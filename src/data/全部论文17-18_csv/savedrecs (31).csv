We demonstrate that the corporate transparency of large farms is an issue of both public interest and private investor interest and decompose the construct of transparency respectively. Because firms tend to exhibit heterogeneous transparency strategies when facing common sets of pressures, we draw upon four case studies of different Ukrainian agroholdings using the suggested decomposition of the transparency construct. We find that large farms may benefit substantially in the long run if they establish effective corporate governance mechanisms and provide more evidence that they contribute positively to corporate social responsibility and rural development.","[Gagalyuk, Taras] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Dept Struct Dev Farms & Rural Areas, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Gagalyuk, T (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Dept Struct Dev Farms & Rural Areas, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",gagalyuk@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646",,,,,81,19,23,2,9,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

This article is dedicated to study of marketing activities in the social network. The main factors that can influence the result of economic activities are identified. For the study, the authors used data from the groups in the social network VKontakte in the city of Tomsk. For this purpose, the authors calculated network analysis metrics (a clustering factor, a degree, a number of second-level elements) and specific indicators of social groups (activity, popularity). A Java-based program was implemented to collect data and perform group metric calculations. Two regression models have been developed. Also different types of dependencies were studied: linear, hyperbolic, progressive. The first regression model describes the change dependency on the number of members of the group as a result of the competition, based on the number of subscribers and the popularity of the group. The second regression model describes how the value of the advertisement in the group is dependent on the number of subscribers and the indicator of whether the group is the leader. Both regressions are significant at 99% confidence level. The models can be used in planning and evaluating the results of marketing activities.","[Gribanova, E. B.; Shirenkov, I. V.; Katasonova, A.

The paper presents some important steps and measures under the package of tax changes in relation to direct taxes, namely personal income tax, which were approved in accordance with the set trend leading to increased tax neutrality in the area of direct taxes in the Czech Republic. These changes in tax legislation in relation to taxpayers of personal income tax primarily relate to changes in the requirements when applying for determination of the tax using a lump sum. The lump sum tax is one of the ways how entrepreneurs can optimize their tax liability. This measure represents the greater attractiveness of the lump sum tax and the efforts of legislators for greater use among entrepreneurial taxpayers. The paper also lists other important changes and measures which relate to the preferred and much more used tax institutions, not only by entrepreneurial taxpayers. Specifically, these are measures relating to changes in claiming expenses as a percentage of revenue, tax benefit for dependent children, discount on placement of a child in pre-school facility, pension and life insurance limits, and others. The above-mentioned changes and measures, which influence the tax optimization and lead to the neutralization of the tax system in the Czech Republic, can generally be considered positive and significant, not only in terms of the redistributive function of the tax but also in terms of fiscal policy itself. These changes reinforced the basic principles necessary for the functioning of the market economy, namely the principle of tax neutrality and tax universality, and represent a positive trend in the Czech tax system.","[Hakalova, Jana; Palochova, Marcela; Psenkova, Yvetta] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Hakalová, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.",jana.hakalova@vsb.cz; marcela.palochova@vsb.cz; yvetta.psenkova@vsb.cz,"Palochová, Marcela/G-3392-2018; Hakalová, Jana/G-1702-2018; Psenkova, Yvetta/G-2244-2018","Hakalová, Jana/0000-0001-9123-6809; Psenkova, Yvetta/0000-0003-3650-8124",,,,,11,0,0,0,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,237,245,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700025,0

Qualitative research methods are employed - the systematic review (worldwide), focus groups, and expert interviews. A modification of the Social Return on Investment (SROI) method is suggested for EAN social costs estimation; the modification allows to calculate the resulted losses. For the SROI calculation, EAN is divided into three groups: financial abuse, domestic abuse, and neglect of care for elderly. In the first group of financial abuse, the social loss was estimated to be CZK 5.8-7.7 million for Prague in 2016. The second group of domestic abuse was assigned the loss of CZK 0.9-1.9 million for Prague in 2015. The resulting loss was not determined for the third group, neglect of care for elderly, because the available data are so limited that they do not allow the calculation. According to the experts' opinion, these costs should be considered for a minimum estimation of real costs, since the issue is rather hidden and the real extent is unknown.","[Bartak, Miroslav; Kuchar, Pavel] JE Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Pasteurova, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Haunerova, Barbora; Kuchar, Pavel] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, CzechHTA, Dept Biomed Technol, Nam Sitna 3105, Kladno 27201, Czech Republic; [Bartak, Miroslav; Kuchar, Pavel] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Social Work, Pasteurova 40096, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Czech Technical University Prague; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Haunerová, B (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, CzechHTA, Dept Biomed Technol, Nam Sitna 3105, Kladno 27201, Czech Republic.",b.haunerova@gmail.com; miroslav.bartak@ujep.cz; rogalewicz@fbmi.cvut.cz; pavel.kuchar@ujep.cz,"Barták, Miroslav/N-9249-2017; Rogalewicz, Vladimír/H-6246-2011","Rogalewicz, Vladimír/0000-0001-5432-4148",,,,,24,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,263,271,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700028,0

For the computation we collect 1,271 estimates of the border effect reported in 61 studies, codify 32 aspects of study design that may influence the estimates, and use Bayesian model averaging to take into account model uncertainty in meta-analysis. Our results suggest that methods systematically affect the estimated border effects. Especially important is the level of aggregation, measurement of internal and external distance, control for multilateral resistance, and treatment of zero trade flows. We also find that the magnitude of the border effect is associated with country characteristics, such as size and income.","[Havranek, Tomas] Czech Natl Bank, Res Dept, Prague, Czech Republic; [Havranek, Tomas; Irsova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank; Charles University Prague,"Havranek, T (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Res Dept, Prague, Czech Republic.;Havranek, T (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",tomas.havranek@cnb.cz; zuzana.irsova@ies-prague.org,"Havranek, Tomas/M-8888-2015; Irsova, Zuzana/K-6387-2016","Havranek, Tomas/0000-0002-3158-2539; Irsova, Zuzana/0000-0002-0753-8124","Czech Science Foundation [15-02411S, 16-00027S]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"Tomas Havranek is Senior Economist and Advisor to the Board at the Research Department of the Czech National Bank and Associate Professor at Charles University, Prague; his email address is: tomas.havranek@cnb.cz.

This consumer paper identifies five clusters and, thus, strategic groups for the purchase of animal welfare products within the large group of consumers that differ significantly in their attitudes towards modern agriculture, their perception of animal welfare, their social acceptance of meat consumption and their shopping behaviour. Even personal differences are found between the clusters. Based on the results, we derived specific marketing implications for each cluster. These implications can help to develop a more differentiated market segment for animal welfare products in terms of animal welfare level and required price premium, enabling consumers to make product choices according to their preferences.","[Heise, Heinke; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Management Agribusiness, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Heise, H (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Management Agribusiness, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",hheise@gwdg.de,,,,,,,72,29,29,4,61,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Implementation of the process is done by conceptualizing problems, collecting data, and analyzing and reporting results. In this process, the required product innovation as well as the needs of the employees, as internal organizational clients, are determined. These results are then used to design KPIs that relate to consumer perspectives as well as internal perspectives (Saha and Ahmed, 2012). This framework is manifested in a diagram called the House of Quality (HOQ). Nevertheless, as a tool developed from a practical level, little theoretical and empirical reviews attempt to provide sufficient information to assure the benefits of QFD in the transport context. Therefore, we review the theoretical foundations that can be used to support QFD and present a number of empirical findings from the literature that can be used to evaluate the feasibility of QFD in the selection of modes of transport. Because it is a practical tool, QFD is rarely discussed through theoretical approach. Hermann et al (2012) state that QFD has no theoretical basis at all. However, it is important to support QFD from the relevant theoretical aspects to explain how this system can work in promoting the improvement of product and service quality.","[Kamariah, Najmi] Business Adm Study Program STIA LAN Makassar, Makassar, Indonesia; [Ganna, Oktavianus Riza] Hasanuddin Univ, Fac Econ, Makassar, Indonesia; [Kadir, Abdul Rahman] Hasanuddin Univ, Econ Study, Makassar, Indonesia",Universitas Hasanuddin; Universitas Hasanuddin,"Kamariah, N (通讯作者)，Business Adm Study Program STIA LAN Makassar, Makassar, Indonesia.",najmikamariah@gmail.com; reza.ganna@vale.com; rahmankadir90@yahoo.com,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-410-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,40.0,,,,,,376,387,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9IB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416100900028,0

In this paper, a brief review was conducted to recent publications in some of the respected journals and conferences. Published scientific research from 2010 to 2015 is reviewed based on the following: (i) what are the main components used in the decision support system, and (ii) how environmental support systems are integrating with other techniques and methods to optimize the needed solutions. The DSS tools and components play a great role in solving the complexity problem of the eco-system and in the environment. According to our review, researchers found that environmental problems have common characteristics. EDSS, also, has been used in different fields.

Design/methodology/approach - Institutions are quantified in terms of regulatory, normative, and cognitive aspects. Firm resources include technological and marketing resources, organizational slack, and internally generated and externally raised financial resources. The research context is foreign direct investments of Taiwanese listed firms in the electronics and computer industry from the year 2000 to 2007, which include 732 companies investing in 3,691 projects in 41 countries. Findings - The tacitness of technological resources inhibits their transfer to distant countries. Marketing resources are more transferable to distant countries in terms of explicit regulative institutions. Organizational slack may weaken motives of firms in entering distant countries. Internally generated financial resources encourage risky investments in distant countries in terms of regulative institutions. Externally raised financial resources, due to their providers, restrict firms to finance risky projects in distant countries. High-control entry strategies are preferred to minimize appropriation risks regardless of funding sources. Involving local partners through a shared ownership provides institutional knowledge for foreign firms to mobilize local legitimacy in host countries. Firm resources directly and indirectly determine entry strategies through perceived IDs. Originality/value - This study bridges the effect of firm-level resources and country-level institutions on the choices of host country and the entry strategies. It is among the first to quantify institutions in terms of their regulatory, normative, and cognitive aspects.","[Kittilaksanawong, Wiboon] Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Fac Econ, Strategy & Int Business, Saitama, Japan",Saitama University,"Kittilaksanawong, W (通讯作者)，Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Fac Econ, Strategy & Int Business, Saitama, Japan.",wiboon@mail.saitama-u.ac.jp,,,JSPS [15K03694]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03694] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI, Grant No. 15K03694.",,53,12,12,1,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The analysis shows that, for the countries that recently joined the European Union, stagnation of the sector is more evident than in the non-member countries where the premium volume is increasing. It looks like the first group of countries reached the limits considering their economies, while the second group of countries still has potential for the market growth.

Almost three decades since entrepreneurial opportunities were formally re-established by the soon-to-fail soviet regime, the concept of financial literacy has been developing with agreeable ambition, especially following the global and financial crisis and during the European debt crisis. Although only relatively recently included in education curricula, financial literacy has been consistently gaining an increased exposure in the fields of financial, management and education policy analysis based on the impact of behaviour on economic and financial decisions and therefore economic activity. These recent developments in turn have prompted an increased research output on financial literacy, which sets the stage for the main theoretical and practical implications of this paper. The main defining types of sources for this paper are primary and secondary sources, as well as conceptual and theoretical research concerned with description or analysis of the topic of financial literacy. The approach involves dividing the literature into themes and categories, presenting the literature chronologically and exploring and examining the theoretical and methodological literature. For such a vigorously and enthusiastically developing body of research, the conclusions elucidate the demand for a broader analysis of the impact of financial literacy and financial education on economic decision-making in the Baltic states.

Thus, cybersecurity management became a challenging problem, due to an apparent lack of minimum standards requirements and to difficulty for the majority of the organizations to implement such processes because of their business design and cost perspectives. One way to solve this costs' issue could be through a more holistic view about managing risks integrating a major concern with the firms' intellectual capital. Considering this subject, and although its importance, little research has been carried out in Management studies, so, in this sense, the purpose of this study is to provide a systematic literature review focusing on cybersecurity management, intellectual capital and trust in order to characterize the overall dynamics of academic publications based on a set of valuable information such as: (1) authorship patterns (author productivity and geographic affiliation) (2) type of publication (3) the citations used per article and (4) a co-citation map. A systematic literature review is conducted in order to characterize the overall dynamics of academic publications identifying the practices, concepts and relationships. A Bibliometric Analysis is applied based on articles present in the ISI Web of Science and 87 studies were found distributed by 64 journal titles. Within these 64 journals, the European Conference on Intellectual Capital (ECIC) proceedings have contributed with nearly 30% of the results. A total of 105 authors published their works since 1999, at which 70% contributed with just one publication. In terms of countries, the list is leading by USA, Finland and Romania verifying a large geographic polarization. The results reflect: (1) a pattern of publications' behaviour in terms of polarization and dimension; (2) a gap in the literature, pointing therefore a way to explore and (3) the need of empirical studies in this field. The nature of this study reflects itself an originality, either by the relationship between these three concepts or by the applied methodology.

The result shows that the acceleration of marketization and the development of Internet finance can promote the allocation efficiency of financial resources in the western region. The lack of opening up leads to the inefficient allocation of financial resources.

In the world we live in, the privacy of personal data has become an abstract reality because, in legal terms, the line between what is personal and what is public information is not defined. On the other hand, there are other aspects of the culture of security information, often overlooked, and episodically challenged by questions as simple as: Do you allow the use of your information and data for future commercial offerings?. When these situations occur, we face the request of express consent, and after that we have also to deal with a tacit consent to the processing and displaying of our personal data. The existence of tacit consent is the open door to the trampling of the rights of citizens, especially with regard to confidentiality of information and privacy of citizens. The majority of the information systems we deal with daily are presented to us as a value-added tool for our comfort, productivity and cost reduction. In fact, the culture of safety and preventive behaviour of citizens towards information displaying is the guarantor of their rights and privacy in a society increasingly competitive, confrontational and eager for knowledge. In this sense, our purpose is to verify, among university students, if they are aware of the issues of confidentiality and privacy when they exchange information and/or data in their electronic relationships. Our exploratory study also intends to analyse the differences and similarities between the sexes as regards the degree of awareness of the meaning of confidentiality and privacy in the electronic relationships.","[Loureiro, Marlene; Meirinhos, Galvao; Leal, Carmem] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal; [Leal, Carmem] Ctr Estudos Transdisciplinares Desenvolvimento CE, Vila Real, Portugal; [Loureiro, Marlene; Meirinhos, Galvao] LabCom IFP, Covilha, Portugal",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro,"Loureiro, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal.",mloureiro@utad.pt; gsm@utad.pt; cleal@utad.pt,"Loureiro, Marlene/CAF-4336-2022; Meirinhos, Galvão Dos Santos/GQR-0425-2022; Leal, Carmem/V-7073-2017","Meirinhos, Galvão Dos Santos/0000-0002-7255-5721; Loureiro, Marlene/0000-0002-1955-5693; Leal, Carmem/0000-0002-7860-9858",,,,,9,0,0,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,182,189,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000023,0

However there is no consistency as to what extent this type of advertising is effective. One of the reasons could be that the majority of results are based on declarations, but the actual reactions to controversial ads might not be conscious for the recipient or the person might not want to express them. In the first study n = 219) we validated the Facereader methodology. In the second study n = 76) we used Facereader to test the automatic emotional reaction toward ads referring to sexual violence. The results showed more complex information about the reaction toward ads from Facereader than from declarations. Moreover a comparison of the brand image measured before and after an ad exposure showed a decline of the brand image, which makes the effectiveness of shocking advertising questionable. In the third n = 131) and forth study n = 76) we explored people's reaction toward ads which refer to homosexuality social and commercial ads).

We address potential endogeneity issues by building an artificial panel of clusters using GPS coordinates. Our results indicate a significant negative relation between girls' school attendance and water hauling activity, as a halving of water fetching times increases girls' school attendance by about 7 percentage points on average, with stronger impacts in rural communities. Our results seem to be the first definitive documentation of such a relationship in Sub-Saharan Africa.

In this study, we examine the role of top managers in financial decisions at sharia-compliant firms in Pakistan and the UK. For each firm in the sample, a manager-firm matched panel has beep constructed to identify the top managers across the sharia compliant firms over the time. After accounting for the observable and unobservable heterogeneity, we identify the observable differences in firms' financing decisions that are attributable to managers' fixed effects. We also examine the difference in the styles among managers who move between firms that are sharia-compliant and those that are not sharia-compliant. Results of the study show that the managers exert significantly important influence over leveraging, the dividend policy, and working capital decisions. The decisions of managers who come from non-sharia-compliant firms are significantly different from those who come from sharia-compliant firms. Moreover, the policies regarding leveraging, dividend payouts, and working capital at sharia-compliant firms differ significantly from those at non-sharia-compliant firms. Furthermore, discriminating the differences between the importance of managerial financial styles of top officials in sharia and non-sharia companies helps managers make strategic plans in terms of their financial decisions.

Unlike previous hedonic studies, we use the method of unconditional quantile regression (Firpo et al., in Econometrica 77(3):953-973, 2009). An important advantage of this new method over the traditional conditional quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett, in Econometrica 46(1):33-50, 1978) is that it allows for the estimation of potentially heterogeneous effects of cadmium pollution along the entire (unconditional) distribution of farmland prices. Using a threshold specification of the hedonic-pricing model, we find evidence of a U-shaped valuation pattern, where cadmium pollution of the soil has a negative and significant impact on prices only in the middle range of the distribution, insofar as cadmium concentrations are above the regulatory standard of 2 parts per million for agricultural land. Results obtained from a probit model to classify land plots into different price segments further suggest that the heterogeneous impact of soil pollution on price can be directly related to the variety of amenities that farmland provides.","[Peeters, Ludo] Hasselt Univ, Fac Business Econ, Martelarenlaan 42, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium; [Schreurs, Eloi; Van Passel, Steven] Hasselt Univ, Fac Business Econ, Ctr Environm Sci, Martelarenlaan 42, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium; [Van Passel, Steven] Univ Antwerp, Dept Engn Management, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",Hasselt University; Hasselt University; University of Antwerp,"Peeters, L (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Fac Business Econ, Martelarenlaan 42, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium.",ludo.peeters@uhasselt.be; eloi.schreurs@gmail.com; steven.vanpassel@uhasselt.be,,"Van Passel, Steven/0000-0002-6971-9246",,,,,56,20,22,2,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Many enterprises implement the so-called management by projects (MBP). The enterprises following such an approach are referred to as project-oriented organizations (PORORs). A project and an organization cannot exist without appropriate human capital. This capital is developed in the process of HR function fulfillment (R&S, training, HR appraisal, remuneration and HR flow). In every enterprise, which implements MBP, HR function takes a two-way course: in an organization-wide perspective (general HR function) and within the framework of a particular project (HR function in projects). The objective of the article is to answer the following research questions: Q1: Should the same operational schemes in both courses of HR function be used from the perspective of an effective functioning of project-oriented organizations? Q2: What kind of gaps occur in the area of HR function internal consistency within the analyzed organizations? The article presents the results of empirical studies carried out in 2014 and 2015 in 100 project-oriented organizations. The methodology for measuring HR function's internal consistency was proposed. Data triangulation was applied in the research process. The conducted studies indicate that the multidimensional consistency of the personnel function results in an increased efficiency of not only projects, but also the entire organization. The surveyed organizations present higher general HR function consistency than the HR function in projects. Moreover, some gaps in consistency between both personnel function courses were indicated. The presented results of empirical studies provide knowledge about the specificity of project-oriented organizations. The presented discussion can also become the foundation for developing further research.","[Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Piwowar-Sulej, K (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",katarzyna.piwowar@ue.wroc.pl,"Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna/P-2694-2018; Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna/AAS-1994-2021","Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna/0000-0002-4627-4344; Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna/0000-0002-4627-4344",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,238,246,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000030,0

The main differences between both data sources appears in the fact that data on ethnicity in the Population Census 2011 were collected based on the responses of respondents (self-rated ethnicity), whereas in the Population Census 2000 information on ethnicity was processed from Population Register (documented ethnicity), which provided for avoidance of the problem of numerator-denominator bias when performing calculation on demographic processes. The same approach - documented ethnicity - will be performed in the Population Census 2021 as it will be implemented based only on administrative data sources.","[Ponomarjova, Denize; Klusa, Anna] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Ponomarjova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,451,460,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400045,0

One of the aspects of administrative proceedings is the fact that these proceedings on one hand, allow the possibility of applying the procedural rights of all parties to administrative proceedings, on the other hand that took place within a reasonable timeframe. Administrative proceedings therefore has a beginning, and the end. Administrative proceedings are terminated by issuing a decision, which is in force.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a meta-analytical approach that synthesizes 189 effect sizes from 24 independent samples with a total sample size of n = 5,496 acquisitions. Findings - This meta-analytical study found a consistently negative and significant relationship between organizational cultural differences and acquisition performance, and a dual effect of national cultural differences (i.e. cultural distance) on acquisition performance. It further identified significant methodological and contextual moderators and discusses the implications for acquisitions in emerging markets. Research limitations/implications - Due to the nature of meta-analyses, this study is based on existing (i.e. available secondary) data. Future research may collect novel, primary data to further test the conceptual model and respective relationships developed therein. Practical implications - This study sheds light onto the culture-based performance determinants of acquisitions and the effects of methodological and contextual moderator variables. Given the significant importance of acquisitions across organizational and national cultures, the findings may inform business practitioners when developing sustainable strategies to successfully integrate organizations that are culturally different and/or are located in culturally diverse environments. Social implications - A better understanding about the culture-based performance determinants of acquisitions may inform public policy makers about how to regulate and set incentives for acquisitions, which constitute a main vehicle through which firms undertake foreign direct investment, and which can be considered a global sustainable growth strategy for multinational corporations and entire economies. Originality/value - This paper is original in that it provides a large-scale and in-depth quantitative integration and synthesis of the empirical literature on culture and acquisition performance based on a meta-analytical approach and so has important theoretical value and empirical implications for future emerging market research.","[Rottig, Daniel] Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Lutgert Coll Business, Int Business & Strateg Management, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Gulf Coast University,"Rottig, D (通讯作者)，Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Lutgert Coll Business, Int Business & Strateg Management, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA.",drottig@fgcu.edu,,,,,,,112,25,27,9,61,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Firm growth has been perceived as key driver of economic development, competitiveness and employment. Therefore, numerous research studies are devoted to investigation of relationship between IC and firm performance. However, only few studies focused on a relationship between firm growth and IC. The aim of this research is to examine whether the SMEs that invest in IC have higher potential for growth. Data set for this research consists of 271 SMEs from Croatia (with 31.4% of them being high growth SMEs). Enterprise is defined as high growth if it has an average annualized growth in sales greater than 20% a year, over a three-year period. Empirical analysis of a relationship between IC and a firm growth has been conducted in two stages. First part included a comparison of high growth SMEs that have IC reported in their financial statements and those without IC in financial statements, based on main financial indicators, entrepreneur's characteristics, firm's characteristics and environment. Second stage covered a development of high growth prediction model by using logistic regression to: (i) predict probability of SME to achieve high growth, (ii) identify factors that influence growth, and (iii) investigate how intellectual capital influences growth. The results point to a positive relationship between human and organizational capital and firm's growth and confirm that specific elements of human and organizational capital can be considered as one of the key determinants in high growth prediction model. Besides, the study showed that SMEs that have some elements of IC recorded in their financial statements significantly differ from SMEs without IC in financial statements in terms of human capital measured by entrepreneur's experience, education, skills, networks and personality traits. Implications of this study are of value to business owners, managers as well as policy makers.","[Sarlija, Natasa; Stanic, Marina] JJ Strossmayer Univ, Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Sarlija, N (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ, Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia.",natasa@efos.hr; marina@efos.hr,"Stanić, Marina/ABG-1001-2021","Stanić, Marina/0000-0002-3835-6358; Sarlija, Natasa/0000-0003-2600-9735",Croatian Science Foundation [3933],Croatian Science Foundation,This work is funded by Croatian Science Foundation under Grant No. 3933 Development and application of growth potential prediction models for SMEs in Croatia.,,28,3,3,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,288,296,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000036,0

And whether the officials know which professions in public and state administration will be covered by this law. The result of an empirical research, for example, is the statement that 82% of respondents correctly answered what is not corruption or corrupt behavior, but nearly 80% of respondents incorrectly defined a definition of corruption, according to the law. Half of the total number of reported corruption cases on the level of municipal and state offices is concerned to elected members of the municipal council.

It is necessary to keep track of any changes, but first and foremost, to recognize that the organization itself is a multi-layered, complex, diverse relationship. Therefore, the article recommends new patterns that allow to perceive an organization through the 10E or 11F prism. The aim of the article is to point out the necessity of looking for analytical models which take into greater account the variability of the environment, especially in agribusiness. Looking for ways to determine the shape of an effective company, researchers refer to the 7S Mc Kinsey's model. Within the network concept, two types can be distinguished. A business network is self-generated, poorly formalized, without clearly defined borders, and without the leading business. Strategic networks, on the other hand, are based on long-term agreements between entities which aim is to acquire a competitive advantage over other networks or the companies functioning outside the networks. Usually, there is a leader in the strategic network (a hub firm, a network captain) that defines the idea of a value creation network and, by implementing its strategy, decides on the choice of partners and the nature of the relationship. Forming a network strategy in agribusiness requires a particular care in the selection of analytical instruments, since the quality of the strategy depends on the information base for decision-making. It was assumed that the formed strategy must be flexible, and to a large extent emergent. It is therefore proposed to use an original algorithm based on the characterization of competitive advantages, appropriate to the current environmental conditions, using all available resources, especially those available for the network.","[Sikora, Marek] UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Bielski, Ireneusz] Wyzsza Szkola Gospodarki Bydgoszczy, Bydgoszcz, Poland",Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology,"Sikora, M (通讯作者)，UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Bydgoszcz, Poland.",m.sikora@utp.edu.pl; i.bielski@wp.pl,"Sikora, Marek/AAS-1037-2021","Sikora, Marek/0000-0001-9773-8527",,,,,17,1,1,1,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,335,341,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400045,0

However, its influence on performance in developing and emerging (D&E) economies, particularly under a cooperative's context, has been under-researched. This paper examines the impact of market orientation components on the performance of seed producer cooperatives (SPCs) in Ethiopia. Results show that customer orientation, interfunctional coordination, and supplier orientation, but not competitor orientation, contribute to higher business performance. Our findings confirm that customer orientation is the key factor for superior business performance in D&E economies. Business performance has a mediating effect between market orientation components and livelihood performance. Interfunctional coordination and supplier orientation influence the livelihood of member farmers both directly and indirectly via business performance. The study concludes that market orientation of SPCs is very important for business performance and provides a strong basis for the livelihood of seed producer families. SPCs can improve their performance and the livelihood of member-farmer families by implementing market oriented strategies, emphasising the key components of market orientation.","[Sisay, Dawit Tsegaye; Verhees, Frans J.

Both brands are produced by the Carlsberg Group, and both are lagers. The Carlsberg Group markets Tuborg as a more premium brand, and it also aims at women. The research was conducted in Denmark using an on-line questionnaire. The attitudes were measured in three dimensions - affective, cognitive, and conative. Affective and cognitive dimensions were measured using already validated instruments, while the conative dimension (for which no validated instrument was found) is based on consumption of a particular brand of beer. With regards to finding, Cronbach's alpha for the affective dimension was .944 for Tuborg and .956 for Carlsberg; Cronbach's alpha for the cognitive dimension was .785 for Tuborg and .886 for Carlsberg; and Cronbach's alpha for the conative dimension was .843 for Tuborg and .906 for Carlsberg. Although all scales had their Cronbach's alphas over .7, it is surprising that the difference in Cronbach's alpha for the cognitive dimension for the two brands was approximately .1 in spite of the fact that the statements for the scales were evaluated at the same time by the same respondents.","[Sudzina, Frantisek] VSCHT Praha, Prague, Czech Republic","University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague","Sudzina, F (通讯作者)，VSCHT Praha, Prague, Czech Republic.",sudzinaf@vscht.cz,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,375,381,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400051,0

The Synthetic Inverse Demand System is used to quantify the impact of Mexican shipments on the prices of strawberries. The estimation results indicate that market prices are responsive to supply from each of the three sources, suggesting an integrated, competitive national market. The simulation results suggest that rapidly growing Mexican shipments will cause large losses to the U.S. strawberry industry, posing challenges to the sustainability and survival of the industry, particularly that of the Florida industry.

Business model innovation is typically performed either by renewal or replication strategy. Drawing on the instrumental and integrative theories, a framework of hypotheses is developed that underlines the effects of business model innovation on a firm's corporate sustainability practices. The operational responsiveness of the relationship between business model innovation and corporate sustainability practices is tested using organizational learning, strategic flexibility as sequential mediating variables and environmental dynamism as a moderating variable. Using a conclusive research design, the present study tests the two types of business model innovation (replication, renewal) on the triple bottom line approach of corporate sustainability with special reference to managerial workforce of the select Indian pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, the study uses Structural Equation Modeling and Sequential Mediation Analysis, to test the proposed research model. Some of the findings indicate that both the types of business model innovation significantly predict corporate sustainability practices and organizational learning sequentially mediates strategic flexibility.","[Vihari, Nitin Simha; Rao, M.

The investor who tries to exploit momentum is assumed to have access to a risk-free asset and a risky asset whose return exhibits short run momentum. We derive an exact explicit solution and an approximate analytical solution to, the dynamic asset allocation problem. We find that the optimal portfolio demand for stocks contains two components: the momentum-adjusted myopic demand and the intertemporal hedging demand. When the model is calibrated to Chinese stock market data, it implies that intertemporal hedging demand motives greatly decrease the portfolio demand for stocks by investors whose risk aversion coefficients exceed one when the latest levels of stock returns are non-negative or moderate negative. In addition, hedging motives increase the optimal portfolio when they are sufficiently negative. Also, we find that risk aversion is the main preference parameter in determining portfolio choice rather than the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.","[Wu, Hui; Ma, Chaoqun; Yue, Shengjie] Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Ma, CQ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",cqma1998@hnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Fund of China [71431008]; National Natural Science Innovation Research Group of China [71221001],National Natural Science Fund of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Innovation Research Group of China,"The authors would like to thank Duan Li and Qianqiu Liu for their constructive comments, which have significantly improved the content of the paper.

The results show that firms announcing resignations of politically-connected independent directors after the regulation experience a significant increase in crash risk, suggesting that disruption to political connections intensifies managers' bad-news hoarding behavior and makes firms more crash-prone. We further find that the negative impact of disrupted political connections on crash risk is less pronounced in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) than that in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). Moreover, the association is more salient when the resigned director has a geographic and industrial working background overlapping with the firm's operation. Our findings are consistent with the notion that heightened resource acquisition pressure caused by disruption to political networks increases stock price crash risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It has been a growing pragmatic and theoretical shift in interest from the modeling of 'normal' asset market conditions to the shape and heavy of the tails of the distributions of asset returns that characterize statistical models for extreme events. The Black-Scholes model cannot explicitly explain the negative skewness and the excess kurtosis of asset returns. Typically, in the period of time when the left skewness of asset prices increases, the Black-Scholes model will overprice out-of-the-money call options and underprice in-the-money call options related to when there is greater symmetry in the function of distribution. Especially in the life insurance market, the price of guaranteed unitized participating life insurance contract will be affected by a change in asset volatility which leads to the fluctuations in embedded option value. Thus, when pricing a participating contract with surrender option, it is significant to identify the distribution of stock returns over expansion-recession cycles and the occurrence of catastrophic events, in case of insufficient solvency problem for insurance companies. The primary reason is that these embedded options such as terminal dividend option and the surrender option will determine the fair value of the life insurance contract. Existing literatures rarely considered the pricing for participating life insurance products in the case of GEV (generalized extreme value) asset returns. Therefore, this article is considering the economic crisis which may change the distribution of asset returns. Based on the assumption that the return rate follows the GEV distribution, a multi-factor fair valuation pricing model of guaranteed unitized participating life insurance contract is split into four components: the basic contract, the annual dividend option, the terminal dividend option, and the surrender option. We study the effect of death rate, minimum guaranteed interest rate, annual dividend ratio, terminal dividend ratio and surrender on the embedded option values and calculate the annual premium of the guaranteed unitized participating life insurance contract under different influence factors. The Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation method is used to simulate the pricing model. In addition, we make a comparison in the sensitivity of the pricing parameters under the GEV distribution and Normal distribution. The results show that the option price was highly sensitive to the changes in the tail shape and the value of surrender option under the hypothesis of GEV asset returns is higher than it under the Normal asset returns in most cases. Meanwhile, the changing trends of parameter sensitivity are basically similar under two different distributions. In addition, with the mean of GEV distribution further deviating from Normal distribution, the price of the embedded options would be changed substantially. Especially in the financial crisis and other risk events, GEV distribution can characterize the volatility of return better on assets theoretically, which can improve the precision of embedded option pricing.","[Zheng Haitao; Hao Junzhang; Bai Manying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhang Zhengjun] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison Med Sci Ctr 1220, 1300 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Beihang University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Zheng, HT (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",zhenghaitao@buaa.edu.cn; haojz@buaa.edu.cn; baimy@buaa.edu.cn; zjz@stat.wisc.edu,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371021, 71571007, 71401192, 71333014, 71420107025]; Beijing Planning Program of Philosophy and Social Science [11JGC102]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Planning Program of Philosophy and Social Science,"This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 71371021, 71571007,71401192, 71333014,71420107025) and Beijing Planning Program of Philosophy and Social Science (grant number 11JGC102).",,8,0,0,0,1,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,852,860,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700058,0

The estimated cost of delay to lenders is an order of magnitude greater than the campaign contributions by the political action committees of the largest mortgage servicing banks to the committee members in that period.","[Agarwal, Sumit] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Amromin, Gene] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA; [Ben-David, Itzhak] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ben-David, Itzhak] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dinc, Serdar] Rutgers State Univ, Newark, NJ USA",National University of Singapore; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Agarwal, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.",,"Amromin, Gene/B-7425-2011; Agarwal, Sumit/F-4836-2012; Ben-David, Itzhak/I-3233-2012","Agarwal, Sumit/0000-0002-8305-3786; Ben-David, Itzhak/0000-0001-9743-7441",,,,,58,13,15,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

To deflect political pressure, in the United States, final decisions on AD are delegated to the International Trade Commission (ITC), an independent agency composed of six non-elected commissioners. Using a newly collected dataset, I study the determinants of all final ITC votes on AD during the 1989-2010 period. I find that ITC commissioners decisions on AD crucially depend on which party has appointed them and on the trade policy interests of key senators in that party: whether commissioners vote in favor of AD depends heavily on whether the petitioning industry is key (in terms of employment) in the states represented by leading senators of the Republican and Democratic parties, indicating that commissioners are reactive to party-specific political pressure. Interestingly, pressure seems to be more effective when the case for voting in favor or against AD is less clear-cut, suggesting that ITC commissioners are more likely to vote in line with political parties' interests when it matters more.","[Aquilante, Tommaso] Univ Libre Bruxelles ECARES, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Aquilante, T (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles ECARES, Brussels, Belgium.",tommaso.aquilante@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,59,3,4,1,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

The strong implication of this property is that the fiscal authority is able to target GDP and the unemployment rate, a result reminiscent of the Blinder-Solow framework.

To this end, we follow a standard regression-based approach augmented by interaction terms. To date, the empirical literature has only investigated the economic and financial facets of globalization; we, on the other hand, find a significant relationship between risk-sharing and noneconomic aspects of globalization. For several groups of industrialized countries, social and political integration positively correlate with risk-sharing. The economic factor does not explain all the improvements that relate to globalization, and political integration plays a remarkable role in shaping risk-sharing opportunities, both among EMU/EU countries and on a global scale. For advanced economies, in an increasingly globalized world, political integration should be of great concern.","[Balli, Faruk] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, QB2 47, Auckland, New Zealand; [Pericoli, Filippo M.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [Pierucci, Eleonora] Univ Basilicata, Potenza, Italy",Massey University; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Basilicata,"Balli, F (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, QB2 47, Auckland, New Zealand.",F.Balli@massey.ac.nz,"Balli, Faruk/H-8162-2019","Balli, Faruk/0000-0003-2372-4709",,,,,65,16,16,1,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

I show that the effect is driven primarily by provinces that had a low ex-ante level of financial development, suggesting that mafias take advantage of investment opportunities in the construction sector that are left unexploited due to liquidity constraints.","[Scognamiglio, Annalisa] Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Scognamiglio, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, Naples, Italy.",annalisa.scognamiglio2@unina.it,,"scognamiglio, annalisa/0000-0002-2392-1027",,,,,25,12,15,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Accounting for cross-section dependence and heterogeneity among provinces, a long-run equilibrium relationship is established between freight transportation and economic growth in all three regions. Specifically, the long-run output elasticity coefficient for freight transportation ranges between 0.35 and 0.89 among the three regions, with the highest economic impact in the central region. In addition, a bidirectional Granger causal relationship is identified between freight transportation and economic growth in the less developed central and western regions, while freight transportation leads economic growth in the more affluent eastern region but not the reverse. When considering modes of freight transportations, highways are found to be cointegrated with economic growth, with a long run impact ranging from 0.37 to 0.67 among the three regions. Also, the causality between highway freight and economic growth follows the relationship between overall freight transportation and economy in all three regions; whereas rail freight do not cause economic growth in any of the three regions. Our findings imply that highway freight has become the dominant mode of transportation in terms of supporting regional economic growth. In addition, spatial diversity in economic activity should be taken into consideration in planning regional transportation system in China.","[Tong, Tingting] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Int Business Coll, Dalian 116025, Peoples R China; [Yu, T.

Similarly, the implications for portfolio design are also evaluated on daily and weekly data span bases, concerning the period ranging from December 2007 to September 2017. Overall, the empirical results appear to reveal that the safe haven roles associated with the CDS and the portfolio design prove to differ noticeably across the time horizons as well as from one model to another. Likewise, choosing CDS or VSTOXX futures as hedging instrument seem to depend heavily on data frequency and the models applied. The interest lying behind the conduction of such a study is twofold: on the one hand, it should serve as a guide to investors through enabling them to opt for the most effective strategies useful for hedging the stock sectors' relating risks and, on the other hand, to highlight the models' specifications associated impacts.

The purpose of this paper is to estimate the impact of regulatory announcements on systemic risk among the Indian telecom firms. Design/methodology/approach This study employed a two-step methodology to measure the impact of regulatory announcements on systemic risk. In the first step, CAPM along with the Kalman filter was used to estimate the daily beta (systemic risk). In the second step, event study methodology was used to assess the impact of regulatory announcements on daily beta derived from the first step. Findings The results of this study indicate that regulatory announcements did impact systemic risk among telecom firms. The study also found that regulatory announcements either increased or decreased systemic risk, depending upon the type of regulatory announcements. Further, this study estimated the market-perceived regulatory risk premiums for individual telecom firms. Research limitations/implications The regulatory risk premium was either positive or negative, depending upon the different types of regulatory announcements for the telecom sector firms. Thus, this study contributes to the theory of literature by testing the buffering hypothesis in the context of Indian telecom firms. Practical implications The study findings will be useful for investors and policy-makers to estimate the regulatory risk premium as and when there is an anticipated regulatory announcement in the Indian telecom sector.

Using a large-scale database, we analyze the economic, political and institutional factors that should be considered in such a decision. In particular, we test if the emergence of SWFs and more specifically of a specific type of SWFs can be explained by the following factors: the excess foreign exchange reserves due to natural resources rents or persistent current account surpluses; the volatility of commodity prices; the appreciation of the real exchange rate leading to the Dutch Disease effect and the governance of the country. The results suggest that countries with excess foreign exchange reserves, which are dependent on a commodity and which suffer from an appreciation of the real exchange rate are more likely to create a fund. We also find that commodity-based funds tend to be established in low democratic countries. Finally, our results suggest that the factors driving SWFs creation are different depending on the origin of the funding (commodity or non-commodity) and the macroeconomic objective(s) assigned to the fund. Our results may be of interest for policymakers debating whether or not it can be optimal for the country to establish a SWF.","[Amar, Jeanne] Aix Marseille Univ, CERGAM EA 4225, Marseille, France; [Lecourt, Christelle] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, EHESS, Cent Marseille,AMSE, Aix En Provence, France; [Kinon, Valerie] ICHEC Brussels Management Sch, Brussels, Belgium",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Lecourt, C (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, EHESS, Cent Marseille,AMSE, Aix En Provence, France.",jeanne.amar01@gmail.com; christelle.lecourt@univ-amu.fr; valerie.kinon@ichec.be,,"Amar, Jeanne/0000-0002-7006-0717",,,,,35,11,11,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

This paper implements the Travel Cost Method to estimate consumer surplus per season derived from ski mountaineering and snowshoeing in Val Bedrettoa valley located in the Swiss Alps. In addition, the Contingent Behavior Method is used to estimate the changes in welfare associated with the construction of an alpine center that would provide services aiming to reduce the risk of injury and death associated with winter outdoor recreation. The data is analyzed by means of latent class panel on-site count models. The latent class approach allows us to identify subpopulations that benefit from the alpine center. The results show that 33% of visitors would experience an increase in their consumer surplus per season equivalent to Euro31 per visitor.","[Filippini, Massimo; Martinez-Cruz, Adan L.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Energy Policy & Econ, ZUE E8,Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Filippini, Massimo] USI, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland; [Greene, William] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Econ Dept, 44 West Fourth St,7-90, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Martinez-Cruz, Adan L.] CIDE, Dept Econ, Circuito Tecnopolo Norte 117, Aguascalientes 20313, Ags, Mexico",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; New York University; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

This paper explores whether and how thin-capitalization rules, which restrict interest deductibility beyond a certain amount, affect corporate debt ratios and mitigate corporate default risk. We find that rules targeted at related party borrowing (the majority of today's rules) have no significant impact on debt bias, as they do not affect third-party borrowing. These rules also have no effect on broader indicators of firm corporate distress. Rules applying to all debt, in contrast, turn out to be effective: the presence of such a rule reduces the debt-asset ratio in an average company by 5 percentage points; and they reduce the probability of a firm being in financial distress by 5 percent. Debt ratios are found to be more responsive to thin capitalization rules in industries characterized by a high share of tangible assets. (C) 2018 International Monetary Fund.

This paper analyzes how non-disclosure of confidential information leads the government to use the magnitude of the AD duty to signal this information, in casu the costs of the firm under investigation, to the domestic industry. We obtain two main results. First the AD authority sets lower tariffs compared to the full disclosure scenario because it has an incentive to signal that the foreign firm is relatively inefficient. Second, adhering to the non-disclosure clause leads to lower domestic welfare relative to the full disclosure scenario. On the other hand, prices are lower and global welfare is higher under the non-disclosure clause, thus providing an economic rationale for the WTO's ADA non-disclosure clause.","[Khatibi, Arastou] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Pl Montesquieu 3, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Khatibi, Arastou; Vergote, Wouter] Univ St Louis Bruxelles, CEREC, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Vergote, Wouter] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St,MC 3308, New York, NY 10027 USA",Universite Catholique Louvain; University Saint-Louis - Bruxelles; Columbia University,"Vergote, W (通讯作者)，Univ St Louis Bruxelles, CEREC, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.;Vergote, W (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St,MC 3308, New York, NY 10027 USA.",Arastou.Khatibi@uclouvain.be; wrv13@columbia.edu,"Vergote, Wouter/GWU-5413-2022","Vergote, Wouter/0000-0002-3201-7515",,,,,26,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Sovereign bond spreads reflect both an economic default risk and a strategic default risk. We hypothesize that a country's extra-financial performance reduces default risk by signalling good commitment ability. We test this hypothesis for the countries which bonds are included in the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global. Over the period from 2001 to 2010, we find that an emerging country's average cost of capital decreases with its governance and social performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a good social performance signals an emerging economy's long-term orientation and commitment to repay its debt in the future.","[Margaretic, Paula] Cent Bank Chile, Agustinas 1180, Santiago, Chile; [Pouget, Sebastien] Univ Toulouse Capitole, CRM, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Central Bank of Chile; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Toulouse School of Economics,"Margaretic, P (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Chile, Agustinas 1180, Santiago, Chile.",paumargaretic@gmail.com,,,Center on Sustainable Finance and Responsible Investment (Chaire Finance Durable et Investissement Responsable) at IDEI-R,Center on Sustainable Finance and Responsible Investment (Chaire Finance Durable et Investissement Responsable) at IDEI-R,"We thank Marie Briere, Patricia Crifo, and Rim Oueghlissi for helpful comments.

The intent is to explore how foreign remittances have evolved and impacted poverty and economic well-being of households. Focusing on a consistent set of households across the three survey rounds in a balanced panel format helps examine the effect of foreign remittances with appropriate controls. Results from methodologically consistent, random-effects regressions that correct for potential attrition and heterogeneity bias support significant poverty-reducing and, more accurately, economic well-being-enhancing effects of foreign remittances especially when originating in countries other than India.

However, little empirical evidence exists concerning the role and impact of these new actors in policy decisions where pluralist politics are lacking. By presenting the case of forest policy-making in Ethiopia, this paper illustrates the strategies of ENGOs, and how and to what extent they have impacted policy decisions, in a 'semi-authoritarian' context, where public policies are typically the exclusive mandate of governmental actors. We applied the policy arrangement approach (PAA), enriched with an ENGO classification, to analyze and explain the dynamics and nuances of policy processes. Our study finds that ENGOs do have an influence on policy-making under 'semi-authoritarianism', even without being formally invited to do so. However, influencing policy under such circumstances requires a circumspect approach and follows more complex pathways than the conventional policy-making steps in a democratic context. When the formal avenue for their participation in the policy-making process is restricted, these actors employ indirect strategies of catalyzing policy processes, such as demonstrating innovative policy approaches by implementing pilot projects, documenting and communicating field evidence and best practices, forming strong networks with like-minded actors, forging alliances with key decision makers, and investing sufficient human and financial resources to push the adoption of a new policy. The findings and the conclusions drawn in this paper are consistent with the conceptual framework employed. The PM has proved to be a suitable analytical tool to understand and explain policy processes in various polities, from pluralist democracies to (semi-)authoritarianism. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We provide evidence of increased innovation following minority acquisitions accompanied by cash flows to small, young, most financially constrained target firms that have relatively small patent portfolios prior to acquisition. The effect is not present in the case of minority acquisitions without cash transfers to target firms, or in the case of pre-acquisition relatively large patent portfolio firms, which are less likely to face financial constraints. We also find that R&D expenditures increase following minority acquisitions with cash transfers to target firms. The results are robust to accounting for endogeneity in estimation using matching techniques. Comparable firms, who are targets of announced but failed minority acquisitions, experience no change in their innovation activity.

Household survey data for Portugal were used to build shares of low, medium, and high risk assets representing fractions of household's total wealth. Data showed incomplete household portfolios along with housing capturing the largest share of households' wealth, in line with the literature on composition puzzles. The findings indicate robust empirical evidence that the rate of housing valuation is an indicator of households' wealth perception. When the housing price appreciates with respect to its initial cost, households suffer an endowment effect and tend to increase diversity in their portfolio, expanding the holdings of safe deposits as they raise the share of high risk assets.","[Camoes, Francisco; Vale, Sofia] ISCTE IUL, Econ Dept, Av Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Vale, S (通讯作者)，ISCTE IUL, Econ Dept, Av Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",fhcc@iscte.pt; sofia.vale@iscte.pt,"Vale, Sofia/AAE-7268-2020; Vale, Sofia/R-2234-2019; Vale, Sofia/AAC-3138-2021","Vale, Sofia/0000-0002-1074-4711; Vale, Sofia/0000-0002-1074-4711",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [UID/GES/00315/2013],Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This work was supported by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia through the UID/GES/00315/2013 Grant.,,38,2,2,1,18,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Economists have used the lighthouse as an empirical example to illustrate the extent to which the private provision of public goods is possible. This inquiry, however, has neglected the private provision of lightships. We investigate the private operation of the world's first modern lightship, established in 1731 on the banks of the Thames estuary going in and out of London. First, we show that the Nore lightship was able to operate profitably and without government enforcement in the collection of payments for lighting services. Second, we show how private efforts to build lightships were crowded out by Trinity House, the public authority responsible for establishing and maintaining lighthouses in England and Wales. By including lightships into the broader lighthouse market, we argue that the provision of lighting services exemplifies not a market failure, but a government failure.","[Candela, Rosolino A.] Brown Univ, Polit Theory Project, Box 2005, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Geloso, Vincent J.] Bates Coll, Dept Econ, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA",Brown University,"Candela, RA (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Polit Theory Project, Box 2005, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",rosolino_candela@brown.edu; vincentgeloso@hotmail.com,,,,,,,111,30,32,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2018,176.0,3-4,,,,,479,506,,10.1007/s11127-018-0573-x,0.0,,,28,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GQ5ZF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441775600007,0

We focus on a particular facet of this phenomenon, namely the frequent failure of recipients to comply with a requirement after entering the regime, which in turn can lead to losing their entitlement to benefits. In order to investigate this phenomenon, we conduct an experimental evaluation taking the form of a randomized control trial involving the influences of informational availability and complexity of the regime's regulations. The two distinct treatments consist of changes in the information set which is sent to households just after they enter the regime. We seek to discern behavioral responses to these particular nudges. Our findings suggest that a costless action on the part of program administrators might be able to increase take-up for certain types of beneficiaries - in our case young men and people living in rural areas. In order to be effective, however, these interventions should target households with certain attributes.","[Chareyron, Sylvain] Univ Paris Est Creteil, ERUDITE EA 437, TEPP FR 3435, F-94000 Creteil, France; [Gray, David] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [L'Horty, Yannick] Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE EA 437, TEPP CNRS FR 3435, UPEC,UPEM, F-77454 Marne La Vallee, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); University of Ottawa; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Chareyron, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est Creteil, ERUDITE EA 437, TEPP FR 3435, F-94000 Creteil, France.",sylvain.chareyron@univ-paris-est.fr; David.Gray@uottawa.ca; yannick.lhorty@u-pem.fr,,,Conseil Departemental de Seine-et-Marne; European Social Fund,Conseil Departemental de Seine-et-Marne; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"We have benefitted from the support of the Conseil Departemental de Seine-et-Marne and of the European Social Fund.

In single-office elections, a classic spoiler turns a winner into a non-winner and a non-winner into a winner. Such spoilers rarely appear in multi-office elections. In such elections, spoilers include a Kingmaker, who turns a non-winner into a winner; a Kingslayer, who turns a winner into a non-winner; a Valuegobbler, who subtracts from some competitor more seats than it receives; and Selfspoilers, who may be hurt by competing separately rather than creating an electoral coalition. Various strategic spoilers, such as fake parties, are possible as well. I look for spoilers in eight Polish parliamentary elections that have taken place since the fall of communism in 1989. In two elections, the consequences of spoilers were massive. In 1993, multiple spoilers on the right helped the two post-communist parties return to power, slow down decommunization and create strong institutional obstacles to further democratization. In 2015, a spoiler manufactured a majority for the largest party (PiS) and, as a consequence, enabled PiS quickly to implement radical reforms. In other elections, spoilers had smaller, but noticeable consequences. The results suggest that parliamentary elections using PR party-list systems are vulnerable to spoiler problems that may cause significant political effects.","[Kaminski, Marek M.] Univ Calif Irvine, Math Behav Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Kaminski, Marek M.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Kaminski, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Math Behav Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;Kaminski, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",marek.kaminski@uci.edu,"Kaminski, Marek/HLV-9448-2023","Kaminski, Marek/0000-0003-3997-0541",UCI's Center for the Study of Democracy,UCI's Center for the Study of Democracy,"The support of the UCI's Center for the Study of Democracy is acknowledged.

We provide intuition for our hypothesis and show empirically that indeed the momentum and reversal effects occur not in isolation, but are concurrent with systematic patterns in firm investment. For example, winners only continue to win when there is also subsequent investment, and losers only continue to lose when there is also subsequent disinvestment. Although our paper is about understanding the nature of the price pattern delay rather than examining a trading strategy, our tests suggest ways to enhance trading returns.

A portfolio of all 77 countries offers a mean-variance investor annualized profits of between 5.7% and 8.0%, and profits are maximized when return forecasts are based on U.S. returns.","[Narayan, Paresh Kumar] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Ctr Econ & Financial Econometr, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Phan, Dinh Hoang Bach] Taylors Univ, Fac Business & Law, Taylors Business Sch, Subang Jaya, Malaysia; [Phan, Dinh Hoang Bach] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Narayan, Seema] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Deakin University; Taylor's University; Monash University; Monash University Sunway; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Narayan, PK (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Ctr Econ & Financial Econometr, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",paresh.narayan@deakin.edu.au,"Narayan, Paresh/AAE-8777-2019; Narayan, Seema/H-5698-2019; Narayan, Seema Wati/GRY-3201-2022; Phan, Dinh Hoang Bach/ACD-7028-2022; Narayan, Paresh Kumar/AEM-2143-2022","Narayan, Seema Wati/0000-0002-3993-4981; Phan, Dinh/0000-0001-5096-6530; Narayan, Paresh/0000-0001-7934-8146","International Centre for Education in International Finance (an arm of Bank Negara, the Central Bank of Malaysia)","International Centre for Education in International Finance (an arm of Bank Negara, the Central Bank of Malaysia)","This paper was supported by funding (industry grant) provided by the International Centre for Education in International Finance (an arm of Bank Negara, the Central Bank of Malaysia).",,22,8,8,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1566-0141,1873-6173,,EMERG MARK REV,Emerg.

A difference-in-difference-in-differences strategy is employed to estimate the effect of the policy on the housing equity holdings of potentially treated individuals. Using a panel of unmarried homeowners, the policy induced treated individuals who were likely to require long-term care to hold less housing equity by values of $82,000 to $193,000 relative to control individuals. This equates to relative reductions of 12 to 29 percent for treated individuals after the policy change. Similar effects are not observed when considering health measures less predictive of long-term care services and for a sample of married households who were unlikely affected by the policy. These estimates confirm the importance of the housing asset as a shelter for Medicaid eligibility.","[Ricks, Judith S.] Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Off Res, 1700 G St NW, Washington, DC 20552 USA",,"Ricks, JS (通讯作者)，Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Off Res, 1700 G St NW, Washington, DC 20552 USA.",judith.ricks@cfpb.gov,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

More precisely, we find that the unemployment rates and the ratio of self-employment to employees' earnings have a positive effect on self-employment, whereas, economic development and divorce rates have a negative effect. Importantly, we find that the economic variables have equal or stronger long run impact on females than males, with both groups reacting to changes in family circumstances. Finally, we show that the short run family circumstances are better predictors of self-employment choices rather than economic factors, with self-employment being a means of adjustment to new personal circumstances and economic needs.","[Saridakis, George] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Mohammed, Anne-Marie] Univ West Indies, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Garcia-Iglesias, Jesus M.] Univ Extremadura, Fac Business Finance & Tourism, Caceres, Spain; [Torres, Rebeca I.

Ultimately, this literature thus comes up with a long list of institutional factors that may explain entrepreneurial differences between countries. But which institutions are most influential? How do these institutions relate to different types of entrepreneurship? And to what extent are institutions complementary to each other in the way they sustain different entrepreneurship types? The literature on 'Varieties-of-Capitalism' (VoC) offers a parsimonious theoretical framework to address these questions. Based on the VoC literature, we theoretically derive a consistent set of institutional indicators that can explain differences in entrepreneurship types between countries. Based on principal component and cluster analyses, we illustrate how 21 Western developed economies cluster around four distinct institutional settings. Furthermore, we use simple OLS regressions to show how these institutional constellations are related to different types of entrepreneurship. We conclude that four different 'Varieties of Entrepreneurship' can be identified across the Western world. The main implication of our findings is that a 'perfect' institutional constellation, equally facilitating different types of entrepreneurship, does not exist. Policy-makers seeking to stimulate entrepreneurship are thus faced with the trade-off of targeting policy reforms to that entrepreneurship type they intend to promote-at the expense of other types of entrepreneurship and the broader societal consequences such reforms will have.","[Dilli, Selin; Herrmann, Andrea M.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Elert, Niklas] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden",Utrecht University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Dilli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",S.Dilli@uu.nl; Niklas.Elert@ifn.se; A.M.Herrmann@uu.nl,"Herrmann, Andrea M./M-9267-2013",,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [649378],Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(Horizon 2020),"This work is part of the European Commission 2020 Horizon project 'Financial and Institutional Reforms to build an Entrepreneurial Society (FIRES) in Europe'.

We contend that this event unblocked an informational cascade, in that much of the information was already known to outside parties, yet no significant market response occurred until the September 18 EPA notice. We also find a significant change in the evolution of equity and credit default swap (CDS) prices in the automobile industry consistent with more-informed trading in the equity market. A test of economic significance further supports this finding by showing a decrease in the profitability of a trading rule based on a predictive relation between CDS spread changes and lagged equity returns.","[Griffin, Paul A.] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Sch Management, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lont, David H.] Univ Otago, Dept Accountancy & Finance, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Otago,"Griffin, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Grad Sch Management, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",pagriffin@ucdavis.edu; david.lont@otago.ac.nz,,"Griffin, Paul/0000-0003-1226-652X",,,,,45,7,7,1,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1815-5669,,,J CONTEMP ACCOUNT EC,J.

Individuals take only part of their impact on pollution into account, hence there is a negative externality of capital accumulation on environmental quality. Increasing wealth or increasing pollution enhance green attitude and reduce the externality, because individuals care more about the environment if their income is higher or if pollution is more obvious. The time path of pollution as well as the evolution of equilibrium growth are shown to depend crucially on the determinants of green attitude. Ongoing growth may lead to complete internalization of the environmental externality if green attitude improves with increasing wealth, e.g. as a consequence of an increase in environmental education. In contrast, if green attitude is determined exclusively by the level of environmental quality, pollution remains at a suboptimally high level. The interdependence of wealth and pollution in the determination of environmental awareness implies more complex dynamics. Capital growth enhances green attitude and thereby decreases pollution. Improved environmental quality in turn may increase capital growth due to less green attitude and therefore slow down convergence to the sustainable balanced growth path.","[Ott, Ingrid] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Ott, Ingrid] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Soretz, Susanne] Univ Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Universitat Greifswald,"Soretz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.",ingrid.ott@kit.edu; soretz@uni-greifswald.de,"Soretz, Susanne/E-7559-2019","Soretz, Susanne/0000-0002-7996-865X",,,,,28,14,14,5,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

However, the on-site sampling scheme over-samples frequent site visitors and omits nonvisitors, which can result in biased and inconsistent estimation of population parameters. A common empirical approach to addressing the sampling issues is to make adjustments directly to the assumed population distribution. We propose an alternative empirical strategy that utilizes the sample distribution and treats endogenous stratification and truncation separately. Monte Carlo simulation shows this proposed empirical strategy has merit.

The imperative for a sustainable economic model corroborated with the advances in digital technologies usage have reconfigured consumers' approaches and expectations and availed new forms of consumer behavior. Among these, the development of consumer-based online communities and of the online intellectual capital have often come forth as an undertaking of empowered consumers pursuing knowledge-based consumption patterns. The quest for sustainable, bio-labeled products on the digital markets has cemented the formation of new social aggregations built on the similarity of interests, goals, values, expectations, preferences, etc., giving way to consistent communication and interaction flows among their members and engendering profound transformations in today's society. Acknowledging all these facts, the study investigates the influences of the online intellectual capital on the consumption patterns through the lens of bioeconomy. The focus is set on the bio products consumption in two European countries (i.e., Romania and Italy), relying on a sample of over 700 active online consumers.

From basic principles expressed in the language of acceptance sets we derive a general pricing and hedging formula and apply it to American options. The result combines the important aspects of the problem into one price. It finds the optimal compromise between risk reduction and transaction costs, i.e. optimally placed rebalancing times. Moreover, it accounts for the interplay between the early exercise and hedging decisions. We then perform a numerical calculation to compare the price of an agent who has exponential preferences and uses our method of optimal hedging against a delta hedger. The results show that the optimal hedging strategy is influenced by the early exercise boundary and that the worst case holder behavior for a sub-optimal hedger significantly deviates from the classical Black-Scholes exercise boundary.","[Gerer, Johannes; Dorfleitner, Gregor] Univ Regensburg, Dept Finance, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Gerer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Dept Finance, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",johannes@gerer.name,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Yet, another important promise of the treaties has been ignored altogether. Architects of the investment treaty regime, as well as many current proponents, have suggested that the treaties allow developing countries to de-politicize investor-state disputes; i.e. shield commercial disputes from broader political and diplomatic considerations with developed states. While this argument is widely accepted by legal scholars and practitioners and explicitly promoted by capital-exporting states, it has never been subjected to empirical investigation. We provide the first such test, using an original dataset of US diplomatic actions in 219 individual investment disputes across 73 countries as well as detailed case studies drawing on internal US State Department diplomatic cables. We find no evidence for the de-politicization hypothesis: diplomatic engagement remains important for investor-state dispute settlement, and the US government is just as likely to intervene in developing countries that have ratified investment treaties with the US as those that have not. Coercive American intervention in investment disputes is rare, but this is a general feature of American investment diplomacy after the Cold War, rather than one limited to investors with recourse to legalized dispute settlement procedures. These findings provide a critical corrective to our understanding of the investment treaty regime, and have important implications for understanding the effects of international legalization on developing countries.

Based on a review of literature on child friendly cities and sustainable travel, we have developed a new operational framework for child centred sustainable travel policies. The framework measures consideration given to sustainable travel in children's policies and promotion of children and young people's needs and rights in sustainable travel policies from the point of view of children as equal citizens. We then review 25 child friendly policy and guidelines and 19 sustainable travel policies from Australian local governments, using this framework.

Locating this privatization within a broader context of capital's enclosures, the paper shows a process of depeasantization, labour intensification (via the multiplication of petty commodity production activities and proletarianization) and changing socioecological relations. This is a process where enclosures continuously alienate workers by separating them not necessarily from the land, but, more generally, from the conditions of their labour even when these are already commodified. As workers cope with alienation, they encounter it anew, contributing to capital's survival through their search for money and other commodities (i.e., means of production and subsistence). Workers' everyday adaptations to capital, and hence alienation, need to become central in future research on primitive accumulation and agrarian change.","[Hiraldo, Rocio] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Hiraldo, Rocio] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of East Anglia; University of Copenhagen,"Hiraldo, R (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England.;Hiraldo, R (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",r.hiraldo@uea.ac.uk,,"Hiraldo, Rocio/0000-0002-2526-6206",University of East Anglia; University of Copenhagen,University of East Anglia; University of Copenhagen,University of East Anglia; University of Copenhagen,,76,6,8,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Because of the difficulty of obtaining bridge votes, most existing approaches for estimating the ideal points of members of Congress generate static ideal points or ideal points that move linearly over time. We propose an approach for dynamic ideal point estimation using Project Vote Smart's National Political Awareness Test to construct bridge votes. We use our dynamic estimates to measure aggregate change, to measure individual-level change, and to study the institutional and structural factors that explain the changing positions of House candidates and members of Congress. We demonstrate that while the Republican Party has been selecting increasingly extreme candidates, Democratic incumbents have become more extreme while in office. We also find that the congruence between elected members of Congress and their constituents is mostly explained by the selection as opposed to the responsiveness of the candidate. Nonetheless, we find evidence of dynamic responsiveness of incumbents in specific circumstances. We find that competitiveness, midterm elections, and sharing the president's party affiliation are associated with greater responsiveness. Conversely, retirement is not associated with a change in responsiveness. We find no evidence of responsiveness of challengers.

We compare and contrast the accuracy and uncertainty in forecasts of rents, and capital and total returns with those for a variety of macroeconomic series. The results show that in general forecasters tend to be marginally more accurate in the case of macroeconomic series than with rents and substantially so in the case of capital and total returns. However, once account is taken of the heightened volatility of the underlying series forecasts, rents do perform comparably. Across all of the series, forecasts tend to be smoothed with forecaster's under-estimating performance during economic booms and vice versa in recessions. We find that rental forecasts in particular are affected by economic uncertainty, as measured by disagreement across the macro-forecasters. Increased uncertainty leads to increased dispersion in the rental forecasts and a reduction in forecast accuracy.","[Papastamos, Dimitrios] Eurobank, Athens, Greece; [Matysiak, George] Master Management Grp, Warsaw, Poland; [Matysiak, George] Krakow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland; [Stevenson, Simon] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Cracow University of Economics; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Papastamos, D (通讯作者)，Eurobank, Athens, Greece.",d.papastamos@gmail.com; gmatysiak@gmail.com; ss243@uw.edu,,"Stevenson, Simon/0000-0001-7090-5938",,,,,45,3,3,1,7,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

Although redistribution and expropriation are both types of government extraction, redistribution re-allocates wealth within the citizenry, while expropriation re-allocates wealth from citizens to the government. Representative political institutions increase redistribution and reduce expropriation. Market openness changes these incentives, as foreign investors prefer reductions in both redistribution and expropriation. When political institutions are representative, the government will rely more on reducing expropriation, rather than limiting redistribution, to attract foreign investment. Under representative institutions then, openness partially reinforces the preferences of voters rather than undermining them. In addition, market liberalization occurs only when the policy changes needed to attract foreign investment are relatively small. If existing policies are satisfactory to foreign investors, moves toward openness may be accompanied by greater redistribution and expropriation, as governments are tempted by a larger base for extraction. Thus, openness has ambiguous effects on economic policy, at times encouraging and at times constraining extraction.","[Pond, Amy] Texas A&M Univ, Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Pond, A (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",apond@tamu.edu,"Pond, Amy/AAC-3108-2021","Pond, Amy/0000-0002-6908-2791",,,,,86,8,11,0,8,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Strategies have been differentiated over time, among regions, and in relation to specific political choices. The paper focuses on Latin America and the Caribbean in which different political approaches have been developed together with a quite different geographical level of characterisation, representing a significant case study to better understand how political and institutional intervention might incentivise local and/or foreign investors, shaping the organisation of the infrastructure network. Therefore, the current research analyses the transport-related projects included in the World Bank database on private participation in infrastructure (from 1980 to 2015) highlighting main patterns in terms of institutional, social and economic characteristics that might influence the investment in transport infrastructure in the Latin America and the Caribbean. Our panel analysis that includes data collected from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and local government websites shows a clear link between government strategies and the related outcome in terms of transport investments. In particular, in addition to the size of the investment, a positive (and significant) impact of being part of a regional organisation emerges, as well as the involvement of private companies.","[Tei, Alessio] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Ferrari, Claudio] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, Genoa, Italy",Newcastle University - UK; University of Genoa,"Tei, A (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",alessio.tei@ncl.ac.uk; ferrari@economia.unige.it,"Ferrari, Claudio/L-4981-2019; Tei, Alessio/AAT-1791-2020","Ferrari, Claudio/0000-0002-4339-2871; Tei, Alessio/0000-0002-1430-828X",,,,,40,11,11,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We consider both quality and quantity of the connections of two transport modes: air and rail. Among the 23 major cities selected, Shanghai is revealed to have the highest connectivity level, leading in both air and rail connectivity. Hong Kong, Kunming, and Urumqi are the three cities that predominantly rely on air transportation whose contribution to the connectivity exceeds 80%. This research also suggests that the connections between international cities and China's domestic network are highly concentrated on a few cities, namely, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou, and that Seoul is the best connected international city in terms of its transport links with China. Shanghai-Nanjing has been found to be the best-connected city pair, primarily due to the significant contribution from high-speed rail (HSR) service. Our study shows that the contribution from train service is more than 80% for 19 of the 20 top-ranking domestic routes measured by connectivity. In addition, HSR has become a preferred and dominant option over air on a number of long-distance routes up to 1,300km. This finding has significant policy implications for transportation infrastructure planning and investment.","[Zhu, Zhenran; Zhang, Anming] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Zhang, Yahua] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Commerce, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Zhang, Anming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Acad Financial Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of British Columbia; University of Southern Queensland; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhang, AM (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",anming.zhang@sauder.ubc.ca; yahua.zhang@usq.edu.au,,"Zhang, Yahua/0000-0003-1522-3402; Zhang, Anming/0000-0002-9457-8414",UBC Centre for Transport Studies; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2015-0845],UBC Centre for Transport Studies; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We are very grateful to three anonymous referees and the Associate Editor (Peter Hall) whose detailed and thoughtful comments have led to a large improvement of the paper.

We find that, similar to conventional banks, Islamic banks in Turkey exhibit procyclical lending pattern. We also find that Islamic bank lending does not show significant difference from conventional bank lending. The results conflict with some of the findings that indicate Islamic banks as natural stabilizers in the banking systems. We emphasize that regulatory amendments of the last decade that are effective on Islamic banks could induce these banks to lend procyclically. To test the validity of this conjecture, we empirically examine how the state of competition in the Turkish banking system affects bank lending across business cycles by disentangling the effects separately for Islamic and conventional banks. The results suggest that the degree of competition spur bank lending procyclicality at the same magnitude, confirming the convergence between Islamic and conventional banks in their lending patterns. We also discuss several other issues in Islamic banking which may lead to the procyclicality of lending. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Corruption reduces economic growth, lowers investment, and erodes trust in government officials, creating an institutional environment that pushes entrepreneurs from productive to destructive activities. Corruption also has effects at the micro level because some industries are better situated to profit from corruption than others. Corruption not only lowers economic output but also shifts resources toward some industries and away from others. Using federal convictions in the USA as a measure of corruption, regression results show that increased corruption shifts resources toward the construction industry and away from the education industry and professional, scientific, and technical service industry.

Moreover, women show a higher survival rate than men. In addition, a high educational level positively influences survival, whilst previous work experience increases the risk of not surviving. Finally, age, with a nonlinear influence, increases probability of survival but at a decreasing rate.

A part of this aim was a comparison of defined factors in the Czech Republic (CR) and the Slovak Republic (SR). In regards to the aim defined, a survey-based research was conducted with enterprises operating in the SME segment. 312 enterprises in CR and 329 enterprises in SR were approached during this research. To verify the defined scientific hypotheses, a custom Business Environment Quality Index was created that was quantified separately for CR and SR. The research results brought interesting findings. The aggregated Business Environment Quality Index in the Slovak Republic reached the value of 0.460, which was higher than that of the Czech Republic (0.418). Slovak entrepreneurs gave the economic factors a higher rating than Czech entrepreneurs. Similarly, Slovak entrepreneurs rated the importance of the Central Bank in establishing a stable business environment and the role of commercial banks in financing business needs more positively. The evaluation of political factors is relatively negative in both countries. Slovak entrepreneurs evaluated more positively the judicial system in the area of commercial law, the state's influence on the business environment, and the administrative burden on enterprises. Czech entrepreneurs had a minor issue with the state bureaucracy's impact on the business environment. The evaluation of technological factors is relatively negative in both countries, as the value of this index is slightly below 0.250. Slovak entrepreneurs better assessed the situation on the job market and the cooperation of the public sector with the business environment. On the contrary, Czech entrepreneurs gave the infrastructure level in the area of research and development a better rating. The evaluation of social factors is relatively positive in both countries. Entrepreneurs in the Slovak Republic perceive a more positive attitude of the society towards entrepreneurs and a more intense influence of the family on entrepreneurship, and positively evaluate media's activities in regards to the business environment. The evaluation of the competitive environment is more positive in Slovakia. When evaluating the narrower competitive environment, it was discovered that Slovak entrepreneurs think that customers, suppliers, and employees play a positive role in their business.","[Cepel, Martin; Kotaskova, Anna] Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia; [Stasiukynas, Andrius] Kazimieras Simonavicius Univ, Dariaus Ir Gireno G 21, LT-02189 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Dvorsky, Jan] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Pan-European University; Kazimieras Simonavicius University; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Cepel, M (通讯作者)，Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia.",cepel@benzinol.com; andrius@snowarena.lt; anna.kotaskova@gmail.com; jan.dvorsky5@gmail.com,"Kotaskova, Anna/AAD-8105-2019; Cepel, Martin/AAY-6375-2020; Dvorsky, Jan/C-9213-2018","Kotaskova, Anna/0000-0002-6282-9899; Dvorsky, Jan/0000-0002-6078-2636",,,,,45,49,49,32,165,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

The first peril is that reforms containing tax provisions selected simply on the basis of their projected revenue contributions will produce less tax revenue than anticipated, illustrative calculations suggesting shortfalls of roughly 8-16 percent. The second peril is that reforms will not advance the objectives of efficiency and tax equity to the extent that they include provisions intended to influence future tax legislation or government spending. The third peril is that reforms designed without sufficient appreciation of transitional gains and losses will offer inadequate and misdirected transition relief. And the fourth peril is that reforms stoke expectations of future tax changes, discouraging investment and encouraging costly tax avoidance.

Director-CEOs might be hired in a planned succession because they combine outsiders' new perspectives with insiders' firm-specific knowledge. Alternatively, directors may be recruited when the board is unprepared for a leadership change. We find that unplanned successions, in which director-CEOs are appointed as a quick-fix solution, result in a negative market reaction, deterioration in performance, and ill-fitting candidates with shorter tenures. Conversely, firms recruiting director-CEOs in planned successions perform similarly to other firms.

Asymptotic theory is developed assuming the factors form a weakly dependent vector-valued time series, and the regression errors are weakly dependent functions. To accommodate the empirical behavior of the cross-section of returns and of the factors, we allow both the factors and the error functions can exhibit mild departures from stationarity. This requires new asymptotic theory which leads to several tests for the significance of function-valued regression coefficients. The new approach to the study of the significance of risk factors for a cross-section of returns complements the established Fama-French approach based on portfolio construction.

We employ the popular decomposition approach proposed by Heston and Rouwenhorst and cover 2,045 individual firms from 36 emerging countries across 39 industries. Generally, we find a domination of country factors in the sample period of 1990-2012, particularly after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, which implies that country-based diversification is still superior to industry-based diversification in emerging markets. In addition, we document high variability of the common factor coupled with a diminishing trend of country and industry factors, which limits the desired risk reduction from diversification in emerging markets. A convergence between systematic and total risk is found beginning in 2007, which coincides with the timing of the Global Financial Crisis.","[Lee, Meng-Horng] Hong Leong Investment Bank, Res Dept, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Hooy, Chee-Wooi] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Brooks, Robert] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Monash University,"Hooy, CW (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",cwhooy@usm.my,"Hooy, Chee Wooi/A-7756-2011","Hooy, Chee-Wooi/0000-0002-9014-6745",Ministry of Higher Education [203/PMGT/6711253],Ministry of Higher Education(Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR)),"The Ministry of Higher Education, Grant number: 203/PMGT/6711253",,25,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

A potential hypothesis for this result is the fact that a single supervisory authority can take spillover effects between countries into account and is therefore able to stabilize the European banking sector. Splitting the sample by an indicator for supervisory power, an indicator for corruption, and by debt/GDP reveals that the positive impact of the SSM was stronger for banks in countries that perform poorly with respect to these measures.

This study investigates the relationship between oil price fluctuations and the current account balances in Nigeria. The study used a time series data sample from 1977 to 2015. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) was used to estimate the relationship between the current account and oil price fluctuations in the short-run and long-run. It was argued from the findings that in the short-run, the oil price had a positive but insignificant impact on the current account balances, while in the long-run, it impacted negatively, but was found to be a significant determinant of current account balances in the economy. Other variables such as population growth (POP), gross domestic product (GDP) and trade (T) had an insignificant relationship with the current account balances in the short-run, while in the long-run, only GDP and oil price (OP) were found to be significant determinants of the current account balances in the economy. The study, therefore, concludes that better performances of the current account balance in the Nigerian economy are a function of the stability in the oil price. From the findings, it was recommended that the economy should be tailored towards mitigating the shocks in oil price through considering alternative means of trade.","[Longe, Adedayo Emmanuel; Adelokun, Oluwole Oluniyi] Univ Ibadan, Ctr Petr Energy Econ & Law, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria; [Omitogun, Olawunmi] Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Dept Econ, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria",University of Ibadan,"Longe, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Ibadan, Ctr Petr Energy Econ & Law, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria.",Longeemmanuel28@gmail.com; Oluwoleadelokun58@gmail.com; omitogun.olawunmi@oouagoiwoye.edu.ng,,,,,,,32,4,5,0,5,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

The results suggest that daylight savings time reduces the demand for electricity by about 1.5% in Ontario. The reductions in electricity consumption is concentrated during the evening period.

We find that funds generate higher returns and attract more inflows when they reach for yield, especially in periods of low-interest rates. Returns for high reaching-for-yield funds nevertheless tend to be negative on a risk-adjusted basis. Funds engage in rank-chasing behavior by reaching for yield, although these incentives are moderated by the illiquid nature of corporate bonds.

Moreover, this has stimulated the emergence of new modes of transport, for example the motorcycle-taxi (moto-taxi). While moto-taxis have been used for decades in some areas, they have seen massive growth in the past couple of years and they have expanded to other rural and urban areas in SSA. This has come with a number of benefits as regards securing public mobility and socio-economic effects. On the other hand, the growth of these often informally provided services has resulted in negative externalities, especially road safety issues. And this has fuelled public discussions on how to control and regulate these services. Within academia their growing importance has resulted in a significant number of empirical studies - including a large share of final theses/assignments - in the past five to ten years. These studies deliver valuable insights into different aspects of this transport mode. However, only few comprehensive overviews of moto-taxis and their service characteristics exist. This article aims to present a comprehensive summary of the role played by moto-taxi services in providing public transport options in SSA. Based on an extensive literature review it categorises and summarises insights into this transport mode that are covered by the reviewed studies. The topics include underlying factors of motorcycle-taxi growth, supply side and demand side aspects, service organisation, regulation, as well as safety, health and environmental impacts. As far as available insights allow, regional, as well as urban and rural service patterns are traced. On that basis, the article discusses implications for the debate on informal transport and identifies knowledge gaps that should be addressed by future research.","[Ehebrecht, Daniel] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Heinrichs, Dirk; Lenz, Barbara] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Transport Res Berlin, Rutherfordstr 2, D-12489 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Ehebrecht, D (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",daniel.ehebrecht@geo.hu-berlin.de; dirk.heinrichs@dlr.de; barbara.lenz@dlr.de,"Ehebrecht, Daniel/AAD-4888-2020; Heinrichs, Dirk/ABA-9621-2020","Ehebrecht, Daniel/0000-0003-3947-0096",German Research Foundation (DFG) [LE 1137/9-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) [LE 1137/9-1, 2015-2018].",,120,72,78,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Each of these two questions is an example of a broad category of questions of great relevance for the economics of risk. The second question is an example of a contingent risk comparison, while the question behind second-order stochastic dominance is an example of a non-contingent risk comparison. The stochastic order arising from a contingent risk comparison is obviously weaker than that arising from the corresponding non-contingent risk comparison, but we show that the two stochastic orders are closely related, so that the answer to a non-contingent risk comparison problem always provides the answer to the corresponding contingent risk comparison problem. In addition to showing the connection between parallel contingent and non-contingent risk comparison problems, we articulate a method for solving both kinds of problems using the basis'' approach. The basis approach has often been used implicitly, but we argue that there is value in making its use explicit, particularly in indicating which new, previously unsolved problems can readily be solved by the basis approach and which cannot.","[Gollier, Christian] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Kimball, Miles S.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Gollier, C (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",christian.gollier@tse-fr.eu,,,European Research Council under the European Community [230589],European Research Council under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)),"Helpful comments from Susan Athey, Rose-Anne Dana, Ian Jewitt, Jean-Charles Rochet, Edward Schlee, and two anonymous referees are acknowledged.

It should be, as by definition it is supposed to lead individuals to adopt collectively optimal strategies. Indeed, it has been argued that team reasoning is more rationally efficient and can be more evolutionarily viable than individual reasoning. This paper provides reasons that mitigate both claims, which I argue rely on an underestimation of the efficiency of individual reasoning and on an overestimation of the coordinating power of team reasoning. Once these are corrected, the efficiency of team reasoning turns out to be equivocal. At the rational level, the superior efficiency of team reasoning depends on specific conditions regarding the nature of the interactive situation and the general probability that individuals team reason. At the evolutionary level, both the stability and the appearance of team reasoning become puzzling.","[Paternotte, Cedric] Univ Paris Sorbonne, Dept Philosophy, SND Res Team, Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite,"Paternotte, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Sorbonne, Dept Philosophy, SND Res Team, Paris, France.",cedric.paternotte@gmail.com,"Paternotte, Cedric/AAE-4739-2020",,,,,,35,2,3,1,3,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Their emergence can be explained by the constant negotiation of multiple and sometimes even antagonistic logics within these farms in a context of rapid agrarian change and the juxtaposition of capitalistic, entrepreneurial and peasant farms in the same area. Through their engagement as workers or sharecroppers in the different types of farms and as household members on the family farm, the young farmers from the dismantled agrarian cooperatives participate actively in the transformation of farming modes. The porosity of the peasant and entrepreneurial worlds is the main lesson we draw from our study. There is a subtle process of hybridization between the peasant and entrepreneurial modes of farming, resulting in a wide range of profiles. If we only focus on the political discourse, the trend towards capitalistic and entrepreneurial modes of farming seems inescapable. Nevertheless, our study stresses the resistance of peasant modes of farming that can blend with a 'modern' perception of agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This has important implications for many cross-country comparisons, including measures of poverty and inequality. Without presuming that either round is better methodologically, the paper tries to help the community of ICP users better understand the economic factors underlying the estimated changes in price levels across countries. Differences in domestic inflation rates have played a role, as expected. Two other factors are identified. The excess sensitivity to changes in market exchange rates suggests that the PPPs may put higher weight on internationally traded goods than do domestic deflators. Additionally, faster growing countries have seen a steeper rise in their PPP relative to market exchange rates; this can be explained by a tendency for wage increases in growing economies to lead to a higher price level. Together these factors account for over 70% of the variance in PPP changes even ignoring methodological changes. However, an independent downward drift in price levels is also evident, concentrated in the ICP's Asia region. A possible explanation lies in the Asia region's greater success (relative to other regions) in removing urban bias in the price surveys.

Furthermore, the economic viability of cage culture depends on substantial investment thresholds, engendering foreign direct investment in the industry in developing countries. This paper develops a conceptual model for fresh-water-based aquaculture that accounts for these effects. We found that a Pigouvian tax (optimum ad valorem tax) that corrects the externalities depends on economic and biological parameters in both fisheries. Correcting for the externalities results in a reduction in aquaculture production but not optimum wild catch. Furthermore, with foreign capital in aquaculture, the Pigouvian tax equals the ratio of net to total benefit from aquaculture.

In order to frame poor performance in a positive light, managers also focus more on the future, provide causal explanations for poor performance, and use more passive voice and fewer personal pronouns.","[Asay, H.

We applied the direct method, which measures discounting independent of utility, in a representative French sample, interviewed at home by professional interviewers. We found more discounting for money than for health. The median discount rates (6.5% for money and 2.2% for health) were close to market interest rates, suggesting that at the aggregate level the direct method solves the puzzle of unrealistically high discount rates typically observed in applied economics. Constant discounting fitted the data better than the hyperbolic discounting models that we considered.

While the narrative is about the construction of a US-style market-based financial system to overcome the problems of Europe's bank-based system and help medium-sized enterprises, the first legal initiative aims to create a European market for securitizations, which are a source of funding for large (mortgage) banks and as such are squarely at odds with the headline goals of the Capital Market Union.

The links between environmental characteristics and walking behaviors are usually context specific. While local studies fail to embrace a global overview of these contexts, global studies hide the context scale patterns. In this study, we applied a geographically weighted logistic regression (GWR) on a large area (whole of France) to explore spatial variations of the relations between five environmental variables and walking for leisure and errands purposes among 40,480 French adults. This approach allowed us to adopt a global view of local patterns of relations and to highlight spatial contexts (defined through a clustering of GWR odds ratios) where combinations of correlates varied. Specifically, clustering algorithms on the GWR odds ratios led to 9 and 6 clusters for walking for leisure and errands, respectively. Some clusters were characterized by a particularly strong effect of population density, whereas others exhibited low effect of vegetation cover rate. Chi -squared tests indicated that these clusters were associated with type of urban areas (Paris, major urban poles, periurban areas, small urban poles, isolated areas) for the two types of walking. Beyond its methodological contribution - providing a method to handle large data samples into GWR analyses - this study offers key elements to practitioners and policy makers to target relevant contexts and environmental features for promoting daily walking.","[Feuillet, T.] Univ Paris 08, LADYSS, UMR 7533, CNRS, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France; [Feuillet, T.; Menai, M.; Kesse-Guyot, E.; Hercberg, S.; Charreire, H.] Univ Paris 13, Equipe Rech Epidemiol Nutr, Sorbonne Paris Cite, U1153,Inserm,INRA,CNAM,Ctr Rech Epidemiol &, Bobigny, France; [Commenges, H.] Univ Paris 01, Geog Cites, UMR 8504, CNRS, Paris, France; [Salze, P.; Enaux, C.] Univ Strasbourg, LIVE, UMR 7562, CNRS, Strasbourg, France; [Reuillon, R.] Inst Syst Complexes Paris Ile de France, Paris, France; [Nazare, J. -A.; Simon, C.] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, INSA Lyon, INRA U1235, CRNH Rhone Alpes,Lyon Univ,Lab CarMeN,INSERM,U123, Lyon, France; [Charreire, H.] Univ Paris Est, Lab Urba, UPEC, Creteil, France; [Oppert, J.

PTH's relations with future profitability and future investment growth are both significantly positive, and they mirror PTH's relation with future returns in the cross section and by time horizons.

Does this rise of the entrepreneurial society also imply that entrepreneurial personalities are becoming increasingly widespread and powerful in political leadership? Joseph A. Schumpeter already argued that highly influential entrepreneurs are unique and show a certain personality pattern that can be described as being not only high in creativity and change orientation but also high in competitiveness and rule-breaking. It is interesting to ask whether such Schumpeterian personalities indeed play an increasingly important role in political leadership, given that daily routines of policy leaders, at least at first glance, usually require rather non-entrepreneurial strategies such as careful, risk-averse diplomacy. To address this question, we first survey the existing literature on personality and political leadership. We further present a novel personality analysis of an influential business leader that recently made a transition to political leadership: Donald J. Trump, the incumbent US president. Employing a language-based, computerized method of analyzing Twitter statements, we compare his online personality to the online personality of other influential entrepreneurs and business managers, who do not engage in political leadership. The results indicate that Trump is indeed distinct in that he shows stronger features of a Schumpeterian personality. However, he is also comparatively high in Neuroticism. We discuss these findings focusing on the potential implications of a concentration of entrepreneurial mindsets in political leadership.","[Obschonka, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Australian Ctr Entrepreneurship Res, Sch Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Fisch, Christian] Trier Univ, Fac Management, Trier, Germany; [Fisch, Christian] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Inst Management ERIM, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Universitat Trier; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Obschonka, M (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Australian Ctr Entrepreneurship Res, Sch Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",martin.obschonka@qut.edu.au,,"Fisch, Christian/0000-0003-3609-7193; Obschonka, Martin/0000-0002-0853-7166",,,,,112,25,25,3,74,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Based on the assumption that deviation from a legal norm is the more accepted the less its underlying principles are jeopardized, we argue that violating the tax compliance norm is socially justifiable if revenue requirements as well as equity and efficiency tax principles are not infringed upon by the evasion. Building on the literature on tax evasion, optimal inheritance taxation, and family economics, we hypothesize that a large non-declared amount of transfer and a high liquidity of the transferred asset decrease the acceptability of inheritance tax evasion and that both a high degree of kinship and young age of the heir increase the acceptance of evasion. Utilizing an experimental design embedded in a survey on the acceptance of inheritance tax evasion conducted in Germany in 2012, we confirm these hypotheses empirically.","[Abraham, Martin; Lorek, Kerstin; Richter, Friedemann; Wrede, Matthias] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Wrede, M (通讯作者)，Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Sch Business & Econ, POB 3931, D-90020 Nurnberg, Germany.",matthias.wrede@fau.de,,,FAUs Emerging Fields Initiative (Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg) [EFIRW_01],FAUs Emerging Fields Initiative (Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg),"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the FAUs Emerging Fields Initiative (Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg) (EFIRW_01).

We find that adjustment to these shocks is relatively fast. Current accounts experience, on average, a contemporaneous variation of only about 1/2 of the magnitude of the price shock indicating a significant volume offset and a full adjustment within 3-4 years. Dynamics are largely symmetric for terms-of-trade booms and busts, as well as for advanced and emerging market economies. External adjustment is driven primarily by offsetting shifts in domestic demand, as opposed to variations in output (also reflected in the response of import rather than export volumes), indicating a strong income channel at play. Exchange rate flexibility played an important buffering role during booms, but less so during busts; while international reserve holdings were a key tool for smoothing the adjustment process.","[Adler, Gustavo; Magud, Nicolas E.; Werner, Alejandro] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Adler, G (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",gadler@imf.org,"Magud, Nicolas/AAW-5912-2020","Magud, Nicolas/0000-0001-6274-7650",,,,,15,4,4,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

The model simplifies urban space by dividing it into two zones (islands), center and suburbs, which are connected by a congested road and a public-transit line. Each road commuter requires an allotment of CBD land for parking, and because the central zone's area is fixed, parking land reduces the amount available for central residences and CBD production. The model characterizes optimal resource allocation from the perspective of a social planner. The planning solution can be decentralized, which requires employee- rather than employer-paid parking, congestion tolls, and a tax (subsidy) to offset the road capacity deficit (surplus). The analysis then considers the effect of switching to employer-paid parking, with the burden of parking costs shifting from road users to employers, thus reducing the wage for all workers. This switch inefficiently increases road usage and capacity investment, while spurring an inefficient increase in suburbanization.","[Brueckner, Jan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Franco, Sofia F.] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Brueckner, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jkbrueck@uci.edu; sfranco@novasbe.pt,,,,,,,30,27,29,1,20,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

On one hand, crime against women is on the rise while on the other, women's labor force participation rate (WLFPR) has been declining over the last three decades. We estimate the extent to which the decline in WLFPR can be assigned to increasing instances of crime against women. We argue that an increase in crime against women, increases the non-pecuniary costs of traveling to work, particularly in a traditional society marked by stigma against victims of sexual crimes. Our findings suggest that women are less likely to work away from home in regions where the perceived threat of sexual harassment against girls is higher. The estimate is robust to various sensitivity checks. Moreover, the deterrence effect of crime responds to the opportunity cost of work on one hand and the stigma cost of sexual crimes on the other.

One line of argument tells a story of unprepared novices making a risky move, and thus predicts negative consequences. Another line of argument tells a story of prepared entrepreneurs making a strategic decision, and thus predicts positive consequences. The problem of estimating the true effect involves an important endogeneity problem that can only be overcome by accounting for the fact that new ventures self-select into internationalization. The goal of this research is to add to the post-internationalization survival literature by accounting for this self-selection using an endogenous switching model in a potential outcomes or counterfactual inference approach. Leveraging a panel of US new ventures from the Kauffman Firm Survey, our results paint a picture more in line with the preparedness logic of new venture internationalization. After controlling for this self-selection, we find a positive average treatment effect of internationalization on survival, and we find evidence that early internationalization is better for post-internationalization survival than late internationalization. We argue that these results suggest that the new theories of new venture internationalization needs to be further unchained from the process theories of internationalization.","[Fariborzi, Hadi; Keyhani, Mohammad] Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Off SH 467,Scurfield Hall,2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Fariborzi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Off SH 467,Scurfield Hall,2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",hadi.fariborzi@haskayne.ucalgary.ca,"Keyhani, Mohammad/U-8218-2018","Keyhani, Mohammad/0000-0001-9110-6959",,,,,73,19,21,2,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

When managers vary in ability, determining who is good and who is not is vital. Moreover, knowing they will be assessed can lead those being assessed to behave in ways that make them appear better. Such signal-jamming behavior can be beneficial (e.g., an executive Works harder on behalf of shareholders) or harmful (e.g., the behavior is myopic, boosting short-term performance at the expense of long-term success). In standard models of assessment, it is assumed those doing the assessing behave according to Bayes Theorem. But what if the assessors suffer from one of many well-documented cognitive biases that makes them less-than-perfect Bayesians? This paper begins an exploration of that issue by considering the consequence of one such bias, the base-rate fallacy, for two of the canonical assessment models: career-concerns and optimal monitoring and replacement. Although firms can suffer due to the base-rate fallacy, they can also benefit from this bias.","[Hermalin, Benjamin E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hermalin, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",hermalin@econ.berkeley.edu,,,Thomas & Alison Schneider Distinguished Professorship in Finance,Thomas & Alison Schneider Distinguished Professorship in Finance,The author thanks Heather Montgomery for her helpful discussion of this paper at the nber-tcer-cepr (trio) Conference and the other participants at that conference for their comments.

J,"Ika, LA",,,,"Ika, Lavagnon A.",,,Beneficial or Detrimental Ignorance: The Straw Man Fallacy of Flyvbjerg's Test of Hirschman's Hiding Hand,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Review,,,,,,Albert O. Hirschman; Hiding Hand; ignorance; project management; straw man fallacy,PROJECT-MANAGEMENT; PLANNING FALLACY; APPRAISAL; PROGRAM,"In a recent paper in this journal, The Fallacy of Beneficial Ignorance: A Test of Hirschman's Hiding Hand, Professor Bent Flyvbjerg claims that there is no such thing as beneficial ignorance and that ignorance is detrimental to project success. Moreover, he argues that if Hirschman's principle of the Hiding Hand were correct, then benefit overruns would exceed cost overruns. Thus, with a statistical test, he demonstrates that the Hiding Hand is in fact less common than its evil twin, the Planning Fallacy. In this rejoinder, the author shows that Flyvbjerg's test is built on a straw man fallacy and that he fails to refute the Hiding Hand. Contrary to Flyvbjerg-who focuses on the narrow costs and benefits this paper provides evidence that while the Hiding Hand is found among projects that are project management failures but project successes, the Planning Fallacy fits with projects that are both project management and project failures. On that basis, the author analyzes a sample of 161 World Bank-funded projects of different types and finds that the Hiding Hand prevails. While future research should ascertain this finding, the author then points out the methodological limitations of Flyvbjerg's test. Indeed, it is ironic that the Hiding Hand, a principle crafted against the very idea of cost-benefit analysis, is refuted on that very basis. Even worse, Flyvbjerg, in his cost-benefit analysis, ignores the full life-cycle project costs and benefits, the unintended project effects, the difficulties, and problem-solving abilities so dear to Hirschman, and, thus, treats the management of projects as a kind of black box. Finally, the author submits that Hirschman was a behavioral project theorist, and argues that it is more important to shed light on the circumstances where the Hiding Hand works than to question whether the principle of the Hiding Hand is right.

Stability is measured by the ratio of retail deposits to total assets and the ratio of loans to total assets to cover both positive and negative impacts, and deposit insurance policy is assessed in various stages. The survey uses a data panel of 127 commercial banks from 2000 to 2013 in six member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Using a dynamic panel data investigation, we obtain results showing that the implementation of deposit insurance policy negatively affects the ratio of retail deposits to total assets while positively influencing the ratio of loans to total assets. This is an important finding, as it implies that deposit insurance policy causes bank managers to take greater risks to increase their returns, rather than increasing the confidence level of depositors and ultimately increasing total deposits. This result is important for regulators as they evaluate deposit insurance policy and anticipate any negative outcomes that might follow. (C) 2017, Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi.

Hirschman; the Principle of the Hiding Hand; project management; quantitative versus qualitative analysis,,"Albert O. Hirschman's famous Principle of the Hiding Hand describes an unconscious predisposition of project managers: Projects are launched in the belief that one is prepared for every possible future difficulty. However, some potential problems are overlooked during the planning phase and surprisingly might surface later making it necessary to deal with them. Recently, this concept was statistically tested by Bent Flyvbjerg in World Development, who concluded that the Principle is wrong, biased and potentially disastrous. However, it is not the Principle of the Hiding Hand that is faulty, but the methodological approach taken by Flyvbjerg. In fact, Flyvbjerg's analysis is a telling example of what can go wrong if we assess the value of qualitative scholarship merely through the lens of large-n case quantitative analysis. Flyvbjerg seems to overlook both the context of the Hiding Hand and its connection to the work of Albert Hirschman. This article shows how specific notions of rigor can serve as a hindrance to understanding and thus belittle insights by one of the most original thinkers of the 20th century that are still useful in current debates on project management and expert behavior.

Our analysis distinguishes between short and long-run effects and accounts for the consequences of naturalization and assimilation. We use the model to analyze Spain's large 2000-2008 immigration wave. We find that immigration led to a 15% increase in public enrollment in the short run, together with a 3% reduction in public education spending and almost a 1 percentage-point increase in the share of native households using private schools. Depending on the eventual degree of assimilation, these trends will be greatly intensified or mitigated once immigrants naturalize and gain the right to vote. Our analysis suggests that assimilation in terms of family size and the value assigned to children's education are the most relevant dimensions quantitatively. We also show that immigration policies that favor one group over another can significantly alter the overall effects of immigration on the schooling system.","[Tanaka, Ryuichi] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; [Farre, Lidia] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Ortega, Francesc] CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Farre, Lidia] IAE CSIC, Barcelona, Spain",University of Tokyo; University of Barcelona; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Tanaka, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",ryuichi.tanaka@iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp; lidia.farre@ub.edu; fortega@qc.cuny.edu,"Farre, Lidia/AAA-1991-2019",", Ryuichi/0000-0002-3483-5175; ortega, francesc/0000-0001-5779-5711","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24330077]; Government of Catalonia [SGR2014-325]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-76866-R]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H02535, 17K03757, 25245040] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya); Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We benefitted from insightful comments by Antonio Cabrales, Daniele Coen-Pirani, Matthias Doepke, Shin-ichi Fukuda, Kyle Hyndman, Max Steinhardt, Weina Zhou and seminar participants at CUNY, Dalhousie University, University of Tokyo, University of Tsukuba, Development Bank of Japan, and Tokyo Labor Economics Workshop.

Next, we estimated an econometric model linking the level of financial development with measures of central bank characteristics and their monetary policies using panel data econometrics. The sample is made up of a panel of 89 countries, including 22 developed countries, 34 emerging countries and 33 developing countries over the period 1980-2010.

To capture respondents' relative deprivation, we use self-reported information on respondents' perception of the relative standing of their household in comparison to those of their neighbors. Controlling for households' absolute income and other relevant subjective dimensions, we illustrate that households' relative position vis-a-vis their reference groups plays an important role in determining the intentions of their members to migrate abroad. In particular, individuals are more willing to engage in temporary emigration if they perceive themselves to be poorer than the reference group. Our results may have important policy implications. A conjectural suggestion of our empirical exercise is that if migration has to be curbed, reducing absolute poverty alone may not be sufficient. In addition, policy-makers may need to decrease relative income differentials within the country.","[Antinyan, Armenak] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Int Acad Business & Econ, 25 Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China; [Corazzini, Luca] CaFoscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 821, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Tianjin University of Finance & Economics; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Antinyan, A (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Int Acad Business & Econ, 25 Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",antinyan.armenak@gmail.com,"Antinyan, Armenak/AAT-9633-2020","Antinyan, Armenak/0000-0001-9960-3618",,,,,75,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Markets provide economic opportunity, but without effective governance, high demand can drive resource degradation. In the context of small-scale sea cucumber fisheries in Yucatan, Mexico, this study documents local governance responses to new markets and identifies factors driving those responses. We conducted a comparative case study of two SSF communities, collecting participant observation and interview data during 16 months of fieldwork. Our study found that local rules-in-use did not match government regulations and that the emergence of local rules was shaped by relations of production in each study site. Specifically, patron-client relationships promoted an open access regime that expanded local fishing fleets while fishing cooperatives attempted to restrict access to local fishing grounds through collective action and multi-level linkages with government. We propose that the different material incentives arising from the way that patron-client relationships and cooperatives organize labor, capital, and profits help explain these divergent governance responses. We hypothesize that this finding is generalizable beyond the study context, especially given that patron-client relationships and cooperatives are common throughout the world's SSFs. This finding builds on previous research that indicates local institutions can mediate the effects of market pressures, showing that the emergence of local rules depends on how resource users are organized not just in relation to resource governance but vis-avis the markets themselves. Therefore, effective policies for SSFs facing market pressures require a greater emphasis on regulating local-level trade and governing the commercial aspects of fishing livelihoods. These lessons are relevant to the estimated 540 million individuals whose livelihoods SSFs support who may increasingly engage in the global seafood trade. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Borrowers showing a persistently superior managerial ability over previous years (more likely due to ability) enjoy a lower loan spread, while borrowers showing a temporary superior managerial ability (more likely due to luck) do not enjoy any spread reduction. This finding suggests that banks can discern ability from luck when pricing a loan. Firms with high-ability managers are more likely to continue their prior lower loan spread. The spread-reduction effect of managerial ability is stronger for firms with weak governance structures or poor stakeholder relationships, corroborating the notion that better managerial ability alleviates borrowers' agency and information risks. We also find that well governed banks are better able to price governance into their borrowers' loans, which helps explain why good governance enhances bank value. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We administer a choice experiment focused on ecosystem-service valuation to three independent samples: single-choice, repeated-choice, and best-worst scaling elicitation. We test whether results differ by parameter estimates, scale factors, preference heterogeneity, status-quo effects, attribute non-attendance, and magnitude and precision of welfare measures. Overall, we find limited evidence of differences in attribute parameter estimates, scale factors, and attribute increment values across elicitation treatments. However, we find significant differences in status-quo effects across elicitation treatments, with repeated-choice resulting in greater proportions of action votes, and consequently, higher program-level welfare estimates. Also, we find that single-choice yields drastically less-precise welfare estimates. Finally, we find some differences in attribute non-attendance behavior across elicitation formats, although there appears to be little consistency in class shares even within a given elicitation treatment.","[Petrolia, Daniel R.; Interis, Matthew G.] Mississippi State Univ, Deparment Agr Econ, Box 5187, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Hwang, Joonghyun] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 1105 SW Williston Rd, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA",Mississippi State University; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission,"Petrolia, DR (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Deparment Agr Econ, Box 5187, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",d.petrolia@msstate.edu; m.interis@msstate.edu; joonghyun.hwang@myfwc.com,"Petrolia, Daniel/AAH-6670-2020","Petrolia, Daniel/0000-0003-2102-1612; Interis, Matthew/0000-0003-3779-5495","NOAA Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, U.S. Department of Commerce [NA10OAR4170078]; USDA Cooperative State Research, Education & Extension Service [W-3133, MIS-033130]","NOAA Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, U.S. Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USDA Cooperative State Research, Education & Extension Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","The authors thank A.A.J.

Using Turkey as the case example of a garment export country in the global economy, the article explores the nature and organization of home-based piecework at the micro level within a broader global garment production chains perspective. Conducted in two Turkish cities, the study analyses the different cultural backgrounds of female workers and two distinct types of work, namely hand stitching and machine sewing of garments. The findings highlight the relationship between the cultural backgrounds of workers and the different types of work they undertake with control and consent practices as well as the patriarchal societal structure and relations in the context of local labour control regimes.","[Tartanoglu, Safak] Univ Duisburg Essen, Campus Essen,Univ Str 12, D-45141 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Tartanoglu, S (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Campus Essen,Univ Str 12, D-45141 Essen, Germany.",safak.tartanoglu@uni-due.de,,/0000-0002-2858-8606,,,,,54,3,4,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

The AA model makes two ancillary assumptions that do not refer to ambiguity: expected utility for risk and backward induction. These assumptions, even if normatively appropriate, fail descriptively. This paper relaxes these ancillary assumptions to avoid the descriptive violations, while maintaining AA's convenient mixture operation. Thus, it becomes possible to test and apply all AA-based ambiguity theories descriptively while avoiding confounds due to violated ancillary assumptions. The resulting tests use only simple stimuli, avoiding noise due to complexity. We demonstrate the latter in a simple experiment where we find that three assumptions about ambiguity, commonly made in AA theories, are violated: reference independence, universal ambiguity aversion, and weak certainty independence. The second, theoretical, part of the paper accommodates the violations found for the first ambiguity theory in the AA model-Schmeidler's CEU theory-by introducing and axiomatizing a reference dependent generalization. That is, we extend the AA ambiguity model to prospect theory.","[Trautmann, Stefan] Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Wakker, Peter P.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Wakker, PP (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",trautmann@uni-hd.de; Wakker@ese.eur.nl,,,,,,,103,7,7,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

These include, lump-sum transfers to households; reducing existing distortionary taxes, such as income taxes on labor and capital; investment in technology funds leading to energy/emissions efficiency improvements; and/or infrastructure developments that help expedite the adoption of low or lower carbon-intensive technologies. In this paper, we undertake illustrative simulations to explore how different revenue recycling options influence the overall economic outcome in terms of broad macroeconomic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or household welfare. Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) multi-sector, multi-region Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model (EC-MSMR) is used to simulate various revenue recycling options. These simulations are undertaken for the U.S. economy. The main findings of the paper are: (i) using carbon revenue for a general income tax reduction or investment subsidy is more advantageous than a lump-sum transfer to U.S. consumers in terms of welfare or GDP; and (ii) using carbon revenue for a sector-based subsidy such as renewable energy is more disadvantageous than a lump-sum transfer to consumers. In terms of accumulated welfare effects, our results indicate that the best carbon revenue recycling option is the investment subsidy or capital income tax reduction in the longer horizon; labor tax reductions yield the best outcome in the shorter horizons.","[Zhu, Yunfa; Ghosh, Madanmohan; Luo, Deming; Macaluso, Nick; Rattray, Jacob] Environm & Climate Change Canada, 200 Blvd Sacre Coeur, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0H3, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Zhu, YF (通讯作者)，Environm & Climate Change Canada, 200 Blvd Sacre Coeur, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0H3, Canada.",,,,,,,,48,17,18,0,19,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

The negative welfare effects are more severe for households where land is solely managed by women, a finding that sheds light on the gender-unequal impact of temperature shocks. Our evidence also suggests that women's vulnerability to temperature shocks is linked to women's land tenure security, as temperature shocks significantly impact women's welfare only in patrilineal districts, where statistics show that investment in agricultural technologies is lower.","[Asfaw, Solomon] Food & Agr Org FAO United Nat, Agr Dev Econ Div, Rome, Italy; [Maggio, Giuseppe] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Asfaw, S (通讯作者)，Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",solomon.asfaw@fao.org,"Maggio, Giuseppe/HGB-8937-2022","Maggio, Giuseppe/0000-0002-8768-1317",,,,,58,48,54,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

We identify the main drivers and impacts of crop and labor diversification which constitute two livelihood strategies on moderating the adaptation deficit. In doing so, we account for the interdependence between the two diversification practices and potential reverse causality between welfare outcomes and diversification behavior. Moreover, we condition the impacts of diversification on different sections of the welfare distribution to capture potential non-linear effects. Our results reveal that the diversification has positive and significant welfare impacts when most vulnerable households rely on it as an adaptation strategy to mid-run climate variability and as a, coping strategy to short-run market shocks. At the same time, our results find lower but still positive impacts for well-endowed households that are likely to diversify their activity portfolio. Given the very limited presence of policy support, we conclude that the rural Nigerien communities are characterized by a large and autonomous adaptation response which constitutes a key leverage mechanism for policy makers. We thus suggest government interventions aimed at supporting the most important diversification drivers, but also aimed at straightening some channels, such as network infrastructures or the promotion of local crop varieties, which may have a greater potential in triggering diversification.

Because of that, economists, real estate developers, banks, development and economy ministers, and land registry cadastral directorates of the countries have focused on explaining housing demand with economic variables. Therefore, the existence of effective model for prediction is very crucial for policy makers in the sector.

First, we made an inventory of the events reported to have affected banana export volumes for six exporter countries, as well as events reported to have affected banana import prices in the French market, between the years 2000 to 2015. We used weekly time-series to examine the impact of reported events on banana export volumes and on banana import prices. The first results indicate that weather events were the most frequently reported events to impact on export volumes and on consumer demand, thus confirming that they play a frequent role in determining prices. However, we also identified a wide range of other non weather events which affect volumes, consumer demand and thus prices. We demonstrated that the extent to which extreme weather events affect prices is primarily determined by the coincidence of events and by the structural context of the exporting and importing countries. This study helps to put the potential impact of weather events related to climate change into perspective and highlights the ongoing role of market mechanisms, policy makers and stakeholders' strategies in price variations in international commodity markets.","[Blake, Daniella; Staver, Charles] CGIAR, Montpellier, France; [Dawson, Carolina; Loeillet, Denis] CIRAD, Montpellier, France",CGIAR; CIRAD,"Dawson, C (通讯作者)，CIRAD, UR GECO, Blvd Lironde,TA-B-PS4, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",carolina.dawson@cirad.fr,,,,,,,56,1,1,0,19,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Drawing on a concrete case in the Selous-Niassa Corridor in Southern Tanzania, we show how a frontier emerged in the form of community-based conservation. Decades of consecutive and continuous territorialization projects, based on mapping and boundary making, have ensured that conservation is beyond questioning, despite failures in the processes of demarcating, controlling, and managing this large-scale socio-spatial intervention. Although these failures produce territorial conflicts and confusions on the ground, we argue that in the context of a conservation frontier the gap between the envisioned ideal and the messy reality is used to legitimize continuous conservation interventions that rely on technical expertise rather than political dialog. While such top-down territorialization by community-based conservation inevitably remains partial and contingent, this is nonetheless a powerful and resilient project that gradually transforms communal landscapes into conservation territories with little room for public debate.

Abnormal operating performance for the entire sample was negative and statistically significant. After the event the operating performance did not improve following new CEO appointments or re-appointments. Obtained results indicate that CEO appointments decrease the value of the company.

A literature review was prepared and as a result the following hypothesis was put: the bigger the banks from the countries where the banking sector is more concentrated and more competitive, the higher the banks' credit ratings. The analysis has been prepared by using ordered panel data models on banks' credit ratings with the use of quarterly data on a European banks' sample. Long-term issuer credit ratings given to banks by the three largest credit rating agencies (S&P, Fitch and Moody) were used as a dependent variable. Banks' notes are especially sensitive to the capital adequacy, the assets quality and the earnings factors. The concentration of the banking sector has got a significant impact on the notes proposed by Fitch and Moody's, but the direction of the impact has been varied. Fitch notes are positively correlated with concentration indicators. According to their opinion, bigger banks on more concentrated markets can receive the financial support from the government, because in the case of default problems will have an influence on the whole financial system. Fitch ratings also react negatively to a higher competition on the financial market. Moody's puts attention to insolvency problems of the financial market, and as a result its notes are negatively correlated with the concentration of the banking sector. A positive relationship between the competition and banks' credit ratings has been observed in the case of Moody's and S&P's.","[Chodnicka-Jaworska, Patrycja] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Chodnicka-Jaworska, P (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",pchodnicka@wz.uw.edu.pl,,"Chodnicka - Jaworska, Patrycja/0000-0001-7471-352X",,,,,23,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-76228-9; 978-3-319-76227-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,121,134,,10.1007/978-3-319-76228-9_12,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1UI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448435600012,0

The liberalization of the gold mining sector has given way to complex forms of regulation where non-state and illegal mining entrepreneurs compete in governing mining extraction. Taking the case of gold mining in Burkina Faso, this paper analyses the conditions and dynamics under which such complex regulation takes place. We draw on extensive ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Northern Burkina Faso, in particular the Burkinabe mining sector. We argue that enclave economies in the gold mining sector are co-produced by state and market regulation through a plurification of regulatory authority. This plurification is the effect of competition among different frontier entrepreneurs, who seek to broker regulatory authority in mining concession sites. We show that concession sites are not discrete extractive enclaves, but are better understood as indiscrete sites that are entangled in local politics and social relations. Rather than thinning social relations, as is often claimed, we observe that enclave economies thicken politics around concessionary regimes, where governmental bodies re-emerge as an arbitrating regulatory force. These findings problematize policy prescriptions to formalize the gold mining sector and draw attention to the role of the state in re/producing frontier entrepreneurs with unequal political rights to claiming concessions.

The purpose of advertisers' use of English language is to appeal to consumers, to attract their attention and to stimulate them to learn more about advertised products. The findings proceed in the following manner that English as symbolic value is affecting the purchase intention because the use of English language in advertising is to improve the image of the product that associated with sophisticated and cosmopolitan products. The paper's analysis has implications for advertising for middle class consumers in Indonesia.

The findings reveal that situational regulatory focus plays an important role in influencing investment choice. In particular, a congruent promotion-focused image and related message increases risk-taking behavior in terms of choice for stocks rather than fixed deposits, whereas the reverse is true for a congruent prevention-focused image and related message. However, this relationship depends on the amount of information available during the decision-making process, and regulatory focus has a stronger impact on investment choice under the condition without additional financial information.","[Ewe, Soo Yeong; Lee, Christina Kwai Choi; Yang, Chia Yen] Monash Univ Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia; [Gul, Ferdinand A.] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic, Australia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway; Deakin University,"Ewe, SY (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Business, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",sooyeong@gmail.com,"Lee, Christina Kwai Choi/JNR-3968-2023; Yang, Chia Yen/GSN-1153-2022; Ewe, Soo Yeong/A-4124-2014","Lee, Christina Kwai Choi/0000-0003-2380-4186; , Soo Yeong/0000-0002-2106-5861",,,,,37,14,14,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The sample encompasses six energy entities that are comprised of Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index (DJSI) constituent's list on September 19, 2016. The results highlight that stakeholders who hold power have a high score of salience, being followed by those who possess legitimacy and then by those who possess urgency. The obtained results suggest the need to continue to focus on the normative theory of the stakeholders.

The vulnerability of rail transit network becomes an important concern of researchers and rail managers. This paper proposes a station-based accessibility approach addressing passenger flow and land use characteristics in rail transit network vulnerability analysis. Land use variables are measured as the independency degree on rail transit. The reduction ratio of network accessibility before and after incidents is calculated to measure the potential consequences. Based on results of comparisons with existing methods with the help of an example problem, the proposed accessibility measure demonstrates better and more reasonable results as not only the rail network and passenger flow but also the land use and travel alternative variables interacting with rail transit are accounted. The proposed method is then applied to Shanghai metro network. The data for analysis include rail transit network data, passenger flow data, and land use data around stations. Results indicate that the vulnerability of rail transit network is jointly affected by its network topology, passenger flow, and land use variables. Unbalanced land use, high plot ratio, and the less travel alternatives will increase the dependency of land on rail transit travel, leading to high network vulnerability once disrupted. Results of this work will inform rail transit managers of the degree of network vulnerability and critical stations and links as well as the land use dependency on vulnerability. Findings of this study may have implications not only for the planning of other transit modes to enhance the resilience of public transit network in vulnerable areas but also for the land use development around rail stations.","[Jiang, Ruoyun; Lu, Qing-Chang; Peng, Zhong-Ren] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Dept Transportat & Logist, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Lu, QC (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Dept Transportat & Logist, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",jiangruoyun@sjtu.edu.cn; qclu@sjtu.edu.cn; zrpeng@sjtu.edu.cn,"Peng, Zhong-Ren/X-4342-2019; Peng, Zhongren/AAH-8123-2020","Peng, Zhongren/0000-0003-3648-6770",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51408356],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51408356).

However, research on consumer perceptions of pollinator friendly traits is limited. Understanding consumer perceptions is important because they impact behavior and product selection. In turn, this affects the effectiveness of relevant policies and pollinator insects' access to beneficial plants. This manuscript quantifies consumers' perceptions of plant traits that aid pollinators. U.S. consumers (n=1,243) were surveyed to identify their perceptions of pollinator friendly traits. Binary logit models and marginal effects were estimated using 22 plant traits and consumers' purchasing interest, existing knowledge, and demographic variables. Results imply consumers interested in purchasing pollinator friendly plants selected positive traits regardless of accuracy. Furthermore, consumers selected traits that aligned with their knowledge. Older participants had more accurate perceptions of pollinator friendly traits. Results highlight the challenges facing regulatory efforts geared towards promoting pollinator friendly products/practices.","[Khachatryan, Hayk; Rihn, Alicia] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Mid Florida Res & Educ Ctr, 2725 S Binion Rd, Apopka, FL 32703 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Khachatryan, H (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Mid Florida Res & Educ Ctr, 2725 S Binion Rd, Apopka, FL 32703 USA.",hayk@ufl.edu,"Khachatryan, Hayk/GLQ-6541-2022","Khachatryan, Hayk/0000-0003-2387-3624; Rihn, Alicia/0000-0001-6941-8673",,,,,37,6,6,0,13,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Though the method is quite old and has met criticism, it is still reasonable to use it because it enables the decomposition of unemployment into the structural and cyclical component at various levels, limited only by data availability. Also, it is highly suitable for the analysis of data retrieved from the EU-wide Labour Force Survey (LFS). Calculating the flow rates and equilibrium unemployment levels for particular rural population groups selected by defined characteristics, assessing how they evolve over time, and comparing the results between different population groups (e.g. urban dwellers) can be a basis for drawing conclusions on the determinants of changes in economic activity and on the structural or cyclical nature of unemployment. This information is essential for a proper selection of measures taken to counteract adverse developments in the labour market, and enables a more efficient search for solutions designed to improve the population's occupational and economic status. The possible uses of that method are illustrated by the example of the Polish rural population and by calculations based on 2016 data.","[Kolodziejczak, Wlodzimierz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Kolodziejczak, W (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland.",,"Kołodziejczak, Włodzimierz/ABE-9463-2020","Kołodziejczak, Włodzimierz/0000-0001-7315-6717",National Science Centre within the MINIATURA research project Determinants of Economic Activity of the Rural Population in Poland.

The study is based on the BACH-ESD database provided by the European Commission and includes 11 EU countries during the period 2000-2014. The results of the panel data models estimated for different countries and for three debt measures indicate that the impact of direct determinants of debt varies considerably across countries and depending on debt maturity. The differences occur in terms of both significance and direction. The research findings confirm the prevalence of the industry effect over the size effect in the capital structure, although the difference between the relative importance of the two effects varies across countries.

On this basis, we calculate a rate of implicit rentability of this global capital in order to test the validity of what Piketty presents as a fundamental unbalance, comparing in the long term the rate of return of capital and the growth rate of income. Piketty's economic law, linking the coefficient of capital to the ratio savings rate - growth rate, is then examined (part 2). The results previously obtanined are confronted to new estimations on the subperiod 1978-2012, corresponding to what many authors call a capitalism a la Chinese (part 3).

While e-commerce has changed the structure of rural economic development, the rapid development of rural tourism has also aroused people's concern. This article analyzes the development of Taobao Village and rural tourism and finds that the development of rural tourism is relatively balanced. The development of Taobao Village is highly spatially autocorrelated, which means that the development of Taobao Village will be affected more by the surrounding Taobao Villages.

Moreover, although one often regards perceptions as preconditions for adaptation, some direct and underlying factors may influence perceptions and adaptations in opposite ways. To assess determinants of perceived directions of climate change and adaptations by farmers, the paper formulates ordered response and multinomial choice models accounting for the location and neighbourhood effects. Relative to a survey of rural households in the Ethiopian Nile basin, perceptions of long-term climate trends are found to substantially vary across regions, altitudes, distances from markets, and neighbourhood characteristics, with climate reference scales being themselves non-uniform across respondents. The inclusion of proxies for local spatial dependence and clustering in multinomial logit regressions on adaptation decisions provides further insights, relative to individual- and farm-specific features. Adaptation measures turn out to be largely independent from degree of awareness of negative trends in climate changes. This highlights the importance of adaptive strategies coordinated at regional and national scale, such as preventive measures of control of pest damage risk due to increasing temperatures, and specific interventions for semi-arid agro-climatic zones.","[Mainardi, Stefano] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Appl Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Mainardi, S (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Appl Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",stemaind@gmail.com,,"Mainardi, Stefano/0000-0002-4684-9857",Czech Science Foundation [GA15-23177S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The author wishes to thank two referees for insightful comments, S.

The concept of CSR in sharia banking should emphasize the awareness of individuals who understand their duty to fellow and universe in the company so that the purpose of togetherness which is based on servitude to Allah SWT can be achieved. This awareness is the spiritual element or the deepest sense in man that comes from Allah SWT. Therefore, the concept of CSR should also contain the underlying spiritual element of humanity so that it no longer only meets the Triple Bottom Line but seeks to meet the Pentuple Bottom Line (God, Prophet, Profit, People and Planet). Using perspective of Ihsan as a methodology in Islamic CSR because CSR in Islamic Banks uses funds derived from Zakat, Infaq, Shodaqah and Social funds (fines, conventional bank interest, other social funds) all of which are the Fund of Virtue (Qardhul Hasan) in accordance with the provisions of PSAK no 101 paragraph 75 year 2015 and Fatwa DSN No. 19/DSN-MUI/IV/2001 as a source of financing CSR activities.

We meta-analyze the literature on the wage impacts of teachers unions to try to draw out general findings, the importance of empirical model specification, and samples. A key finding of this study is that the average wage impact estimated by the included papers is modest, around 2%-4.5%. Our findings also suggest that the quality of an empirical strategy significantly affects the size of the estimated impact. We find that teachers union wage impacts have varied over time. The largest impacts appear to be following the rapid expansion of teacher unionism in the 1970s. Finally, we gain new insight into the goals of teachers unions by using the increased statistical power of meta-analytic techniques to show that unions increase the wages of new teachers and not just senior teachers.

It argues that the latter part of Jokowi's first term has seen a downturn in the quality of Indonesian democracy, associated with the continued mainstreaming and legitimation of a conservative and anti-pluralistic brand of political Islam; the partisan manipulation of key institutions of state; and the increasingly open repression and disempowerment of political opposition. These trends have served to unbalance the democratic playing field, limit democratic choice, and reduce government accountability. This article first discusses the medium-term ramifications of the polarised 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election and their implications for 2018's marquee political events: a major round of sub-national elections and the presidential nomination process. It then argues that the Jokowi government has taken an authoritarian turn' ahead of the 2019 elections, highlighting its manipulation of powerful law enforcement and security institutions for narrow, partisan purposes, as well as the administration's concerted efforts to undermine and repress democratic opposition. Finally, it frames the 2019 election as a contest between two candidatesJokowi and Prabowo Subianto-who display little regard for the democratic status quo. The declining quality of Indonesian democracy is particularly troubling in a global context of democratic recession.","[Power, Thomas P.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Power, TP (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,"Power, Thomas/0000-0002-6858-2807",,,,,40,93,95,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Subsequently, based on this classification, we review some of the most prominent approaches for measuring political risk, including the political risk assessment frameworks by ICRG, PRS, BERI, and AON. Based on our findings, we then consider criteria which can be used to select an appropriate measure of political risk depending on the scope and objectives of the risk analyst.","[Psychogyios, Ioannis] OTE Grp Co, Athens, Greece; [Koutsoukis, Nikitas-Spiros] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Corinth, Greece",University of Peloponnese,"Koutsoukis, NS (通讯作者)，Univ Peloponnese, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Corinth, Greece.",ipsychogios@cosmote.gr; nkoutsou@uop.gr,"Koutsoukis, Nikitas-Spiros/O-6169-2014","Koutsoukis, Nikitas-Spiros/0000-0002-7347-7868",,,,,45,2,2,3,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-93452-5; 978-3-319-93451-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,17,31,,10.1007/978-3-319-93452-5_2,0.0,,,15,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BQ4NA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000591182600002,0

This co-movement in equity markets which is evidenced higher during the turmoil period influences economic fundamentals of a country dissimilar in nature. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether economic fundamentals or investors' behavior attributable to disturbances across the world are the rationale behind the crisis transmission, and thereby distinguish fundamental-based contagion from investor-induced contagion. Design/methodology/approach - Initially, the study investigates the role of macroeconomic fundamentals and stock returns on crisis occurrence using panel probit estimates. Additionally, ordinary least squares estimates controlling the influence of fundamentals on domestic return capture the discrete country effect measuring the influence of domestic as well as foreign economic fundamentals along with foreign returns on the domestic stock index. Findings - The empirical results reveal that foreign country stock index returns are having a significant influence on domestic returns besides a prominent role in crisis occurrence. The binary probit model confirmed the influence of both macroeconomic factors and foreign returns in crisis occurrence. The OLS estimates found evidence for investor-induced contagion in the crisis period where the effects of economic fundamentals are small in comparison to foreign market returns that are mainly dominant in pre- and post-crisis period. Research limitations/implications - The propagation of crisis from one market to other would enable the policy makers to make clear regulations at right time to control for the crisis in future. The results can help the policy makers as well as investors in reducing the impact of the crisis in future by clearly monitoring the behavior of the factors under study. Originality/value - The current study addresses the role of macro fundamentals and investors influence in crisis propagation. Adopting subprime crisis of 2008-2009 as a reference point and separating the sample period into pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis period, the study explains how badly the other 30 markets impacted the crisis that emerged in the USA.","[Rajan, Sruthi; Santhakumar, Shijin] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Commerce, Pondicherry, India",Pondicherry University,"Rajan, S (通讯作者)，Pondicherry Univ, Dept Commerce, Pondicherry, India.",sruthi.nellikkathara@gmail.com,"Santhakumar, Shijin/IQW-8898-2023","Santhakumar, Shijin/0000-0002-1485-1266; Rajan, Sruthi/0000-0002-7019-3632",,,,,81,4,4,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The research covered a total of 405 Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE)-listed companies which were not financial institutions. The study group, i.e. the group of serial acquirers, comprised 93 companies which in the study period undertook four or more acquisitions. They accounted for 76% of the total number of transactions. The control group was made up of the remaining companies. The financial results of these two groups of companies were observed for the years 2002-2015. Rates of return on equity, return on assets, and capital market ratios, such as MV/BV and PE, were analysed for both groups, as were their asset growth rates and sales growth rates. The proposed hypotheses were tested by a two-sample t-test with unequal variances. The research conducted on the WSE shows that serial acquirers have a lower return on equity (ROE) and a lower return on total assets (ROA). The serial acquirers more quickly increase their assets and achieve a higher sales growth rate than the remaining companies. The capital market values their prospective achievable yield higher, thanks in part to their newly-acquired assets (MV/BV).","[Rutkowski, Andrzej] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Rutkowski, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.",arutkowski@wz.uw.edu.pl,"Rutkowski, Andrzej/AAV-4424-2021",,,,,,23,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-76228-9; 978-3-319-76227-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,211,218,,10.1007/978-3-319-76228-9_20,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448435600020,0

Perspectives of Bangladeshi Women,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RURAL CREDIT PROGRAMS; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; PHYSICAL VIOLENCE; GENDER; RISK; RESOURCES; MARRIAGE; AUTONOMY,"Studies addressing the relationship between women's empowerment and intimate partner violence (IPV) have yielded conflicting findings. Some suggest that women's economic and social empowerment is associated with an increased risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), arguably because men use often IPV to enforce their dominance and reassert inegalitarian gender norms when patriarchal norms are challenged; other studies suggest the converse. It is important to understand why these findings are contradictory to create a more sound basis for designing both women's empowerment interventions and anti-violence interventions. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between women's empowerment and IPV in a setting where gender roles are rapidly changing and IPV rates are high. We examine some of the ways in which the nature of women's empowerment evolved in six villages in rural Bangladesh during a 12-year period in which surveys have documented a decline of 11 points in the percentage of married women experiencing IPV in the prior year. The paper is.based on data from 74 life history narratives elicited from 2011 to 2013 with recently married Bangladeshi women from the six villages, whom other community residents identified as empowered. Our findings suggest that women's empowerment has evolved in several ways that may be contributing to reductions in IPV: in its magnitude (for example, many women are earning more income than they previously did), in women's perceived exit options from abusive marriages, in the propensity of community members to intervene when IPV occurs, and in the normative status of empowerment (it is less likely to be seen as transgressive of gender norms). The finding that community-level perceptions of empowered women can evolve over time may go a long way in explaining the discrepant results in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The comparative analysis of the neoclassical and behavioral theory of decision-making shows that the traditional neoclassical way of explaining pension decisions based on the theory of expected utility and the concept of homo economicus turns out to be too simplistic and inadequate.

Currently, the process of progressive corporate globalization can be observed in the Polish market. This phenomenon intensifies competition among hotels, in particular, on the part of significant rivals, namely global hotel concerns. Therefore hotels in their pursuit to increase their performance and competitiveness search for effective methods of organization and management. Among modern concepts of management, outsourcing deserves attention. Its growing significance among enterprises makes it an important management tool applied more and more often to non-productive business functions and processes of hotel enterprises. The aim of the paper is to present the type of tasks that are of key importance for the application of outsourcing in the modelling of business processes when creating the competitiveness of hotel enterprises operating during corporate globalization. The research shows that outsourcing can be used in many areas of hotel operations. As a result of the separation and delegation of specific tasks, an entity may focus on the execution of its core activities. The study indicates the benefits of building competitiveness through the implementation of the concept of outsourcing in the process of enterprise management. This increases the flexibility of operation from the perspective of corporate globalization.","[Sztorc, Malgorzata] Kielce Univ Technol, Dept Management & Mkt, Fac Management & Comp Modelling, Kielce, Poland",Kielce University of Technology,"Sztorc, M (通讯作者)，Kielce Univ Technol, Dept Management & Mkt, Fac Management & Comp Modelling, Kielce, Poland.",msztorc@tu.kielce.pl,"Sztorc, Małgorzata MSz/B-9121-2019; Sztorc, Małgorzata/M-5600-2019","Sztorc, Małgorzata MSz/0000-0003-0881-0844; Sztorc, Małgorzata/0000-0003-0881-0844",,,,,41,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-623-5,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,56.0,,,,,,287,292,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000491539600065,0

To address the endogeneity of the geographical distribution of the Hoa, we use an important historical episode: the rapid deterioration in Sino-Vietnamese diplomatic relationship that led many ethnic Chinese to flee abroad, particularly to the refugee camps in the Guangxi province of China, in 1979. We find that the effects of proximity to the refugee camps on the share of ethnic Chinese in 1989 were more pronounced for provinces that had a larger presence of the ethnic Chinese population in 1979. We also find strong correlations between the 1989 share of ethnic Chinese (instrumented) and contemporary indicators of economic performance. The results suggest that the ethnic Chinese minority had positive economic impacts on Vietnam's regional economies and that the post-Vietnam War exodus of ethnic Chinese was likely to have had long-term negative economic impacts.","[Tuan Anh Nguyen-Viet] Univ Southern Calif, Ctr Econ & Social Res, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Imai, Masami] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",University of Southern California; Wesleyan University,"Imai, M (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",mimai@wesleyan.edu,,,,,,,32,5,6,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

There is strong evidence that public support is not a very efficient public policy tool and ambiguous results were observed in the detailed view. The local government funding was statistically insignificant in case of the innovation input intensity measured by the log of R&D expenditures per employee and also in the case of innovation output intensity measured by sales from innovated goods and services. Central government funding led to a crowding-effect of public support in the market, but it was not present in manufacturing industry. The EU funding was the most successful economic policy tool although no additional effect of this funding was observed on the innovation output.

These services offer new examples of ICT support to business and form an important and fast-growing part of service market which, in turn, is a part of labour market. We claim that each market beside its demand and supply has its own organizer who sets, often informally, rules for its demand-supply game. These three market actors (people, institutions, firms, etc. made by people) are connected by formal and/or informal relations what can be pictured as a triangle, called the market triple. For each virtual service, in contrast to a typical service, the rules of the demand-supply game are strictly formalized and presented by the organizer as its application (computer program) which matches virtually, through an internet platform, the demand for a given service with the supply equalizing it. We show first that each virtual service beside its market has its own market triple and its own SW scheme, and next we study relationships between the last two. The SW scheme indicates who of the three actors does the matching. For instance, it is the supply side in the case of Uber, but the demand side in the case of Airbnb, while the organizer alone matches demand and supply on the Forex market. In conclusion, we demonstrate how our methodology can be used in debates on the impact of the Internet on a contemporary economy and service virtualization, in particular.","[Walukiewicz, Stanislaw] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Walukiewicz, S (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland.",s.walukiewicz@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,289,296,,,,,,8,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000029,0

Evidence from Emerging Markets,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,inward FDI; corruption; emerging markets; propensity score matching,JOINT VENTURE; DIRECT-INVESTMENT; CORRUPTION; PERFORMANCE; GROWTH; SUBSIDIARIES; DETERMINANTS; CHOICE; COSTS; FDI,"An extensive literature exists on the adverse effects of corruption on inward FDI and the impact this may have on economic development but the reverse causality has not been fully explored. Legislation in the US and the EU prohibits firms from engaging in corrupt practices in foreign countries and this suggests that foreign-owned firms might be less likely to pay bribes. However, such legislation may be ineffective because foreign firms have to adapt to local market conditions or risk being uncompetitive. Using firm level data for 41 emerging countries, a probit model estimates the probability that a firm pays bribes. To allow for possible endogeneity this probit analysis is repeated with an instrument to proxy for endogenous foreign ownership. Then, a propensity score matching technique tests for differences in the propensity to pay bribes by domestic and foreign firms. The paper finds no difference in the behavior of foreign owned and domestic firms with respect to corrupt practices. Results are robust to different levels of foreign ownership and support the view that foreign-owned firms adapt to local practices and are neither more nor less likely to pay bribes than comparable domestic firms. The paper finds that other variables including bureaucracy, government contracts, and perceived difficulties with civil society (legal and political) do have statistically significant effects on increasing bribery and that some others, such as per capita GDP, tend to reduce bribery. The study concludes that there is no evidence that foreign ownership, after investment has occurred, tends to reduce bribery but it does support the view that foreign owned firms adopt local behavioral norms.

Design/methodology/approach - The sample comprises 166 industrial products public-listed firms covering a time span from year 2003 to 2012. Using Baskin's framework, firm's SPV is related to dividend payout, controlling for earnings volatility, firm size, leverage and growth of assets. Further, the impact of the global financial crisis on the relationship between SPV and the tested variables is examined. Findings - Earning volatility significantly explains SPV of industrial product firms during the crisis period, while dividend payout ratio (PR) predominantly influences volatility during pre- and post-crisis sub-periods. The empirical results indicate that dividend policy is a strong predictor of SPV of industrial products firms in Malaysia, particularly during the post-crisis period. Originality/value - The paper explores the firm's SPV and dividend policy for a new set of data focussing on industrial products firms listed on the Malaysian Stock Exchange.","[Zainudin, Rozaimah; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz; Yet, Chee Hong] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Zainudin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",rozaimah@um.edu.my,"Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/GQO-8871-2022; ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/GQA-9048-2022; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/M-9161-2019; ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/B-9626-2010; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/B-9441-2010; zainudin, rozaimah/AAA-4984-2021","Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/0000-0003-4700-9654; ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/0000-0002-9929-8753; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/0000-0003-4700-9654; ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/0000-0002-9929-8753; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/0000-0003-4700-9654; zainudin, rozaimah/0000-0002-9929-8753",Malaysian Ministry of Education under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [FP025-2016],Malaysian Ministry of Education under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme,The authors would like to thank the Malaysian Ministry of Education under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme for providing the resources and facilities that assisted in the conduct of this study (Research Grant No: FP025-2016).,,70,20,24,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Therefore, this paper uses the data of 2017 in seven key poverty-stricken counties in southwestern Guizhou Province, using principal component analysis, cluster analysis and entropy method, to empirically analyze the relationship between the poverty level and financial development level in poverty counties. The empirical results show that the degree of poverty is related to financial development, that is, the higher the level of financial agglomeration, the lower the degree of poverty; the lower the level of financial agglomeration, the higher the degree of poverty. Therefore, a correct understanding of the role of financial agglomeration in poverty alleviation will help promote Guizhou Province to reduce poverty through financial reforms and provide an important reference for the formulation of relevant policies.","[Zhang, Hongmei; Zhang, Ning] Guizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Finance, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongmei; Zhang, Ning] Guizhou Inst Technol Innovat & Entrepreneurship I, Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongmei; Zhang, Ning] Guizhou Inst Urban Econ & Dev, Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, Peoples R China",Guizhou University of Finance & Economics; Guizhou Institute of Technology,"Zhang, HM (通讯作者)，Guizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Finance, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China.;Zhang, HM (通讯作者)，Guizhou Inst Technol Innovat & Entrepreneurship I, Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, Peoples R China.",zhm1035@qq.com; 809089169@qq.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-574-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,66.0,,,,,,528,533,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448284700083,0

Such homeownership bias' and its consequences for a wide range of economic outcomes have long been recognised in the economic literature. Although a removal of the homeownership bias is generally advocated on efficiency grounds, its distributional implications are often neglected, especially in a cross-country perspective. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by investigating the first-order effects, in terms of distribution of income and work incentives, of removing the income tax provisions favouring homeownership. We consider six European countries - Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK - that exhibit important variation in terms of income tax treatment of homeowners. Using the multi-country tax benefit model EUROMOD, we analyse the distributional consequences of including net imputed rent in the taxable income definition that applies in each country, together with the removal of existing special tax treatments of incomes or expenses related to the main residence; thus, we provide a measure of the homeownership bias. We implement three tax policy scenarios. In the first, imputed rent is included in the taxable income of homeowners, while at the same time existing mortgage interest tax relief schemes and taxation of cadastral incomes are abolished. In the two further revenue-neutral scenarios, the additional tax revenue raised through the taxation of imputed rent is redistributed to taxpayers, through either a tax rate reduction or a tax exemption increase. The results show how including net imputed rent in the tax base might affect inequality in each of the countries considered. Housing taxation appears to be a promising avenue for raising additional revenues, or lightening taxation of labour, with no inequality-increasing side effects.","[Figari, Francesco] Univ Insubria, Varese, Italy; [Figari, Francesco] ISER, Rome, Italy; [Figari, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, CeRP, Turin, Italy; [Figari, Francesco] Dondena, Turin, Italy; [Paulus, Alari; Sutherland, Holly] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Essex Jct, VT USA; [Tsakloglou, Panos] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Tsakloglou, Panos] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Verbist, Gerlinde] Univ Antwerp, Herman Deleeck Ctr Social Policy, Antwerp, Belgium; [Zantomio, Francesca] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy",University of Insubria; Collegio Carlo Alberto; Athens University of Economics & Business; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Antwerp; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Figari, F (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Varese, Italy.;Figari, F (通讯作者)，ISER, Rome, Italy.;Figari, F (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, CeRP, Turin, Italy.",francesco.figari@uninsubria.it; apaulus@essex.ac.uk; hollys@essex.ac.uk; tsaklog@aueb.gr; gerlinde.verbist@uantwerpen.be; francesca.zantomio@unive.it,"Tsakloglou, Panos/AAF-2099-2020; Verbist, Gerlinde/AAC-4935-2019; Paulus, Alari/AAC-2678-2020","Verbist, Gerlinde/0000-0001-9253-3477; FIGARI, FRANCESCO/0000-0003-0735-1076; Paulus, Alari/0000-0001-7921-0462","European Commission [6, 028412]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) [RES-518-28-001]; Joint Research Centre - European Commission [JRC/SVQ/2013/J.1/0008/NC]; ESRC [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Joint Research Centre - European Commission; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was carried out as part of the research project 'Accurate Income Measurement for the Assessment of Public Policies' (AIM-AP), funded by the European Commission Framework Programme 6 (Project no. 028412).

For instance, a 40% reduction from the mean of baseline risk results in an increase in MWTP by 70% or more. Thus, estimates of monetary benefits of public programs to reduce heart disease risk would be understated if the standard practice is followed of evaluating MWTP at initial risk levels and then multiplying this value by the number of cases avoided. Estimates are supported by: (1) unique quantitative information on perceptions of the risk of getting heart disease that allow baseline risk to be defined at an individual level and (2) improved econometric procedures to control for well-known difficulties associated with stated preference data.","[Gerking, Shelby] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Gerking, Shelby] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Adamowicz, Wiktor] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Dickie, Mark] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Econ, POB 1400, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Veronesi, Marcella] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Veronesi, Marcella] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Dev & Cooperat, Clausiusstr 37, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; University of Alberta; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; University of Verona; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Gerking, S (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.;Gerking, S (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",56f100pu@gmail.com,"Veronesi, Marcella/JAX-3674-2023","Veronesi, Marcella/0000-0001-5520-8093; Adamowicz, Wiktor/0000-0002-7634-2985","US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) [RD-3159201-0, RD-83326301-0]",US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) partially funded this research under RD-3159201-0 and RD-83326301-0.

The Political Determinants of Smallholder Land Titling,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,land titling; customary tenure; chiefs; Zambia; Senegal; Africa,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; INVESTMENT INCENTIVES; BURKINA-FASO; IMPACT; REGULARIZATION,"This article examines the effect of customary institutions on smallholder land titling in Sub-Saharan Africa. It argues that the individual's status within the customary institution conditions his or her demand for land titles. Individuals with greater customary privilege gain advantages from maintaining customary property rights, including stronger tenure security. For households with lower privilege within the customary institution, the benefits of adopting state land titles are higher. Analysis of an original survey of smallholder farmers in Senegal and an existing survey in Zambia demonstrates that households with greater customary privilege are less likely to adopt state land titles, independent of ethnicity, wealth, and land values. I find additional support for the argument in measures of increased tenure security for those with greater customary privilege. Qualitative interviews with customary authorities and smallholder farmers help establish the mechanism. These findings update the dominant wisdom that land values and material transaction costs drive smallholder land titling, demonstrating the important effect of status within the customary institution on demand for land titles. By examining the political underpinnings of customary property rights, this article contributes to our understandings of which farmers benefit most from land titling. This has implications for the improved design of land governance programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The diverging results in the literature suggest that we may indeed expect differences between the two levels. With the z-score as the measure of financial stability, our theoretical analysis confirms that we may find such differences. Yet our empirical analysis for the EU-25 during the 1998-2014 period finds no economically significant effect of concentration on either the bank-level or the country-level z-score. The finding that concentration hardly affects stability at both levels of analysis is an indication of robustness in the empirical concentration-stability relation not previously established in the literature. This finding further suggests that neither supervisory restructuring, nor normal market-driven mergers, are likely to be substantially harmful to financial stability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

If disclosure is costly, then a firm discloses high qualities but conceals low qualities in equilibrium. The higher the disclosure cost, the higher the equilibrium threshold below which firms conceal quality information.

This paper aims to examine the impact of intermediate input linkages on carbon leakage both theoretically and empirically. The theoretical part develops a Harberger-type model with an input-output linkage structure, identifies four leakage effects and derives closed-form solutions for these leakage effects. Its empirical part builds a computable general equilibrium model of China's economy and introduces structural decomposition analysis to link the theoretical and empirical models. When imposing a carbon price on the electricity generation sector, our results show significant sectoral carbon leakage. Our decomposition analysis further suggests that such leakage is mainly through the production substitution effect and the multiplier effect.

We make use of administrative data from both institutions over the period 2004-2013. While one institution relies on village associations for screening and monitoring of borrowers, the other institution uses the individual liability approach. We find that the likelihood to go into arrears is higher for the institution with a strictly individual lending technique, while the likelihood of going into arrears over 30 days is higher for the institution working with village associations. These results are robust to a variety of additional tests, including different definitions of arrears and subsamples. Our findings suggest that the institution using an individual lending technique provides certain flexibility to its clients, while the village-based microfinance institution might face more strategic default behavior. We provide evidence that once a borrower is in arrears, (s) he is more likely to stay in arrears for more than 30 days in branches with a higher share of borrowers in arrears and in the village-based lender. Our findings provide evidence that a village-or group-based lending technique is not necessarily superior to the individual lending technique in terms of loan performance.","[Beck, Thorsten] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England; [Beck, Thorsten] CEPR, London, England; [Behr, Patrick] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Brazilian Sch Publ & Business Adm, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",City University London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Behr, P (通讯作者)，Getulio Vargas Fdn, Brazilian Sch Publ & Business Adm, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",TBeck@city.ac.uk,"Beck, Thorsten/GRX-3987-2022",,European Fund for Southeast Europe,European Fund for Southeast Europe,Financial support by the European Fund for Southeast Europe is gratefully acknowledged.,,22,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Our study examines whether and how CTs go beyond welfare objectives to promote livelihoods. Presenting a cross-case analysis using original qualitative data on beneficiary perspectives from six African countries Kenya, Ethiopia, Malawi, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Ghana we explore CT livelihood impacts within household economies and social networks, paying attention to gender issues. We find that a small but predictable flow of cash improves strategic livelihood choices and stimulates productive investments, including through positive effects on beneficiary entry into risk-sharing arrangements and networks for economic collaboration. Levels of household vulnerability and labor constraint nevertheless significantly mediate the ability of CTs to consolidate livelihood outcomes. The varying availability of economic opportunities, plus effective program implementation, also shape livelihood impact. Incorporating beneficiary perspectives brings to the fore the multidimensionality of CT effects on experiences of poverty and deprivation, including gender dynamics and intangibles such as dignity and respect; they add powerful realism to the influence of the CT on both immediate survival and livelihood choices. Beyond this, they confirm wider knowledge on productive impact and bring nuance to the conditions under which, and mechanisms by which beneficiaries' use CTs to build productive capability and assets and to make strategic livelihood choices.

In contrast, when the firm has sufficient internal funds to meet its investment needs and outstanding debt is relatively safer, the overconfident CEO has no necessity to seek external funds and the overinvestment incentive persists.

Our findings are consistent with the statements of the theoretical literature and emphasize the importance of the role played by gender roles on demographic and economic developments.

This paper analyzes the indirect role of institutional investors in monitoring firm managers and in the process of shareholder wealth maximization. Institutional monitoring reduces the agency problem of free cash flow. Controlling for reverse causality, we find that increased institutional ownership results in lower leverage and dividend payout that consequently lead to greater cash holdings and firm value. The results are consistent with the free cash flow hypothesis and provide an alternative explanation for why firms hold so much cash and why debt and dividends have decreased during the last thirty years.","[Karpavicius, Sigitas] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Business Sch, Accounting & Finance, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Yu, Fan] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",University of Adelaide; Macquarie University,"Karpavicius, S (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Business Sch, Accounting & Finance, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",sigitas.karpavicius@adelaide.edu.au; fan.yu@mq.edu.au,,"Yu, Fan/0000-0003-4919-2333",,,,,70,6,6,2,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Contrary to expectation, odd lot investors are paying higher prices than round lot investors. The pricing difference be tween markets is affected by market returns, volatility and spreads. Our main hypothesis is that; once the assets traded in the odd lot market are more illiquid than their counterparts, the mispricing is driven by liquidity factors. Additionally, we show that the mispricing yields an at bitrage opportunity that is not being traded away in the Brazilian market. Therefore, we propose regulators to review the market design for odd lots in Brazil. We argue that reducing the minimal trading unit in the round lots market would benefit investors.","[Ramos, Henrique P.; Perlin, Marcelo S.; Righi, Marcelo B.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Sch Management, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Ramos, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Sch Management, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",henrique.ramos@ufrgs.br,"Righi, Marcelo/E-3756-2015; Ramos, Henrique/AAE-1690-2022","Righi, Marcelo/0000-0002-3753-0705; Pinto Ramos, Henrique/0000-0002-7998-7033",,,,,31,1,1,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

Using Swedish data, we find that the decision of adoptees to hold equities is associated with the behavior of both biological and adoptive parents, implying a role for both genetic and environmental influences. However, we find that nurture has a stronger influence on the share of financial assets invested in equities and on portfolio volatility, suggesting that financial risk-taking is substantially environmentally determined. The parental investment variables substantially increase the explanatory power of cross-sectional regressions and so may play an important role in understanding cross-sectional heterogeneity in investment behavior.","[Black, Sandra E.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Black, Sandra E.] NHH, Bergen, Norway; [Black, Sandra E.; Devereux, Paul J.; Lundborg, Petter; Majlesi, Kaveh] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Black, Sandra E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Devereux, Paul J.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Devereux, Paul J.] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Lundborg, Petter; Majlesi, Kaveh] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Lundborg, Petter; Majlesi, Kaveh] Knut Wicksell Ctr Financial Studies, Lund, Sweden",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); IZA Institute Labor Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research; University College Dublin; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Lund University,"Black, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Black, SE (通讯作者)，NHH, Bergen, Norway.;Black, SE (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Black, SE (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Devereux, Paul/0000-0003-0221-8241",,,,,44,29,34,4,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

According to self-determination theory, well-being is driven by the satisfaction of three basic psychological needs: autonomy, relatedness and competence. We assess if, and to what extent, trust and the values of obedience and respect influence Europeans' satisfaction of these needs, controlling for income and education. We find a positive and significant impact for generalized morality (high trust and respect, low obedience), which is robust to different checks for endogeneity, including instrumental variable regressions at country, regional and individual level. Results suggest that lack of trust, high obedience and low respect not only reduce the wealth of nations, but also constrain the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, thereby hindering the individuals' fulfilment of happiness.

Recent analyses revealed that this business model has not paid off for the vast majority of firms in this industry. Building on theories of learning and attention, and supported by empirical analyses of firms' ability to develop new products over two decades, this article finds evidence that initiating new product development projects targeting new-to-the-firm therapeutic markets within the same industry disrupts firms' product development projects in their existing markets. This effect is primarily driven by firms that ventured into therapeutic markets that were not highly related to their area of expertise, and firms that did not recruit top executives with experience in newly entered markets. These results help to explain the poor performance of biotechnology firms in getting new products to market.","[Ener, Hakan] IESE Business Sch, Ave Pearson 21, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Ener, H (通讯作者)，IESE Business Sch, Ave Pearson 21, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",hener@iese.edu,,,,,,,67,0,0,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

To tackle this question, we study how departments' characteristics affect the quantity and quality of academics' publications in economics in France, controlling for individual time-varying characteristics and individual fixed effects. Department characteristics have an explanatory power at least equal to a quarter of that of individual characteristics and possibly as high as theirs. The quantity and quality of an academic's publications in a field increase with the presence of other academics specialised in that field and with the share of the department's publications output in that field. In contrast, department size, proximity to other large departments, homogeneity in terms of publication performance, presence of colleagues with connections abroad, and composition in terms of positions and age matter for some publication measures but only if not controlling for individual fixed effects.

In particular, for a given coalition structure we study to what extent the sustainability of tax agreements is affected by the coalitions that have formed. In our setup, countries are symmetric, but coalitions can be of arbitrary size. We analyze sustainability by means of a repeated game setting employing simple trigger strategies and we allow a sub-coalition to deviate from the coalitional equilibrium. For a given form of punishment we rank the sustainability of different coalition structures. We show that sub-coalitions consisting of singleton regions have the largest incentives to deviate and that the sustainability of cooperation depends on the degree of cooperative behavior ex-ante. Bilateral agreements between pairs of regions turn out to be the form of cooperation that is the easiest to sustain.","[Brangewitz, Sonja] Paderborn Univ, Dept Econ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Brochoff, Sarah] Univ Freiburg, Inst Publ Finance 2, Freiburg, Germany; [Brochoff, Sarah] Bielefeld Univ, Bielefeld Grad Sch Econ & Management, Bielefeld, Germany",University of Paderborn; University of Freiburg; University of Bielefeld,"Brangewitz, S (通讯作者)，Paderborn Univ, Dept Econ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",sonja.brangewitz@wiwi.upb.de; sarah.brockhoff@googlemail.com,,,International Research Training Group Economic Behavior and Interaction Models (EBIM) - German Research Foundation (DFG) [GRK 1134/2]; Franco-German University (DFH - UFA); German Research Foundation (DFG) within Collaborative Research Centre On-The-Fly Computing [SFB 901]; German Academic Exchange Service,International Research Training Group Economic Behavior and Interaction Models (EBIM) - German Research Foundation (DFG); Franco-German University (DFH - UFA); German Research Foundation (DFG) within Collaborative Research Centre On-The-Fly Computing; German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"We are grateful for intensive discussions with Claus-Jochen Haake, Jun-Ichi Itaya, Wolfgang Eggert, and Christoph Braun.

Impulse responses from a panel VAR estimation are used to compare the response of investment to changes in cash flow and the marginal product of capital among plants with different size and ownership status. The analysis reveals that cash flow has greater effect on investment among small plants, whereas the effect of the marginal product of capital is greater among large plants. This indicates that small plants are more financially constrained than large plants even though they have significantly higher marginal product of capital. Comparison between public and private firms is less conclusive, showing that size rather than ownership is strongly associated with financial constraints in Ethiopia. The results indicate that financial market imperfections could undermine industrial performance in Africa by limiting the growth of small firms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we study how this change in the law affected equilibrium mortgage lending. Using unique mortgage loan-level application data and a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the qualification criterion, we find that the law change led to a decline in equilibrium loan sizes of about 1 to 2 percent. There exists some evidence that mortgage approval rates also decreased for the affected loan applications. These results suggest that making the deficiency judgment law more default friendly in Nevada generated material cost on borrowers at the time of mortgage origination. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The intellectual capital performance of banks is measured through the value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC) methodology. The intellectual capital performance of the Turkish banking sector is generally affected by human capital efficiency (HCE). In terms of bank types, development and investment banks have the highest average VAIC. When VAIC is divided into its components, it can be observed that capital employed efficiency (CEE) and human capital efficiency (HCE) positively affect the financial performance of banks. However, CEE has more influence on the financial performance of banks compared to HCE.

Our model takes into account both effects of long-term macroeconomic factors and short-term structural breaks on oil volatility. The in-sample and out-of-sample results show that macroeconomic fundamentals can provide useful information regarding future oil volatility beyond the historical volatility. We also find the evidence that the structural breaks cause higher degree of GARCH-implied volatility persistence. Two-regime GARCH-MIDAS models can significantly beat their single-regime counterparts in forecasting oil volatility out-of-sample.,"[Pan, Zhiyuan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Chinese Financial Studies, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Pan, Zhiyuan] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Financial Secur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yudong] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, 200 Xiaolingwei St, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Chongfeng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yin, Libo] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Nanjing University of Science & Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, YD (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, 200 Xiaolingwei St, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wangyudongnj@126.com,"Yin, Libo/Q-7525-2017; Yin, Libo/AAJ-1976-2021","Yin, Libo/0000-0003-0193-6735; Wang, Yudong/0000-0002-0156-1294; Pan, Zhiyuan/0000-0001-6035-1070","National Science Foundation of China [71501095, 71320107002, 71601161, 71671193]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China through grant numbers 71501095 (Yudong Wang), 71320107002 (Chongfeng Wu), 71601161 (Zhiyuan Pan) and 71671193 (Libo Yin).

Financial development boosts innovation by improving resource allocation and investment in strategic sectors as well as facilitating technology to promote growth. Using binary response models and instrumental variable techniques to correct for endogeneity, we find robust but puzzling results. Contrary to most of the existing literature, financial development has a negative effect on the probability of a firm to innovate in developing countries. This effect is conditional on firm size, and only larger firms benefit from financial development. These results are robust to different measures of financial development and econometric specifications. We argue that this is a result of the design of the financial system in regard to the lack of capital and institutional system. Consequently, developing countries should first generate appropriate institutional conditions if they want financial development to spur growth through innovation.","[Aristizabal-Ramirez, Maria] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Camila Botero-Franco, Maria] Bancolombia, Medellin, Colombia; [Canavire-Bacarreza, Gustavo] Univ EAFIT, Sch Econ & Finance, Medellin, Colombia",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Universidad EAFIT,"Canavire-Bacarreza, G (通讯作者)，Univ EAFIT, Sch Econ & Finance, Medellin, Colombia.",gcanavir@eafit.edu.co,"Canavire-Bacarreza, Gustavo/AAJ-4856-2020",,,,,,37,16,17,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The soum-level analysis reveals the marginal effect of precipitation has a positive effect on livestock/ha up to 26 mm/mo and thereafter a harmful effect. The marginal effect of warming on livestock/ha is not significant until annual temperatures exceed 0.4 degrees C whereupon warming is strictly harmful. The household-level analysis suggests warming will decrease earnings per animal while overall earnings per household increases with a small change in climate but declines with larger changes. However, the household data also suggests warming would increase the total value of livestock.

In order to extend the policy's scope beyond point-of-use emissions, regulators assign each potential fuel an emission intensity rating for use in calculating compliance. I show that welfare-maximizing ratings do not generally coincide with the best estimates of actual emissions. In fact, the regulator can achieve a higher level of welfare by properly selecting the emission ratings than possible by selecting only the level of the standard. Moreover, a fuel's optimal rating can actually decrease when its estimated emission intensity increases. Numerical simulations of the California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard suggest that when recent scientific information increased the estimated emissions from conventional ethanol, regulators should have lowered ethanol's rating (making it appear less emission-intensive) so that the fuel market would clear with a lower quantity.","[Lemoine, Derek] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, McClelland Hall 401,1130 Helen St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Lemoine, D (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, McClelland Hall 401,1130 Helen St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",dlemoine@email.arizona.edu,,"Lemoine, Derek/0000-0002-1298-9472",,,,,34,6,6,3,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This happens when the recipient government decreases domestic revenue, decreases net borrowing, or when aid bypasses the budget. This study makes three contributions to both fungibility and fiscal response literature. First, fungibility at the aggregate level is re-examined on a larger recent panel 1980-2012, distinguishing between short- and long-term impact of aid. The results indicate that aid is partly fungible in the long run and highly fungible in the short run. Second, to account for aid bypassing the budget, technical cooperation is used as a proxy for off-budget aid. Off-budget aid is found to be non-fungible and on-budget aid is partly fungible. Third, fungibility of bilateral and multilateral aid is analyzed: the results indicate lower fungibility of multilateral aid.","[Marc, Lukasz] Overseas Dev Inst Res & Policy Dev RAPID, 203 Blackfriars Rd, London SE1 8NJ, England; [Marc, Lukasz] Vistula Univ, Fac Business & Int Relat, 3 Stoklosy Str, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland",Vistula University,"Marc, L (通讯作者)，Overseas Dev Inst Res & Policy Dev RAPID, 203 Blackfriars Rd, London SE1 8NJ, England.",l.marc@odi.org,,,,,,,91,9,10,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Following a structural and multilevel empirical approach, we test whether both sets of variables explain the variation of individual wages, self-employed earnings, and the propensity of being in independent work. The results indicate that while most of the variation in these three outcomes is explained by individuals' traits, place-related variables account for a non-negligible share of spatial variation. Second, as suggested by occupational choice theories, the propensity of being in self-employment positively correlates with larger expected earning differentials, but only in the case of employers. This, along with other results, suggests that while employers seem to choose their occupational status, own accounts in Chile seem to respond to factors pushing them into self-employment.","[Modrego, Felix] Univ Catolica Norte, Inst Reg Appl Econ Res IDEAR, Antofagasta, Chile; [Paredes, Dusan] Univ Catolica Norte, IDEAR Dept Econ, Antofagasta, Chile; [Romani, Gianni] Univ Catolica Norte, Entrepreneurship & SME Ctr, Antofagasta, Chile; [Romani, Gianni] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Adm, Antofagasta, Chile",Universidad Catolica del Norte; Universidad Catolica del Norte; Universidad Catolica del Norte; Universidad Catolica del Norte,"Modrego, F (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Norte, Inst Reg Appl Econ Res IDEAR, Antofagasta, Chile.",fmodrego@ucn.cl,"Romaní, Gianni/ABE-6855-2020; Paredes, Dusan/G-9432-2012","Paredes, Dusan/0000-0002-7090-5919; MODREGO BENITO, Felix Antonio/0000-0002-7428-0039",National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT) [FONDECYT 1130356],National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT),"The authors want to thank SBEJ Associate Editor, Dr. Michael Fritsch, two anonymous reviewers, Miguel Atienza, and participants at the PRSCO conference 2015 for their helpful comments and suggestions.

We exploit a unique dataset containing data on 29,266 guarantee backed loans under the UK SFLG scheme over the period 2000 to 2005. Results suggest that lower spreads are offered for loans of larger amounts and higher durations, for service firms, for larger firms, and for those located in the most advanced regions. Higher spreads are applied to high-tech manufacturing firms and to loans issued for working capital purposes. We also find that the presence of other extant debt is associated with a relatively higher spread and that this effect is especially significant for the subset of firms that have reached a maximum debt capacity based on collateralized assets. Further, we also find that the higher the incidence of the publicly guaranteed debt over the total amount of outstanding loans, the lower, on average, the spread. However, an increase in the guaranteed coverage leads to a contraction in the spread only for loans aimed at covering working capital needs rather than investments.","[Ughetto, Elisa; Scellato, Giuseppe] Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Ughetto, Elisa; Scellato, Giuseppe] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, I-10024 Moncalieri, Italy; [Cowling, Marc] Univ Brighton, Brighton Business Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Polytechnic University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Brighton,"Ughetto, E (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",elisa.ughetto@polito.it; giuseppe.scellato@polito.it; m.cowling2@brighton.ac.uk,"Ughetto, Elisa/C-9313-2018","Cowling, Marc/0000-0001-5731-8712",,,,,40,27,27,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Land control grabs are not only having consequences for local communities and ecosystems, but also for regional economies. The present study compares the value chains of smallholder products with those of sugar and palm oil. Primary data were collected from agricultural producers and their backward and forward sectors in the agricultural regions where the plantations are most prominent. The results show that on a regional level, sugar and palm oil generate fewer jobs in comparison to the products of small-scale agriculture, which have important forward linkages to small and medium trading and processing sectors. In addition, the wealth created by small-scale farming remains within the regions, whereas profits from the sugar and palm oil industries are being transferred out of them. Therefore, to achieve inclusive regional development, smallholder agriculture should be strengthened rather than promoting monoculture expansion.","[Duerr, Jochen] Univ Kassel, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Dept Dev Econ Migrat & Agr Policies, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Dürr, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Dept Dev Econ Migrat & Agr Policies, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany.",jochenduerr@gmx.de,,,,,,,31,15,17,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We define them as corridors established between a gateway port, where goods are imported, and urban areas, where the final distributors are located. The efficient management of the flow of goods operated on these corridors requires a structured territory and organized actors. Decentralized decisions of actors and interactions between them make it possible to provide consistent logistic services despite the numerous system constraints (legal, environmental, economical, ... ). Our goal is to reproduce the behavior of logistic systems through simulation. Our approach consists of describing the dynamics of such a system at a micro level. Therefore, we first enumerate the local properties, constraints and behaviors of each main actor and the infrastructures of this territory in order to extract the essential elements' that will be part of the theoretical model. A major aspect of the model is the description of the interface between maritime dynamics (schedule on a day-basis) and metropolitan dynamics (scheduled on an hour basis). This interface is self-organized: macro characteristics emerge from local properties and rules. It is revealing of a complex system, working on different scales, that we model with agents and dynamic graphs. Each actor and infrastructure is represented with agents. The transportation network is a multi-modal dynamic graph that makes possible to model the traffic and topology evolution. This approach enables users, like public authorities, to modify local parameters and observe their effects at the macro level. Thus users can identify levers to control the whole system. We execute some simulations with data on the Seine axis to confront our results with a real case study. We provide some measures (e.g. number of vehicles and quantity of goods) to show that the simulation reproduces the atomization process of logistic flows. We propose a spatial analysis of the goods traffic within the transportation network and compare the effects of two replenishment strategies on the stock shortages.","[Demare, Thibaut; Bertelle, Cyrille; Dutot, Antoine; Leveque, Laurent] Normandie Univ, Caen, France; [Demare, Thibaut; Bertelle, Cyrille; Dutot, Antoine] ULH, LITIS, F-76600 Le Havre, France; [Leveque, Laurent] ULH, IDEES Le Havre, F-76600 Le Havre, France",Universite Le Havre Normandie; Universite Le Havre Normandie,"Démare, T (通讯作者)，Normandie Univ, Caen, France.;Démare, T (通讯作者)，ULH, LITIS, F-76600 Le Havre, France.",thibaut.demare@univ-lehavre.fr,"Bertelle, Cyrille/B-9848-2012","Bertelle, Cyrille/0000-0002-5484-161X; Demare, Thibaut/0000-0002-9422-7702",Region Haute-Normandie; European Union; ERDF; CLASS Project for the interface modelling of port logistics and metropolitan logistics; Urban Area of Le Havre (CODAH),Region Haute-Normandie(Region Normandie); European Union(European Union (EU)); ERDF(European Union (EU)); CLASS Project for the interface modelling of port logistics and metropolitan logistics; Urban Area of Le Havre (CODAH),"This work and its authors have received supports from Region Haute-Normandie and the European Union based on various projects: ERDF RISC and XTERM projects for complex systems and complex networks development, ERDF Passage Portuaire for Port Logistics Analysis, CLASS Project for the interface modelling of port logistics and metropolitan logistics.

Political parties face a trade off in choosing the mix of high- and low-quality candidates: high-quality candidates are valuable to voters, and thus help to win elections, but they crowd out loyal candidates, who are most preferred by the parties. Under proportional representation, politicians' selection depends on the share of swing voters in the entire electorate. In majoritarian elections, it depends also on the distribution of competitive versus safe (single-member) districts. We show that a majoritarian system with only a few competitive districts is less capable of selecting good politicians than a proportional system. As the share of competitive districts increases, the majoritarian system becomes more efficient than the proportional system. However, for a large enough share of competitive districts, a non-monotonic relation arises: the marginal (positive) effect of adding high-quality politicians on the probability of winning the election is reduced, and highly competitive majoritarian systems become less efficient than proportional ones in selecting good politicians.","[Galasso, Vincenzo] Bocconi Univ, Dept Publ Policy, Dondena, IGIER, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Galasso, Vincenzo; Nannicini, Tommaso] Bocconi Univ, CEPR, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Nannicini, Tommaso] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, IZA, IGIER, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Galasso, V (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Publ Policy, Dondena, IGIER, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.;Galasso, V (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, CEPR, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",vincenzo.galasso@unibocconi.it; tommaso.nannicini@unibocconi.it,"Galasso, Vincenzo/AFP-4222-2022","Galasso, Vincenzo/0000-0002-3882-0587; NANNICINI, TOMMASO/0000-0002-9400-7494",,,,,27,23,25,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2017,171.0,3-4,,,,,257,281,,10.1007/s11127-017-0436-x,0.0,,,25,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,ET4FQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400235100002,0

This paper investigates the effects of fiscal consolidation on trading partners' growth through trade linkages. Using a measure of exogenous fiscal shocks in export markets, fiscal consolidation spillovers are found to slow down domestic growth and decrease employment. To the extent that fiscal consolidations are synchronised, fiscal policies have large spillover effects on output. Spillovers of fiscal consolidations on growth are found to be initially larger between countries belonging to currency unions, though this larger impact vanishes over the medium term. Larger spillovers of fiscal consolidation coincide with lower bilateral exports, higher bilateral imports and relative increases in unit labour costs in currency unions. Spillovers of fiscal consolidation are also found to be more detrimental to domestic growth during economic downturns in export markets.","[Goujard, Antoine] OECD Econ Dept, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Goujard, A (通讯作者)，OECD Econ Dept, Paris, France.",antoine.goujard@gmail.com,,,,,,,61,6,6,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Using an original fine-grained data set of tax reforms, the paper finds support for the role of these two sources of variation. In particular, the probability of reform is higher during banking crises. During electoral periods, increasing taxes becomes highly unlikely, even if the government is facing financing problems. Interestingly, politics seem to trump economics: banking crises do not affect the probability of having a reform during electoral times.

BAs under a carbon tax are taxes on imports and rebates on exports, based on the emissions from the production of a good. They are thought to be a method of reducing inefficiencies from a unilateral carbon price, such as shifts in the location of production, known as leakage. After examining the basic economics of BAs, we examine three design issues: which goods BAs should apply to, which emissions from the production of those goods should be taxed, and from and to which countries BAs should apply. We conclude that BAs will impose high administrative costs and need stronger welfare justifications.","[Kortum, Samuel] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Weisbach, David] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Weisbach, David] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Argonne Natl Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Yale University; University of Chicago; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; University of Chicago,"Kortum, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",samuel.kortum@yale.edu; d-weisbach@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,49,0,0,1,27,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

In particular, we describe and address concerns that have been raised about this method, including missing variable bias, irrigation, prices, and carbon fertilization. We review cross-sectional studies of estimated climate impacts on agriculture around the world. These studies suggest that both temperature and precipitation have modest effects on farmland value and net revenue. The studies also suggest that marginal warming will likely be harmful in low latitudes but beneficial in higher latitudes and that marginal increases in rainfall will be beneficial in semiarid locations but harmful in very wet places. The impacts differ for rain-fed versus irrigated farms and for crops versus livestock. The results imply that global warming will likely have only modest impacts on global food production for the next century since the harm from higher temperatures will likely be offset by the benefits of carbon fertilization and adaptations by farmers.","[Mendelsohn, Robert O.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, FES, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Massetti, Emanuele] Georgia Inst Technol, CESIfo, CMCC, 685 Cherry St NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Massetti, Emanuele] Georgia Inst Technol, FEEM, Sch Publ Policy, 685 Cherry St NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Yale University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Mendelsohn, RO (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, FES, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",robert.mendelsohn@yale.edu; emanuele.massetti@pubpolicy.gatech.edu,"Mendelsohn, Robert/GZA-9112-2022",,,,,,61,64,71,5,54,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

This paper investigates whether social learning and, in particular, the development of earthquake-mitigating technologies reduces earthquake-induced fatalities. Combining patent data with a global cross-section of 894 earthquakes that occurred between 1980 and 2010, we find that countries with more disaster-mitigating innovations and more earthquake exposure in the past suffer fewer fatalities. This study is the first to empirically examine the role of technological change and social learning in disaster mitigation. It sheds light on knowledge as a key element of adaptive capacity, and suggests the importance of incorporating technology development into a long-term hazard mitigation and adaptation policy.

Since the individual functions as a totality of his or her single characteristics (involving the interplay of biological, psychosocial, and context-related levels), a person-oriented approach focusing on intraindividual dynamics seems to be particularly fruitful to infer realistic implications for practice such as entrepreneurship education and promotion. Applying a person-oriented perspective, this paper integrates existing psychological approaches to entrepreneurship and presents a new, person-oriented model of entrepreneurship, the Entrepreneurial Personality System (EPS). In the empirical part, this model guided us to bridge two separate research streams dealing with entrepreneurial personality: research on broad traits like the Big Five and research on specific traits like risk-taking, self-efficacy, and internal locus of control. We examine a gravity effect of broad traits, as assumed in the EPS framework, by analyzing large personality data sets from three countries. The results reveal a consistent gravity effect of an intraindividual entrepreneurial Big Five profile on the more malleable psychological factors. Implications for entrepreneurship research and practice are discussed.","[Obschonka, Martin] Saarland Univ, Dept Psychol, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany; [Obschonka, Martin] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Ctr Appl Dev Sci, Semmelweisstr 12, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Stuetzer, Michael] Baden Wuerttemberg Cooperat State Univ, Coblitzallee 1-9, D-68193 Mannheim, Germany; [Stuetzer, Michael] Ilmenau Univ Technol, Fac Econ Sci & Media, Ehrenbergstr 29, D-98684 Ilmenau, Germany",Saarland University; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Mannheim; Technische Universitat Ilmenau,"Obschonka, M (通讯作者)，Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Ctr Appl Dev Sci, Semmelweisstr 12, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",martin.obschonka@uni-saarland.de,,"Obschonka, Martin/0000-0002-0853-7166; Stuetzer, Michael/0000-0001-9375-8125",,,,,97,108,112,4,95,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In particular, the tree-based model is used to preliminarily select the traits which have a statistical effect on mode choice, and the logit-based model is used to provide deeper understanding of the underlying decision processes and the correlation effects of the variables. Results show that car ownership, poor walking/cycling environment, and adults' convenience for escorting students significantly stimulate the use of cars in school commuting. Students are more inclined to choose cars when their departure time is at rush hour compared to the other time. Moreover, the longer distance encourages the use of motorized transport, where the households with local hukou (usually related to the car ownership and other welfares) are more willing to drive their children to school.

The advantages of the NARDL approach vis-a-vis earlier approaches is that it provides more efficient short-run and long-run coefficient estimates and allows through the distributed lag and the long-run dynamics a single common cointegrating vector. Both parts are allowed to be asymmetric. While previous studies have relied on models that ignored the time series properties of the variable and some have used the linear ARDL and obtained mixed results, the current paper uses the nonlinear auto-regressive distributed lag model (NARDL). We show that this is due to the assumption that the relationship is symmetric in nature. Results from long-run cointegration analysis, short-run analysis and half-lives, all provide evidence indicating that when depreciation is separated from appreciation, it is shown to have significant effects on the trade balance but in an asymmetric model.","[Arize, Augustine C.] Texas A&M Univ Commerce, Coll Business, Commerce, TX 75429 USA; [Malindretos, John] William Paterson Univ, Cotsakos Coll Business, Wayne, NJ 03013 USA; [Igwe, Emmanuel U.] Univ May Hardin Baylor, Belton, TX 76513 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Commerce,"Arize, AC (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ Commerce, Coll Business, Commerce, TX 75429 USA.",Chuck.Arize@tamuc.edu,,,,,,,66,177,179,0,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Does the change in service delivery due to decentralization affect the internal migration, a phenomenon not new to Indonesia and driven by the historic uneven development across the archipelago? Furthermore, because the services are no longer centered in Java and Bali, will the migration to these historically popular provinces change? If yes, to what extent? This discussion is of central importance not only in the Indonesian context where rising population pressures in Java and Bali provinces are the government's ultimate challenge but also in the development literature, where empirical research on such questions is made impossible by the lack of appropriate data and context. Two different datasets, the Indonesian Family Life Survey and the Indonesian Census, are used to conduct the analyses. They provide consistent results. A household in a district that went through election is 19% less likely to be a migrant-sending household. This is true particularly for districts that are in Java and Bali. A household in a district in Java and Bali that went through election is 27% less likely to be a migrant-sending household. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Strict records of all saving and lending are important, both to avoid conflicts in the group and to obtain access to bank loans. Accounting is either done by a group member (internal accountant), or by another villager (external accountant). Using first-hand data on SHGs in Northern India, this paper studies whether economic and non-financial returns differ depending on whether SHGs meet as independent entities or with external involvement. Economic theory suggests that repeated interaction between individuals can help build social capital. The presence of an external accountant hampers this process. Indeed, repeated interaction is more likely to create nonfinancial benefits in the form of mutual assistance and collective action when the accountant is a group member. However, these benefits come at a cost, as SHGs with internal accountants distribute financial benefits more unequally and the accountants themselves receive larger shares than the other members of the groups. The analysis shows that the larger shares cannot be explained as a compensation for a better financial performance, but that some form of elite capture occurs. However, other group members implicitly agree on the unequal distribution. Indeed, members are not more likely to leave groups, possibly because the loss in financial benefits is outweighed by the gain in non-financial benefits. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Within each generation we distinguish individuals with high, medium or low ability to build human capital. Our simulation results prefer a pay-as-you-go pension system with a particular earnings-related linkage above a fully-funded private system. This pay-as-you-go system conditions pension benefits on past individual labor income, with a high weight on labor income earned when older and a low weight on labor income earned when young. Uncorrected, however, such a system implies welfare losses for current low-ability generations and rising inequality. Complementing or replacing it by basic and/or minimum pension components is negative for aggregate employment and welfare. Better is to maintain the tight link between individual labor income and the pension also for low-ability individuals, but to strongly raise their replacement rate. An additional correction improving the welfare of low-ability individuals would be to maintain for these individuals equal weights on past labor income.","[Buyse, Tim; Heylen, Freddy; Van de Kerckhove, Renaat] Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; Res Fdn Flanders FWO, Brussels, Belgium",Ghent University,"Buyse, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Tim.Buyse@UGent.Be; Freddy.Heylen@UGent.Be,,"Buyse, Tim/0000-0002-4769-5888",Flemish government (Steunpunt Fiscaliteit en Begroting - Vlaanderen); Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO); National Bank of Belgium,Flemish government (Steunpunt Fiscaliteit en Begroting - Vlaanderen); Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO); National Bank of Belgium,"We thank David de la Croix, Andre Decoster, Alexander Ludwig, Dirk Van de gaer, Glenn Rayp, Gregory Ponthiere and two anonymous referees for most valuable suggestions and comments.

The coordinated risk management hypothesis (Schrand and Unal, 1998) implies a negative relation between underwriting risk and investment risk. Consistent with this hypothesis we find that diversified insurers take more asset risk than non-diversified insurers, and that the degree of asset risk-taking is positively related to diversification extent. Our results are robust to corrections for potential endogeneity bias, selectivity bias, and alternative diversification and asset risk measures. We also provide event study evidence that further supports the coordinated risk management hypothesis. Specifically, we find that when a focused firm diversifies, it increases its asset risk relative to firms that remain focused, and when a diversified firm refocuses, it reduces its asset risk relative to firms that remain diversified.

This paper firstly discussed the relationship between excess kindergarten travel and residence-kindergarten spatial mismatch. And then questionnaires and GIS are used to provide some baseline analyses of their distribution pattern both statistically and spatially in Changchun. Thirdly, we provide an exploratory analysis of the causes of excess kindergarten travel and spatial mismatch. Results indicate that a) kindergartens in Changchun are highly accessible if children attend their nearest kindergartens, b) however, there is numerous excess travel and high degree of spatial mismatch, nearly 87.1% of the kindergarteners travel excessively, c) the excess travel distances in inner city are much shorter than other areas, and the corresponding spatial mismatch degree is lower. Two critical factors influencing excess kindergarten travel and residence-kindergarten spatial mismatch are summarized. Firstly, the actual causes are a) parents' personal preferences and kindergarten choice tendencies, b) Danwei owned kindergartens generally with higher quality, tendentious enrollment policies, charge threshold, and c) the widespread use of private cars. Secondly, the root causes are limited public expenditure on kindergarten education and its unbalanced allocation, as well as Chinese traditional concept and prevailing way of parenting.

Turkey's highly unstable legislative party system from 1991 to 2002 allows us to conduct a two-stage conditional logit analysis of party affiliation.

By conducting a rolling window analysis, we are able to monitor the evolution of pure contagion effects and the changing influence of exogenous factors over time. Importantly, this is done without an ex-antespecification of the contagion window. Hence, we are able to determine the exact timing of the start and end for the different contagion periods. In contrast to related studies, we use a slightly different definition of contagious events and show that this approach leads to different conclusions about the progression of the EMU debt crisis. First, the main sources of pure contagion in the later phase of the EMU debt crisis appear to be Italy and Spain and not Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Furthermore, we find that substantial contagion effects among EMU government bond spreads (caused by Ireland and Portugal) already arise during the subprime mortgage crisis and not only during the EMU debt crisis, as one might expect.

The Portuguese range' comprises a set of ports located in the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula, grouped in a multi-port gateway region, directly connected to one of the main European Union rail freight corridors. These ports possess a natural competitive advantage as a gateway to foreland regions along the Atlantic Ocean, such as Latin America, North America and West Africa. In order to fully realize this potential, the entire range is engaged in a regionalization process into certain regions of Spain, which is analysed in this paper. The paper builds upon previous work on regionalization, inland terminal networks, dry port development and dyad formations and applies these concepts to the Portuguese range, in its pursue for the capture of hinterlands in Spain. The validity of the regionalization theoretical framework is thus benchmarked against a trans-national case and novel elements are sought to enrich the framework. The paper first describes the current situation of container terminals in the Portuguese range regarding throughput, rail connections, network of inland terminals (and dry ports) and its utilization. Comparison is made with its Spanish counterparts. The policies of major stakeholders are also reviewed concerning dry port and logistic platform development. A number of potential and existing seaport-dry port dyads are identified. Conclusions and policy suggestions are presented. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Santos, Tiago A.; Soares, C.

It draws on the findings of the individual contributions and provides a comparison of the agrarian policies of left-wing governments in Latin America. We identify common trends and offer an explanation of why these governments did not change the agricultural model in the direction of food sovereignty, but continued to heavily support agribusiness while redirecting some resources to peasant and family producers. They improved the living conditions of the rural poor, mostly through populist anti-poverty and social protection programmes financed by the commodity boom. They expanded programmes to integrate small farmers into commodity chains and improved the working conditions of rural wage labourers, but did not carry out a redistributive agrarian reform. They instead continued to support agribusiness with numerous policies and measures. We argue that these governments did not curb the power of the dominant rural classes because these are highly intertwined with capital, making them part of a coalesced bourgeoisie that occupies key positions in the state. Leftist governments did not have a real agenda of social transformation or a strategy to tackle the rentier nature of the state. Contradictorily, their policies furthered peasant differentiation thereby weakening the previous alliance of rural subaltern classes.","[Vergara-Camus, Leandro] Univ London, SOAS, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Kay, Cristobal] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, POB 29776, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Vergara-Camus, L (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",lv6@soas.ac.uk,"Vergara-Camus, Leandro/ITU-9103-2023; Kay, Cristóbal/F-7454-2014","Vergara-Camus, Leandro/0000-0002-6959-9942; Kay, Cristóbal/0000-0002-9727-7596",,,,,47,40,49,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Unlike the existing studies, we consider the possibility of the price puzzle when agent expectations are based on adaptive learning and three monetary policy alternatives (the optimal monetary policy, money growth targeting, and a Calvo-type policy rule) are available to the central bank. Furthermore, we use two alternative measures of inflation. Calibration of our medium scale model, using plausible parameter values, reveals that irrespective of how the inflation rate is measured and the policy rule used by the central bank, the puzzle fades away when a sufficiently strong exchange rate pass through is present in the economy. We also find that a decrease in inflation is associated with a cost to the society in the form of lower aggregate output but this loss is minimum when the central bank uses the optimal monetary policy.","[Ali, Syed Zahid] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Sch Econ, Lahore, Pakistan; [Anwar, Sajid] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA 8001, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Lahore University of Management Sciences; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of South Australia; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance,"Ali, SZ (通讯作者)，Lahore Univ Management Sci, Sch Econ, Lahore, Pakistan.",szahid@lums.edu.pk; SAnwar@usc.edu.au,"Ali, Syed Zahid/ISS-1019-2023; Anwar, Sajid/JBJ-1127-2023; Anwar, Sajid/F-4401-2013","Anwar, Sajid/0000-0001-9087-1309",,,,,74,8,9,1,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

This paper examines the relationship between the Bank of England policy rate and UK long-term rates in each regime. Our starting point is R. G. Hawtrey's A century of Bank Rate, which focused mainly on the classical Gold Standard. We also examine the Interwar years, post-Second World War years of policy by discretion and the recent regime of inflation targeting. We find that policy regimes that firmly anchor inflationary expectations result in long-run interest rates becoming less responsive to changes in monetary policy rates. This suggests a conflict between a regime that anchors inflationary expectations and one that allows a central bank to have significant effects on long-term rates via a short-term policy rate.","[Berument, Hakan] Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Cabezon, Ezequiel] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Froyen, Richard] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; International Monetary Fund; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Froyen, R (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",froyen@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

A nationally representative dataset of 3,670 married family farm couples in Taiwan is used as an illustration. A multiple choice treatment effect model is estimated to cope with endogeneity bias. The results indicate a significant association between farm couples' off-farm labor decisions and the farm's adoption of direct marketing strategies.

If so, and if self serving behavior by corporate executives at presumably well governed firms is a greater surprise to investors, then the price reaction to the news of governance failure should vary by the degree of competition prevailing in the firm's industry. For a sample of firms that backdated employee stock options, we find that firms operating in more competitive industries experienced significantly larger wealth declines upon revelation of the news of governance failure (back dating of stock option grants).

In industries with the highest aggregate shorted values, the most-shorted stocks earn about 1.535% lower abnormal returns than other highly shorted stocks in less shorted industries over the next six months. These results are likely driven by short sellers' preference for complex industries with the highest profit potential. We also show that the aggregate shorted value at the industry level is able to predict important industry shifts, such as declines in sales and increased competition. Overall, our results suggest that short sellers help to reduce information complexity and improve economic efficiency at the industry level.","[Huszar, Zsuzsa R.; Tan, Ruth S.

Based on the magnitude of the forecast errors and the direction of change, long-term forecasts are more accurate than short-term forecasts.

However, in times of crises in the bank sector, this feature may indicate a weakness of these economies when the credit squeeze phenomenon may occur and companies' competitiveness might be negatively affected thanks to unstable financing possibilities. In such conditions, a shift from bank loans to bonds might be expected. That is why this paper focuses on mutual development of corporate bond and business loan markets in the developing Czech economy in the years 2006-2014 with regard to the impacts of the global financial crisis of 2008/2009. The main goal of this article is to identify whether, thanks to the impacts of the global recession in 2009, there was a shift in Czech economy in business financing from the loans to bonds in a similar fashion as in the case of East Asian economies after their financial crisis in the nineties. Since Czech companies practically do not use short-term bonds, a mutual relationship is examined between amounts of long-term corporate bonds and economic development captured by the GDP per capita, and between long-term business loans and development of long-term corporate bonds. The main findings of this study are that since the global financial crisis, bond financing of businesses has been growing faster than loan financing. Czech economy thus shifts and becomes more bond market-based. The development of bond financing is positively correlated with the GDP per capita. Time series of both loans and bonds develop along the same trend. However, residual components are correlated negatively, which confirms the standing of loans and bonds as substitutes. Two main practical implications may be derived from this study. First, a growing usage of bonds increases demands on the market regulator, especially in the field of monitoring. Second, the growing bond market leads to the increased effectiveness, which makes additional effective sources of finance available to businesses and makes Czech economy more competitive even in times of difficulties in the banking sector.","[Maci, Jan; Valentova Hovorkova, Vladimira] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Voronezska 13, Liberec 46001 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Maci, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Voronezska 13, Liberec 46001 1, Czech Republic.",jan.maci@tul.cz; vladimira.valentova@tul.cz,"Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/M-1370-2018","Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/0000-0001-5718-315X; Maci, Jan/0000-0002-6315-7991",,,,,33,10,10,2,8,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

An ex-ante analysis suggests that this is the case. Changes through a less obvious channel (that is, in factor incomes) are likely to be more beneficial to middle-income households. In general, all households experience losses, with poorer households being the most affected. When accounting for transfers financed through the collection of export taxes, poorer households benefit.

Particularly, we search for upward trends in correlations and investigate the impacts of global and market volatility, and the news from the markets on the time-varying structure of correlations. The focus is on two commodity sub-indices; agricultural commodity and precious metal. New evidence against the rising trend is found for the agricultural commodity sub-index and empirical results show that high market volatility during financial crises seems to be the main source of high correlations. Moreover, increase in correlation is not a new phenomenon and cannot be attributed to the recent financial crisis. For the precious metal sub-index, market volatility plays crucial role in the dynamic nature of correlation along with rising trend. Furthermore, heterogeneous structure of commodity markets delivers better portfolio diversification opportunities during calm periods compared to turmoil periods. It is empirically shown that the gain of portfolio diversification across commodity and stock markets is not negligible.","[Oztek, Mehmet Fatih] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Econ, Cinnah Cad 16, Ankara, Turkey; [Ocal, Nadir] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University; Middle East Technical University,"Öcal, N (通讯作者)，Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",mfoztek@ybu.edu.tr; ocal@metu.edu.tr,,"Ocal, Nadir/0000-0001-6607-0587",,,,,32,64,65,0,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

A variety of distributed energy resources and improving computation, communication, and control technologies create an unprecedented degree of choice for electricity consumers, choices that are poorly guided by electricity rates and other incentives designed for a comparatively simpler era. These technologies also create new tools for regulated utilities, competitive suppliers, and other businesses to employ in the provision of electricity services. This paper summarizes the findings of a two year, multidisciplinary MIT Energy Initiative research effort, the Utility of the Future study, and outlines a framework for proactive electricity regulation, market, and policy reform designed to enable the efficient evolution of the power sector over the next decade and beyond. Recommendations include a comprehensive system of efficient prices and charges for all electricity users, enhanced regulation of distribution utilities, careful reconsideration of industry structure to avoid conflicts of interest, and improvements to electricity markets. Together, this framework is intended to establish a level playing field for the provision and consumption of electricity services and enable the integration of a cost-effective combination of centralized generation, conventional network assets, and emerging distributed resources, whatever that mix may be.","[Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio J.; Batlle, Carlos] Comillas Pontif Univ, Inst Res Technol IIT, Madrid, Spain; [Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio J.] MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jenkins, Jesse D.; Batlle, Carlos] MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jenkins, Jesse D.] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Comillas Pontifical University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Pérez-Arriaga, IJ (通讯作者)，Comillas Pontif Univ, Inst Res Technol IIT, Madrid, Spain.;Pérez-Arriaga, IJ (通讯作者)，MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",ipa@mit.edu,"Batlle, Carlos/AFG-4923-2022; Batlle, Carlos/AAF-1471-2022; Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio/ABF-7662-2020","Batlle, Carlos/0000-0001-8451-5295; Batlle, Carlos/0000-0001-8451-5295; Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio/0000-0002-1466-8613; Jenkins, Jesse/0000-0002-9670-7793",,,,,51,50,52,1,12,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

This article examines the changing political economy of the UK enforced by Wave 1 City Deals, to analyse the claims made by devolution proponents that there is an 'economic dividend' to devolution. The argument is made that scant evidence exists to suggest that these reforms respond to the pathologies of the UK economy. Instead, the Northern Powerhouse discourse serves to disguise the implementation of a tax and investment settlement which regressively concentrates taxation revenue in the more affluent parts of the country. These reforms though are a political expression of a certain understanding of wealth creation which privileges low tax taxation, interterritorial competition to promote it and a belief in the major UK cities to drive the economic recovery. It is a strategy likely to produce very uneven geographies of growth which will exacerbate uneven development; ironically so given the 'Northern Powerhouse' rhetoric through which it was reasoned.","[Bailey, Daniel] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Bailey, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",daniel.bailey@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,4,4,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

The model generates high international correlation of state prices along with modest cross-country consumption growth correlation and matches the empirical disconnect between exchange rate changes and consumption growth rate differentials. The key mechanism is endogenous time variation in conditional consumption growth volatility: the conditionally less risk averse country insures the more risk averse one, offsetting cross-country heterogeneity in conditional risk aversion and leading to significant international comovement in marginal utility growth.","[Stathopoulos, Andreas] Univ Washington, 4277 Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Stathopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, 4277 Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",astath@uw.edu,,,,,,,44,21,29,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

However, in practice, networks cannot be designed to accommodate each individual trip. Still, it is possible to optimize transportation systems from a collective demand point of view. To move from an individual to a collective scale, individual demands need to be encapsulated into demand corridors. Although current spatial tools and data mining techniques are able to identify corridors from numerous movements by using linear or non-linear trajectory data, their limitations from a transportation point of view include the use of non-intuitive parameters and the application of some aggregation processes that make it difficult to retrace the attributes of individual input data that could benefit the richness of the available data after processing. For that reason, we propose a new algorithm called Trajectory Clustering for Desire Lines (TraClus-DL), which can identify corridors from Origin-Destination (OD) information with simple parameters, such as spatial location, angles between lines, and sampling weights. The functionality of TraClus-DL as a diagnostic tool for transportation supply was assessed and tested using data from the 2013 OD travel survey conducted in the Montreal area. The sensitivity of the results, with respect to parameter settings, was evaluated, and a comparison with an existing algorithm was proposed. The results of this study demonstrate that transportation specialists can benefit from the convenience of using TraClus-DL as a corridor identification tool, which includes its potential to perform deep analyses at the corridor level. In addition, this study provides new insights into the possible uses of demand corridors as relevant tools for transportation planning, and in the decision-making processes in which a neutral reference is needed to evaluate how much the transportation supply differs from the collective travel demand.

Additional instruments, alongside CF, are implemented to overcome the challenges of CF and to adapt to the policy environment in which the different stakeholders operate. This paper develops a theoretical framework that gives insight into how these complex entities are structured and operate in a developing country context. This theoretical analysis takes a holistic approach by adopting elements of existing theories to form a new critical research paradigm: (i) Resource Dependence Theory to incorporate the wider operating environment in which the two cases operate, (ii) Transaction Cost Economics to explain the internal efficiency of the different models, and (iii) Agency Theory to account for the safeguard mechanisms. This new framework is then tested on two complex IBs that aim to integrate smallholder farmers into the commercial value chain, but which have each implemented a different institutional set-up developed around CF arrangements. It finds that a high dependence by the offtaker in the first case study stimulates a higher level of commitment and investment by this stakeholder in the contract arrangement. In turn, this increases the asset specificity aspect, which then requires safeguards to ensure the smallholders adhere to the contractual agreement. A higher dependency in this particular study also resulted in a higher number of smallholders being engaged in the contract, requiring mechanisms to efficiently monitor and coordinate them.","[Chamberlain, W.

We also find that soybean yields have a significant impact on land rental prices.

Development of decentralized structures with shallow hierarchy and higher levels of delegation of authority is a precondition for organizational flexibility. Furthermore, providing employees with broader authority and more responsibilities are key preconditions for achieving higher motivation and dedication of employees. Modern managers should act as mentors who strengthen and encourage their employees to be more self-efficient, which will have an ultimate effect on achieving organizational goals. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of delegation of authority as the managerial skill on the achievement of organizational goals. The current business practices indicate that a large number of companies in BiH have traditional structures and that a lack in good managers is one of the key factors of bad business performance by BiH companies. Therefore the research focused on examining managers' attitudes towards delegation of authority and its influence on achievement of organizational goals is important. The research was conducted in the Coal Mine Banovici (RMU Banovici d.d. Banovici), a large mining company, based on a questionnaire survey distributed on a sample of 20% of managers at different management levels in this company. The research results indicate that there is relatively high level of delegation of authority in this company and that this process has various implications on social atmosphere and quality of relations between managers and employees, which positively affects achievement of strategic and operative organizational goals. Future research in this field should be conducted on a larger sample of companies in order to establish more objective relations between delegation of authority and different aspects of processes in companies.","[Delic, Adisa; Alibegovic, Sabina Donlagic] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Derzic, Lejla Cebic] Coal Mine Banovici Ltd, Banovici, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Delic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",adisa.delic@untz.ba; sabina.djonlagic@untz.ba; lejla_cebic@hotmail.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,5,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,593,604,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900037,0

It is assumed that, despite the de-industrialization of the 1990s, the industrial sector remains crucial for the economy of the RF subject concerned, including its peripheral municipalities. The improved quality and quantity dynamics of the industry caused by the new industrialization is a key to successful development of the region. On its territory, there are several sizeable industrial centers (close to Yekaterinburg, Severouralsk, Nizhny Tagil and Kamensk-Uralsky). Enterprises of these areas ensure most of the industrial production volume in the Sverdlovsk oblast. From 2010 to 2015, the proportion of the peripheral territories in the regionwide indicators was getting down steadily. Judging by the quality indicators referring to the industrial sector, manufacturing enterprises located in the center of the region are driving all the critical innovations, whereas the peripheral territories mostly remain a resource base for the industrial development of the region. The authors conclude that development of old industrial regions and peripheral territories can be ensured by certain center-to-periphery innovation impulses as well as by technological re-equipment of peripheral enterprises, with a transfer of some of them from the center to the periphery.","[Dvoryadkina, Elena B.; Kaibicheva, Catherine I.] Ural State Univ Econ, Dept Reg Municipal Econ & Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Shurova, Irina I.] Ural State Univ Econ, Dept Business Foreign Languages, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural State University of Economics; Ural State University of Economics,"Dvoryadkina, EB (通讯作者)，Ural State Univ Econ, Dept Reg Municipal Econ & Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",elena.dvoryadkina@yandex.ru; Catherine.kai@mail.ru; irina_shurova@mail.ru,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [17-32-00016],Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"The reported study was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), research project No. 17-32-00016 Responses of peripheral urban districts to changes of the parameters of regional economy in conditions of the local government reform",,17,1,1,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,273,279,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600046,0

Software support for risk management process is crucial for efficient risk evaluation and assessment, continuous monitoring, reporting and easier improvement of that process. The authors conducted the empirical research in order to find if there are any differences in the importance of some functional characteristics of enterprise risk management software (ERM) related to the size of the company. The sample comprises of 92 companies (27 large, 26 medium and 39 small and micro companies) whose employees in charge of risk management fulfilled online questionnaire. The results of the research showed that there are significant differences related to the functional software characteristics requested by large, medium, and small and micro companies. For example, for larger companies, it is important that software provides customization of the organization's hierarchy and working with multiple organizations, while those characteristics are less important for smaller companies. The research results showed that user requirements related to ERM software depend on the size of companies. ERM software vendors should consider offering full (for large and medium companies) and light (for small and micro companies) version of their software with the possibility for easy switch from light to full version as the company grows up.","[Gaspar, Drazena; Mabic, Mirela] Univ Mostar, Fac Econ, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg; [Coric, Ivica] Hera Ltd, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Mostar,"Gaspar, D (通讯作者)，Univ Mostar, Fac Econ, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg.",drazena.gaspar@ef.sum.ba; mirela.mabic@ef.sum.ba; ivica.coric@hera.ba,"Gaspar, Drazena/L-7987-2019; Mabić, Mirela/N-8720-2018","Gaspar, Drazena/0000-0002-3573-2653; Mabić, Mirela/0000-0002-1529-7797",,,,,12,0,0,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,918,932,,,,,,15,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900058,0

In this article, we provide a cohesive analytical framework to review certain key channels through which disclosure in financial markets affects market quality, information production, efficiency of real investment decisions, and traders' welfare. We use our framework to address four main aspects. First, we demonstrate the conventional wisdom that disclosure improves market quality in an economy with exogenous information. Second, we illustrate that disclosure can crowd out the production of private information and that its overall market-quality implications are subtle and depend on the specification of information-acquisition technology. Third, we review how disclosure affects the efficiency of real investment decisions when financial markets are not just a side show, as real decision makers can learn information from them to guide their decisions. Last, we discuss how disclosure in financial markets affects investors' welfare through changing trading opportunities and through beauty-contest motives. Overall, our review suggests that information disclosure is an important factor for understanding the functioning of financial markets and that there are several trade-offs that should be considered in determining its optimal level.","[Goldstein, Itay] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Yang, Liyan] Univ Toronto, Joseph L Rotman Sch Management, Dept Finance, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada",University of Pennsylvania; University of Toronto,"Goldstein, I (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",itayg@wharton.upenn.edu; liyan.yang@rotman.utoronto.ca,"Goldstein, Itay/AAU-9170-2021; yang, liyan/HNB-9033-2023","Yang, Liyan/0000-0002-2599-1328",,,,,68,112,130,9,72,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4809-0,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Results show that women's participation in the cowpea value chain significantly increases cowpea production, marketing and adoption of improved cowpea varieties. It also reduces both food insecurity and poverty. However, women's participation in the value chain is limited by low levels of education, access to extension, credit, village markets, and improved agricultural technologies. Policies to address these constraints that limit women's participation in the cowpea value chain have the potential to reduce gender disparities, food insecurity, and poverty.","[Gondwe, Therese; Oladeji, Alamu E.] IITA, Southern Africa Hub, POB 310142, Chelstone, Lusaka, Zambia; [Tegbaru, A.; Gaya, H.] IITA, East Africa Hub, POB 34441, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Khonje, Makaiko] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Heinrich Dueker Weg 12, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Manda, J.] IITA, Chitedze Res Stn, POB 30258, Lilongwe 3, Malawi",University of Gottingen,"Gondwe, T (通讯作者)，IITA, Southern Africa Hub, POB 310142, Chelstone, Lusaka, Zambia.",T.Gondwe@cgiar.org,"Gondwe, Therese/HKV-9704-2023; Alamu, Emmanuel Oladeji/P-8456-2018","Alamu, Emmanuel Oladeji/0000-0001-6263-1359; Manda, Julius/0000-0002-9599-5906",,,,,39,3,4,1,7,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,3,,,,,263,273,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1317643,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FH0YL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410866500004,0

We show that optimal policy under discretion near the zero lower bound responds to signals about an increase in the equilibrium real interest rate by less than it would when far from the zero lower bound. In addition, we show that Taylor-type rules that either include a time-varying intercept that moves with perceived changes in the equilibrium real rate or respond aggressively to deviations of inflation and output from their target levels perform similarly to optimal discretionary policy. Our analysis of first-difference rules highlights that rules with interest rate smoothing terms carry forward current and past misperceptions about the state of the economy and can lead to suboptimal performance.","[Gust, Christopher; Johannsen, Benjamin K.; Lopez-Salido, J.

According to the authors' review, more than 350 reliable sources (scientific publications, academic books and working papers) examine or at least discuss the concept. As RI gains popularity among academic authors, some discrepancies have started to appear. This wealth of publications could impact prior advancements related to understanding of the phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to decrease fragmentation and focus on identifying and understanding RI. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review of RI was conducted. The review conformed to a rigorous set of core principles: it was systematic (organized according to a method designed to address the review questions), transparent (explicitly stated), reproducible and updatable, and synthesized (summarized the evidence relating to the review question). Findings - This systematic review provides an improved theoretical and practical framework for the concept of RI. In terms of theory, the authors have demonstrated that the idea behind the concept is not entirely new. A consensus on the definition of RI is not reached in the literature, and descriptions in organizational theory contexts are sometimes misleading. The authors analyzed all the various definitions provided in the literature. From a practical point of view, the authors have explained the academic interest in RI in relation to organizational strategy, in particular the context in which strategies are adopted. The concept of RI has significant managerial implications, and the authors have proposed a conceptual framework to help managers understand and grasp the implications of RI. Finally, the authors have provided suggestions for future research on RI. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first exhaustive literature review on RI.","[Hadengue, Marine; de Marcellis-Warin, Nathalie] Polytech Montreal, Dept Math & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [de Marcellis-Warin, Nathalie] Harvard Univ, Harvard Ctr Risk Anal, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Warin, Thierry] HEC Montreal, Dept Int Business, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Yet, this welfare-enhancing policy commonly faces strong opposition by citizens. Conversely, externality-correcting subsidies frequently enjoy high public support. We conduct a lab experiment to explore public support for Pigouvian taxes and subsidies. In an experimental market with a negative externality, participants vote on the introduction of Pigouvian taxes and subsidies under full or reduced information concerning how the tax revenues will be spent and the subsidy paid for. Theoretically the two instruments should produce identical outcomes. However, we find substantially greater support for subsidies than for taxes. This can partially be explained by the participants' expectation that the subsidy will increase their own payoffs more than a tax, but not because it is expected to be more effective in changing behavior. Furthermore, we find that with greater uncertainty, the preference for subsidies is even stronger, a result which is consistent with loss aversion.","[Heres, David R.] CIDE, Dept Econ, Carretera Mexico Toluca 3655, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico; [Kallbekken, Steffen] CICERO, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Galarraga, Ibon] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Alameda Urquijo 4,4a, Bilbao 48008, Spain",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Hence, voluntary disclosures such as management earnings forecast can be informative, and the degree of information revelation will be positively related to depositors' perspectives on the random investment shock.","[Ho, Shirley J.] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Ho, SJ (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",sjho@nccu.edu.tw,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST103-2410-H-004-100-]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported The Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST103-2410-H-004-100-].",,43,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The authors focused their research in two directions. On the one hand, the authors point out the open theoretical and ideological dilemmas on the nature of the occurrence of corruption: (1) Whether the corruption is linked to the inability of the government to establish effective control of public flows through the legal system and to prevent the use of public service for private ends, or (2) The corruption is linked to the lack of markets and creation of an opportunity for the establishment of a monopoly in decision making. The answer to this dilemma determines the strategy and measures to prevent corruption. On the other hand, the authors explore the international standards and anti-corruption policies and they analyse trends of regulation and supervision of financial markets, which would constitute a barrier to the use of the financial systems for the legalization of corruption.","[Hodzic, Kadrija] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Ricka, Zeljko] Univ Zenica, Fac Econ, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla; University of Zenica,"Hodzic, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",kadrija.hodzic@gmail.com; revicon.tz@bih.net.ba,,,,,,,17,0,0,2,3,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,790,809,,,,,,20,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900050,0

Main aim of the contribution is to answer the question, whether Czech farmers are able to use advantages from economies of scale, secure higher income and create higher value added. Among secondary aims belong: (i) determination of main influencing factors of farm income and value added creation; (ii) proposition of possible strategies leading to increase in income and value added. Based on the gained results, it can be concluded: (i) there is a great variation in Polish agricultural holdings between different size groups; (ii) Czech agricultural holdings have much larger land resources compared to Polish farms; (iii) Polish agricultural farms are engaged in intensive agricultural production, while Czech farms in extensive production; (iv) polish farms achieve higher per hectare production and added value in all groups of farms, although Czech farms achieve higher income per farm and per labour input; (v) Czech farms in each group of farms achieve higher profitability of production thanks to economies of scale and specialization on low input and low value added production; (vi) net value added evince increasing trend among most size groups.

Because the private colleges and universities are more complicated and diverse than the public colleges and universities in the mode of running school and the management ideas, it may lead to the vagueness of the main body of the constitution drafting, the excessive commonness but lacking of individuality in the constitution, and poor implementation effect of the constitution, the existence of formalism or other problems. Then, it is urgent to clarify the responsibility subject of the constitution; and the realization way needs to be proposed from three aspects, such as digging its own characteristic and cultural idea, building an individualized constitution, strengthening the examination and supervision on the contents of the constitution, so as to ensure the scientificity, comprehensiveness, systematicness, rationality and validity of the constitution construction of the private colleges and universities. The constitution of colleges and universities is the main body of modern university system, and also is a necessary criterion for colleges and universities to run school independently and carry out public affairs management, a basis for them to carry out teaching activities and social practice activities and a strong guarantee for them to systematically construct a modern university system. Therefore, the National Medium-and-Long-Term Education Reform and Development Plan Outline (2010-2020) has taken enhancing the constitution construction and improving the governance model as the basic request to construct the modern university system.

The economists around the world seem to be confused to use redenomination as a tool to control inflation. The current study provides insight into the perplexed phenomenon of redenomination. The study aims to examine the impact of redenomination on inflation. The secondary data were collected from five hyper inflationary countries: Bulgaria, Argentina, Romania, Turkey and Brazil to investigate the impact of deleting zeroes on economy. The results revealed that there was statistically significant impact of redenomination on consumer price index (CPI). One-unit redenomination would decrease the inflation about 0.91 units. It was therefore, concluded that redenomination could be used to control the inflation which leads to stabilization of economy of world. It is recommended that redenomination can be applied as an anti-inflation policy in countries having higher level of prices.","[Husain Tahir, Safdar; Rizwan Ullah, Muhammad; Ghafoor, Nabeeha] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Allama lqbal Rd, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Gulzar] Lahore Garrison Univ, Dept Psychol, Lahore, Pakistan; [Rehman, Faiza] Govt Coll Women Univ Faisalabad, Dept Publ Adm, Faisalabad, Pakistan",Government College University Faisalabad,"Husain Tahir, S (通讯作者)，Govt Coll Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Allama lqbal Rd, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",drsafdar@gcufedu.pk; mrizwanullah77@gmail.com; gulzar818@gmail.com; nabeeha.ghafoor2014@gmail.com; faizamsbf30@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,315,326,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800024,0

Although the role of external knowledge has been discussed in detail in the open innovation literature, there is still a challenge: how to operationalize technological opportunities and measure their impact on firms' innovation performance. In order to reduce this gap in the literature, our study aims at analysing the effects of technological opportunities on the output of the innovation process. Our empirical research is based on micro-data from the Polish Community Innovation Survey. The sample consists of 1979 manufacturing firms. We use the linear regression to estimate the relationship in which the share of innovative product sale is a function of a set of technological opportunity variables. These variables refer to two distinct measures of technological opportunities, i.e. the contribution of external knowledge to innovation activity and the propensity to collaboration on innovation. Our results show that inter-firm differences in technological opportunities explain inter-firm variation in innovation outcome. Moreover, we do not find any moderating impact from the absorptive capacity on the relationship between technological opportunities and innovation performance.","[Kijek, Tomasz] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Akad 13, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland; [Skrzypek, Elzbieta] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Plac Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland",University of Life Sciences in Lublin; Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Kijek, T (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Lublin, Akad 13, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland.",tomasz.kijek@up.lublin.pl,"Kijek, Tomasz/U-2584-2018","Kijek, Tomasz/0000-0002-0134-4943",Polish National Science Centre [DEC 2013/09/D/HS4/01139],Polish National Science Centre,The project was financed by Polish National Science Centre on the basis of decision number DEC 2013/09/D/HS4/01139.,,27,0,0,0,0,"SCIENCEPARK SCI, ORGANIZATION & COUNSELING LTD",KYRENIA,"13 SUBAT ST, NO 17, KYRENIA, 99030, CYPRUS",2547-8818,,,N TR ISS P HUM SOC S,,,2017,,,,,,,69,76,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4PU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463801800009,0

The paper presents basic impact factors of low level of competitiveness, such as inefficient state apparatus, corruption, unstable government/political action and fiscal regulations. Paper concludes that BiH has to work on a number of structural reforms in order to achieve a higher level of competitiveness. In addition to the conclusion, paper offers number of recommendations for improving competitiveness, as well as recommendations for future research.","[Klapic, Hidajet] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Cavalic, Admir] Assoc Multi Tuzla, Slanac, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Klapic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",hidajet.klapic@untz.ba; admircavalic@multi.ba,"Čavalić, Admir/D-7494-2017",,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,699,712,,,,,,14,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900044,0

Prior literature predominantly assumes that informal investors engage in investment activities with a return on investment and profit in mind; however, other non-financial objectives for informal investment-e.g., altruistic informal investment-have also been suggested although their antecedents unexplored. We suggest altruistic investment behavior depends on life circumstances determined by social capital, gender, and their combination.

The detailed objectives are: to present the state of organising farmers into producer groups (PGs) and organizations (POs), to show the dynamic creation of groups and producer organizations, to present the benefits of collaboration in groups and to discuss the current legal status of these organisations and efforts. To achieve these ends, economic theories were reviewed with a view to justifying integration activities undertaken by agricultural producers. That justification can indeed be found in a variety of theories. The status of organising farmers into groups and producer organizations was also discussed. For this purpose, data from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Agricultural Market Agency, the Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture and the Central Statistical Office were used. The data show that there is only a low level of integration among producers in Polish agriculture, due mainly to a reluctance among farmers to join the groups. Nonetheless, participation holds numerous benefits that are difficult to come by for farmers operating alone.","[Lemanowicz, Marzena] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Lemanowicz, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",m.lemanowicz@wp.pl,,"Lemanowicz, Marzena/0000-0002-5114-9185",,,,,18,1,1,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,190,197,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400025,0

The industry shifted from one focused on US-owned corporations to one with a much more international orientation. Because of the success Canada enjoyed in attracting foreign automotive investment, one might conclude that those engaged in the process did so with a coherent plan and that the period was marked by one success after another. The reality, however, is that several misses also occurred. Layering archival sources and interviews with secondary sources, this article contributes to the history of the economic development of Canada's automotive industry. Through this, important lessons for policy-makers are offered: The process of goal and policy congruence is demonstrated; one sees how dominant personalities can override governance mechanisms, even in large corporations; and one observes the capacity of exogenous factors to affect the best-laid plans.","[Mordue, Greigory D.] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Mordue, GD (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,75,4,4,1,5,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

This scale is a result, in part, of low average rural population densities; development patterns in broadacre production; low levels of effective public policy transfers; a stable and suitable institutional setting suitable for corporate and other large scale investment; and low yields. It is also a factor of the natural variability of the country's climatic systems which have contributed to the scale of extensive northern cattle production; this variability has implications for the pattern of ownership of broadacre and extensive production. Corporate ownership, tends to concentrate production aggregations at sufficient scale to offset its additional overheads in areas of relative climatic stability and to replicate these agroholding aggregations spatially to protect the stability of revenue flows. Family structures are more dominant in areas of greater climatic variability.

The framework explicitly accounts for the fact that commercial banks hold excess reserves and they incur costs in holding these assets. The model also accounts for imperfect substitutability between bank funding sources and it shows that this feature is an important channel through which reserve requirement shocks can affect real variables. Numerical experiments show that an increase in reserve requirements creates a countercyclical effect for real economic activity.

The hypothesis of expected utility theory is that the decision makers are rational economic man, they are risks -averse, and they can make decision with objective probability when facing the uncertain events. Because the farmers' low cultural level, incomplete information, farmers hardly can be a rational economic man to decide whether they need to buy agricultural insurance. Therefore, the paper questions the rationality of using the expected utility theory to analyze the consumption behavior of agricultural insurance, and it introduces the prospect theory, which is often used by behavioral economics researchers, can response the real situation better. The advantage of the prospect theory is that it suggests that the decision makers are risks-averse in the face of benefits, but risk-appetite in the face of losses; decision makers will be based on their experience and subjective perception to correct the objective risks probability.

Theories of corruption then suggest that higher levels of transparency are associated with lower levels of corruption. Thus, this paper is focused on the potential effects of open data in reducing the level of corruption. For this purpose, different related open data and corruption indices from two different time periods are examined. In contrast to previous studies, the use of open data indices to verify this relationship is new in research on e-government development. Findings indicate that there is a positive correlation relationship between selected corruption and open data indices. Thus, higher levels of open data availability are associated with lower levels of corruption in the compared countries, especially in the case of Open Data Barometer index. It was also found out that the methodologies behind open data indices may affect the results, because they are still evolving due to the increasing effects of open data in the society.","[Renata, Machova] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Renáta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",renata.machova@upce.cz,,,,,,,14,3,3,2,12,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,58,65,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100007,0

A set of 32 indicators from economic, social and environmental areas was chosen for the measurement of QOL at the district level. The model was designed for the evaluation, comparison and explanation of regional differences in the QOL. Algorithms of hierarchical cluster analysis were applied for the whole set of objective indicators in the model. The results show that QOL on the district level is very similar across the CR; only the districts located in the highland areas in Sumava (mountains), Jeseniky (mountains) and Krusne hory (Krusne mountains) have lower level of QOL. On the other hand, the highest QOL is observed in the district Capital city of Prague as actually expected.","[Romana, Provaznikova; Jiri, Krupka; Lucie, Kokesova] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Romana, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",romana.provaznikova@upec.cz; jiri.krupka@upec.cz; LKokesova@seznam.cz,,,"Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR at the Faculty of Economics and Administration, University of Pardubice [SGS_2016_023]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR at the Faculty of Economics and Administration, University of Pardubice","The elaboration of this article was supported by projects No. SGS_2016_023 of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR, the project title is Economic and social development in the private and the public sectors at the Faculty of Economics and Administration, University of Pardubice.",,19,2,2,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,82,89,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100010,0

We examined intention, goals and tools of Slovak regulatory agency and proved those are unduly determined and will not lead to desired ends. We have proved that real outcomes of this policy had led to unintended consequences such as excess of production facilities, declining prices of electricity, decreased profitability of all producers and exit from market of marginal production sources that are not subsidized.

As source of data the daily press Lidove Noviny was used. By analyzing of real estate market data taking from period of 20's and 30's it argues, there is significant relationship between expected unemployment and present level of rental dwelling supply. In the paper there are presented the reasons of the most significant relationship. It seems the most significant reason why the supply of rental dwellings is sensitive for future level of unemployment is expected level of unemployment indicated by the landlords in advance.

Only a few of them consider system parameters that are under direct control of municipal representatives on a daily basis - e.g. pick-up frequency, number of collection points and their density, distance to collection points, curbside collection versus collection points (drop-off recycling), volume of bins/containers installed in the system. Our research aimed to fill this gap implementing dynamic factors that influence the total costs of the system - performance of the container-based collection, efficiency of the container-based collection network, or charging system. In contradiction to our assumptions these factors explain the intermunicipal variability in total costs per capita only marginally. The highest importance has residual waste production per capita, residual waste cost per ton and number of inhabitants per collection site (or economies of density). The dynamic factors influence the separate collection costs that depend on the efficiency of the container-based collection network of plastics, or on glass and plastics production, but also on number of containers for glass per km(2), volume of installed glass containers (liter per capita), and type of charge. These results should be reflected by the implementation of the relevant measures aimed to decrease municipal waste management costs.","[Slavik, Jan; Rybova, Kristyna] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Slavík, J (通讯作者)，Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",jan.slavik@ujep.cz; kristyna.rybova@ujep.cz,"Slavík, Jan/A-9765-2018; Rybova, Kristyna/JMP-9012-2023","Rybova, Kristyna/0000-0001-7340-4012",Czech Science Foundation [15-08032S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This article was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Project Nr. 15-08032S Unfair competition and other economic factors influencing the efficiency of the provision of public services).,,34,2,2,0,14,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,371,378,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100048,0

Most foreign studies have confirmed the influence of IMC on cost efficiency in terms of cost savings, both in the Czech Republic and abroad. This paper is a follow-up to a previous study of Soukopova and Klimovsky [ 27] that confirmed the influence of IMC and showed that the institutional aspects of IMC are important in relation to cost efficiency. The paper addresses the issues in a more complex manner. We investigate other aspects of IMC (managerial, etc.) using the OLS regression model. The results show that institutionalization and ownership share are undoubtedly significant factors of cost efficiency, although there is a significant synergy effect of other factors related to IMC. In contrast, the results of the OLS model show that city size (populations over 20,000 inhabitants) and waste collection company profits increase municipal waste management expenses per capita.","[Soukopova, Jana; Bakos, Eduard; Zelenakova, Petra] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Soukopová, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",soukopova@econ.muni.cz; bakos@econ.muni.cz; petra.zelenakova@mail.muni.cz,"Soukopová, Jana/H-9432-2013; Soukopová, Jana/JCO-2082-2023","Soukopová, Jana/0000-0002-9423-3301;",Czech Science Foundation [GA15-08032S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The research leading to the production of this paper was supported by the Czech Science Foundation under project No. GA15-08032S Unfair competition and other economic factors influencing the efficiency of the provision of public services.,,30,0,0,0,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,379,386,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100049,0

Further, we determine the stationarity property of the debt/GDP ratio while accommodating possible breaks in the data caused by wars and economic crisis under both the null and alternative hypotheses of an endogenous unit root test. The results show that the U.S. public debt was sustainable until 2005 when the primary surplus to GDP reacted negatively to the debt/income ratio. This is further exacerbated during the global financial crisis when primary surpluses continued to fall with increased debt, thus jeopardizing the sustainability of fiscal policy. While the stationarity test shows that the U.S. fiscal debt/GDP ratio is sustainable, it fails to highlight the risk that its debt policy has been becoming unsustainable in recent years.","[Thanh Dat Nguyen] La Trobe Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; [Suardi, Sandy] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Chua, Chew Lian] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",La Trobe University; University of Wollongong; University of Melbourne,"Nguyen, TD (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",td18nguyen@students.latrobe.edu.au; ssuardi@uow.edu.au; mchua@unimelb.edu.au,"suardi, sandy/JXY-3445-2024; Nguyen, Dat Thanh/HZJ-3407-2023","suardi, sandy/0000-0002-0491-8957; Nguyen, Dat Thanh/0000-0002-6868-3253; Chua, Chew/0000-0003-3201-9497",,,,,48,10,10,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

We show that the more central minority agents are located in the social network, the more they assimilate to the majority culture. We also show that denser networks tend to favor assimilation so that, for example, it is easier to assimilate in a complete network than in a star-shaped network. We show that the subgame-perfect equilibrium is not optimal because there is not enough activity and assimilation. We then endogeneize the network and show under which condition the ethnic minorities either assimilate to or separated themselves from the majority group. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Transport belongs to sectors where PPPs have been most visible and transformative. Yet not all countries have embraced the new method in the same manner. As some initial studies indicate, their PPP readiness varies quite significantly. So far, however, no single study has shown how (un)successful in reality the European countries are at implementing transport PPPs. This is mostly due to difficulties in formulating appropriate and comparable evaluation criteria. At the same time, with many projects in development it is simply a bit too early to say whether the original expectations have been met. This study thus uses a negative definition of PPP success and establishes the failure rate for each country from the sample. In doing so, it only takes into account indisputable cases of projects that were abandoned or seriously distressed and modified in advance stages of the procurement process. As a result, transport PPP failure rates of selected European countries are compared. At the same time, the main success/failure factors within the wider PPP institutional framework are identified.","[Witzova, Petra; Witz, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Witzová, P (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic.",witzova@gmail.com; peta.witz@centrum.cz,"Witz, Petr/AAH-7647-2020",,grant GAUK [368815]; SVV IMS FSV UK [260460/2017],grant GAUK; SVV IMS FSV UK,This work is supported by grant GAUK 368815 (Witzova) and SVV IMS FSV UK No 260460/2017 (Witz).,,13,0,0,1,5,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Referencing to the results of the available literatures at home and abroad, we take the science and technology innovation ability in Beijing city as the research object. On one hand, the DEA model and super-efficiency DEA model are adopted to measure the static efficiency of input and output in the science and technology innovation of Beijing city. On the other hand, the Malmquist index model is used to measure the dynamic efficiency of the input and output in the science and technology innovation of Beijing city. At the meantime, the principal component-ideal solution model is built to evaluate the science and technology innovation ability of Beijing city. On this basis, according to the static and dynamic efficiency of the input and output of science and technology innovation and the science and technology innovation ability of Beijing, the correlation degree between the two is evaluated, and the relevance between static and dynamic efficiency of the input and output of science and technology innovation of Beijing city and its science and technology innovation ability is diagnosed, and the countermeasures and suggestions for the further improvement of the input and output efficiency of the science and technology innovation of Beijing city are proposed. The research results show, the input and output efficiency of the science and technology innovation of Beijing city fluctuates during 1996 and 2014, with most of the effective years. Except for several years, Beijing city has basically realized the continuous improvement of the technical progress and the science and technology innovation ability. The changes of the static and dynamic input and output efficiency of the science and technology innovation of Beijing are similar to that of the science and technology innovation ability. The degrees of association between them reach 0.976 and 0.998 respectively. Although the overall situation of the science and technology innovation efficiency of Beijing city during 1996 and 2014 is good, some problems still exist: the redundant science and technology input and the inadequate output prevail in the years with a low technical efficiency. The input index of the science and technology innovation is redundant. The inadequate output of science and technology innovation shows in the patent index. It shows the resource utilization rate of the science and technology innovation of Beijing city is low, and the capability of independent innovation remains to be further improved.","[Wu, Dan; Hu, Jing] North China Univ Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China",North China University of Technology,"Wu, D (通讯作者)，North China Univ Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,Youth Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603004]; Youth Project of Beijing Social Science Fund [17GLC064]; Outstanding Young Talent Training Plan Project of North China University of Technology [XN018035],Youth Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China; Youth Project of Beijing Social Science Fund; Outstanding Young Talent Training Plan Project of North China University of Technology,"Youth Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71603004), Youth Project of Beijing Social Science Fund (17GLC064), Outstanding Young Talent Training Plan Project of North China University of Technology (XN018035)",,14,0,0,2,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-437-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,32.0,,,,,,249,256,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426689600052,0

The results show that when the average stock holding ratio and the price volatility of the stock in the previous quarter are higher, and the beta value is lower, then it is more likely for the stock price to be manipulated.

The nature of this uncertainty is different from that of a typical uncertainty shock because of its length, breadth and political complexity. Consequently, a new firm-level survey, the Decision Maker Panel (DMP), was created to investigate this, finding three key results. First, Brexit was reported to be one of the top three sources of uncertainty for around 40 per cent of UK businesses in the two years after the vote in the June 2016 referendum, and this proportion increased further in Autumn 2018. Hence, Brexit provided both a major and persistent uncertainty shock. Second, uncertainty has been higher in industries that are more dependent on trade with the EU and on EU migrant labour. Third, the uncertainties around Brexit are primarily about the impact on businesses over the longer term rather than shorter term, including uncertainty about the timing of any transition arrangements and around the nature of Brexit.","[Bloom, Nicholas; Chen, Scarlet] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bunn, Philip; Smietanka, Pawel] Bank England, London, England; [Mizen, Paul] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Thwaites, Greg] LSE Ctr Macroecon, London, England; [Young, Garry] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, Westminster, England",Stanford University; Bank of England; University of Nottingham,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nbloom@stanford.edu; philip.bunn@bankofengland.co.uk; sijiac@stanford.edu; paul.mizen@nottingham.ac.uk; pawel.smietanka@bankofengland.co.uk; g.d.thwaites@lse.ac.uk; g.young@niesr.ac.uk,"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P010385/1]; ESRC [ES/P010385/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P010385/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The views expressed in this paper do not necessarily represent those of the Bank of England or its Committees.

The narratives of public and political discussions, as well as of some widely cited papers, suggest this possibility. In this paper, we will investigate the possible existence of such a vicious cycle. We find no evidence of a bad long-run equilibrium and cannot confirm a feedback loop leading into default as a transitory state for all but the very worst ratings. We use a bivariate semiparametric dynamic panel model to reproduce the joint dynamics of sovereign ratings and government bond yields. The individual equations resemble Pesaran-type cointegration models, which allow for valid interference regardless of whether the employed variables display unit-root behavior. To incorporate most of the empirical features previously documented (separately) in the literature, we allow for different long-run relationships in both equations, nonlinearities in the level effects of ratings, and asymmetric effects in changes of ratings and yields. Our finding of a single good equilibrium implies the slow convergence of ratings and yields toward this equilibrium. However, the persistence of ratings is sufficiently high that a rating shock can have substantial costs if it occurs at a highly speculative rating or lower. Rating shocks that drive the rating below this threshold can increase the interest rate sharply, and for a long time. Yet, simulation studies based on our estimations show that it is highly improbable that rating agencies can be made responsible for the most dramatic spikes in interest rates.

By using panel data from Japan, we estimate the matching function accounting for the spatial spillovers from neighboring regions. According to our results, job seekers in the local region compete with their counterparts in neighboring regions for jobs. This spatial competition for jobs stems from inter-regional job search, observed as spatial spillovers. Furthermore, catastrophic events, such as natural disasters, boost the magnitude of spatial spillovers in job matching.","[Higashi, Yudai] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Higashi, Yudai] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan",Kobe University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"Higashi, Y (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.;Higashi, Y (通讯作者)，Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",yudai.higashi@stu.kobe-u.ac.jp,,"Higashi, Yudai/0000-0002-9882-650X",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI) [JP18J11560],"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I would like to thank anonymous reviewers, Kazufumi Yugami, Nobuaki Hamaguchi, Keisuke Kondo, Tamotsu Nakamura, Keijiro Otsuka, Hajime Seya, Ana Maria Takahashi, Yasuhide Tanaka, and participants at the seminar at Kobe University, the 21st Wakate Kenkyusha niyoru Keizaigaku Kenkynkai, the 2016 Kansai branch meeting of the Japan Economic Policy Association, the 2017 Autumn Meeting of the Japanese Economic Association, the 31st Annual Meeting of the Applied Regional Science Conference, and the Rokko Forum for their helpful comments.

Temperature shocks have a negative and significant impact on household growth if their initial consumption lies below a critical threshold. As such, temperature shocks slow income convergence among households, at least in the short run. Crop yields and total factor productivity in agriculture are the main transmission channels. Extrapolating from short-term elasticities to long-run phenomena, these findings support the Schelling Conjecture: economic development would help poor farming households to reduce the impacts of climate change. Hence, closing the yield gap, modernizing agriculture and favouring the structural transformation of the economy are all crucial issues for adaptation of farmers to the negative effects of global warming.

The real option has a first-order effect similar to the effect of bankruptcy costs in addressing the zero-leverage puzzle: the observation that many firms seemingly forgo sizable debt benefits by remaining debt-free. The debt-free firms' value includes the option whose value is derived from future debt benefits and hedging bankruptcy costs.

While the sale-to-rent ratio of housing prices is generally regarded as a fundamental barometer of housing market health, the study of its determinants remains in its infancy. This paper examines the housing price ratio in Ireland since 2000, a period including an extreme housing market cycle. Using new data on first-time buyer loan-to-value ratios, a one-step error correction model of the housing price ratio in Ireland is presented for the first time. It finds clear evidence that, alongside user cost, credit conditions were central in determining equilibrium in the housing market. Throughout, and especially earlier in the sample, there is rapid adjustment of the housing price ratio to its implied equilibrium relation. There is evidence that the housing market regime changed during the period, in 2010 and again in 2014/2015. The preferred specifications imply that a ten percentage point increase in the median first-time buyer loan-to-value was associated with a 9% rise in sale prices, holding other factors - including rental prices and the system wide ratio of credit to deposits - constant. In addition to an understanding of the Irish market, the findings contribute to the evidence base for macroprudential policies that focus on mortgage lending and also hint at how housing market history may differ across rising and falling markets in forming expectations of capital gains.","[Lyons, Ronan C.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Lyons, Ronan C.] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London, England",Trinity College Dublin; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lyons, RC (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland.;Lyons, RC (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London, England.",ronan.lyons@tcd.ie,,"Lyons, Ronan/0000-0001-5342-987X",Balliol College Oxford,Balliol College Oxford,"I am very grateful to the editors and two anonymous referees for thorough comments which have substantially improved the analysis, to John Muellbauer for patient and diligent support as supervisor, to daft.ie and the Central Bank of Ireland for sharing data, and to Balliol College Oxford for financial support as a doctoral student that made this research possible.

Utilizing the redistribution mechanism of the Meltzer-Richard model, an equivalent frame is induced by letting subjects vote either on a proportional tax rate or an outcome equivalent minimum net income. In a series of laboratory experiments, we find that framing effects both on the individually preferred and collectively agreed level of redistribution are tremendously strong if the information tool is not available (low transparency condition). Once subjects have access to the information tool (high transparency condition), the framing effect on individually preferred tax rates is significantly reduced, and after group communication, the framing effect is washed out from the collective decision. High transparency increases redistribution if subjects have to set a redistributive tax rate and lowers redistribution if subjects have to set a minimal income. Thus, the availability of the information tool has an asymmetric effect on the level of redistribution.","[Paetzel, Fabian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany; [Paetzel, Fabian] DFG Res Grp FOR2104, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany; [Lorenz, Jan] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Focus Area Divers, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Tepe, Markus] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Social Sci, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Tepe, Markus] DFG Res Grp FOR2104, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University; Jacobs University; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Paetzel, F (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.;Paetzel, F (通讯作者)，DFG Res Grp FOR2104, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",fpaetzel@hsu-hh.de; post@janlo.de; markus.tepe@uni-oldenburg.de,"Lorenz, Jan/D-1806-2010; Tepe, Markus/AAJ-6558-2020","Lorenz, Jan/0000-0002-5547-7848; Tepe, Markus/0000-0002-6679-0346",German Research Foundation (DFG) [LO-2024/2-1]; Uni Oldenburg; research group FOR 2104 (DFG) Need-based justice and distributive procedures; [TE 1022/2-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Uni Oldenburg; research group FOR 2104 (DFG) Need-based justice and distributive procedures;,"German Research Foundation (DFG) LO -2024/2-1 (Opinion Dynamics and Collective Decision, Jan Lorenz) and research group FOR 2104 (DFG) Need-based justice and distributive procedures, Markus Tepe (TE 1022/2-1), Fabian Paetzel.

About one quarter of subjects either fully ignored the information provided or revised their beliefs inconsistently with the Bayesian learning hypothesis. We find several factors related to the subjects' numerical skills that explain information refusal and inconsistent belief revisions and discuss them in the context of health risks.","[Rheinberger, Christoph M.] European Chem Agcy, Helsinki, Finland; [Hammitt, James K.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Risk Anal, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hammitt, James K.] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",European Chemicals Agency; Harvard University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Rheinberger, CM (通讯作者)，European Chem Agcy, Helsinki, Finland.",rheinberger.cm@gmail.com; jkh@harvard.edu,,,,,,,47,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Using the data on the investments in start-ups between 1995 and 2011, I find that start-ups backed by mixed syndication in their initial financing round are less likely to survive to the next round to obtain refinancing, compared to those backed by syndication solely among PVCs. I present evidence consistent with two possible explanations of the underperformance of firms backed by mixed syndication: a potentially lower criterion of selecting portfolio companies when led by PVCs and less complementary resources but higher coordination cost in mixed syndication. The empirical results continue to hold when using instrumental variables, propensity score matching analysis and the quasi-maximum likelihood estimation method for mitigating the potential selection bias and endogeneity problems.","[Zhang, Yuejia] Univ Auckland, 12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Zhang, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, 12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",aria.zhang@auckland.ac.nz,,"Zhang, Yuejia/0000-0002-4886-2553",,,,,88,22,25,2,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Additionally, the authors have identified the demographic characteristics of the micro-firms, financing and credit associated with women who suffer economic violence. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a structured questionnaire was administered to a representative sample nationwide (357 female micro-entrepreneurs). Findings The authors found that 22.2 percent of female micro-entrepreneurs have been affected by economic violence at some point in their lives, while at the same time 25 percent of respondents have been forced by their partner to obtain credit against their will. Lower education level, living with one's partner, having children, business location in the home, lower income, not having access to credit, not applying credit to working capital needs, late payments and being forced to obtain credit against one's will were all factors associated with economic violence. Furthermore, the results showed a significant correlation between suffering economic violence and being a victim of other types of violence (including psychological, physical or sexual); the highest correlation was with serious physical violence (r=0.523, p<0.01). Research limitations/implications A limitation of this study is that the authors measured economic violence only in terms of misappropriation or theft of funds from the business, but not in terms of exacting control over economic resources, which can be a way of depriving the micro-entrepreneur of her autonomy in the management of the business. Practical implications The authors hope that the findings and conclusions reported here might open a renewed debate among academia, financial service providers, micro-firms, civil society and the public sector, providing a conceptual framework and a starting point to design effective, integrated and inter-sectoral prevention efforts. Social implications The authors recommend that efforts to reduce intimate partner violence be strengthened, taking into account the issue of gender inequality. It is not sufficient that social policy solely be designed to eliminate violence. Originality/value Previous research on gender violence has tended to examine the nature and causes of psychological, physical and sexual violence; this study, however, intends to contribute to the understanding of economic gender violence in the context of formal sector small business in a Latin American emerging market.","[Asencios-Gonzalez, Zaida; Vara-Horna, Aristides; Santi-Huaranca, Ines; Chafloque-Cespedes, Raquel; Diaz Rosillo, Alberto] Univ San Martin Porres, Lima, Peru; [Brad McBride, J.] Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad de San Martin de Porres; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Asencios-Gonzalez, Z (通讯作者)，Univ San Martin Porres, Lima, Peru.",zasenciosg@usmp.pe,"DIAZ-ROSILLO, ALBERTO/JOK-3524-2023; Chafloque Cespedes, Raquel/F-9343-2017; Vara Horna, Aristides Alfredo/F-1082-2017","DIAZ-ROSILLO, ALBERTO/0000-0001-6534-1680; Chafloque Cespedes, Raquel/0000-0003-0314-5603; Vara Horna, Aristides Alfredo/0000-0002-3107-1157; Santi-Huaranca, Ines/0000-0002-4656-5731; ASENCIOS-GONZALEZ, ZAIDA/0000-0003-0254-8208","Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura, A.C.","Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura, A.C.","The authors wish to thank the support received from the Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura, A.C.",,70,7,7,5,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of energy in China's preferential trade agreements (PTAs) and their impact on Chinese imports of oil, gas and coal. Design/methodology/approach An extended trade gravity model framework is applied to explore the dynamics of China's annualized energy import flows from the 22 economies that have PTAs with it for the period 1995-2015. Findings The effect of PTAs on trade patterns varies across the product groups and agreement clauses. The dominant factor affecting trade flows of coal, crude oil and oil products is the average tariff level. Its impact is less significant for gas imports, which are more affected by policy arrangements represented by a PTA variable. The depth and scope of a PTA do not affect Chinese energy imports patterns. Research limitations/implications This paper is focused on exploring the effect of China's trade and foreign relations strategies on its energy imports through the prism of its PTAs. Estimating the direct impact of China's initiatives in the areas of trade, investment, security, culture, etc., on its trade flows of energy products and other product groups using the methodological framework proposed in this study would contribute to better understanding of the issue. Practical implications The findings can assist both China and energy exporting countries that target Chinese market in better understanding the drivers of trade flows of energy products and design their PTA strategies accordingly. Originality/value This study applies the trade gravity model framework to assess the impact of specific components of preferential trade agreements - tariff reduction and depth and scope of agreement - on energy trade flows differentiated by product group.","[Galkin, Philipp; Bollino, Carlo Andrea; Atalla, Tarek] King Abdullah Petr Studies & Res Ctr, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Bollino, Carlo Andrea] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Galkin, P (通讯作者)，King Abdullah Petr Studies & Res Ctr, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",philipp.galkin@kapsarc.org; carlo.bollino@kapsarc.org; tarek.atalla@kapsarc.org,,"Bollino, Carlo Andrea/0000-0002-7751-7089",,,,,59,5,5,2,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Information content of the new product announcement has never been an exclusive focused stream of research. Therefore, an assessment of the impact of the content characteristics of the new product announcement on the shareholder value and the impact of source credibility (spokesperson) in making such announcements is a major gap in the existing literature. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach First, the standard event study methodology has been employed on the sample to measure the abnormal gains/losses accruing to the announcing firms. Second, moderated regression analysis (MRA) is employed to identify the characteristics of the new product announcement and to check the role of the spokesperson in creating shareholder value. Findings The results of the event study indicate that the abnormal returns are generated during the new product announcement. The results of MRA disclose the variables having a positive and a significant influence on the effective returns of the announcing companies. Likewise, the role of the spokesperson has come out brightly as a credible communicator. Originality/value The research provides a direction to the announcing companies regarding the content of the announcement leading to a positive perception among the investing community. Likewise, it also provides direction to the investor community about the characteristics of the announcement content they give weight age in forming a perception of strength in evaluating the new product announcement, to which they are largely unaware.","[Mann, Bikram Jit Singh; Babbar, Sonia] Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Univ Business Sch, Amritsar, Punjab, India",Guru Nanak Dev University,"Babbar, S (通讯作者)，Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Univ Business Sch, Amritsar, Punjab, India.",bikrammann@hotmail.com; soniababbar2008@gmail.com,"mann, bikramjit singh/G-4303-2018",,,,,,89,1,2,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Increasing trend inflation from 2 to 4 percent generates a consumption-equivalent welfare loss of about 4 percent. Welfare costs of this magnitude are driven by: staggered wage contracts, trend growth, extended borrowing, a roundabout production structure, and the interaction between trend inflation and shocks to the marginal efficiency of investment (MEI). A sticky-price model abstracting from these features generates much smaller losses. Moderate trend inflation also has important business-cycle implications, interacting much more strongly with MEI shocks than with productivity or monetary shocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence on children's experiences of household food insecurity and how food insecurity influences their dietary quality is limited for India and other low- and middle-income countries. Evidence on mid-childhood and adolescence is even scarcer. We present longitudinal evidence on household food insecurity and child diets by drawing on a mixed methods study with two cohorts of children from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (India). Analysis of survey data shows that children living in food insecure households had lower dietary diversity and probability of consumption of micronutrient- and protein-rich foods, which are critical for their healthy development. Inequalities in child dietary quality by household food security status were most pronounced at preschool age. Children identified dietary quality as a critical dimension of their well-being. From an early age, children were able to describe and explain the food security challenges of their families and recognize the negative consequences of household food insecurity on their diets, health and education. Children were not only cognizant of household responses to food insecurity, but they were also actively involved in such strategies through limiting the quantity and quality of food purchased and consumed, reducing dietary diversity, and/or engaging in work or social protection. The latter were often mentioned as critical safety nets in face of economic, demographic or climate shocks, although children expressed criticism about implementation. Longitudinal mixed methods can enhance our understanding of children's experiences of household food insecurity and its repercussion on their health and broader well-being. Child-focused evidence is key to shaping social protection implementation to context-specific needs at critical human development stages. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Theoretically, Uber's effect on transit is ambiguous: while Uber is an alternative mode of travel, it can also increase the reach and flexibility of public transit's fixed-route, fixed-schedule service. We estimate the effect of Uber on public transit ridership using a difference-in-differences design that exploits variation across U.S. metropolitan areas in both the intensity of Uber penetration and the timing of Uber entry. We find that Uber is a complement for the average transit agency, increasing ridership by five percent after two years.

First, since taxes paid in 2018 and 2019 are based on income earned respectively in 2017 and 2019, income in 2018 will not be taxed, thus giving rise to a lost year for public finances. In addition, taxpayers will lose the benefit of a one-year postponement in the tax payment, which constitutes an implicit tax increase. In this article, we evaluate the specific impacts of these two effects and the resulting global effect. The lost year results in an annual income tax reduction that is proportional to the difference between the interest rate and the growth rate. Compensating the lost year by an implicit tax increase induces the income tax receipt to increase proportionally to the nominal economic growth rate. From the taxpayers' viewpoint, we show that, whatever its precise modalities, the reform will weight unevenly in favor of the older generations to the detriment of the younger, and possibly the future, ones.","[Le Garrec, Gilles; Touze, Vincent] Sci Po OFCE, 10 Pl Catalogne, Paris, France",,"Le Garrec, G (通讯作者)，Sci Po OFCE, 10 Pl Catalogne, Paris, France.",gilles.legarrec@sciencespo.fr; vincent.touze@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The literature on civil wars has not explored the historical legacies of colonial institutions for insurgency. I address this gap in the literature, by exploiting sub-national variation in the most important internal security threat in the world's largest democracy-the Maoist insurgency in India. Within India, I focus on the crucial case of the Maoist rebels in the tribal state of Chhattisgarh in central India which epitomizes the causal mechanism of indirect rule through native princely states creating enclaves of weak state capacity, low development and tribal grievances due to natural resource exploitation. I test my theory on a new dataset at the sub district level within Chhattisgarh, and use instrumental variable regression to address endogeneity due to selection bias, combined with historical analysis and interview data to demonstrate path dependence. This study demonstrates historical origins of weak state capacity and ethnic grievances due to natural resource exploitation, which are important explanations for civil war onset. It also sets the agenda for further research on other cases where colonial indirect rule creates conditions for insurgency, like the Taliban in FATA in Pakistan, the ethnic insurgencies in Burma's peripheries, and leftist insurgencies in Nepal, Peru and Colombia.

We find that optimal bank liquidity is lower than would be the case under rational expectations, and, consequently, the banking system is more vulnerable to adverse shocks, which lead to bank runs. Asset pledgeability of surviving banks is also affected so that their capacity to raise external funds for purchasing assets of distressed banks is weakened. Further, we examine the case when asset returns are correlated through securitization. In this case adverse shocks are felt uniformly across the banking sector and banks that survive with the help of a public liquidity backstop will become risk-averse and reluctant to purchase distressed assets. Finally, we explore a government funded asset purchase program, that is implemented with an asset price target.","[Bernardin, Thomas] St Olaf Coll, Dept Econ, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Park, Hyun Woong] Denison Univ, Dept Econ, Granville, OH 43023 USA",Saint Olaf College; University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Park, HW (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, Dept Econ, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",parkhw@denison.edu; bernar1@stolaf.edu,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

With a focus on storage assets and wider natural gas market exposures, we present a gas storage valuation methodology, which uniquely uses a flexible multifactor Levy process setting that allows for consistent valuation and risk management reporting across a general derivative book. Our approach is capable of replicating the complex covariance structure of the natural gas forward curve and capturing time spread volatility, a key driver of extrinsic storage value, while being simultaneously capable of accurately calibrating to market traded options. We begin by extending a single factor Mean Reverting Variance Gamma process to an arbitrary number of dimensions and, by way of specific examples, show how the traditional Principal Component Analysis based view of gas forward curve dynamics can be incorporated into a primarily market based valuation. We develop in the process an innovative implied moments based calibration technique, which allows for efficient calibration of general multifactor forward curve models to delivery period options common in energy and commodity markets. Furthermore, to accommodate the forward curve and traded options market consistency, we propose an appropriate joint market based calibration and historical estimation methodology. Through a formal model specification analysis, we provide evidence that the multifactor Levy models we propose provide a better joint fit to NBP natural gas options-forward market data, relative to comparative benchmark models. Finally, we develop a novel multidimensional fast Fourier transform based storage valuation algorithm and provide empirical evidence that the multifactor Levy model suite is better specified to more accurately capture extrinsic value.

Recent studies consistently find support for this prediction. We consider a salience-based choice model which explains this frame-dependence of the Allais paradox. We then derive the novel prediction that the presentation format responsible for reductions in Allais-style violations of expected utility theory will also reduce Ellsberg-style violations of subjective expected utility theory. This format makes the appeal of Savage's sure thing principle more transparent. We design an experiment to test this prediction and find strong support for such frame-dependence of ambiguity aversion in Ellsberg-style choices. In particular, we observe markedly less ambiguity-averse behavior in Savage's matrix format than in a more standard prospect format.

In an environment with involuntary unemployment, this paper shows that downward nominal wage rigidity, which arises only in recessions, can generate business cycle-dependent government spending multipliers. In line with Keynesian views, a demand stimulus reduces unemployment in recessions and may not drive up inflation and wages as in expansions. Thus, the positive income effects from reduced unemployment and weaker crowding-out effects from a smaller increase in the real interest rate enhance the expansionary spending effects in recessions. The theoretical implications are largely consistent with existing empirical evidence on business cycle-dependent government spending effects on key macroeconomic variables. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It investigates long-run and short-run elasticities and causality using the ARDL bounds testing approach and vector error correction model. Main finding confirm the existence of long-run equilibrium relationships among spot-futures prices. The short and long-run elasticities exist between spot and futures prices and between crude and refined oil prices except for gasoline, with merely great dependence in the short-run. The speed of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium is overall moderate, but is faster for refined oil (compared to crude oil) on spot markets (compared to futures markets). Short run causality tests prove that futures prices lead spot prices for refined oil and that short run and long run causalities reveal that oil markets are inefficient in the short-run, but they become efficient in the long-run.","[Arfaoui, Mongi] Univ Monastir, Fac Econ & Management Mahdia, Monastir, Tunisia; [Arfaoui, Mongi] Univ Tunis El Manar, FSEG Tunis, LAFICOIF, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Monastir; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar,"Arfaoui, M (通讯作者)，Univ Monastir, Fac Econ & Management Mahdia, Monastir, Tunisia.;Arfaoui, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis El Manar, FSEG Tunis, LAFICOIF, Tunis, Tunisia.",arfaoui.mongi@gmail.com,"Mongi, Arfaoui/I-7631-2019","Mongi, Arfaoui/0000-0002-1649-3589",,,,,34,12,12,1,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

We find, however, that these challenges disappear when controlling for the quality, or its inverse, junk, of a firm. A significant size premium emerges, which is stable through time, robust to specification, not concentrated in microcaps, more consistent across seasons, and evident for non-price-based measures of size, and these results hold in 30 different industries and 24 international equity markets.

Using administrative and survey data, we assess the price shock's impact on service volume, physician labor supply, and quality of care. Primary care physicians (PCPs) in independent practices demonstrate, at most, a marginal 2 percent increase in new patient visits while horizontally and vertically integrated PCPs show no change. Both PCP organizational types witness declines in established patient visits, on average, but there is marked heterogeneity: established patient visits increase by 1 to 2 percent among PCPs with fewer Medicare claims in the pre-period. The Medicare fee bump did not observably impact other labor supply outcomes and quality of care margins.

In contract to those studies which focus on public financial markets, this paper explores a firm's MBE effect on its private loan terms, including price and non-price terms. We find that, despite the fact that banks possess superior information access and processing abilities that reduce information asymmetry costs for borrowers, they still impose more favorable price (i.e., lower loan spread) and non-price (longer loan maturity) terms for firms meeting expectations than for firms missing expectations. In addition, we find that the benefits of meeting expectations (i.e. lower loan spread and longer maturity) are more pronounced for financially distressed firms (habitual beaters) than financially sound firms (sporadic beaters). Further analyses document whether and how prospect theory can be used to explain differential loan terms.","[Chin, Chen-Lung; Yu, Po-Hsiang] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Accounting, 64,Sec 2,Jhihnan Rd, Taipei 116, Taiwan; [Chen, Mei-Hui] Natl Def Univ, Grad Sch Finance, 70,Sec 2 Zhibgyang North Rd, Taipei 112, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; National Defense University - Taiwan,"Chen, MH (通讯作者)，Natl Def Univ, Grad Sch Finance, 70,Sec 2 Zhibgyang North Rd, Taipei 112, Taiwan.",kim@nccu.edu.tw; ndmcf99005@ndu.edu.tw; 102353501@nccu.edu.tw,"yu, push/HZK-7828-2023","Yu, Po-Hsiang/0000-0001-6561-305X",National Science Council [NSC 102-2410-H-606_002],"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We acknowledge the comments from Tai Yuan Chen.

We perform a meta-analysis of correspondence tests from 25 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 2006 and 2017, containing more than 300 estimates of effects and representing a total of more than 110,000 e-mails sent to private landlords or real-estate agents. In addition to presenting overall results of recent studies, we focus on subgroups of specific correspondence tests in order to highlight the differences in ethnicity, gender, type of landlords, procedure, continent, and type of information provided in applications. We provide evidence that both gender and ethnic discrimination occur in the rental housing market in OECD countries, such that applicants with minority-sounding names and male names are discriminated against (especially Arab/Muslim applicants). Thus, ethnic majority women are the most favored in this market in OECD countries while minority men are the most disadvantaged. Moreover, we show the existence of interactions between ethnic and gender discrimination: gender discrimination is greater for minority-sounding names than for majority-sounding names. Finally, it seems that realestate agents discriminate significantly less against minority applicants than private landlords do. This would seem to be at least in part because private landlords display significant statistical discrimination while real-estate agents do not. These results are robust to the estimation methods used (random effects, fixed-effects, and unrestricted weighted least squares methods).","[Flage, Alexandre] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, 30 Ave Observ,BP 1559, F-25009 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte,"Flage, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, 30 Ave Observ,BP 1559, F-25009 Besancon, France.",alexandre.flage@edu.univ-fcomte.fr,,"Flage, Alexandre/0000-0001-8414-6143",French National Research Agency (DALTON project) [ANR-15-CE28-0004],French National Research Agency (DALTON project),"The author is grateful to Massimo Baldini, Samanta Friedman, Vojta Barto, Angeles Carnero, Andrew R.

Long-term risky investments, such as research and development, can suffer the most from this problem as their payoff comes long after CEOs retire. To mitigate such behavior, most executive compensation contracts include long-term performance incentives. In this study, we hypothesize that long-term debt-like compensation in the form of defined benefit pension can make the career horizon problem more severe. We empirically examine the impact of managerial opportunism, influenced by pension compensation, on the research and development investments. We find that on average UK CEOs do not curtail research and development as their career horizons become shorter. But, the defined-benefit pension component of executive compensation leads CEOs, who are closer to retirement, to decrease R&D investments. Our results imply that executive compensation contracts need to be appropriately adjusted when managers approach retirement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The research sample consisted of 220 students, 16-17 years old. The experiment was chosen as the basic research method. The authors' research focuses first on building a case study. This was subsequently verified experimentally in the second research phase, and its effect on the development of higher cognitive dimensions was evaluated. Relevant research tools were developed, including a case study adapted to each age group of students with a focus on relevant educational content and two non-standardized professional tests in the form of a post-test that was uniformly designed for the experimental and control group to determine the range of effects at the level of development of lower and higher-order thinking processes that the implemented methods can produce. The tests took into account the age of students, content and cognitive difficulty. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney u-test was chosen to verify null hypotheses at 5% significance. The results indicate that the application of metacognitive learning strategies at an adequate age and adequate level of cognitive abilities of students are the assumption of financial literacy and entrepreneurship support. Using activating teaching methods through the implementation of the case study method is more successful and effective in the development of higher-order thinking operations than the established traditional methods, which are still nowadays overused by teachers. This means that methods have a significant impact on the development of higher cognitive dimensions, which are the fundamental assumption of a successful career for economists and corporate managers.

Committee membership allows for a determination as to whether legislators sort themselves into committees that are more consistent with an objective to win the next election in their electoral district, or more consistent with gaining a more prestigious position in their party. Using data from three large German states, we find that legislators elected in the electoral system's majoritarian tier more often become members of district committees, i.e., committees that might give politicians greater opportunity than others to obtain government funds for the benefit of their home districts. This effect is strongest for legislators who won district elections by narrow margins.

A comparison of Kenya and Ghana,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Renewable energy; Investment; Africa,HYBRID POWER MARKETS; ELECTRICITY; SECTOR; INTEGRATION,"Policymakers in Sub-Saharan Africa face several choices to increase levels of access to electricity under severe budget constraints. First, they need to prioritise technologies that can supply electricity at a low cost. Second, they need to design and implement appropriate policies to attract private investment. On the first choice, renewable energy is becoming increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. Moreover, it contributes to energy security and environmental sustainability, while providing access to new sources of (sustainable) finance. On the second choice, developing countries typically face a multitude of constraints to attract investment to their energy sector. It can be daunting and expensive to address them all at once. This paper presents a new methodology to support policymakers to better target policies for the promotion of commercial-scale renewable energy investment. The methodology, which we call Green Investment Diagnostics draws upon the Growth Diagnostics framework, extensively used in the field of Development Economics to identify the binding constraints to economic growth. It is operationalised with a decision tree analysis that builds cumulative evidence to prioritise some constraints over others, through the review of indicators and validation through expert interviews. We apply this approach to Kenya and Ghana, finding that Ghana's key constraints to investment in renewable energy are an unreliable off-taker, macroeconomic imbalances, regulatory uncertainty, pressures to keep prices low, as well as insufficient and costly domestic finance. Kenya instead offers generous returns to investment in renewables but faces a low demand, a lack of networking infrastructure and problems of governance and social acceptance, exacerbated by uncertain land property rights and rent-seeking.

In current practice, progress is frequently measured using the multidimensional poverty index. While elegant and useful, the multidimensional poverty index is inconsistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights principles of indivisibility, inalienability, and equality. We argue that a first-order dominance (FOD) methodology maintains basic consistency with these principles. Specifically, FOD comparisons are independent of any applied weighting schemes and hence are free from assumptions regarding substitutability between included welfare indicators (indivisibility). FOD cannot be established when welfare in any indicator is deteriorating, no matter how great the advancement is in other indicators (inalienability). Finally, FOD requires that domination occurs throughout the population (equality), implying that welfare gains among better-off groups never offset welfare losses among worse-off groups. We discuss and compare the properties of the multidimensional poverty index and first-order dominance approach and apply both measures to 26 African countries using data near 2002 and 2012. Results across the two measures are broadly similar but not the same. For example, while the multidimensional poverty index suggests that all countries are advancing, FOD indicates that 14 countries experience broad-based progress, two countries show more moderate likelihoods of progress, and the remaining 10 countries neither improve nor deteriorate in terms of attainment of rights for the dimensions considered. We conclude that the multidimensional poverty index and first-order dominance approaches are useful complements that should be employed in tandem. (C) 2018 UNU-WIDER.

Using a sample of US bank holding companies from 2001 to 2015, we provide evidence that the relationship between size and bank's market to book value of assets is inverse U-shaped and that monitoring costs offset the benefits from economies of scale.

We use a questionnaire survey to collect data from 325 SMEs in the semi-arid regions of Kenya and Senegal and analyze this information to estimate the quality of current adaptation measures, distinguishing between sustainable and unsustainable adaptation. We then study the link between these current adaptation practices and adaptation planning for future climate change. We find that financial barriers are a key reason why firms resort to unsustainable adaptation, while general business support, access to information technology and adaptation assistance encourages sustainable adaptation responses. Engaging in adaptation today also increases the likelihood that a firm is preparing for future climate change. The finding lends support to the strategy of many development agencies who use adaptation to current climate variability as a way of building resilience to future climate change. There is a clear role for public policy in facilitating good adaptation. The ability of firms to respond to climate risks depends in no small measure on factors such as business environment that can be shaped through policy intervention.

We show that warehouses become banks because their superior storage technology allows them to enforce the repayment of loans most effectively. Further, interbank markets emerge endogenously to support this enforcement mechanism. Even though warehouses store deposits of real goods, they make loans by writing new fake warehouse receipts, rather than by taking deposits out of storage. Our theory helps to explain how modern banks create funding liquidity and why they combine warehousing (custody and deposit-taking), lending, and private money creation within the same institutions.

Coastal communities are subject to a wide range of stressors related to climate change, including biological resource decline and natural hazards. Small historically natural-resource-dependent communities are particularly vulnerable because of their close reliance on ecosystem goods and services that are likely to be affected by climate change (e.g., fisheries, forests) and their limited access to outside technical and financial resources needed for adaptation. Exogenous adaptation policies, while helpful for fostering new behavioral adjustments to address resource decline and natural hazards, can in some cases exacerbate socioeconomic disruption, further burdening communities already struggling to adapt. This paper presents an investigation of how six historically natural-resource-dependent coastal communities in Oregon, USA, have experienced and responded to external stressors and how adaptation in these communities has been shaped by interactions between past and present practices, processes, and vulnerabilities. Despite climate-related impacts identified by the scientific community, climate change was not salient in the community members' reports of stressors and impacts, and thus was not a trigger of adaptation. Rather, communities were responding to stressors associated with decades of declines in natural resource industries, an economic recession, restrictive natural resource management and land use policies, demographic change, and natural hazards. These findings confirm other research findings that chronic everyday problems, including those related to the maintenance of livelihoods, or consequences of inadequate livelihoods, often eclipse potentially disastrous threats in the minds of rural community members, thereby influencing adaptation strategies. In some cases communities do not prioritize such threats because people have come to accept living with them, or they feel powerless and unable to change the circumstances of daily life. The findings improve understanding of adaptation in natural-resource based coastal communities in the USA and support the need for policy makers and planners to integrate climate change adaptation into livelihood improvement strategies.

An extended household possibly has both a demand and a supply of elder caregiving by children-in-law. A patrilocal version of the model, inspired from traditional Chinese marriage institutions adopted by a number of countries in the Far East, leads to derived demands for caregiving by daughters-in-law and supplies of caregiving by families of daughters. Market equilibrium prices for caregiving by children-in-law are established. These prices then provide incentives to which individual households respond. Payments can be made during, before, or after marriage. The model can throw light on gender differences in marital happiness, differences in the impact of eldercare on the health of in-family caregivers and on their happiness, and East/West and regional differences in caregiving obligations of family members. It also suggests that these geographic differentials may be related to variation in family institutions, including variation in the prevalence of dowry and brideprice. The policy relevance of the model is discussed.","[Grossbard, Shoshana] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Grossbard, Shoshana] IZA Inst Labor Econ, Bonn, Germany",California State University System; San Diego State University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Grossbard, S (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",shosh@mail.sdsu.edu,"Grossbard, Shoshana/I-7038-2012; Grossbard, Shoshana/IWV-0194-2023","Grossbard, Shoshana/0000-0002-4884-8225; Grossbard, Shoshana/0000-0002-4884-8225",Asian Development Bank Institute,Asian Development Bank Institute,Asian Development Bank Institute.,,53,2,2,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Although many developing countries have made strong efforts to expand the coverage of education services, children in poor households still struggle to attend school on a regular basis. Human development conditional cash transfers (known as CCTs) have emerged in response to this situation in developing countries. While the effects of the CCTs are well known and widely documented, their effects in relation to educational attainment and school participation are still unclear. This paper looks empirically into the continuous treatment effects of participation length in Familias en Accion, a CCT program in Colombia. The paper focuses on the continuous treatment effects on school registration and educational attainment of participants in the program. Although initial results show a fuzzy relationship between the program outcomes and the participation length, the empirical results confirm the fact that a longer exposure to the antipoverty program led to higher school registration rates, accumulation of years of education, and lower child labor participation levels.","[Villa, Juan M.] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Villa, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",juan.villa@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Regret and rejoicing are two emotions that are defined by comparing the result of an action retained by an agent with respect to the result that he could have obtained from an alternative action. We show that the choice of the alternative action impacts the allocation of risky assets. When it is defined in relation to the ex post maximum expected result, the agent only receives regret. This may lead, for low values of the marginal cost of risk, to retain more risky assets than an agent who maximized a standard expected utility function. On the contrary, the agent could express a preference for certainty and defines his emotions in relation to what a total investment in risk-free assets would bring to him. In this case, we show that investment in risky assets is weaker than the one realized by an agent who maximized a standard expected utility function.","[Bien, Franck] Univ Paris 09, PSL Res Univ, LEDa, LEGOS, F-75016 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et oceanographie spatiales,"Lanzi, T (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, PSL Res Univ, LEDa, F-75016 Paris, France.",franck.bien@dauphine.fr; thomas.lanzi@dauphine.fr,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We conjecture that the government censors negative news and promotes positive news in Chinese media, leading to the premium on A-shares, which are mainly traded by domestic investors. We find that the ratio of positive to negative news is substantially higher for Chinese newspapers than English news-papers. Such favouritism is found to inflate the price of domestic A-shares and contribute to the discount of foreign B-shares from the same firms. We also provide evidence that B-share investors pay more attention to bad news, while A-share investors pay more attention to good news. Our findings suggest that the news perception distorted by media censorship helps to explain the foreign share discount puzzle and has important implications for international capital flows.

We examine how ex ante management is an opportunity to influence the ex post conditions, which in turn affect the ex post optimal outcome. To capture these ex ante management choices, we extend the Poisson collapse model of Reed and Heras (Bull Math Biol 54:185-207, 1992) to allow for endogenous initial conditions and ex post multi-stability. We account for two uncertain processes: the introduction and establishment of the pathogen. Introduction is conditional on anthropogenic investments in prevention, and both random processes are conditional on how we manage the native population to provide natural prevention of invasion and natural insurance against establishment placing the system in an undesirable basin of attraction. We find that both multi-stability of the invaded system and these uncertainty processes can create economic non-convexities that yield multiple candidate solutions to the ex ante optimization problem.

In contrast, a positive association has been reported for high growth. Executive cash compensation is positively associated with discretionary accruals and negatively with firm value. Firms that pay cash compensation are likely to engage in earnings manipulation when their actual credit ratings differ from their expected ratings.

The model incorporates the insiders-outsiders labor market structure and the concept of an elite government. Outsiders form a group of workers that supply labor to a competitive private sector. And, insiders form a group of workers that enjoy market power in supplying labor to the public sector and influence the policy decisions of government, including those that affect the development and maintenance of public sector infrastructures. This leads to labor misallocation and inefficient fiscal policies. Thus, even though expanding public sector output has a positive effect on growth, eventually this is counterbalanced by the labor misallocation and inefficient tax policy outcomes leading to a growth reversal phenomenon.

Yet in cases found throughout the developing world, privatizing the commons has destroyed wealth. To explain this phenomenon, we develop a theory of wealth-destroying private property rights. Privatization's effect on social wealth depends on whether privatizing an asset confers net gains or imposes net losses on society. The decision to privatize, however, depends on whether privatizing an asset confers net gains or imposes net losses on property decision makers. When decision makers are residual claimants, these effects move in tandem; privatization occurs only if it creates social wealth. When decision makers are not residual claimants, these effects may diverge; privatization occurs if it benefits decision makers personally even if privatization destroys social wealth.

We quantify the impacts of liberalisation of the EU-Africa aviation market on air fare and service frequency using a two-stage least squares model approach. The analysis shows that inter-continental air services between Europe and Africa are mainly governed by bilateral agreements negotiated between the individual countries of the EU and the various African governments. Compared to the developments in the links between Africa and the rest of the world, the EU-Africa market appears to be losing momentum. The results of the econometric model suggest that EU-Africa routes which experienced liberalisation over the period 2002 and 2016 had 28% higher departure frequency and 14% lower fares than those routes without such a regime change. Furthermore, the results show that the presence of a low-cost carrier reduces fare by 31%.","[Njoya, Eric Tchouamou; Nikitas, Alexandros] Univ Huddersfield, Dept Logist Operat Hospitality & Mkt, Huddersfield Business Sch, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Christidis, Panayiotis] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, ES-41092 Seville, Spain",University of Huddersfield; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Njoya, ET (通讯作者)，Univ Huddersfield, Dept Logist Operat Hospitality & Mkt, Huddersfield Business Sch, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.",E.Njoya@hud.ac.uk; Panayotis.Christidis@ec.europa.eu; a.nikitas@hud.ac.uk,"Christidis, Panayotis/X-6004-2019","Christidis, Panayotis/0000-0002-0921-9039; Tchouamou Njoya, Eric/0000-0002-1799-9469; /0000-0002-6384-9031",,,,,41,17,17,0,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Earlier studies suggest that motorists are more exposed to air pollutants than are active transportation users. However, because of their level of physical activity, cyclists also inhale more air pollutants. The main objective of this paper is to measure individuals' levels of exposure to air pollution (nitrogen dioxide similar to NO2) and road traffic noise according to their use of different modes of transportation. Three teams of three people each were formed: one person would travel by bicycle, one by public transit, and the third by car. Nearly one hundred trips were made, from various outlying Montreal neighbourhoods to the downtown area at 8 am, and in the opposite direction at 5 pm. The use of mixed models demonstrated that public transit commuters' and cyclists' levels of exposure to noise are significantly greater than motorists' exposure. Again, using mixed models, we found that although the levels of exposure to the NO2 pollutant do not significantly differ among the three modes, the inhaled doses of NO2 pollutant are more than three times higher for cyclists than for motorists due to their stronger ventilation rate. It is hardly surprising that the benefits of physical activity are of course greater for cyclists: they bum 3.63 times more calories than motorists. This ratio is also higher for public transport users (1.73) who combine several modes (walking, bus and/or subway and walking).","[Apparicio, Philippe; Gelb, Jeremy; Carrier, Mathieu] Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Societe, 385 Sherbrooke St East, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada; [Mathieu, Marie-Eve] Univ Montreal, Dept Kinesiol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Kingham, Simon] Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Geohlth Lab, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand",University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS); Universite de Montreal; University of Canterbury,"Apparicio, P (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Societe, 385 Sherbrooke St East, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada.",philippe.apparicio@ucs.inrs.ca,"; Apparicio, Philippe/K-6086-2013","Kingham, Simon/0000-0002-2869-3756; Gelb, Jeremy/0000-0002-7114-2714; Apparicio, Philippe/0000-0001-6466-9342",Canada Research Chair in Environmental Equity [950-230813],Canada Research Chair in Environmental Equity,"The authors would like to thank the students of INRS Urbanisation Culture Societe involved in this research for their time and cooperation, and the three anonymous reviewers for their careful reading of our manuscript and their many insightful comments and suggestions.

In a conflict setting such as Western Darfur, the education system has been destroyed, leaving millions of children out of schools. Various stakeholders, namely UNICEF and non-governmental organizations, have taken initiatives to rebuild schools and include all children since the beginning of the conflict in 2003. However, very little evidence is available to date on the education of children with disabilities living in conflict and post-conflict situations. Between the 1st of October 2008 and the 28th of February 2009, we carried out a household survey in all localities and settlements in the rural council of Urn Kher, part of the locality of Wadi Salih in the state of West Darfur, Sudan. We interviewed 11,089 heads of household about activity limitations and functioning difficulties associated with a health problem among all family members using a validated screening instruments, as well as 1436 children on various aspects of access to education, learning outcomes and psychological wellbeing. We found that in a context of protracted conflict, all children are at high risk of being excluded from schools and not learning when in school. We also found that children with disabilities were at higher risk of poorer psychological wellbeing, particularly those children with behavioral and mood disorders, as well as associated disabilities. In a context of conflict and protracted crisis such as Darfur, promoting education requires a lot of external effort to ensure access and positive learning outcomes for all children, including children with disabilities. Our study shows poor basic cognitive learning outcomes for all children and the limited effectiveness of the protection of children in schools. Improving learning outcomes and mental wellbeing of vulnerable children in conflict, crisis and protracted crisis contexts require multilevel and multipronged interventions within and outside schools.

In particular, we show that if the central bank does not intervene by monetary easing following a crisis, an aggregate demand externality makes borrowing ex ante inefficient.

The model incorporates long-term impacts of consumption shortfalls, induced by optimal 'asset smoothing' coping behavior of the vulnerable, on poverty. The analysis shows the long-term level and depth of poverty can be improved by incorporating 'vulnerability-targeted social protection' into a conventional social protection system. The paper further shows insurance-based vulnerability-targeted social protection dominates (in economic growth and poverty reduction measures) both in-kind transfers and asset-based vulnerability-targeted protection. We then stress test social protection mechanisms and find the relative performance of insurance-based vulnerability-targeted social protection improves when subjected to current pessimistic projections about increasing drought risk. However, if drought risk increases beyond current climate change projections, then even the vulnerability-targeted policy loses its ability to stabilize the extent and depth of poverty.","[Carter, Michael R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Janzen, Sarah A.] Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, POB 17920, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Janzen, SA (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, POB 17920, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",sarah.janzen@montana.edu,,,World Bank,World Bank(The World Bank India),"The authors wish to thank the World Bank for financial support, and Harold Alderman, Mook Bangalore, Stephane Hallegatte, Rasmus Heltberg, Peter Lanjouw, Matthew McLaughlin, Emmanuel Skoufias, Adrien Vogt-Schilb, Steve Vosti, participants at the World Bank Climate Change and Poverty Conference, the Midwest International Economic Development Conference, and the Georgia State University Center for the Economic Analysis of Risk's Food Security and Sustainable Supply Chains Workshop, and seminar audiences at Michigan State University and the University of Washington for helpful comments.

The implications of such an approach to politics were not obvious and took decades to be worked out. Indeed, they are still being worked out. The result was a new field of research that deepened our understanding of economic and political systems and their many interdependencies. This review essay provides an overview of the core findings of public choice during its first half century and of the boot-strapping process through which those findings emerged. Those core findings provide the idea base and results that ground most contemporary public choice research.","[Congleton, Roger D.] West Virginia Univ, Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Congleton, RD (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",roger.congleton@mail.wvu.edu,,,,,,,71,8,9,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2018,175.0,3-4,,,,,229,244,,10.1007/s11127-018-0545-1,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GG9QZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433037400002,0

This eliminates backdating but creates other agency problems: Chief executive officers (CEOs) aware of upcoming option grants have an incentive to temporarily depress stock prices to obtain lower strike prices. We show that some CEOs have manipulated stock prices to increase option compensation, documenting negative abnormal returns before scheduled option grants and positive abnormal returns afterward. These returns are explained by measures of CEOs' incentives and ability to influence stock prices. We document several mechanisms used to lower stock price, including changing the substance and timing of disclosures.","[Daines, Robert M.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [McQueen, Grant R.; Schonlau, Robert J.] Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Business, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Stanford University; Brigham Young University,"Daines, RM (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",daines@stanford.edu; mcqueen@byu.edu; robert.schonlau@byu.edu,"Schonlau, Robert/AAB-2395-2021",,William Edwards Professorship; Brigham Young University Silver Fund; Whitmore Global Management Center; Stanford University's Rock Center for Corporate Governance,William Edwards Professorship; Brigham Young University Silver Fund; Whitmore Global Management Center; Stanford University's Rock Center for Corporate Governance,"We appreciate helpful comments from an anonymous referee, Yakov Amihud, Louca Christodoulos, Jeff Coles, Michael Drake, Jarrad Harford the editor), William Hubbard, Dirk Jenter, Wei Jiang, Marcel Kahan, Steven Kaplan, Jonathan Karpoff, Ron Kasznik, Mike Klausner, Dave Larcker, Erik Lie, Allan McCall, Todd Mitton, Brennan Platt, Ryan Pratt, and David Yermack, as well as seminar participants at Brigham Young University, University of Chicago, Columbia University, Harvard University, Northwestern University, New York University, Stanford University, Yale University, the 2013 American Law and Economics Association conference, and the 2014 European Financial Management Association conference.

For universities to fulfil this role, students need reliable information about the teaching on offer at different universities, but no such data are currently available.

No two universities offer identical teaching. There is large variation in contact hours and even larger variation in teaching intensity, across both universities and departments. We combine our data with existing data to investigate the relationship that teaching has with university and student characteristics. We find that how much teaching students receive is uncorrelated with tuition fee; that teaching has little predictive power in explaining student satisfaction; and that physics students consistently receive more teaching than either economics or history students.","[Huxley, Gervas] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Mayo, Jennifer] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Peacey, Mike W.] New Coll Humanities, London, England; [Richardson, Maddy] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",University of Bristol; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Cambridge,"Huxley, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.",gervas.huxley@bristol.ac.uk; jenmayo@umich.edu; mike.peacey@nchlondon.ac.uk; mr701@cam.ac.uk,,"Peacey, Michael/0009-0008-2781-7949",Centre for Markets and Public Organisation (CMPO) through ESRC [ES/H005331/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Centre for Markets and Public Organisation (CMPO) through ESRC; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This project benefited from funding from the Centre for Markets and Public Organisation (CMPO) through ESRC grant number ES/H005331/1.

As growth in travel demand continues to outstrip improvements in the fuel efficiency of air travel, the aviation contribution to climate change is likely to grow substantially. Consequently, measures that effectively reduce travel demand are required if atmospheric carbon concentrations are to be limited. The efficacy of the Australian Clean Energy Future policy which placed a $23.00AUD (FY 2012) to $24.15 AUD (FY 2013) per tonne levy on carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions from July 2012 to June 2014 is tested. Specifically, time-series regression is used to estimate the effect of this carbon price policy on the level of domestic passenger kilometres flown in Australia, while adjusting for costs of production (i.e. fuel and labour costs), economic activity (i.e. gross domestic product), competitive effects (i.e. airline capacity), and exogenous shocks. There was no evidence that the carbon price reduced the level of domestic aviation in Australia. Carbon pricing measures may have to be levied at a greater rate to affect behavioural change, particularly given the limited potential for future aviation efficiency gains.","[Markham, Francis] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Arts & Social Sci, Acton, ACT, Australia; [Young, Martin] Southern Cross Univ, Sch Business & Tourism, Lismore, NSW, Australia; [Reis, Arianne] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Sci & Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Higham, James] Univ Otago, Dept Tourism, Dunedin, New Zealand",Australian National University; Southern Cross University; Western Sydney University; University of Otago,"Markham, F (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Aboriginal Econ Policy Res, 24 Kingsley St, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",francis.markham@anu.edu.au,"Markham, Francis/H-5471-2019; Reis, Arianne/I-6805-2013","Markham, Francis/0000-0002-4266-2569; Reis, Arianne/0000-0002-1630-8857",,,,,69,23,23,4,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Identification strategies exploit trend changes in international gold prices after 2002 and regional gold production capabilities as measured by water supply (the majority of gold mining in Colombia is placer mining and water is important for industrial gold production). I find that the gold boom decreases local unemployment in the short term by 3.5%. However, given the lack of capacity to effectively ban child labor, these economic opportunities are also available for children. My results indicate that, because of the gold boom, the probability that a child works increases by 9.3% and school attendance decreases by 23.9%. Capital accumulation seems to be permanently hurt since the probability that a child is lagging three or more grades behind increases by 9%. These effects are only discernible after 2002. The human capital results can be retrieved from different databases. Furthermore, results are robust to a series of robustness checks (restricting the sample to gold producers and their neighbors, using alternative sets of controls and restricting the sample to non-migrants). Resources are a blessing in the short term but a curse for long term economic growth if human capital is productive. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To that aim, we define the nth-order utility premium as a measure of pain associated with facing the passage of one risk to a more severe one and we examine some of its properties. Changes in risk are expressed through the concept of stochastic dominance of order n. The paper investigates more particularly welfare changes of merging increases in risk, first ignoring background risks, then taking them into account. Merging increases in risk may be beneficial or not, depending on whether background risks are considered and how. The paper also provides conditions on individual preferences for superadditivity of the nth-order utility premium.

Simple mean value comparisons reveal no statistically significant differences in fertilizer and pesticide expenditures between off-farm work participants and nonparticipants. However, econometric estimation with a treatment effects model shows a negative selection bias. After controlling for this bias, the empirical results show that participation in off-farm work exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on fertilizer and pesticide expenditures.

We use recent advances in panel econometrics that allow for spatial heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, and non-stationary but cointegrated data. We test for spatial differences and analyze the relationship between the price elasticity of housing supply and the income elasticity of prices, as well as bubble size and duration. The long-term elasticity of house prices with respect to aggregate personal income averages 0.81, but varies considerably across metropolitan areas. The long-term income elasticity generally is greater in the more supply inelastic metropolitan areas, and we show that bubble size and duration are inversely related to supply elasticity.

However, the evidence about the impacts of ICTs vis-a-vis other innovation activities on technological and nontechnological innovation and productivity for developing countries is extremely scarce. This scarcity of research is particularly acute for the services sector, especially when it comes to assessing how it fares in comparison with the manufacturing sector. Our research contributes to closing this knowledge gap by estimating a Crepon, Duguet and Mairesse (CDM)-type three-stage model for Uruguayan data. The results show that ICTs play a bigger role for innovation and productivity in services than in manufacturing. At the same time, nontechnological innovations provide a more important contribution to firm productivity in the services sector than in the manufacturing sector.","[Aboal, Diego; Tacsir, Ezequiel] Ctr Invest Econ CINVE, Ave Uruguay 1242, Montevideo 11100, Uruguay; [Aboal, Diego] Univ ORT Uruguay, Bvar Espana 2633, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Aboal, Diego] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Ave Gonzalo Ramirez 1926, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Tacsir, Ezequiel] UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands","University ORT Uruguay; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Maastricht University","Aboal, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Invest Econ CINVE, Ave Uruguay 1242, Montevideo 11100, Uruguay.;Aboal, D (通讯作者)，Univ ORT Uruguay, Bvar Espana 2633, Montevideo, Uruguay.;Aboal, D (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Ave Gonzalo Ramirez 1926, Montevideo, Uruguay.",aboal@cinve.org.uy; tacsir@unu.merit.edu,"Tacsir, Ezequiel/ABF-2337-2021","Tacsir, Ezequiel/0000-0002-2803-2990; Aboal, Diego/0000-0002-6217-962X",Public Capacity Building Korea Fund,Public Capacity Building Korea Fund,"This paper was part of a research project led by the Competitiveness and Innovation Division (CTI) of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), with the financial support of the Public Capacity Building Korea Fund.

Such restrictions are expected to limit the youth cohort's access to income opportunities in the formal economy, and thus lower the youth-specific opportunity cost of insurrection activities. We develop a theoretical model of insurrection markets and integrate the youth cohort's relative size. In equilibrium, a binding labor-market constraint interacts with the youth bulge in determining the level of insurrection activities within the society. We test the implications of our model on a sample of 135 non-OECD countries in the post-Cold War period and find the effect of the youth cohort's relative size on conflict onsets to be moderated by changes in the labor-market conditions as measured by unemployment rates. Generally, the results provide evidence that the underlying institutional setting shapes the conflict potential inherent in a given demographic structure.","[Apolte, Thomas; Gerling, Lena] Univ Munster, Ctr Interdisciplinary Econ, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Apolte, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Ctr Interdisciplinary Econ, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany.",apolte@wwu.de; lena.gerling@uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,82,7,7,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2018,175.0,1-2,,,,,63,93,,10.1007/s11127-018-0514-8,0.0,,,31,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GA6QA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428457000004,0

These expectations might then in turn shape individuals' investment behaviors, potentially affecting their incomes in subsequent years. As part of an emerging literature on endogenous preferences, economists have begun studying the consequences that exposure to natural disasters have on risk attitudes, perceptions, and behavior. We add to this field by studying the impact of being struck by the December 2012 Cyclone Evan on Fijian households' risk attitudes and subjective expectations about the likelihood and severity of natural disasters over the next 20 years. The randomness of the cyclone's path allows us to estimate the causal effects of exposure on both risk attitudes and risk perceptions. Our results show that being struck by an extreme event substantially changes individuals' risk perceptions as well as their beliefs about the frequency and magnitude of future shocks. However, we find sharply distinct results for the two ethnicities in our sample, indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians; the impact of the natural disaster aligns with previous results in the literature on risk attitudes and risk perceptions for Indo-Fijians, whereas they have little to no impact on those same measures for indigenous Fijians.

Mobility is an important criterion for cruise destinations, besides being an economic resource for the city. The massification of destinations is forcing the adoption of sustainable approaches based on public transport. Starting with a comparative study of the main Mediterranean cruise ports, we define four indicators to identify different levels of the pressure range relating the volume of passengers to the local population, the level of port infrastructure, and the condition of the homeport. The results are classified into four settings, whose geographical distribution confirms the inherent imbalance of cruise ship activity in the Mediterranean. The dependence of a port on its status as a tourist destination, in addition to its geographical and urban conditions, facilitates the development of sustainable public transport as compared with the main destinations.","[Rosa-Jimenez, Carlos; Andrade, Maria J.; Nebot, Nuria] Univ Malaga, Inst Habitat Tourism Terr, Univ Politecn Cataluna, Edificio Ada Byron,Campus Teatinos S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Perea-Medina, Beatriz] Univ Malaga, Andalucia Tech, Escuela Politecn Super, Campus Teatinos S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universidad de Malaga,"Rosa-Jiménez, C (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Inst Habitat Tourism Terr, Univ Politecn Cataluna, Edificio Ada Byron,Campus Teatinos S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",cjrosa@uma.es,"ANDRADE MARQUES, MARIA JOSE/AAD-2714-2022; Rosa-Jimenez, Carlos/R-7084-2019","ANDRADE MARQUES, MARIA JOSE/0000-0002-6104-6569; Rosa-Jimenez, Carlos/0000-0001-6356-8734; Perea Medina, Beatriz/0000-0002-3824-9464; Nebot Gomez de Salazar, Nuria/0000-0001-6187-0972",,,,,57,25,26,3,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We apply an extended organizational capabilities model by integrating Porter's value chain model and Grant's hierarchy of organizational capabilities. Starting from differences in entrepreneurial orientation between architecture and real estate development firms, we argue that under higher environmental uncertainty, network capabilities are more important for the performance of architecture firms whereas managerial capabilities are more important for the performance of real estate development firms. Employing data from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, the research results support the hypotheses. This study integrates Porter's value chain concept and the organizational capabilities model and delivers a contribution to the organizational capability theory. In addition, it contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by showing that network capabilities are more important for creating competitive advantage in entrepreneurial firms than in other firms.","[Sreckovic, Marijana] TU Wien, Dept Ind Bldg & Interdisciplinary Planning, Karlspl 13-234-2, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Sreckovic, M (通讯作者)，TU Wien, Dept Ind Bldg & Interdisciplinary Planning, Karlspl 13-234-2, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",marijana.sreckovic@tuwien.ac.at,,"Sreckovic, Marijana/0000-0003-3990-7702",TU Wien (TUW),TU Wien (TUW),Open Access funding provided by TU Wien (TUW).,,91,26,30,6,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Our analysis investigates whether saving promotion can effectively increase savings, consumption, and future-oriented investments in Sub-Saharan Africa. In an extensive search of 28 academic and policy focused databases in the fields of economics, psychology, and social sciences, 9330 titles and abstracts of published and unpublished studies were screened and 27 randomized controlled trials on saving promotion interventions fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 24 studies reporting on an aggregated sample of 87,025 individuals provided sufficient information to be included in the meta-analysis. Robust variance estimations of pooled effect sizes show small but significant impacts on poverty reduction, including increases in household expenditures and incomes, higher returns from family businesses, and improved food security. They also show positive and significant impacts on more intermediate outcomes including total savings, pro-saving attitudes, financial literacy, and investments in small-scale family businesses. Our results do not show significant effects on assets, housing quality, education, or health. Results from meta-regressions suggest that supply-based programs are superior to demand enhancing program types such as financial education. They further reveal reduced program effectiveness for women. Overall, findings from this analysis suggest that saving promotion schemes are highly relevant in reducing poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, and that future efforts should focus on expansion of banking services to the poor as well as gender-sensitive programming.

We use risk premium computed from corporate credit spreads to measure a firm's exposure to systematic variation in default risk. Unlike previously used measures, the credit risk premium explicitly accounts for the non-diversifiable component of distress risk. In contrast to prior findings in the literature, we find that stocks with higher systematic default risk exposures have higher expected equity returns which are largely explained by the Fama-French risk factors. We confirm the robustness of these results by using an alternative systematic default risk factor for firms that do not have bonds outstanding.","[Anginer, Deniz] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Yildizhan, Celim] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA",The World Bank; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Anginer, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,"Yıldızhan, Çelim/HPP-2576-2023; Yıldızhan, Çelim/ABI-3815-2020","Yıldızhan, Çelim/0000-0001-7323-982X; Yıldızhan, Çelim/0000-0001-7323-982X",,,,,57,13,14,5,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

The unit of analysis is an approximately 50 km x 50 km cell that is tiled across the continent to form a grid of roughly 10,500 cells. I aggregate geotagged aid from each donor into the grid cells in three ways: a binary measure marking if a cell received any aid, the count of aid projects per cell, and each cell's dollar value of aid. I operationalize poverty at the grid cell level in five ways: light at night, mean travel time from the cell to a major city, distance from the centroid of the cell to the recipient's capital city, and cell-level estimates of child malnutrition and infant mortality. I test for the influence of each poverty variable in models that control for the population within each cell and include recipient country fixed effects. Aid flows to richer rather than poorer cells.

A one standard deviation increase in the union power faced by the acquirer increases the odds of choosing cash payment by a factor ranging from 1.26 to 1.57. The effect is stronger when: the acquiring firm is located in states without the right-to-work laws; the interests of managers are more aligned with shareholders in acquiring firms; and acquiring firms' asset specificity is high. When union power is strong, acquirers making cash payment are associated with a significantly positive announcement return. In addition, they are less likely to experience labor strikes or declines in operating performance, and more likely to obtain wage concessions in collective bargaining in the post-acquisition period than acquirers using other methods of payment. These findings suggest that cash payment allows acquirers to reduce excess liquidity and strengthen their bargaining power with unions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using an age-related regression discontinuity design, I find that eligibiliry for catch-up limits leads to a large increase in total tax-deferred contributions for those without access to a 401(k) plan. This is driven by a 25 percent increase in average IRA contributions and a 21 percent increase in the likelihood of making an IRA contribution. I also find no significant effects on overall 401(k) contributions. The findings suggest that, contrary to the neoclassical life-cycle model, the response to eligibility for catch-up limits was not limited to constrained savers.","[Lavecchia, Adam M.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Lavecchia, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",alavecch@uottawa.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC); H.

ERM should theoretically reduce the volatility of cash flows, agency risk, and information riskultimately reducing a firm's default risk. We empirically investigate the relationship between the degree of ERM implementation and default risk in a panel data set covering 78 of the world's largest banks. We create a novel measure of the degree of ERM implementation. We find that a higher degree of ERM implementation is negatively related to the credit default swap (CDS) spread of a bank. When a rich set of control variables and fixed effects are included, a one-standard-deviation increase in the degree of ERM implementation decreases CDS spreads by 21 basis points. The degree of ERM implementation is, however, not a significant determinant of credit ratings when controls for corporate governance are included.","[Lundqvist, Sara A.] Gothenburg Univ, Dept Business Adm, Vasagatan 1, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Lundqvist, Sara A.] Ctr Finance, Vasagatan 1, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Vilhelmsson, Anders] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Business Adm, Lund, Sweden; [Vilhelmsson, Anders] Knut Wicksell Ctr Financial Studies, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; Lund University,"Lundqvist, SA (通讯作者)，Gothenburg Univ, Dept Business Adm, Vasagatan 1, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.;Lundqvist, SA (通讯作者)，Ctr Finance, Vasagatan 1, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",sara.lundqvist@handels.gu.se,"Vasil'eva, Ekaterina D/B-4807-2013","Vilhelmsson, Anders/0000-0001-6973-6807",Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation,Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation,"Sara Lundqvist is at Gothenburg University, Department of Business Administration and The Centre for Finance, Vasagatan 1, 40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.

The aim of the present study was to combine a bottom-up aspect, using eye-tracking in which the participant is not forced to make a decision, and a quasi-experiment (choice-based conjoint analysis) to investigate whether the reviewed theories could also predict the results in a bottom-up, top-down situation. Seventeen subjects participated in the experiment in December 2016, investigating visual attention and choice in the case of tomatoes with product characteristics such as price, label, and origin. The results of the study show no significant relationship between visual attention and choice, when not in a top-down situation. A combination of methods and bottom-up situations as well as top-down situations when investigating attention and choice is suggested as demonstrated by this study.

Political institutions in late pre-colonial West Africa aligned the incentives of the chiefs such that they were responsive to their people. Alignment arose because of a high degree of competition between governance providers and because political leaders were effectively the residual claimants on revenues generated from providing governance services. I identify the mechanisms by which colonialism severed the link that aligned the incentives of government with those of its citizens. British indirect rule did that by reducing political competition and softening the budget constraints of the chiefs. Toward the end of colonial rule, chiefs became less accountable to their people as evidenced by the widespread corruption and extortion by the chiefs and by their unprecedented constitutional violations and abuses of power.","[Palagashvili, Liya] SUNY Coll Purchase, Dept Econ, 735 Anderson Hill Rd, Purchase, NY 10577 USA; [Palagashvili, Liya] NYU, Sch Law, 110 West 3rd St,DAgostino Hall, New York, NY 10012 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; New York University,"Palagashvili, L (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Purchase, Dept Econ, 735 Anderson Hill Rd, Purchase, NY 10577 USA.;Palagashvili, L (通讯作者)，NYU, Sch Law, 110 West 3rd St,DAgostino Hall, New York, NY 10012 USA.",liya.palagashvili@purchase.edu,,,Mercatus Center; Bradley Foundation,Mercatus Center; Bradley Foundation,"I thank Pete Boettke, Pete Leeson, Chris Coyne, Don Boudreaux, Solomon Stein, Paola Suarez, Kyle O'Donnell, Ennio Emanuele Piano, and the anonymous reviewer for valuable comments.

We focus on the relative strength of two opposing effects of entry on large incumbent firms' demand: the direct substitution effect among large firms (negative) and the indirect feedback effect through the change in small firms' aggregated behavior (positive). If the substitutability between large and small firms is sufficiently high, the indirect effect dominates the direct effect and large incumbents' equilibrium prices and profits increase. We show that welfare effects are ambiguous, which calls for careful assessment when regulating large firms' entry.","[Pan, Lijun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Hankou Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hanazono, Makoto] Nagoya Univ, Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Nanjing University; Nagoya University,"Pan, LJ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Hankou Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pan.lijun.nu@gmail.com; hanazono@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [16H06854, 15H03346]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H06854, 15H03346, 15K13005, 25245031] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","An earlier version of this paper was circulated under the title 'Competition among the Big and the Small with Different Product Substitution.'

Due to climate change, the number of people affected by natural disasters is increasing every year with a marked debilitating effect on developing countries as compared to developed countries. To tackle these challenges, the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-30 identified seven global targets, of which the first target is to substantially reduce global disaster mortality by 2030. This research contributes to this emerging domain of knowledge by bringing gender disaggregated mortality data from 1999 to 2013 from an Indian state called Odisha. In doing so, this research brings three questions to the fore: first, why do deaths occur in disasters? This is answered by going beyond the traditional perspectives on risk and vulnerability to include a complex perspective developed from the theories of organization, violence, and justice. Second, who is responsible to reduce deaths and third, how deaths get recorded and reported? Based on a review of annual death reports, census data, and seven expert interviews, findings suggest that the current disaster management system in Odisha is not accountable and the death reporting and recording system merits change in order to be consistent with the Sendai's Goal to reduce deaths. This study posits that complex perspective has the potential to improve disaster management system by shifting the attention from at risk community to the actors and organizations' and to the necessary resources and measures that will be required to reduce deaths in resource poor contexts.

However, their OOPs differed substantially depending on the pattern of health trajectory. The most costly pattern of Multi-Morbidity needed $18,823 more than the least costly No Disease pattern. Older adults with the most costly pattern spent most of OOP on either prescription drugs or doctor/dental visits.

At the same time, banking regulation and supervision were designed to protect banks from failure, but a large number of banking crises were not prevented recently. Using binary response models for panel data and focusing on OECD countries, this paper studies the main determinants of banking crises over a period of 21 years. Results suggest a bank's high debt and a country's low GDP growth rate as the major determinants of banking crises. There is also evidence of contagion across countries from the same geographical region and from G7 to other countries, and that bank-based financial systems are less prone to borderline banking crises. Regulatory and supervision practices are found not to have been relevant in bankruptcy prevention.","[Pedro, Cristina Pereira; da Silva, Jacinto Vidigal] Univ Evora, Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, CEFAGE, Palacio Vimioso Gab 224, P-7000809 Evora, Portugal; [Ramalho, Joaquim J.

Shocks to unsecured firm credit explain a far larger fraction of output fluctuations than shocks to secured credit. This article surveys a tractable dynamic general equilibrium model in which constraints on unsecured firm credit preclude an efficient capital allocation among heterogeneous firms. Unsecured credit rests on the value that borrowers attach to a good credit reputation, which is a forward-looking variable. Self-fulfilling beliefs over future credit conditions naturally generate endogenously persistent business cycle dynamics. A dynamic complementarity between current and future borrowing limits permits uncorrelated belief shocks to unsecured debt to trigger persistent aggregate fluctuations in both secured and unsecured debt, factor productivity, and output. The author shows that these sunspot shocks are quantitatively important, accounting for around half of output volatility.","[Azariadis, Costas] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63106 USA; [Azariadis, Costas] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Washington University (WUSTL),"Azariadis, C (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63106 USA.;Azariadis, C (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,,,,,,,39,3,5,0,5,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

This model takes a form of global projection model, since incorporating mutual linkages between the economies and also their most important trading partner, aggregated eurozone. Gap models are based on a small number of linear behavioural equations capturing macroeconomic fundamentals and underlying stochastic processes pinning down the long-run trend values. Although proposed in mostly linear form and not properly derived from micro foundations as standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, combination of relatively simple structure together with plausible impulse responses makes the model suitable for policy analysis. The model was estimated with Bayesian techniques, which provide a very efficient way of imposing restrictions to produce both plausible dynamics and sensible forecasting propertie In addition, since the trading partners of Slovakia are modelled endogenously, we can capture spillovers between the countries and their final impact on the Slovak economy. Enrichment for the fiscal block makes the model applicable also for fiscal policy purposes. Spillovers between the economies are captured by three macroeconomic channels: impact of the external demand on the domestic output, impact of the exchange rates via relative competitiveness and import prices and correlation of the interbank risk premia. On the other hand, government deficit and debt are affecting the economy via fiscal impulse, government bond premium and trend real appreciation. The shock to the level of potential output has little effect on the output gap or interest rates, but it does lead to some decline in ination, probably because of the cross correlation between the error term in the equation for the level of potential output and that in the ination equation.","[Bartekova, Maria] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Slahor, L'udomir] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; Comenius University Bratislava,"Bartekova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",maya.bartekova@gmail.com; ludomir.slahor@fin.uniba.sk,"Kmety Bartekova, Maria/AAW-5743-2021",,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,180,187,,,,,,8,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000019,0

This paper studies whether intraday technical trading rules have any significant predictive power in the precious metals market through three popular moving average rules. We find that using the standard parameters previously used in the literature, technical trading rules offer no predictive power whatsoever. However after utilising a universe of parameters, we find a number of parameter combinations offer significant predictability in the gold market, but there remains no significant predictability in the silver market. Our results show that the longer parameters of the technical trading rules are more successful than the traditional parameters chosen in the literature. Therefore intraday technical trading rules have some predictive power in the gold market but offer no significant predictability in the silver market.

The face of poverty is primarily rural and young; 80% of the extreme poor and 75% of the moderate poor live in rural areas. Over 45% of the extreme poor are children younger than 15 years old, and nearly 60% of the extreme poor live in households with three or more children. Gender differences in poverty rates are muted, and there is scant evidence of gender inequality in poor children's educational attainment. A sizable share of the extreme and moderate poor, 40 and 50%, respectively, have completed primary school. Compared with the extreme poor, the moderate poor are significantly more likely to have completed primary school and are less likely to work in agriculture. After conditioning on other individual and household characteristics, having fewer than three children, having greater educational attainment, and living in an urban area are strongly and positively associated with welfare. The results reinforce the central importance of households in rural areas and those containing large numbers of children in efforts to reduce extreme poverty, and are consistent with increased educational attainment and urbanization hastening poverty reduction.

In contrast to conventional approaches, this paradigm shifts the emphasis from technology and markets to local knowledge, social justice and food sovereignty, to overcome rural poverty and environmental degradation. However, the spread of this approach faces several obstacles. This paper deals with one of these obstacles: the preference' of smallholders for industrial farming. We specifically analyse the widespread uptake up of oil palm by smallholders in Chiapas. Contrary to agro-ecological assumptions, oil palm proved favourable to smallholders in Chiapas because of historical and contemporary state-peasant relations and the advantageous economic circumstances within the oil palm sector. Based on this research, we identify four challenges for agroecology: (i) the existence of contradictory interests within the peasantry as a result of social differentiation; (ii) the role of the state in making conventional development models relatively favourable to smallholders; (iii) the prevalence of modernization ideologies in many rural areas; and (iv) the need for this paradigm to acknowledge smallholders' agency also when engaged in industrial farming. These challenges need to be tackled for agroecology to offer viable alternatives in a context of agro-industrialization.","[Castellanos-Navarrete, Antonio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Multidisciplinary Res Chiapas & South Border, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Castellanos-Navarrete, Antonio; Jansen, Kees] Wageningen Univ, Knowledge Technol & Innovat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Wageningen University & Research,"Castellanos-Navarrete, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Multidisciplinary Res Chiapas & South Border, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.;Castellanos-Navarrete, A (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Knowledge Technol & Innovat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",acastela@unam.mx; kees.jansen@wur.nl,"Jansen, Kees/C-3222-2008; Castellanos-Navarrete, Antonio/J-1077-2016","Castellanos-Navarrete, Antonio/0000-0001-5796-962X",Mexican Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT),Mexican Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"We thank Abril Aidee Ruiz Medina, Henk van Rikxoort and Carlos Miguel Lopez Sierra for research assistance, Stephen Sherwood for comments and the Mexican Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT) for supporting this research.

The method in question simply sums over time the components of the annual actuarial gain/loss report. This implicitly assumes that in the counterfactual exercise, the interest on the additional UAL is covered dollar-for-dollar by amortization. But under actual funding formulas amortization usually varies less than interest. This means there are large intertemporal interactions between the gap in investment returns and subsequent shortfalls between contributions and interest. Using the actual funding formula in the counterfactual can lead to much higher estimates of the UAL impact of the gap in investment returns because it does not assume away these interactions. This method can more accurately inform policy-makers, regarding the importance of cutting the assumed rate of return.","[Costrell, Robert M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Educ Reform, 201 Grad Educ Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Costrell, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Educ Reform, 201 Grad Educ Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",costrell@uark.edu,,,StudentsFirst; EdBuild,StudentsFirst; EdBuild,"An earlier version of this paper was presented at the Fall Research Conference of the Association for Public Policy and Management, November 12, 2015, Miami, FL.

The informal status of many firms substantially reduces the tax basis and therefore impacts the provision of public goods. The literature on encouraging formalisation has predominantly focused on reducing the direct costs of formalisation and has found negligible impacts of such policies. In this paper, we focus on a stick intervention, which to the best of our knowledge is the first one in a developing country setting that deals with the most direct and dominant form of informality, that is registration with the tax authority with a direct link to the country's potential revenue base and thus public goods provision. We implement an experiment in which randomly selected firms are visited by tax representatives who deliver an official letter from the Bangladesh National Tax Authority stating that the firm is not registered and the consequential punishment if the firm fails to register. We find that the intervention increases the rate of registration among treated firms, while firms located in the same market but not treated do not seem to respond significantly. We also find that only larger revenue firms at baseline respond to the threat and register. Our findings have at least two important policy implications: i) the enforcement angle, which could be an important tool to encourage formalisation; and ii) targeting of government resources for formalisation to high-end informal firms. The effects are generally small in levels and this leaves open the question of why many firms still do not register.","[De Giorgi, Giacomo] Univ Geneva, Geneva Sch Econ & Management, Washington, DC USA; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats Markets, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Org & Voting Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Bur Res & Econ Anal Dev, Cambridge, MA USA; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Innovat Poverty Act, Cambridge, MA USA; [De Giorgi, Giacomo] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Ploenzke, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rahman, Aminur] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC USA",ICREA; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Harvard University; The World Bank,"De Giorgi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, GSEM, Blvd du Pont dArve 40, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",giacomo.degiorgi@gmail.com,,,PEDL Initiative [SEED Grant] [168],PEDL Initiative [SEED Grant],This work was supported by the PEDL Initiative [partial funding under the SEED Grant #168].,,31,13,13,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The institutional peculiarities of Indonesia's largest commercial bank are exploited to separately estimate the effects of access to formal credit from savings. The means by which households smooth consumption differs depending on their access to formal services. Those with access to formal credit increase borrowing from banks, while those with access only to formal savings, but not credit, draw down on savings. Households without access to formal banking services end up liquidating productive assets.","[DeLoach, Stephen B.; Smith-Lin, Marquessa] Elon Univ, Dept Econ, Elon, NC USA",Elon University,"DeLoach, SB (通讯作者)，Elon Univ, Campus Box 2075, Elon, NC 27244 USA.",deloach@elon.edu,,,,,,,28,11,13,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Since through time, the baseline noise power shows a gradual change an adaptive threshold method is required to track and learn the baseline noise for a correct classification.

This finding is robust to various robustness tests including propensity score matching analysis and quasi-natural experiment.

J,"Gomes, JF",,,,"Gomes, Joao F.",,,Comment on partisan conflict and private investment,JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Investment; Uncertainty; Partisan conflict,UNCERTAINTY,"Private nonresidential investment contracted sharply during the Great Recession in most advanced economies and remains well below its pre-2008 trend. While weakness in business investment naturally accounts for a short term drop in the aggregate demand for goods and services, a persistent decline in new capital formation is also bound to have long lasting effects on an economy's ability to produce. Some of the reasons behind this large and prolonged contraction in corporate investment are readily apparent. They include both a sharp tightening in credit conditions in the immediate aftermath of the 2007-08 financial crisis, and a secular decline in productivity growth. Although each of these developments was likely important on its own, even their combined effect seems insufficient to generate the observed slump in non residential investment during the last decade Gala et al. (2016). This paper explores an alternative explanation for the observed decline in investment. Specifically, it investigates the role played by rising uncertainty about future economic policy due to increased partisan conflict since around 2010. The ultimate findings are perhaps best viewed as merely suggestive. Nevertheless, by carefully developing novel measures of policy uncertainty, the paper does succeed in laying important foundations for future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find that domestic firms and firms with dispersed ownership innovate less when business and municipal uncertainty conditions increase. When firms are unsure whether they will be blocked by local bureaucrats from capitalizing on their innovation, they scale down their efforts.

He hypothesizes that if a major positive (negative) stock price move takes place on a day when the stock market index rises (falls), then its magnitude may be amplified by the availability of positive (negative) investment outcomes. In both cases, the availability heuristic may cause price overreaction to the initial company-specific shock, resulting in subsequent price reversal. In line with the hypothesis, the author documents that both positive and negative large price moves accompanied by the same-sign contemporaneous daily market returns are followed by significant reversals on the next 2 trading days and over 5- and 20-day intervals following the event, the magnitude of the reversals increasing over longer postevent windows, while large stock price changes taking place on the days when the market index moves in the opposite direction are followed by nonsignificant price drifts. The results remain robust after accounting for additional company (size, beta, historical volatility) and event-specific (stock's return and trading volume on the event day) factors, and are stronger for small and volatile stocks.","[Kudryavtsev, Andrey] Max Stern Yezreel Valley Acad Coll, Emek Yezreel, Israel",,"Kudryavtsev, A (通讯作者)，Max Stern Yezreel Valley Acad Coll, Econ & Management Dept, IL-19300 Emek Yezreel, Israel.",andreyk@yvc.ac.il,,,,,,,49,10,11,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

At its peak, the effects of the crisis have put at serious risk the outcome of the euro project, exposing the inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the monetary union. As the degree of economic and financial integration of these countries is significant, we aim to investigate in details the potential cross-covariance and spillover effects between the Eurozone economies and financial markets. In order to do this, we employ financial stress indexes, as systemic risk metrics in a multivariate GARCH model. This method is able to capture markets' dependencies and volatility spillovers and is employed on a single market level as well as on the full spectrum of Eurozone markets. The empirical results have shown the important and intensive stress transmission on banking and money markets. Moreover, the role of peripheral countries as stress transmitter is verified, but only for particular periods. The significant spillover effects from core countries are also evident, indicating their important role in the Euro Area and its overall financial stability. The decoupling hypothesis is empirically verified, underling the gradually decreasing intensity of spillovers between Euro Area countries. Overall, this paper exhibits the complex structure of spillover effects for Eurozone, along with a clustering effect in the most recent times. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The article confirms that there is no direct correlation between the improvement of working conditions and the labor productivity of researchers in the social and human sciences. The article shows that in the change in labor productivity of researchers there is a pending effect. The relationship between researchers in one research team has a great impact on labor productivity. It is noticed that, as in any other industry, ordinary researchers refuse to increase labor productivity, fearing an increase in planned targets and a reduction in the amount of material incentives. At the same time, the researcher's own importance is the most powerful psychological stimulus for increasing the researcher's labor productivity. The most important conclusion is the conclusion that the system of material incentives for researchers should be as simple as possible. This system should not focus the researcher's attention on remuneration, but should only ensure decent and fair remuneration of labor.","[Maloletko, Alexander] Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia",Russian State Social University (RSSU),"Maloletko, A (通讯作者)，Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia.",Shadow.economy@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,918,925,,,,,,8,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000104,0

Households in resource-based economies allocate their time and other factors between resource extraction and other activities. As a result, factors may shift from one sector to another as marginal returns change. This has two important implications. First, it implies potentially strong linkages between resource and non-resource sectors. Second, it means that unmanaged resources cause inefficient allocations of inputs across all sectors, and the effects of resource management spill into other sectors. We construct a local general equilibrium model that accounts for inputs that over-allocate to an open access resource and create a general equilibrium tragedy of the commons. This model describes resource rent dissipation more adequately in economies with mobile factors than a model with slowly dissipating rents. Perfectly mobile factors dissipate rent in every period, but endogenous wages cause labor and capital allocations to change with the resource stock. We use the model to illustrate medium-run impacts of a limit on capital in an artisanal fishery in Honduras. Simulation results reveal that fishery management has economy-wide impacts on prices and wages. Managers in developing countries thus should consider these linkages when implementing policies to conserve fish stocks.","[Manning, Dale T.] Colorado State Univ, Clark Bldg,1172 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Taylor, J.

Three types of models are estimated: models in origin, which determine the current effect of violence; context change models, which estimate the effect of decreased violence levels; and violence aftermath models, which indicate the groups that do not completely adapt to a peaceful context. Through multilevel logistic models, we find that the coefficient of violence depends on the municipality in where adolescents reside or resided. We conclude that violence promotes the transition to childbearing particularly among rural females. However, a reduction in violence levels reduces the probabilities of childbearing.","[Maria Sanchez-Cespedes, Lina] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Maria Sanchez-Cespedes, Lina] Calle 44D 45-86, Bogota, Colombia",University of Essex,"Sanchez-Cespedes, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",lina.maria.sc@live.co.uk,,,,,,,31,0,0,2,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Moreover, the paper points to the reasons why the Slovak Republic belongs to the states of EU where the effectiveness of the collection of taxes is one of the worst ones. It can be seen from the experience of the countries with developed economy that tax system maturates from three to five years. The Slovak Republic was in that period of maturity at the end of 90ties of the 20th century. Therefore it was necessary to come to the steps leading to improvement, eventually to the changes of tax system - to tax reform. The keystone of so-called tax reform in the Slovak Republic was to decrease tax burden, decentralization of tax system and finally stimulation of entrepreneurial sphere. For the processing of theoretical part, the method of research of professional literature and other relevant information to this topic was used.

Possible solutions include expansion of distributed and grid-scale batteries, pumped hydro generation, dispatchable flexible generation, increasing demand-side participation or expanding transmission connection to the bigger electrical systems in New South Wales and Victoria. In Australia, the process for interconnector development is self-assessed proposals by transmission companies and regulatory approval of the outturn expenditure for inclusion in the regulated asset base. However, these self-assessments do not provide appropriate incentives. In particular, they are likely to crowd out unregulated solutions including grid-scale batteries. An independent transmission planning authority that does not have a financial interest in network expansion is likely to assess competing alternatives more objectively.

Value added tax has a specific effect because the indirect tax is included in the price of goods and services. Foodstuffs are basic goods which are consumed by all consumers, so each VAT rate change related to foodstuffs affects all citizens of each member state. Any VAT rate increase brings a significant impact on the price level of foodstuffs, especially in the month the change is implemented. In general, an increase in the VAT rate has a more significant effect on prices than a decrease. As a result, each increase in the VAT rate can cause effects that can be difficult for a government to correct at a later date through a VAT rate decrease.","[Prochazka, Jan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Procházka, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic.",prochazka3@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2283-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,110,118,,,,,,9,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL8FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456200200015,0

In 2010, Greece adopted a fiscal adjustment programme in order to fix the fiscal weaknesses of its economy. After almost 7 years since the fiscal adjustment programme was adopted, the Greek economy is even worse off than the parties involved in the Greek programme had foreseen. For this reason, the aim of this chapter is to examine the productive capabilities of the Greek economy as a means to overcome the recession and stagnation. Exports are a tool for overcoming the stagnation of Greek economy that resulted from the internal devaluation policy. According to the latest available data, Greece is still facing a trade deficit. Its trade balance has improved after the integration to fiscal consolidation process mainly because of the reduction in imports. Greece's accession to the Economic and Monetary Union and the adoption of euro strengthened consumption against investment. We are going to examine the Greek economy's performance in regard to high-technology exports. Hightechnology exports generate higher earnings. The study of certain commodities that embody high technology in comparison with EU-28 and OECD member states will reveal the Greek economy's potential to meet strong competition in the global economy.

Utilising data from the Czech financial market, a linear model with mixed effects was constructed, evaluating the relationship between remuneration of individual agents and quality-costs of the products they recommend. The results were structured for different organisational setups. We have found that in some less important environments from the market perspective (small and medium multi-level marketing networks, small and big pools, medium and big flat firms), there is a negative association between quality-cost of the contracted product and the amount of commission paid out to the agent. This indicates potential consumer detriment. In the majority of organisations dominating the industry, however, the direction of this relationship is positive in nature or statistically insignificant. Hence, the systemic potential for instigating the adverse selection was not detected in a major part of the market, bringing up regulatory implications in the conflict of interest and inducements area.","[Sindelar, Jiri; Budinsky, Petr] Vysoka Skola Financni & Spravni, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Sindelár, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Financni & Spravni, Prague, Czech Republic.",sindelar@mail.vsfs.cz; petr.budinsky@vsfs.cz,,"Sindelar, Jiri/0000-0002-1476-8235",,,,,31,1,1,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The detection rate of Penicillium spp. was highest (11%), followed by Yarrowia spp. (1.5%) and detection rate of other genera varied from 0.25% similar to 0.75%. Therefore, long-termmonitoring should be implemented to realize ecological risk for Hunan province and vital to establish a necessary management measures for monitoring and prevention of pathogenic fungus which have great significance in protecting ecological risk in China as well as eastern Asian regions.","[Wang, Haoning; Wang, Xiaolong] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife Resource, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaolong] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Conservat Med & Ecol Safety, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Northeast Forestry University - China; Northeast Forestry University - China,"Wang, HN (通讯作者)，Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife Resource, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",,,,Key Project of the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFD0501702],Key Project of the National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This study was financially supported by the Key Project of the National Key Research and Development Program of China, code: 2017YFD0501702",,31,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-574-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,66.0,,,,,,458,464,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448284700072,0

Terrorism is a growing threat to internationally active firms, but there has been no empirical research to address the distinctive challenges that terrorism poses for the international marketing activities of firms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory investigation, following a two-phase research design. In the first phase it was based on qualitative interviews with internationally active firms. In the second phase, an online survey of a large sample of international firms based in the USA was performed. All measures were developed specifically for the study. Findings - The paper provides empirical insights about how terrorism affects MNEs, especially those operating in emerging markets. It suggests that terrorism accounts for significant costs in the international marketing budget of MNEs, as well as in planning, and the design of supply chains and distribution channels. Findings also reveal that firms with significant resources and international experience appear to cope better with terrorism's effects. Research limitations/implications - Given the early stage of empirical research on terrorism and international marketing, this study was necessarily exploratory. Practical implications - The paper includes implications and suggestions for multinational companies to increase the security of their businesses through the development of corporate preparedness. Social implications - Terrorism represents not only an organizational crisis at the level of a firm, but it affects the whole society. Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified need to study the relationship between the growing threat of terrorism and international business.","[Zeneli, Valbona] George C Marshall European Ctr Secur Studies, Coll Int Secur Studies, Gernackerstr, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Czinkota, Michael R.] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC USA; [Knight, Gary] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Georgetown University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Zeneli, V (通讯作者)，George C Marshall European Ctr Secur Studies, Coll Int Secur Studies, Gernackerstr, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",valbona.zeneli@marshallcenter.org,,"Knight, Gary/0000-0003-4793-1200",,,,,68,5,6,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

In 2015, the House of Representatives adopted a new dynamic scoring rule requiring a point estimate within the budget window of the deficit effect due to the macroeconomic response to certain proposed tax legislation. The revenue estimates provided by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) for major tax bills often play a critical role in Congressional deliberations and public discussion of those bills. The JCT has long had macroeconomic analytic capability, and in recent years, responding to Congress' interest in macrodynamic estimates for purposes of scoring legislation, outside think tank groups notably the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation have also developed macrodynamic estimation models. The May 2017 National Tax Association (NTA) Spring Symposium brought together the JCT with the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center for a panel discussion regarding their respective macrodynamic estimating approaches. This paper reports on that discussion.

We find a positive association between financial inclusion disclosure and banking firms' subsequent performance, with this relationship moderated by market competition and government ownership. We also find evidence that firms' engagement in financial inclusion activities increases their market share, with the disclosure of this information reducing the information asymmetry between managers and capital market participants. The broad implication of our research findings is that firms considering investing in financial inclusion activities could benefit from improved firm performance and gain market share.

Shadow banking economizes on scarce collateral, expanding liquidity provision, boosting asset prices and growth, but also building up fragility. A rise in uncertainty raises shadow banking spreads, forcing financial institutions to switch to collateral-intensive funding. Shadow banking collapses, liquidity provision shrinks, liquidity premia and discount rates rise, asset prices and investment fall. The model generates slow recoveries, collateral runs, and flight-to-quality effects, and it sheds light on Large-Scale Asset Purchases, Operation Twist, and other interventions.","[Moreira, Alan] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Savov, Alexi] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Savov, Alexi] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Rochester; New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Moreira, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",,,,,,,,83,80,101,4,129,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Chinese government officials establish firm ties with trusted people through lavish banquets with flowing alcohol, providing privileged access to scarce resources like licenses, land, bank loans, subsidies, and government contracts. In China, Baijiu, the most popular grain liquor at these parties, works as the currency of bribery and is the lubricant for political connections for corruption. Xi Jinping's anti-corruption policy, known as the Alcohol Bans, has targeted Baijiu in an attempt to stop the boozy banquets, and, consequently, to bring an end to this channel of political networking. This paper employs the event study approach and connects cumulative abnormal stock returns of high-end Baijiu companies with the impact of the Alcohol Bans. It applies the difference-in-difference method to rule out unobserved reasons for stock market changes. The result is unchanged in both the efficient market hypothesis test and the abnormal return test. We consider if Baijiu may be substituted for other luxuries, and find little evidence for such substitution effects. Our work concludes that the Alcohol Bans has partially contributed to Xi's anti-corruption campaign.","[Shu, Yang; Cai, Jiayao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Cai, JY (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",colamonkey@qq.com; caijiayao@hust.edu.cn,"Shu, Yang/AAA-4709-2020",,Foundation of National Subordinate Universities [2016AC007]; Foundation of Education Ministry's Social Science Program [17YJA790105],Foundation of National Subordinate Universities; Foundation of Education Ministry's Social Science Program,"The authors are deeply grateful to Toke Aidt (the editor) and three anonymous reviewers for their inspiring guidance.

The legal framework for the competitive healthcare services in the Czech Republic has been brought about by the privatization of the healthcare sector and private health care in accordance with Act No. 160/1992 Coll., which enabled the establishment of private health facilities. The law has also permitted clients to choose their specific healthcare establishment and their physician. On the other hand, it is also necessary to respect market specifics. A differentiated structure of health organizations is one of the main differences. Some health care organizations work as business entities and others are not-for-profit organizations whose primary objective is not profit. The type of healthcare utilized is the second difference in this environment. We can distinguish two types of healthcare: (1) acute or emergency and necessary healthcare and (2) planned healthcare. In an acute situation, involving emergency and necessary care, a client often does not take advantage of the opportunity to choose his/ her healthcare provider, either due to pain or the need to solve the medical problem quickly. Regarding the planned care, a client has more time and options for choosing. Providers of planned healthcare services constitute part of a competitive environment and their task is to understand their clients' preferences and to customize their portfolio of healthcare services to meet those clients' specific needs. The purpose of the present article is to define the most important factors that influence the decision-making process of clients in the market of selected healthcare services (e.g. eye defects corrections, eyelid aesthetic treatment, orthopedic procedures, selected surgical procedures, planned childbirth and gynecological operations) and to identify the role and the importance of those factors in regard to the decision-making process. A partial aim is to find out whether there are differences in regard to the perception of the key factors that influence decision-making between men and women or between potential and real clients. The result of the research involves the evaluation of 786 questionnaires from clients or potential clients of healthcare services. They were evaluated using the Two-sample t-Test for equal means.","[Stankova, Pavla; Horkelova, Jana; Luczewska, Jana; Ticha, Juliana; Zimcikova, Sona; Cernobila, Jan] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Stanková, P (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",stankova@fame.utb.cz; horkelovajana@seznam.cz; j.luczewska@centrum.cz; Juliana.Ticha@seznam.cz; SonaZimcikova@seznam.cz; jcernobila@gmail.com,,"Stankova, Pavla/0000-0001-7068-8937",Internal Grant Agency (The key factors influencing decision-making of clients in the market of health services) [IGA/FaME/2015/024]; Internal Grant Agency (Management of healthcare organizations effectiveness) [RO/2016/12],Internal Grant Agency (The key factors influencing decision-making of clients in the market of health services); Internal Grant Agency (Management of healthcare organizations effectiveness),The authors are thankful to the Internal Grant Agency IGA/FaME/2015/024 (The key factors influencing decision-making of clients in the market of health services) and Internal Grant Agency RO/2016/12 (Management of healthcare organizations effectiveness) for their financial support in conducting this research.,,16,2,2,0,4,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

These estimators separate correlations and volatilities. We analyze different combinations of quantile- and median- based realized volatilities, and four estimators of realized correlations with three synchronization schemes. Their finite sample properties are studied under five data generating processes, in presence, or not, of microstructure noise, and under synchronous and asynchronous trading. The main finding is that synchronizing with previous tick interpolation combined with the pre- averaged version of disentangled estimators based on Gaussian ranks (for the correlations) and median deviations (for the volatilities) provide a precise, computationally efficient, and easy alternative to measure integrated covariances. A minimum variance portfolio application shows the superiority of this disentangled realized estimator in terms of numerous performance metrics.","[Vander Elst, Harry] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Veredas, David] Vlerick Business Sch, Ave Blvd 21, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium; [Veredas, David] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Vlerick Business School; Ghent University,"Veredas, D (通讯作者)，Vlerick Business Sch, Ave Blvd 21, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium.",david.veredas@vlerick.com,,,FRESH grant,FRESH grant,"The authors are grateful to Torben Andersen, Kris Boudt, Asger Lunde, Rasmus Varneskov, the editor George Tauchen and two anonymous referees, as well as the conference participants at CFE13 (London, December 2013) and the SoFiE annual conference 2015, as well as the seminars participants at CREATES for insightful remarks.

Various techniques have been proposed to remove or, at least, reduce this bias. Using about 30,000 responses on WTP for a variety of power mixes from a panel of 6500 German households and the fixed-effects estimator to control for unobserved heterogeneity, this article simultaneously explores the effects of two common ex-ante approaches-cheap talk and consequential script-and the ex-post certainty approach to calibrating hypothetical WTP responses. Based on a switching regression model that accounts for the potential endogeneity of respondent certainty, we find evidence for a lower WTP among those respondents who classify themselves as definitely certain about their answers. Although neither cheap talk nor the consequential-script corrective reduce WTP estimates, receiving either of these scripts increases the probability that respondents indicate definite certainty about their WTP bids.","[Andor, Mark A.; Frondel, Manuel; Vance, Colin] RWI Leibniz Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Frondel, Manuel] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Vance, Colin] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ruhr University Bochum; Jacobs University,"Frondel, M (通讯作者)，RWI Leibniz Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.;Frondel, M (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany.",frondel@rwi-essen.de,,,Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of the German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 823]; German Federal Ministery of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LA1113A],Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of the German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministery of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We are grateful for invaluable comments and suggestions by Peter Grosche, Christoph M.

Using a large sample of tender offers between 1996 and 2009, we report that the proportion of synergy-driven value-maximizing acquisitions increased following the passage of SOX. Targets experience lower pre-bid share price run-up, receive larger deal premiums, and have larger announcement period abnormal returns after SOX. Acquiring firm shareholders also experience significant wealth gains around the announcement in the post-SOX period. Employing industry and matched firm portfolios, we also document that both the operating performance and buy-and-hold abnormal returns over the three- and five-year post-acquisition period improved significantly after SOX. Overall, our evidence shows that SOX had a positive influence in the market for inter-firm tender offers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We rationalize this phenomenon in a model wherein countries with different fundamentals are on different equilibrium paths all along, but which become discernible only during bad times. Key ingredients are cross- country differences in the volatility and persistence of fiscal revenue shocks combined with their unobservability by investors. Differences in the cyclicality of fiscal revenues affect the option value of borrowing and resulting default risk; unobservability of fiscal shocks makes bond pricing responsive to market actions. When tax revenues are hit by common positive shocks, no country increases net debt and interest spreads stay put. When a common negative revenue shock hits and is persistent, low volatility countries with higher default costs adjust spending, while others resort to borrowing. This difference signals a relative deterioration of fiscal outlooks, interest spreads jump and decoupling takes place.","[Catao, Luis; Ranciere, Romain] IMF, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Fostel, Ana] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Ranciere, Romain] PSE, Paris, France",International Monetary Fund; University of Virginia,"Catao, L (通讯作者)，IMF, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",lcatao@imf.org; alf8p@virginia.edu; ranciere@usc.edu,,"Catao, Luis/0000-0002-1314-034X",PEGGED project in the CEPREMAP node,PEGGED project in the CEPREMAP node,"We thank our discussants, Mark Aguiar, Antonio Antunes, Tatiana Didier, Oleg Itskhoki, Gernot Muller, Ugo Panizza, and Akos Valetinyi, as well as Olivier Blanchard, Emine Boz, Roberto Chang, Steven Phillips, and seminar participants at the 2011 NBER summer camp, the Society for Economics Dynamics meetings, the European Central Bank, the European University Institute, the Lubra Macro Association, the Paris School of Economics, Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Rutgers University for many extensive and insightful comments on earlier drafts.

We challenge this view by arguing that external imbalances are destabilizing only when banks face substantial competition from securities markets in the process of financial intermediation. We assemble a dataset of banking crises covering the advanced industrialized countries from 1976 to 2011 and find evidence of a conditional relationship between capital inflows, a well-developed securities market, and the incidence of banking crises. We further explore the impact of capital inflows on banks' actual risk taking as indicated by their capital adequacy levels and measures of insolvency risk. Our results demonstrate that prudential capital cushions tend to decline with the combination of capital inflows and prominent securities markets. We highlight the political decisionsoften made during the early days of a country's financial developmentthat determine the relative prominence of banks vs. non-bank financial institutions and conclude with policy recommendations.","[Copelovitch, Mark] Univ Wisconsin, Polit Sci & Publ Affairs, Madison, WI USA; [Singer, David A.] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, E53-489,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Singer, DA (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Polit Sci, E53-489,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dasinger@mit.edu,,/0000-0002-7750-6494,"University of Wisconsin-Madison: Jean Monnet European Union Center of Excellence, Graduate School; Robert M.

Using a difference-in-differences matching estimator to assess the effects of changes in analyst coverage caused by broker closures and mergers, we find that firms avoid tax more aggressively after a reduction in analyst coverage. We further find that this effect is mainly driven by firms with higher existing tax-planning capacity (e.g., tax-haven presence), smaller initial analyst coverage, and a smaller number of peer firms. Moreover, the effect is more pronounced in industries where reputation matters more and in firms subject to less monitoring from tax authorities.","[Chen, Tao] Nanjing Univ Technol, Nanyang Business Sch, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lin, Chen] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Nanjing Tech University; University of Hong Kong,"Chen, T (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Technol, Nanyang Business Sch, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jtchen@ntu.edu.sg; chenlin1@hku.hk,"Chen, Tao/AEH-9299-2022","Chen, Tao/0000-0003-4110-0529",Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1 [RG58/15]; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [T31/717/12R],"Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council)","We thank Paul Malatesta (the editor) and an anonymous referee for their very valuable and constructive comments and suggestions.

However, more recent literature has increasingly focused on the constructive potential of blurred boundaries between NGOs and the state, arguing that a degree of overlap provides NGOs with increased mechanisms for influence. There has been less research on the interactions between NGOs and political parties, and how political connections affect the relationship between NGOs and the state. This article contributes to addressing that gap. The article explores the relationship between NGOs and political leaders through a study of local NGOs in the Indian state of West Bengal. It uses a combination of a survey and case studies, as well as interviews with political leaders and government officials, to question some dominant assumptions about how the state uses NGOs and how government funding for NGOs impacts on the relationship between NGOs and the state. The findings call into question the assumption that dependence on government funding creates pressure for the professionalization and bureaucratization of NGOs by highlighting the importance of non-project-based funding provided by government to NGOs and by demonstrating that political connections can play a more important role than formal bureaucratic processes in the allocation and management of government funding for NGOs. The research was conducted towards the end of Left Front rule in West Bengal and has implications for our understanding of the strategies the Left Front used in seeking to cement its authority, as well as how these were contested. The article also contributes to thinking on the methodology of studying NGOs by highlighting the benefits of combining a survey and case studies in a single piece of research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Small-scale peasant producers are marginalized in this context and play functional roles within the current dynamics of agribusiness firms.

We find that local governments increase expenditures because their debt capacity expands following a rating upgrade. These expenditures have an estimated local income multiplier of 1.9 and a cost per job of $20,000 per year. Our findings suggest that debt-financed increases in government spending can improve economic conditions during recessions.

In line with microevidence on wage setting, we consider a wage-setting model featuring an upward-sloping hazard function, based on the notion that the probability of resetting a wage depends on the time elapsed since the last reset. Our wage Phillips curve embeds also backward terms. We test the hazard function slope using generalized method of moment estimation. Then, placing our equation in a small-scale New Keynesian model, we investigate its dynamic properties using Bayesian estimation. Model comparison shows that our model outperforms commonly used alternative methods to introduce persistence.","[Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Econ, Rome, Italy; [Di Pietro, Marco] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome,"Di Bartolomeo, G (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Econ, Rome, Italy.",giovanni.dibartolomeo@uniroma1.it; marco.dipietro@uniroma1.it,"Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni/K-3030-2015","Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni/0000-0001-5016-8483",Sapienza University of Rome,Sapienza University of Rome,"The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees and the Editor Pok-sang Lam for excellent comments and insightful suggestions.

To address these issues and other policy constraints while adhering to the principles of high efficiency and effectiveness within a national system of unified rules, China created a legal framework with unique rules for the coverage and scope of emissions trading, allocations, cap setting, monitoring, reporting and verification, compliance, and division of responsibilities. The system was designed to maintain unified rules across the entire system while also providing flexibility in aspects ranging from coverage and scope, allocation and cap setting to compliance. This design will not only facilitate the formulation of a State Council regulation providing the necessary strong legal foundation for the ETS but will also avoid the frequent changes of regulations that often occur in an evolving policy environment.","[Duan, Maosheng; Zhou, Li] Tsinghua Univ, China Carbon Market Res Ctr, Energy Sci Bldg, Beijing Shi, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Duan, MS (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, China Carbon Market Res Ctr, Energy Sci Bldg, Beijing Shi, Peoples R China.",duanmsh@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71690243]; MOE Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities,The authors wish to acknowledge the support of: 1) Project 71690243 supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China; 2) the MOE Project of the Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities.,,16,21,28,9,38,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Agencies were able to receive higher reimbursement per patient under the prospective payment system if they adjusted the number of therapy visits or the type of visits for a two-month-long episode. Agencies could also increase reimbursement by treating a patient for multiple episodes of care, because prospective payments were made on a per-episode basis. Using the Medicare Claims and Provider of Services Files from 2001 to 2009, we examine differences between for-profit and non-profit agencies in these practice patterns during the first nine years of the prospective payment system. We find that for-profit agencies were more likely to adopt most of these practice patterns than were non-profit agencies. This finding suggests that for-profit agencies were more responsive to financial incentives, and therefore disproportionately contributed to the increase in Medicare home health spending under the prospective payment system. Policymakers could consider revising the current prospective payment system that gives agencies incentives to distort practice patterns regardless of a patient's health care needs. Policy points For-profit home health agencies were more likely to respond to financial incentives in the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) than were non-profit agencies. Non-profit agencies were also responsive to the financial incentives of the PPS, although they changed their practice pattern less than for-profit agencies. Policymakers might consider revising non-linear pricing for therapy visits that provides financial incentives for agencies to distort service provision.","[Kim, Hyunjee] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Oregon Health & Science University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",kihy@ohsu.edu; ecnorton@umich.edu,"Norton, Edward C/B-2211-2009; , Edward/AAQ-1719-2021",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631",Rackham Graduate School of the University of Michigan; Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation; Ewha Womans University,Rackham Graduate School of the University of Michigan; Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation; Ewha Womans University,"This project was supported by Rackham Graduate School of the University of Michigan, Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation, and Ewha Womans University.",,35,4,4,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We first suggest a simple theoretical argument why pairwise similarities of macroeconomic variables can derive stock market comovements. We then apply the conditional nonlinear quantile regression on the pairwise realized stock return correlations for the stock markets in the Pacific Basin region from 1990 to 2012 to empirically justify the argument. As a result, we find evidence that smaller pairwise differences or larger pairwise similarities of a set of macroeconomic variables significantly drive the stock market comovements in the region in a nonlinear way.","[Lee, Hyunchul] Chosun Univ, Div Business Adm, Gwangju, South Korea; [Cho, Seung Mo] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Gyongsan, South Korea",Chosun University; Yeungnam University,"Cho, SM (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Gyongsan, South Korea.",choseungmo@yu.ac.kr,,,Chosun University,Chosun University,"The authors are grateful to Prof. C.

We consider a simple model of agenda setting where two groups of different size lobby a politician over a transfer from one group to the other, and the group which sets the agenda can choose the size of the proposed transfer. The groups have resources which are used to pay the politician and to overcome the public goods problem within the group. Our key result is that which group prevails in the agenda setting game depends crucially on whether the transfers can also be used to pay the politician - in which case we say they are fungible. If the transfer is fungible, as in the case of a monetary payment, the smaller group prevails. If the transfer is non-fungible the result depends on whether it is rival or not - civil rights for example are non-rival. In the case of a rival non fungible transfer depending on circumstances either group may prevail. In the non-rival case the large group prevails.

I offer a simple alternative base case, neutralizing the usual production features instead. I focus on the demand side of general equilibrium, introducing nonhomothetic preferences where environmental quality has an income elasticity of demand exceeding one. I contrast cooperative and noncooperative outcomes between two countries, showing that the poor country makes lower abatement efforts under either assumption. A poor country may be worse off when the large country abates (reversing the usual argument on free riding) and cooperative bargaining over abatement levels may offer no gains. I identify policy leakage and show that border taxes are counterproductive. Free trade is good for the environment for several reasons. Finally, I briefly examine issue linking in bargaining to assess the benefits of linking trade and environment negotiations.","[Markusen, James R.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Markusen, James R.] NBER, CEPR, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Markusen, James R.] CESifo, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Markusen, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

The current paper examines implications of Russia increasing its gas exports capacity by building Nord Stream 2 (to Germany), Turkish Stream (to Turkey and Greece) and Power of Siberia (to China). We find that these projects have moderate effect on Russian gas exports and also that the impact on the European natural gas market is minor. We have also examined the impact of new Russian export pipes if subsidies to large Russian natural gas consumers are halved, or there are no sales to, or transit via, Ukraine. We find that the effects of increased export capacity are much stronger in these cases. The main policy implication of our study is that the EU and Russia have common interest in supporting further integration of European markets, although for somewhat different reasons. Russia wants to sustain, or increase, its exports to Europe, whereas the EU wants to make sure that the market functions well and that no country becomes vulnerable to pressure from Russia.","[Roaraune, Finn; Rosendahl, Knut Einar] Stat Norway, Kongsvinger, Norway; [Le Tissier, Hilde Hallre] Frisch Ctr, Oslo, Norway; [Moe, Arild] Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, Lysaker, Norway; [Rosendahl, Knut Einar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, As, Norway",Statistics Norway; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Rosendahl, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Stunet 3, N-1430 As, Norway.",knut.einar.rosendahl@nmbu.no,,,Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"An earlier version of the paper has been presented at the energy symposium of the Italian affiliate of the International Association for Energy Economics (AIEE) in Milan 2016, and at the Universite Paris-Dauphine in 2017.

To succeed, aid relies on the principle of upward accountability to donors. But federalism shifts the accountability of subnational officials downward to regional and local voters. What happens when aid agencies fund anti-inequality programs in federal countries? Does federalism undermine aid? Does aid undermine federalism? Or can the political and fiscal relations that define a federal system resolve the contradiction internally? We explore this paradox via the Promotion of Basic Services program in Ethiopia, the largest donor-financed investment program in the world. Using an original panel database comprising the universe of Ethiopian woredas (districts), the study finds that horizontal (geographic) inequality decreased substantially. Donor-financed block grants to woredas increased the availability of primary education and health care services in the bottom 20% of woredas. Weaker evidence from household surveys suggests that vertical inequality across wealth groups (within woredas) also declined, implying that individuals from the poorest households benefit disproportionately from increasing access to, and utilization of, such services. The evidence suggests that by combining strong upward accountability over public investment with enhanced citizen engagement on local issues, Ethiopia's federal system resolves the instrumental dissonance posed by aid-funded programs to combat inequality in a federation.

The EU enlargement process, the EU policies regarding youth, the economic crisis affecting national economies on different levels, political instabilities in some European countries, high rates of unemployment or the increasing number of refugees are only a few of the factors influencing net migration in Europe. Based on a set of socio-economic indicators for EU/EFTA countries and cluster analysis, the paper provides an overview of regional differences across European countries, related to migration magnitude in the identified clusters. The obtained clusters are in accordance with previous studies in migration, and appear stable during the period of 2005-2013, with only some exceptions. The analysis revealed three country clusters: EU/EFTA center-receiving countries, EU/EFTA periphery-sending countries and EU/EFTA outlier countries, the names suggesting not only the geographical position within Europe, but the trends in net migration flows during the years. Therewith, the results provide evidence for the persistence of a movement from periphery to center countries, which is correlated with recent flows of mobility in Europe.","[Manafi, Ioana; Marinescu, Daniela; Roman, Monica] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Hemming, Karen] Deutsch Jugendinst eV, Halle, Saale, Germany",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Manafi, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ioana.manafi@csie.ase.ro,"Manafi, Ioana/F-6300-2015; Hemming, Karen/T-4914-2019; Roman, Monica/H-8401-2016","Roman, Monica/0000-0002-9347-0639; Manafi, Ioana/0000-0001-6070-5254",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [649263]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649263] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"The paper is a result of the MOVE project, Mapping mobility - pathways, institutions and structural effects of youth mobility in Europe.

Although, the key corporate responsibility is profit making, the CSR implementation in corporate vision contributes to company's development. CSR can help increase business credibility, but it can also have significant internal effects due to innovation, readiness for future customer demands, employee motivation and loyalty. The primary objective of the paper is to explore organizational culture in connection with the implementation of the Corporate Social Responsibility concept in companies in the Czech Republic.

However, evidence supporting or challenging this view has been limited. This article proposes two new measures of cumulative resistance to exports in global value chains and a measure of the average number of border crossings that build on the inter-country input-output framework. Data from the World Input-Output Database are supplemented with estimates derived from the UN Comtrade and UN TRAINS, allowing for an experimental computation of the accumulated import tariffs faced by exporters in 2001, 2005 and 2010. The average number of border crossings exhibits a slow upward trend, but the accumulated tariffs decline quickly. Trade liberalization therefore neutralizes the risk of higher cumulative protection associated with the international fragmentation of production. The benefits of liberalization or facilitation of trade within free trade agreements accrue to non-members, and this effect can now be estimated.","[Muradov, Kirill] Ctr Informat & Anal Foreign Trade, 43 Zatsepa St, Moscow 115054, Russia",,"Muradov, K (通讯作者)，Ctr Informat & Anal Foreign Trade, 43 Zatsepa St, Moscow 115054, Russia.",kmuradov@mail.ru,"Muradov, Kirill/AGT-4482-2022","Muradov, Kirill/0000-0002-6437-7427",,,,,25,10,10,3,46,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

In doing so, we shed light on the relative importance of coinciding, non-coinciding monetary surprises and non-monetary surprises across the yield curve.

Impacts of these contracts have not been analyzed systematically. Here, data from a village survey, spanning a time period from 1992 to 2012, are used to evaluate effects on rural economic development. Panel regression models with village fixed effects show that contracts have significantly contributed to wealth accumulation. Contracts signed before 1999 were more beneficial than contracts signed afterward, which is due to more public sector support and infrastructure investments during the earlier period. Contracts have contributed to decreasing inter-village inequality, not only because poorer villages were more likely to adopt a contract, but also because they benefited more from contract adoption than richer ones. The results suggest that well-designed contracts can be important for smallholder farmers to benefit from the oil palm boom. The village-level approach has clear advantages to evaluate direct and indirect economic effects, but it also has drawbacks in terms of analyzing environmental effects and issues of intra-village inequality. More research with various approaches is needed to better understand the multifaceted implications of oil palm contracts for sustainable rural development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that along the balanced growth path equilibrium, economic growth may be non-monotonically related to the population growth rate as agents care for the environment; moreover, demographic policies can be used both to achieve win-win outcomes (simultaneously fostering economic growth and improving environmental quality) and to stabilize the otherwise non-monotonic economic and population growth relationship.","[Marsiglio, Simone] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Marsiglio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",,"Marsiglio, Simone/K-2863-2012",,,,,,56,6,6,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

This market is characterized by leading the carbon price discovery process and by being highly dominated by professional traders. Both features make it an appropriate environment for the existence of herding. A patterns analysis indicates that the herding level increases in speculative periods, on those days on which the price and size clustering effect is stronger, and with the arrival of carbon-related news. Regarding possible market drivers, we find that herding behavior is positively related with the number of trades, the intraday volatility and on days with extreme returns. Our results appear to support the claim that the lower the availability of information, the higher the level of herding. Finally, we show that herding increases market volatility and leads carbon traders to overreact. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The results of DEA indicate that average participation bank efficiency is higher than the average conventional bank efficiency each year. Regarding Tobit regression analysis, while expenses and loan quality have a significantly negative relationship with efficiency of conventional banks, they have a significantly positive relationship with the efficiency of participation banks. While the total loans have a significantly positive relationship, external variables have a significantly negative relationship with efficiency of both types of the banks.

The underlying assumption for the most part is that there are deficiencies in the abilities of the group in question, and does not question the possibility that the system or structure may be dysfunctional. The ongoing design and implementation of international protected area management systems in general, and the one described in this paper, continue to be based on a foundational assumption of a lack of community capacity for governance of the resources on which they depend, the deficit model. Emerging from the context of a community in Trindade, Brazil, the goal of the present project was to support members of a community-based organization in capacity development endeavors for needs they identified, Although the implementation of a series of courses is not a novel approach to capacity development, the commitment to critical pedagogy, the clarity of capacity development of what and for whom that was based on an assumption of capacity, defining the capacities needed and the purpose, and being guided by theory, were perhaps the more novel approaches used in this action research project. The goal of capacity development as attempted in the present research project was not to develop skills so that people may fit into an unjust structure or for ease of social control, but to support the enhancement of skills and knowledge to challenge the existing state of affairs. Instead of the insistence on Indigenous Peoples becoming willing partners in flawed governance systems, much work is needed to continue to address these significant flaws and failings, and to critically challenge the status quo.

Network indicators are widely used for characterizing transport network topology and its performance as well as provide insights on, possible developments.

This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of the topological evolution of a multimodal rail network by investigating the dynamics of its topology for the case of Stockholm in 1950-2025. The starting year marks the opening of the metro system while the end year is set to mark the completion of the current development plan. Based on a compilation of network topology and service properties, a year-on-year analysis of changes in global network efficiency and directness as well as local nodal centrality were conducted. Changes in network topology exhibit smooth long-term technological and spatial trends as well as the signature of top-down planning interventions. Stockholm rail network evolution is characterized by contraction and stagnation periods followed by network extensions and is currently undergoing a considerable densification, marking a shift from peripheral attachment to preferential attachment.","[Cats, Oded] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Transport & Planning, Delft, Netherlands; [Cats, Oded] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Dept Transport Sci, Stockholm, Sweden",Delft University of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology,"Cats, O (通讯作者)，Stevinweg 1,POB 5048, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",o.cats@tudelft.nl,,"Cats, Oded/0000-0002-4506-0459",,,,,46,63,66,14,88,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

This study investigated whether, in the absence of specific mHealth interventions, people make different healthcare decisions if they use mobile phones during an illness. Following mainstream narratives, we hypothesized that phone use during an illness (a) increases and (b) accelerates healthcare access. Our study was based on original survey data from 800 respondents in rural Rajasthan (India) and Gansu (China), sampled from the general adult population in 2014 in a three-stage stratified cluster random sampling design. We analyzed single- and multi-level logistic, Poisson, and negative binomial regression models with cluster-robust standard errors. Contrary to other research at the intersection of mobile phones and healthcare, we captured actual health-related mobile phone use during people's illnesses irrespective of whether they own a phone. Our analysis produced the first quantitative micro-evidence that patients' personal mobile phone use is correlated with their healthcare decisions. Despite a positive association between phone use and healthcare access, health-related phone use was also linked to delayed access to public doctors and nurses. We considered theoretical explanations for the observed patterns by augmenting transaction cost and information deficit arguments with the prevailing health system configuration and with notions of heuristic decision-making during the healthcare-seeking process. Our study was a first step toward understanding the implications of mobile technology diffusion on health behavior in low- and middle income countries in the absence of specific mHealth interventions. Future research will have to explore the causal relationships underlying these statistical associations. Such a link could potentially mean that development interventions aimed at improving access to healthcare continue to require conventional solutions to sustain healthcare equity.

Most models used suffer from two drawbacks: relatively simplistic treatment of the cost of water extraction, and a lack of important structural results (such as monotonicity of extraction in stock and concavity of the value function), even in simple models. Lack of structural properties impede both practical policy simulation and clarity of understanding of the resulting models and the underlying economics. This paper provides a unifying framework for these models in two directions; first, the usual cost function is extended to encompass cases where marginal cost of pumping depends on the stock and second, the analysis dispenses with assumptions of concavity of the objective function and compactness of the state space, using instead lattice-theoretic methods. With these modifications, a comprehensive investigation of which structural properties can be proved in each of the resulting cases is carried out. It is shown that for some of the richer models more structural properties may be proved than for the simpler model used in the literature. This paper also introduces to the resource economics literature an important method of proving convergence to a stationary distribution which does not require monotonicity in stock of resource. This method is of interest in a variety of renewable resource model settings.","[Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran B.] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, POB 5005, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran B.] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Econ & Business, CERE, Umea, Sweden",Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics; Umea University,"Krishnamurthy, CKB (通讯作者)，Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, POB 5005, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden.;Krishnamurthy, CKB (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Umea Sch Econ & Business, CERE, Umea, Sweden.",chandra.kiran@beijer.kva.se,,"Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran/0000-0002-9494-6467",,,,,43,6,7,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Using spatial discrete choice models, including the first application of a spatial probit latent class model with class-specific neighbourhood effects, we find evidence of large local differences in the determinants of brownfields redevelopment in England and that the reuse decisions of adjacent sites affect the reuse of a site. We also find that sites with a history of industrial activities, large sites, and sites that are located in the poorest and bleakest areas of cities and regions of England are more difficult to redevelop. In particular, we find that the probability of reusing a brownfield increases by up to 8.5 % for a site privately owned compared to a site publicly owned and between 15 and 30 % if a site is located in London compared to the North West of England. We suggest that local tailored policies are more suitable than regional or national policies to boost the reuse of brownfield sites.","[Longo, Alberto] Queens Univ Belfast, UKCRC Ctr Excellence Publ Hlth, Sch Biol Sci, Gibson Inst Land Food & Environm,Inst Global Food, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Longo, Alberto] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Bilbao 48008, Spain; [Campbell, Danny] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Econ Div, Stirling, Scotland",Queens University Belfast; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Stirling,"Longo, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, UKCRC Ctr Excellence Publ Hlth, Sch Biol Sci, Gibson Inst Land Food & Environm,Inst Global Food, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.;Longo, A (通讯作者)，Basque Ctr Climate Change, Bilbao 48008, Spain.",a.longo@qub.ac.uk; danny.campbell@stir.ac.uk,"Campbell, Danny/E-1873-2011",,"UKCRC Centre of Excellence for Public Health Northern Ireland MRC grant [MR/K023241/1]; Financial Aid Programme for Researchers of BIZKAIA: TALENT Transportation Policies: Emissions Reductions, Public Health Benefits, and Acceptability; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-52587-R]","UKCRC Centre of Excellence for Public Health Northern Ireland MRC grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Financial Aid Programme for Researchers of BIZKAIA: TALENT Transportation Policies: Emissions Reductions, Public Health Benefits, and Acceptability; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","Alberto Longo wishes to acknowledge funding from: the UKCRC Centre of Excellence for Public Health Northern Ireland MRC grant number MR/K023241/1; the Financial Aid Programme for Researchers 2014 of BIZKAIA: TALENT Transportation Policies: Emissions Reductions, Public Health Benefits, and Acceptability; and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Grant ECO2014-52587-R.",,76,21,21,5,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper focuses on analyzing the impact of municipalities' per capita property tax revenues on multidimensional poverty in the Colombian case. This locally raised tax is used as an indicator of the state capacity that municipalities exercise when fiscal decentralization takes place. To estimate its impact on poverty, we control for the possible endogeneity biases that might affect this relationship while taking into account that multidimensional poverty exhibits strong spatial correlation among Colombian municipalities. We find statistically significant results that demonstrate a causal and diminishing effect of property tax revenues on the poverty headcount ratio and gap. We also find that this effect has substantial spillovers across municipalities. The findings of the paper highlight the need to strengthen subnational revenue systems through policy designs to increase locally raised revenues. We simulate four different counterfactual scenarios to evaluate the potential effect of alternative policy designs on multidimensional poverty. The results of these policy scenarios demonstrate that spatially differentiated policy schemes have greater effectiveness in reducing multidimensional poverty than geographically mute designs.

In this article, we argue that a grand plan for a basic or guaranteed income is unnecessary because self-financing redesign of existing tax credits to be refundable can better target benefits to low-income families while improving tax equity. Using 2015 tax and transfer parameters and estimates of income and population, we assess the federal transfer system as a source of universal income security, identify the revenues that can be raised through the elimination of selected federal tax credits, present four options that could be financed within that budget constraint, assess their performance, and select our preferred universal basic guaranteed income (UGBI) option. We then provide a more detailed assessment of the impact of our preferred UGBI design and discuss the extension of that design to provincial tax and transfer systems. We estimate that the combined federal and provincial UGBI that we propose would effectively target benefits to low-income households and virtually eliminate poverty for all but single non-elderly individuals at a modest efficiency cost in terms of work disincentives.","[Stevens, Harvey; Simpson, Wayne] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Stevens, H (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",,,,,,,,24,12,14,2,51,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Additionally, the internal processes that take place within the board particularly Cognitive Conflict, the Critical and Independent Approach and the Comprehensive Discussion Process influence the board's strategic involvement and play a partial mediating role on the aforementioned relationships. However, our results show no evidence for a positive relationship between Board Meeting Dynamics and the board's strategic involvement. (C) 2017 AEDEM.

We introduce a three country extension of the Taylor rule fundamentals model with adaptive learning. Moreover, economies are affected by common and/or country-specific shocks and react according to the preferences of central banks. The simulation results suggest that the extent to which exchange rates comove in the long run strongly depends on the extent of linkages between economies and the purchasing power parity of exchange rates. Indeed without similar Taylor rules in two economically linked countries, exchange rates comovements disappear. We pursue our theoretical analysis using real data and find strong evidence of fractional cointegration between several European exchange rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

One reason could be associated with the fact that in-home activities do not explicitly involve trips. Besides, data limitation could be another reason since most of the travel surveys are based on the household travel diary approach and do not encompass in-home activity information. Nonetheless, incorporating people's in-home activities into the activity-based travel demand frameworks and perceiving the associations between the activities people perform in home and out of home could enhance the activity generation, planning, and scheduling procedures. In an effort to analyze such associations, this study uses a sequential conditional probability approach for modelling activity type and duration decisions of in-home activities in conjunction with out-of-home ones. The paper first proposes an algorithm to incorporate in-home activities within the Agent-based Activity Planning and Travel Scheduling (ADAPTS) framework. Then, models regarding generation and planning of in-home activities are presented and described accordingly. The new framework is capable of modelling and simulating in-home activities alongside and in conjunction with out-of home activities with a special focus on a large set of in-home activity types.","[Langerudi, Mehran Fasihozaman; Javanmardi, Mahmoud; Shabanpour, Ramin; Mohammadian, Abolfazl] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Mat Engn, 842 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Rashidi, Taha Hossein] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Shabanpour, R (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Mat Engn, 842 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",mfasih2@uic.edu; mjavan2@uic.edu; rshaba4@uic.edu; rashidi@unsw.edu.au; kouros@uic.edu,"Rashidi, Taha Hossein/D-1151-2015; Mohammadian, Abolfazl/B-6727-2012; Shabanpour, Ramin/JMC-2161-2023","Rashidi, Taha Hossein/0000-0002-0673-5011; Mohammadian, Abolfazl/0000-0003-3595-3664; Shabanpour, Ramin/0000-0001-7142-0457",,,,,26,6,6,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We find that when there exists subcontracting, the presence of a foreign firm raises social welfare. Comparing to competing with the domestic private firm, when the public firm competes with the foreign firm, social welfare is lower, but consumer welfare is higher. And a variation in firms' costs or tariffs has no effect on either firm's location. Tariff on inputs raises domestic social welfare and government will charge an input tariff to the extent of costs difference. Tariff on final good has no effect on welfare but will raise prices and thus hurt consumers. Compared to no tariff at all, tariff on inputs alone raises retail prices, but tariffs on both inputs and final goods may reduce prices and raise consumer surplus.","[Lyu, Yuanzhen] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shuai, Jie] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, East Lake High Tech Dev Zone, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Shuai, J (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, East Lake High Tech Dev Zone, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.",yuanzhen@ust.hk; shuaijie@gmail.com,,"Shuai, Jie/0000-0003-1922-1033",National Science Foundation of China [71603283],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We wish to thank the editor Hamid Beladi, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

This research contributes to knowledge of walking behaviour by aggregating GPS-tracked walking trips as neighborhood walking densities, and investigating local characteristics affecting those densities. The study maps walking trips in urban and suburban neighborhoods of Halifax, Canada, using data from the Space-Time Activity Research (STAR) survey conducted in 2007-2008. Respondents completed a two-day time-diary, and their movements were tracked using a GPS data logger. The 1971 primary respondents recorded 5005 geo-referenced walking trips. From mapped walking tracks, walking distances were aggregated to 87 census tracts, and expressed as walking densities (per resident, per meter of road, and per developed area). Multivariate regression was used to examine which neighborhood variables and socio-demographic controls are most useful as estimators of walking densities. Contrary to much of the walkability literature, built-environment measures of road connectivity and dwelling density were found to have little estimating power. Rather, retail lot coverage ratio was the single most useful estimator, acting as a proxy to identify traditional retail shopping streets. Office and institutional land uses were also important contributory estimators (highlighting areas of dense employment), as were measures of residents' income and age.","[Neatt, Kevin; Millward, Hugh; Spinney, Jamie] St Marys Univ, Dept Geog &Environmental Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Millward, H (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Dept Geog &Environmental Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",hugh.millward@smu.ca,"Spinney, Jamie E.

REEs are also the object of rent-shifting strategic trade policies, as highlighted by a recent WTO ruling against China's quotas and tariffs on exports of REEs. We construct a three-country trade model with an environmental damage function, in order to examine the effects of three policies with different implications for the equilibrium quantities of dirty inputs and clean technologies: a downstream subsidy, an upstream export tariff, and an upstream pollution tax. We relate the welfare implications of the policies to the parameters of the damage function and to the number of downstream competitors. The effects of a unilateral policy switch from an export tariff to a domestic pollution tax, as suggested by China's reaction to the WTO challenge, are also examined.","[Wan, Rui] Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wen, Jean-Francois] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",Nanjing University; University of Calgary,"Wan, R (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wanrui@nju.edu.cn; wen@ucalgary.ca,,"Wen, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4777-7277",,,,,22,6,7,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We also explore indirect pathways-mother's education, health, and empowerment as well as community channels-operating from early marriage to child schooling and assess the presence of negative externalities for non early married mothers and their children on education transmission in communities with large rates of child marriage. In our econometric analysis we employ OLS, matching, instrumental variables, and pseudo-panel for a better understanding of changes over time. Our results show that early marriage is still a significant source of inequality, though its impact has decreased across time: girls born to early married mothers are between 6% and 11% more likely to never been to school and 1.6% and 1.7% to enter late, and 3.3% and 5.1% less likely to complete primary school, whereas boys are between 5.2% and 8.8% more likely to never been to school and 1% and 1.9% to enter late, and 2.3% and 5.5% less likely to complete primary school. Second, child marriage increases gender inequality within household's with girls losing an additional 0.07 years of schooling as compared to boys if born to early married mothers. Third, our estimates show that mother's education and health mediate some of the effect of early marriage and that the large prevalence of child marriage in a community also impairs educational transmission for non-early married mothers. Fourth, empowering of young wives can weaken other channels of transmission of education inequalities. Overall, our findings highlight the need to target these children with the appropriate interventions and support to achieve the greater focus on equity in the global post-2015 education agenda.

We do this by using a quantile regression method while most of the research in the field of liquidity and volatility has employed conventional OLS regression. While the latter approach can be useful in many applications, it fails to provide any insight about the effects in the rest of the distributions - outside the mean - of interest. Our results show that a distinct volatility smile is formed when trading activity, measured by the number of unique trades, increases. In contrast, an increase in trade size decreases volatility significantly, especially at the tails, resulting in an inverse smile or a frown. Similar results are obtained for the relation between the liquidity measures and the return distribution. We explain our results by trading behavior of heterogeneous traders and suggest directions for future theoretical and empirical research within this field.","[Haugom, Erik] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Postbox 952, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway; [Ray, Rina] Univ Colorado Denver, Business Sch, Denver, CO USA",Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado Denver; Children's Hospital Colorado,"Haugom, E (通讯作者)，Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Postbox 952, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway.",erik.haugom@hil.no; rina.ray@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,,69,18,18,1,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

By using the dispersion of inflation forecasts to measure this uncertainty, we find the opposite. Since the prices of long-term bonds move more with inflation than short-term ones, investors also disagree and speculate more about long-maturity payoffs with greater uncertainty. Shorting frictions, measured by using Treasury lending fees, then lead long maturities to become overpriced and the yield curve to flatten.

The current study analyses the bias of missing data on a selective hedging strategy, where currency options are applied in case of Value at Risk (1%) signs. However, there can be special occasions when one or some data is missing due to lack of a trading activity. This paper focuses on the impact of different missing data handling methods on GARCH and Value at Risk model parameters, because of selective hedging and option pricing based on them. The main added value of the current paper is the comparison of the impact of different methods, such as listwise deletion, mean substitution, and maximum likelihood based Expectation Maximization, on risk management because this subject has insufficient literature. The current study tested daily closing data of floating currencies from Kenya (KES), Ghana (GHS), South Africa (ZAR), Tanzania (TZS), Uganda (UGX), Gambia (GMD), Madagascar (MGA) and Mozambique (MZN) in USD denomination against EUR/USD rate between March 8, 2000 and March 6, 2015 acquired from the Bloomberg database. Our results suggested the biases of missingness on Value at Risk and volatility models, presenting significant differences among the number of extreme fluctuations or model parameters. A selective hedging strategy can have different expenditures due to the choice of method. This paper suggests the usage of mean substitution or listwise deletion for daily financial time series due to their tendency to have a close to zero first momentum.","[Kiss, Gabor David; Savai, Marianna; Udvari, Beata] Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Kalvaria Sgt 1, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Kiss, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Kalvaria Sgt 1, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary.",kiss.gabor.david@eco.u-szeged.hu; savai.marianna@eco.u-szeged.hu; udvari.beata@eco.u-szeged.hu,"Kiss, Gábor Dávid/A-2389-2013","Kiss, Gábor Dávid/0000-0003-0373-9970",,,,,49,2,5,1,8,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

This would suggest a key decision making role for energy users, in all their diversity. However, the industry's critical role in societal, welfare, large environmental impacts, and the challenges of ensuring it's secure and reliable operation, all represent key shared long-term interests requiring high levels of coordination. The role of energy users within many electricity industries has transitioned over time from clients to citizens, then to consumers and now, in restructured industries, to customers. Increasingly, however, emerging distributed energy technologies including photovoltaics, storage and 'smart' loads are offering energy users new industry roles as prosumers rather than just consumers, and utility business partners, or potentially even utility competitors, rather than just customers. This paper outlines some of the experiences of energy users in the Australian National Electricity Market over the past decade as more than 15% of households have installed PV systems, and incumbent industry stakeholders and policy makers have struggled to reconcile formal market principles of encouraging energy user participation, with the realities of what such participation can do to existing business models. Australia's experience holds broader relevance as electricity industries worldwide look to better manage the challenges posed by prosumers while facilitating the societal benefits they can bring, particularly with the growing capabilities and falling costs of PV and energy storage systems. More generally, facilitating greater engagement with energy users will likely be essential in establishing the societal consensus required for the profound and highly disruptive transformation to a cleaner energy future.","[MacGill, Iain] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Smith, Robert] East Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"MacGill, L (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",i.macgill@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,58,12,12,0,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

The first-best policy consists of an aggressive renewables subsidy in the near term and a gradually rising and falling carbon tax. Given that global carbon taxes remain elusive, policy makers might have to rely on a second-best subsidy only. With credible commitment the second-best subsidy is higher than the social benefit of learning to cut the transition time and peak warming close to first-best levels at the cost of higher fossil fuel use in the short run (weak Green Paradox). Without commitment the second-best subsidy is set to the social benefit of learning. It generates smaller weak Green Paradox effects, but the transition to the carbon-free takes longer and cumulative carbon emissions are higher. Under first best and second best with pre-commitment peak warming is 2.1-2.3 C, under second best without commitment 3.5 C, and without any policy 5.1 C above pre-industrial levels. Not being able to commit yields a welfare loss of 95% of initial GDP compared to first best. Being able to commit brings this figure down to 7%.","[Rezai, Armon] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Rezai, Armon] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] St Petersburg State Univ, Lab Econ Performance & Environm, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rezai, Armon] WIIW, Rahlgasse 3, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Oxford; Saint Petersburg State University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"van der Ploeg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.;van der Ploeg, F (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Lab Econ Performance & Environm, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.;van der Ploeg, F (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",armon.rezai@wu.ac.at; rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Rezai, Armon/0000-0002-6598-7307",OeNB Anniversary Fund grant [15330]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J 3633]; ERC Advanced Grant 'Political Economy of Green Paradoxes' (FP7-IDEAS-ERC Grant) [269788]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J3633] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF); European Research Council (ERC) [269788] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),OeNB Anniversary Fund grant; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); ERC Advanced Grant 'Political Economy of Green Paradoxes' (FP7-IDEAS-ERC Grant); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); European Research Council (ERC),"Previous versions of this paper have benefited from helpful comments from Erik Ansink, Reyer Gerlagh, John Hassler, Per Krusell and seminar participants at Oxford, Tilburg and the Tinbergen Institute and audiences at Annecy, SURED 2014, Ascona, and WCERE 2014, Istanbul.

The finite production capacity in each period is considered. The manufacturer operates close to this production capacity. In this setting, the retailer's order decision has a direct impact on the manufacturer's production utilization. Most inventory-focused literature research control inventory levels and allow production levels to vary substantially each period. The manufacturer, however, prefers a stable level of production, i.e. a smooth order pattern from the retailer. Competitiveness of a supply chain is set by its performance as a whole. In a decentralized chain, each link focuses on its own interests. Can the supplier pursuing his/her own goals improve the performance of the whole chain? In this paper, we explore the effects of production smoothing on total system per-unit costs while considering inventory as well as production related costs.","[Synakova, Lucie] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Synakova, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",lucie.synakova@tul.cz,,,,,,,40,7,9,1,7,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Vulnerability to food poverty is assessed based on expected future food expenditure of households. The potential endogeneity problem associated with participation in non-farm work by households is overcome using a novel instrumental variable approach. Analysis of the determinants of expected future food expenditure is done using a standard Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) method. Demographic and socioeconomic variables, location variables, and household facilities are included in the model as control variables. Our study finds that participation in non-farm work significantly increased the future expected food consumption, thereby alleviating the vulnerability of households to food poverty. Our study also confirms that current food poverty and future food poverty, i.e., vulnerability to food poverty, are not independent from each other. Non-farm work plays a crucial role in providing the means to overcome the risk of food poverty in these resource poor households. Policies that promote off-farm income generating activities, such as small businesses and self-employment, as well as the creation and support of businesses that absorb extra labor from the farm, should be encouraged in the study region. Because households in the study region are exposed to above average levels of hunger and food poverty, the study recommends the government of Ghana and development partners to take measures that enhance the resilience of these resource poor households.

The research's findings suggest that firms are inclined to form simultaneous alliances when they have more prior alliance experience, conduct exploration alliances, or are in high level of technological diversification. Second, although simultaneous alliance formation may decrease a firm's performance, greater alliance experience and inter-industry alliances may mitigate such the negative effect of simultaneous alliance formation on firm performance. Low levels of technological diversification may increase firm performance as forming simultaneous alliances. Moreover, propensity to form simultaneous alliances is increased with the increased number of formed alliances as larger firm size, organizational experience, and alliance experience take place. This article contributes to the current strategic alliances and organizational learning literature by introducing the concept of simultaneous and one-by-one alliances.","[Huang, Kuo-Feng] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Business Adm, 64,Sec 2,Zhi Nan Rd, Taipei 116, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Huang, KF (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Business Adm, 64,Sec 2,Zhi Nan Rd, Taipei 116, Taiwan.",kfhuang@nccu.edu.tw,,"Huang, Kuo-Feng/0000-0002-7230-6290",National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC-98-2410-H-004-068-MY2],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This work was supported by Research Project from the National Science Council of Taiwan under Grant NSC-98-2410-H-004-068-MY2.

The Nixon tapes, personal tape recordings made during the presidency of Richard Nixon, provide a unique body of evidence to investigate the motivations for Nixon's stunning reversal. We uncover and report in this paper evidence that Nixon manipulated his New Economic Policy to help secure his reelection victory in 1972. He became convinced that wage and price controls were necessary to grab the headlines away from the defeatist abandonment of the Bretton Woods Agreement and the closing of the U.S. gold window.

Being held in high regards helps firms to build, maintain and foster long lasting relationships with different groups of stakeholders, including customers. Despite this evidence, little research has been conducted in the sphere of measuring corporate reputation exclusively from a customer point of view. The present paper contributes to the reputation debate regarding the need for greater theoretical and scientific clarity in developing a customer-based metric for corporate reputation. Specifically, the primary aim of this article is to develop and validate an alternative instrument for measuring customer-based corporate reputation of service firms. The rationale of selecting service industry as research context is justified by the emphasized role that reputation plays in economic sectors with a higher level of lack of tangibility. In the absence of physical evidences of the quality of the services provided, customers make their purchasing choices relying on signals or cues received from companies. In this context, reputation reduces the information asymmetry and turns into a filter which assists customers' decisions. Hence, the article proposes a customer-based reputation model adapted to the service industry in Romania. We found that reputation in a purchasing-decision context is driven by firm's capability to adopt a customer-oriented strategy. The results indicate that offering value for money services, with superior quality, is no longer enough to be remembered by customers and, therefore, portfolio of services is, by no means, the only reputation factor that matters. We found that companies are required to combine behavioral and emotional metrics to capture the customers' true attention and remain competitive. In the service context, what has emerged in this study is the need to enhance the customer experience by making them feel respected and important when interacting with the company.","[Balan, Dragos-Alexandru; Burlea Schiopoiu, Adriana] Univ Craiova, 13 AI Cuza St, Craiova 200585, Romania",University of Craiova,"Balan, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, 13 AI Cuza St, Craiova 200585, Romania.",dragos.balan03@gmail.com; adriana_burlea@yahoo.com,"Burlea-Schiopoiu, Adriana/B-8733-2009","Burlea-Schiopoiu, Adriana/0000-0002-3600-3663",,,,,46,9,9,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,595,606,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800046,0

We show that deals with a higher level of equity tranche have a significantly lower delinquency rate conditional on observable loan characteristics. The effect is concentrated within pools with a higher likelihood of asymmetric information between deal sponsors and potential buyers of the securities. Further, securities sold from high-equity-tranche deals command higher prices conditional on their credit ratings. Overall, our results show that the goal of security design in this market was not only to exploit regulatory arbitrage, but also to mitigate information frictions that were pervasive in this market.","[Begley, Taylor A.] Washington Univ, London Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Begley, Taylor A.] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Purnanandam, Amiyatosh] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Begley, TA (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England.",tbegley@london.edu,"Begley, Taylor/S-1706-2019",,CoreLogic,CoreLogic,"We especially thank Itay Goldstein, two anonymous referees, and Uday Rajan for comments that significantly improved this paper.

To examine the causal effect of the education of older children on their younger siblings, we use the introduction of a gender-targeted conditional cash transfer program - the Female Secondary School Stipend Program (FSSSP) in Bangladesh. We find that an additional year of schooling of older siblings increases schooling of their younger siblings by 0.13 years. The stipend program accounts for about a 10 per cent increase in the schooling of younger siblings.

Results collected using qualitative social research approach reveal different models of using tangible and intangible culture resources bringing new economic forms to rural territories of Latvia.

Relying on Italian administrative data from 1991 to 2009, we are able to instrument the gender of elected politicians using an institutional exogenous change: a gender quota in the candidacy list enforced only in a subsample of municipalities and for a short period of time. While the gender of politicians does not affect the general 'quality of life', proxied by the internal migration rate, it does increase significantly both the efficacy of policies targeting women and households, proxied by the fertility rate, and the efficiency of the municipal administration, proxied by the actual size of the administrative bodies. These results, which are robust to several specifications and checks, suggest that affirmative action enhancing gender equality in political representation may be beneficial not only in terms of social justice but also from a political outcome perspective.","[Braga, Michela] Univ Commerciale Luigi Bocconi, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Scervini, Francesco] Univ Pavia, Corso Str Nuova 65, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",Bocconi University; University of Pavia,"Braga, M (通讯作者)，Univ Commerciale Luigi Bocconi, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",michela.braga@unibocconi.it; francesco.scervini@unipv.it,,"SCERVINI, Francesco/0000-0001-6403-5876",,,,,45,18,21,1,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

We utilize smooth transition heteroskedastic models with a second-order logistic function to generate trading entry and exit signals and suggest two pair trading strategies: the first uses the upper and lower threshold values in the proposed model as trading entry and exit signals, while the second strategy instead takes one-step-ahead quantile forecasts obtained from the same model. We employ Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods for updating the estimates and quantile forecasts. As an illustration, we conduct a simulation study and empirical analysis of the daily stock returns of 36 stocks from U.S. stock markets. We use the minimum square distance method to select ten stock pairs, choose additional five pairs consisting of two companies in the same industrial sector, and then finally consider pair trading profits for two out-of-sample periods in 2014 within a six-month time frame as well as for the entire year. The proposed strategies yield average annualized returns of at least 35.5% without a transaction cost and at least 18.4% with a transaction cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This text evaluates the objectives of legislative changes (transparency, increase in competition powers and effective price enforcement) examined from the viewpoint of selected parameters of the procurement market. It was found that the transparency in terms of reducing the use of the restricted procedure of public procurement improved and the share of public contracts conducted under the new Act on Public Procurement increased immediately after new legislation. This article positively evaluates a drop in one-offer contracts and continuous tendency towards lower price levels of the public procurement. This analysis includes identification of the impact of an accelerated drawdown of funds from EU programs in connection with the end of the program period in 2015.

A major avenue through which this emphasis has been manifest lies, according to this narrative, in enhancements to women's agency for instrumental and intrinsic reasons particularly through innovations in family planning and microfinance. The  Bangladesh paradox of improved wellbeing despite low economic growth over the last four decades is claimed as a paradigmatic case of the spread of both modern family planning programmes and microfinance leading to women's empowerment and fertility reduction. In this paper we show that the links between microfinance, empowerment and fertility reduction, are fraught with problems, and far from robust; hence the claimed causal links between microfinance and family planning via women's empowerment needs to be further reconsidered.","[Duvendack, Maren; Palmer-Jones, Richard] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Duvendack, M (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",m.duvendack@uea.ac.uk,,"Duvendack, Maren/0000-0002-8125-9115",,,,,76,24,25,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Under the framework of Koszegi and Rabin (2006), we set up a model with two states of the world and the price of insurance is actually fair. We first assume that consumption utility is linear and demonstrate that the propensity to take up insurance is increasing with the loss probability. This finding explains the puzzle that people are not willing to take up subsidized disaster insurance but want to take up insurance for modest risk at highly loaded premiums. In the extreme cases, everyone will buy insurance for almost certain loss at fair premium but nobody will pay fair premium to buy insurance for nearly impossible loss events. To make the expositions more general, we relax the consumption utility to be quadratic and get similar results by numerical analysis. The relation between people's insurance demand and their risk types are also illustrated in this article.","[Fan Chen; Chen Bingzheng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Fan, C (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",fanch.15@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; chenbzh@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,3,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,909,927,,,,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700062,0

This paper provides an alternative and low-cost approach for estimating annual average daily traffic values (AADTs) and the associated transport emissions for all road segments in a country. This is achieved by parsing and processing commonly available information from existing geographical data, census data, traffic data and vehicle fleet data. Ceteris paribus, we find that our annual average daily traffic estimation based on a neural network performs better than traditional regression models, and that the outcomes of our aggregated bottom-up road segment emission estimations are close to the outcomes from top-down models based on total energy consumption in transport. The developed approach can serve as a means of reliably estimating and verifying national road transport emissions, as well as offering a robust means of spatially analysing road transport activity and emissions, so as to support spatial emission inventory compilations, compliance with international environmental agreements, transport simulation modelling and transport planning.

A universal method for the assessment of convergence of regional economies' structures, which is based on gross regional product, has been developed and proposed for testing on the example of other Russian macroregions.","[Gamukin, Valeriy V.] Tyumen State Univ, Dept Finance Money Circulat & Credit, Tyumen, Russia; [Belomyttseva, Olga S.] Tomsk State Univ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tomsk, Russia; [Grinkevich, Larisa S.] Tomsk State Univ, Dept Econ, Tomsk, Russia",Tyumen State University; Tomsk State University; Tomsk State University,"Gamukin, VV (通讯作者)，Tyumen State Univ, Dept Finance Money Circulat & Credit, Tyumen, Russia.",valgam@mail.ru; olbel@f123.ru; nasty_saturn@mail.ru,"Belomyttseva, Olga/O-6867-2014; Grinkevich, Larisa/O-6918-2014; Gamukin, Valeriy V./ABA-3521-2020","Gamukin, Valeriy V./0000-0002-4396-274X",,,,,12,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,63,69,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600011,0

Equating stock market returns with the return to capital, the bulk of the literature concludes that it cannot. This article makes two contributions. First is an equivalence for the neoclassical growth model between a stock market return and a return based on income and capital stock data. While the stock market return is extremely volatile, the income-based return is not. Second is the finding that the neoclassical growth model with shocks to labor productivity alone can account for the bulk of the observed volatility of the income-based return to capital (expressed relative to the volatility of income) but little of the volatility of the stock market return. Simultaneously explaining the volatility of the two measures of the return to capital within the neoclassical model will require a theory of the stock market that breaks our return-equivalence results.","[Gomme, Paul] Concordia Univ, Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gomme, Paul] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ravikumar, B.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res, St Louis, MO USA; [Rupert, Peter] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Concordia University - Canada; Universite de Montreal; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Gomme, P (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Gomme, P (通讯作者)，CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,"Ravikumar, B./K-6862-2016","Ravikumar, B./0000-0001-6991-4677",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2016-1388],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Paul Gomme is a professor of economics at Concordia University, Montreal, and a research fellow at CIREQ; he acknowledges financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (grant number 435-2016-1388).

The main part of the paper examines the structure of supplies provided to the sector and the structure of demand for agricultural products in the light of input-output tables for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010. The input-output tables were taken from the World Input-Output Database and Central Statistical Office of Poland. Analysis of input-output helped capture the direction of these flows between agriculture and other sectors of the economy. Internal circulation in agriculture is still dominant in the Polish agricultural sector. This sector is at a stage of transformations towards modernity. In the material supply of agribusiness, the role of the service sector must first increase. Transitions are slowly moving in the desired direction. The internal structure of flows changes. The inputoutput model is an important instrument for assessing economic phenomena. It shows the interdependence in the sector that determines its development. Poland still has unused production capacity in agriculture. High potential of the agricultural sector is associated with a relatively low macroeconomic efficiency. Improving efficiency is most likely due to improved productivity of labour. There is a lack of parallel technology improvement. The modern agricultural sector is characterized by low direct consumption and low self-sufficiency. It is characterized by strong relationships with other sectors of the economy.","[Goral, Justyna] Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Math Applicat Agr Econ Dept, Swietokrzyska Str 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Góral, J (通讯作者)，Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Math Applicat Agr Econ Dept, Swietokrzyska Str 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland.",justyna.goral@ierigz.waw.pl,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,79,87,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400010,0

Structural Equations methodology was used to analyze the data and hypothesis. The conceptual model was proposed by combining Diffusion of Innovations and Technology-Organization-Environment theories. The results provide information to agribusiness owners, managers and administrators to promote and incentivize the use of ERP. Politicians and farmers can evaluate each scenario and support their political and administrative decisions through the evaluation of socioeconomic and environmental performances of agricultural exploration as a result of technological innovation. This leads to a need for an analytical tool for the farmers, with the objective of supporting the adoption of optimized ERP for agri-food activities.","[Haberli, Caetano, Jr.] Univ Sao Paulo, Super Sch Advertising & Mkt ESPM, BR-03178200 Butanta, SP, Brazil; [Haberli, Caetano, Jr.] Univ Nova Lisboa, IMS, Campus Campolide, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal; [Haberli, Caetano, Jr.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Commun & Arts, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Haberli, Caetano, Jr.] Agroipes, Rod Sc 405 4850, BR-88065000 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Oliveira, Tiago] Univ Nova Lisboa, NOVA Informat Management Sch NOVA IMS, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal; [Yanaze, Mitsuru] Univ Sao Paulo ECA USP, Mkt & Commun, BR-03178200 Butanta, SP, Brazil; [Yanaze, Mitsuru] Univ Sao Paulo ECA USP, Sch Commun & Arts, BR-03178200 Butanta, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Haberli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Super Sch Advertising & Mkt ESPM, BR-03178200 Butanta, SP, Brazil.;Haberli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, IMS, Campus Campolide, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal.;Haberli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Commun & Arts, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;Haberli, C (通讯作者)，Agroipes, Rod Sc 405 4850, BR-88065000 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",caetanohaberlijr@me.com,"Oliveira, Tiago/GSD-3675-2022; Oliveira, Tiago/B-4090-2011","Oliveira, Tiago/0000-0001-6523-0809",,,,,78,7,7,2,36,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Although this functional form is known as being flexible, it is not applicable to those banks incurring economic losses. The recently developed approach, i.e., the censored stochastic frontier model (CSFM), by Tsay et al. (2013) appears to be superior to existing approaches, since CSFM does not need to transform negative profit into positive profit before taking the natural logarithm. The transformation with respect to the profit variable tends to bias the parameter estimates of the profit frontier and the subsequent profit efficiency measure. We show that the parameter estimates of CSFM have the desirable statistical properties. Moreover, empirical results reveal that the mean profit efficiency of CSFM is more robust than those models using transformed profits across the sub-periods 1991-1998 and 1999-2009.

Raising taxpayers' awareness about lawful calculation and payment of public revenues is a key issue for every country and the one in which the accounting profession plays a significant part in addition to the tax authority. Any business process is hardly imaginable today without being adequately connected with the accounting profession and this profession is now more than ever before in the service of public interest that is primarily based on the need for lawful and fair reporting on business entities' business operations. The accounting profession should play an important part in fighting all forms of tax fraud, evasion and all other forms of illegal activity. This is to be achieved also through preventive action where accountants use advice and instruction to discourage fraud and avoidance of payment of public revenues. The accounting profession should be based on the principles of legality, professionalism and ethics, as any other interpretation or action would distance the accounting profession from legality. The tax administration needs sufficient accounting and financial evidence to be able to draw reasonable conclusions on which to base its opinion whether or not tax liabilities have been calculated, paid and reported in accordance with regulations in force. The cooperation between the tax administration, taxpayers and the accounting profession should represent the establishment of partner relations and striving towards a common goal - lawful collection of public revenues. This cooperation should, as a priority, be based on proper understanding, definition and exercise of mutual rights, obligations and the development of partner relations, and the outcome of such relations is measurable and will be reflected in the results of public revenues collection.","[Isovic, Serif] Tax Adm Federat BiH, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",,"Isovic, S (通讯作者)，Tax Adm Federat BiH, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",puinfo@fpu.gov.ba,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,483,503,,,,,,21,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900030,0

The basic process of ABC, based upon five steps, was applied and demonstrated the difficulties in applying cost data collection, identifying activity and cost drivers, as well as collecting driver data. The results also revealed significant differences in unit costs derived by ABC and the company's existing cost system, particularly within frozen food products.

Further analyses suggest that the association between the use of SPEs and unfavorable loan contract terms is primarily due to the increase in the information risk faced by lenders, as firm managers can easily use SPEs to manipulate earnings and hide losses. Specifically, we find that the use of SPEs has a more pronounced effect on increasing the cost of loans and causing more stringent non-price loan terms when managers have a stronger incentive to manipulate earnings and when banks have less knowledge about the SPE sponsor firms due to the lack of prior lending relationship. In addition, we find that the use of SPEs is associated with a greater likelihood of accounting restatements and greater information asymmetry between inside managers and outside capital suppliers.

This paper examines implementation of these reforms through a case-based approach that links national policy processes to analysis of two village-level case studies, based on fieldwork conducted in 2009-10. In both cases, government initiatives do appear to have enhanced women's land rights to a certain degree. However, the causal process involved is considerably more complex than the direct link between titling and women's land rights that is assumed in much of the existing literature. The cases suggest that government initiatives are contingent upon state-society relations, and that change to informal institutions and power relations within society can constitute an important complement to land registration.","[Lavers, Tom] ILO, Res Dept, Route Morillons 4, CH-1211 Geneva 22, Switzerland",,"Lavers, T (通讯作者)，ILO, Res Dept, Route Morillons 4, CH-1211 Geneva 22, Switzerland.",tom.lavers@gmail.com,,"Lavers, Tom/0000-0003-0842-4177",United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper was written during a research fellowship at the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD), based on research conducted as part of a PhD in International Development and Social Policy at the University of Bath.

This paper empirically re-investigates the relationship between competition and bank risk across a large sample of European listed banks over the period 2004-2013. However, in contrast to most extant literature, we consider both individual and systemic dimensions of risk. Bank-individual risk is measured by the Z-score and the distance-to-default, while we consider the SRISK as a proxy for bank systemic risk. Using the Lerner index as an inverse measure of competition and after controlling for a variety of bank-specific and macroeconomic factors, our results suggest that competition encourages bank risk-taking and then increases individual bank fragility. This result is in line with the traditional competition fragility view. Our most important findings concern the relationship between competition and systemic risk. Indeed, contrary to our previous results, we find that competition enhances financial stability by decreasing systemic risk. This result can be explained by the fact that weak competition tends to increase the correlation in the risk-taking behavior of banks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

After the reform of auto insurance, property insurance companies premium income steady growth, but the growth rate declined; the higher the degree of market concentration, the year tends to decline; intermediary business channels accounted for an absolute advantage, each channel has a significant premium income; the payments continued to grow, the simple payment rate tends to decline; the company's overall underwriting profit, but the profit level of different before and after the reform. The terms of commercial auto insurance rates reform, the property insurance premium income increase, to meet the multi-level and diversified insurance demand; given the autonomy of property insurance companies more, stimulate the product innovation ability of property insurance companies; specification of property insurance companies, the insurance industry to promote the transformation and upgrading. However, the premium rate reform of commercial auto insurance also makes insurance companies face great challenges. The market competition is more intense, property insurance companies to further increase the pressure, large property insurance companies have a greater market advantage than the middle and small insurance companies, small and medium-sized property insurance company comprehensive cost rate is high, mostly in the loss situation; affected by the policy of reform, electricity sales channels of premium income has shrunk dramatically, electricity sales channels advantage weakened part; property insurance companies to seize market share to raise the intermediary fees, the agency channel cost increased; auto insurance rates market needs a large number of customers to support the auto insurance underwriting data, data information can not meet the needs of the reality of insurance companies. As the main goal of the commercial insurance reform, and promote the sustainable and healthy development of the insurance market, insurance company should take the following measures to cope with the challenge: to accelerate product innovation, to provide differentiated services; enhance the level of service, to meet customer demand; scientific analysis of sales channels, strengthen the management of sales channels; rational use of auto insurance information platform, information sharing; actively promote the development of vehicle networking and application.","[Liu Jinxia] Hebei Univ Econ & Business, Hebei Radio & TV Univ, Shijiazhuang 050080, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Gao Zhandong] Hebei Univ Econ & Business, Sch Finance, Shijiazhuang 050091, Hebei, Peoples R China",Hebei University of Economics & Business; Hebei University of Economics & Business,"Liu, JX (通讯作者)，Hebei Univ Econ & Business, Hebei Radio & TV Univ, Shijiazhuang 050080, Hebei, Peoples R China.",ljx@heuet.edu.cn; gaozhandong1991@163.com,"Liu, Jinxia/H-1794-2011",,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,407,422,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700028,0

Data was collected from a random sample of 250 farming households by means of a structured questionnaire. A Tobit regression model was employed to examine the determinants of household food security. The study found that factors like household size, marital status, education level, gender, total livestock units, household income, farming experience, credit use and competence levels in fertiliser measurement have the potential to reduce household food insecurity.

General education, credit availability and risk taking attitude play significant roles in whether or not a farm household will be a lead farmer in Bangladesh.","[Mottaleb, Khondoker A.; Rahut, Dil Bahadur; Erenstein, Olaf] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Carretera Mex Veracruz,Km 45, El Batan 56237, Texcoco, Mexico; [Ali, Akhter] Natl Agr Res Ctr, Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Gerard, Bruno] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, SIP, El Batan, Texcoco, Mexico",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); National Agricultural Research Council - Pakistan; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Mottaleb, KA (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Carretera Mex Veracruz,Km 45, El Batan 56237, Texcoco, Mexico.",k.mottaleb@cgiar.org,"Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022; Mottaleb, Khondoker A./I-1103-2019; Gerard, Bruno/AAG-6592-2019","Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271; Mottaleb, Khondoker A./0000-0002-2666-1152; Gerard, Bruno/0000-0002-1079-7493; Erenstein, Olaf/0000-0002-7491-5786",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Bangladesh; USAID; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) CSISA Phase II project,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Bangladesh(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) CSISA Phase II project,This study was made possible through the financial support provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Bangladesh to the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia - Mechanisation and Irrigation (CSISA-MI) project in Bangladesh as well as the USAID and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) CSISA Phase II project.,,23,40,41,4,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The authors give the brief description of features of pledge security registration for loans in some Europe countries. The Europe Union experience shows that trademarks, patents for intellectual property objects, as well as applications for their registration can be used as collateral for obtaining monetary loans. Russian experience of the pledge operations of the intellectual property is too small. This version of bank lending is at the initial stage of development. The main constraint is the difficulty of assessing the value of the pledged intellectual property as intangible assets.

We review research on the establishment and performance of energy derivative markets, focusing on the two major energy commodities: oil and natural gas. For both commodities, trade in derivatives arose at the conclusion of a historical process in which production along the value chain that had been coordinated by vertically integrated companies or similar institutional structures switched to being coordinated through markets. Consequently, much of the research reviewed here is about the structural changes that made it possible for markets to assume this role. This review encompasses research into the price discovery function, which determines how many successful futures contracts are needed for each commodity.","[Parsons, John E.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Parsons, JE (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",jparsons@mit.edu,,,,,,,75,1,1,0,20,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4809-0,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Farmers have a right to claim compensation in case of land takings, which specifies two methods of claim: consent method and arbitration method. Literature indicates that farmers' choice between the two methods has a significant impact on the compensation they receive. Using a binary response model on a primary dataset of 199 displaced farmers from Upper Krishna Irrigation Project, India, we analyse the determinants of this choice. We validate 'access based' hypotheses in choice of compensation and test whether in addition to allocated property rights, benefits actually depend on the 'access mechanisms' farmers have. Results suggest that the choice is governed by access to social identity and information. Therefore, farmers lacking these fail to get resettled despite the presence of a policy framework aimed at their rehabilitation.","[Patil, Vikram] ATREE, Ctr Environm & Dev, Jakkur Post, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India; [Ghosh, Ranjan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Kathuria, Vinish] Indian Inst Technol, SJM Sch Management, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Patil, V (通讯作者)，ATREE, Ctr Environm & Dev, Jakkur Post, Bangalore 560064, Karnataka, India.",vspatil.6@gmail.com,"Patil, Vikram/AAD-7109-2021","Patil, Vikram/0000-0003-1571-4893; Ghosh, Ranjan/0000-0002-8944-7436",International Postgraduate Studies in Water Technologies (IPSWaT) programme by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [IPS 10/13],International Postgraduate Studies in Water Technologies (IPSWaT) programme by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by the International Postgraduate Studies in Water Technologies (IPSWaT) programme by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [IPS 10/13].,,70,5,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Past studies have not found clear evidence of the superiority of a specific corporate governance system in terms of economic and financial performances; instead, they have generally been limited to legal systems where the adoption of a specific system is mandatory. In this paper, we take into consideration the case of the Italian Corporate Law Reform, which gives firms the opportunity to choose, in a non-mandatory way, between different governance systems and in particular between a one-tier model and the pre-existing system prior to the Reform. Using propensity score matching and focusing on a sample of unlisted Italian joint-stock companies, we found evidence of a significant worsening of performances from 2003 to 2013 for corporations adopting a one-tier board after the Reform.","[Pellegrini, Carlo Bellavite] Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Business Management, Via Necchi 5, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Sironi, Emiliano] Catholic Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Sironi, E (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",carlo.bellavite@unicatt.it; emiliano.sironi@unicatt.it,"Sironi, Emiliano/ABC-5130-2020","Sironi, Emiliano/0000-0001-9129-3133; BELLAVITE PELLEGRINI, CARLO/0000-0002-6665-8054",,,,,41,10,11,4,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Youth movement as an organized practice is quite familiar for Russian universities. The youth organization Komsomol (Young Communist League) was widespread across the Soviet Union. In recent years, Russian government with new power supports different forms of student engagement using a non-profit sector. The main problem which we consider in this article is the variety of forms of students' social activity. In our opinion, some collective forms of social activity could become an important condition which is essential for the development of the intellectual capital of universities. Certain kinds of students' activities as an engagement develop personal and professional potential of youth, create a field for the development of socio-productive and personal-professional relationships in universities. The university sphere is not only an intellectually capacious sector, but also the center of the social activity. In this paper we analyze results of national representative online survey of students (2015; N=930, accidental sample). We polled students of all federal universities and leading universities from 14 Russian regions. All respondents are members of thematic communities in different social networks, which unites active young people, young men and women who took part in various mass youth programs and projects. Key research question was: What structures of social interaction or social relations inside the universities affect the development of scientific activity of students? The results of factor analysis let the authors study the experience of social activity of students; in other words, their engagement in activity of different non-commercial organizations. We have found that those students who were engaged in activity of university's internal community organizations are more inclined to scientific work. Such socially active students most likely won't leave home university and continue their educational or scientific activity.","[Pevnaya, Maria; Kuzminchuk, Anna] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Pevnaya, M (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",m.v.pevnaya@urfu.ru; a.a.kuzminchuk@urfu.ru,"Pevnaya, Maria/AAA-6886-2019; Drozdova, Anna A/L-4435-2016; Pevnaya, Maria/E-4080-2014","Pevnaya, Maria/0000-0003-3591-1181; Drozdova, Anna A/0000-0002-1599-8446;","Russian Foundation for Humanities [16-03-00016, 16-03-00051]",Russian Foundation for Humanities,"The research is supported by the Russian Foundation for Humanities (Project No 16-03-00016, project No 16-03-00051).",,10,0,1,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,230,237,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000029,0

It was conceived in 2000 as a part of the Lisbon Strategy (EU) in response to a series of challenges the region faced in its transition towards a knowledge-based society. Comparing different policy instruments, their relative impact and also comparing their impact across national and institutional borders may provide new insights as to what instruments work in higher education (HE) reforms. One of the options to analyse the success of the used policies in education is to use World Competitiveness Index (GCI) analysis. The purpose of this research is to find out if the market size is indeed the main factor that makes impact on the elements of knowledge triangle. It is very important to emphasize the kinds of instruments to carry out policy changes in the HE. We propose to make statistical analysis of following GCI indicators: 1) overall country GCI , 2) higher education and training, 3) innovations 4) market size and 5) research indicators about 28 EU countries and Norway.

Results of the research: it was found out that groups with similar countries allow to analyse similarities and thus to make policy changes in higher education according to the best examples. Research shows that innovation level is strongly connected to the overall country GCI.","[Purgailis, Maris; Steinbuka, Inna; Apsite, Annija] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Purgailis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,473,479,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400047,0

In this context, the insurance industry will have to develop new instruments to cover farmers' incomes against losses due to meteorological factors. Some protective technologies that farmers can use for climate risk management have associated costs that vary as a function of the losses involved. These sorts of instruments compete with other less flexible instruments such as crop insurance. We here analyse an issue of decision-making, where the farmer can decide how much to invest in protection, as in situations where the farmer chooses which portion of a loss to protect in the case of adverse weather conditions, and we propose optimal management to mitigate the increasing negative effects of climate uncertainty. By analysing the optimal policy in a continuous choice situation, we consider whether farmers, as part of their crop management duties, should opt to protect some portion of their harvest value with available technologies, or whether they should protect the entire crop. To analyse this decision-making problem, we employ the cost-loss ratio model and take risk aversion into account.","[Quiroga, Sonia] Univ Alcala, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Cerda, Emilio] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Alcala; Complutense University of Madrid,"Quiroga, S (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala, Alcala De Henares, Spain.",,"Quiroga, Sonia/ABH-6577-2020",,,,,,26,0,0,1,2,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-32-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,327,353,,10.20472/EFC.2017.007.021,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6MP,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854900021,0

This paper examines instead the usefulness of QE in a future fiscal crisis, modeled as a situation where the fiscal outlook is inconsistent with both stable inflation and no sovereign default. The crisis can lower welfare through two channels, the first via aggregate demand and nominal rigidities, and the second via contractions in credit and disruption in financial markets. Managing the size and composition of the central bank's balance sheet can interfere with each of these channels, stabilizing inflation and economic activity. The power of QE comes from interest-paying reserves being a special public liability, neither substitutable by currency nor by government debt.","[Reis, Ricardo] London Sch Econ, Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Reis, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Econ, London, England.",r.a.reis@lse.ac.uk,,,senior George fellowship at the Bank of England,senior George fellowship at the Bank of England,"Ricardo Reis is the A.W.

These criticisms generally reflect the view that these requirements primarily affect stability through their effects on banks' regulatory capital adequacy. I critically evaluate whether this idea can be sustained on logical and evidential grounds. I explain how accounting requirements typically have quite small effects on banks' regulatory capital adequacy. I discuss the plausibility of the alternative view that accounting requirements primarily affect stability by improving banks' understanding of their risks and their transparency to markets and regulators. Because securitization is the setting in which banks' regulatory capital adequacy is most likely to be significantly affected by accounting requirements, I describe empirical research on significant changes in securitization accounting effective in 2010. I explain how even in this setting regulatory capital adequacy incompletely explains how accounting requirements for banks affect stability.","[Ryan, Stephen G.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Ryan, SG (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA.",sryan@stern.nyu.edu,"Ryan, Stephen G/HIR-3827-2022","Ryan, Stephen G/0000-0002-7578-452X",,,,,46,15,16,0,12,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4809-0,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Another way is the development by the government of the corresponding economic policy. The Russian state pursues such policy. It establishes a favorable legal regime for the implementation of entrepreneurial and investment activities in selected territories and renders state support to specific areas of such activity or to certain entities. Different authors define the entrepreneurial ecosystem differently. But the entrepreneur always takes a central place in it and plays a leading role in its creation and maintenance. Experts believe that entrepreneurial ecosystems include economic, social, institutional and other important factors and components that have an interactive impact on the creation, discovery and use of entrepreneurial opportunities.

This has defined the aim of the paper - to determine the ways of influence and the level of correlation between mergers & acquisitions to cyclical economic growth. Research methods used were quantitative and qualitative analysis of factors and means of interrelation between the economic growth and mergers & acquisitions. Statistical methods - Pearson and Spearman rank correlation analysis were used. Main results and findings of the study have demonstrated that information and communication services sector's contribution with 4.6 % workforce in the EU producing only 8.3 % of value added of the total non-financial business economy create other main contributions of digital economy to the economic growth which cannot be measured quantitatively: the creation of increasingly expanding capabilities of distant management of companies. This creates the basis of extensive usage of mergers & acquisitions as the means for restructuring economies and increasing their efficiency in producing higher value added products and services. Important theoretical finding is that the volume of mergers & acquisitions does no increase steadily, has cyclical nature. This feature is determined by the combination of factors - more suitable digital environment and fluctuating market conditions and prices of companies. Practical implications of the findings are the possibility to increase accuracy of the forecasting of mergers & acquisitions intensity and the influence of this process to the economic growth.

When making choices, a human being formulates their cognitive judgments on the basis of their affective experience. The studies point to both the adaptive and nonadaptive effect of emotional experience. Intense emotions moderate or modify the cognitive processes that are a part of decision making.

While it acknowledges that a structured involvement of stakeholders should become central in transport backcasting studies, there are very few policy relevant papers that pay special attention to stakeholder participation in the visioning phase of backcasting. This paper aims at showing the findings Of a participatory visioning study as a starting point of a wider backcasting analysis for the transport sector (2050) in Andalusia (Spain). It presents a methodological approach that involves a total of 40 stakeholders and combines two participatory techniques: (i) Delphi survey; (ii) semi-structured interviews. The main outcomes show how stakeholders were engaged in the participation process through each technique. It then identifies five relevant methodological issues for a more detailed discussion: (i) the selection of participants; (ii) the means to visualise long-term futures; (iii) the visualisation of desired futures; (iv) the generation of multiple future visions; (v) the combination of multiple participatory techniques. In parallel, the study also presents the means by which the use of both participatory techniques can provide a narrative of a future vision for the transport sector in Andalusia. That vision focuses largely on lower carbon emissions, technological innovation, and urban compactness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, despite the clear benefits of the Internet, its negative effects have also been taken into consideration. Some of the most important challenges that organizations have to face are mostly related with vulnerability to security weaknesses, violation of privacy, employee Internet abuse, and Internet addiction. Previous studies showed that access to the Internet has become more common for employees, and so has their propensity to use the Internet for entertainment and other non-work purposes on the job. Moreover, it is clear that nearly everyone experiences episodes of boredom at work from time to time, regardless of the nature of their job. Generally, boredom is regarded as a mental state resulting from a low challenge level as compared to individual skill level and the lack of intrinsic motivation. Individuals who score higher on boredom proneness - a specific and measurable personality trait, have higher rates of negative behaviors including substance abuse and pathological gambling. Boredom has also been linked to decreased academic achievement and increased the likelihood of dropping out of school. Cumulatively, previous studies suggest that boredom proneness has both social, and psychological repercussions, increasing the probability of a range of negative behaviors such as cyberloafing. This study aims at investigating the relationships between boredom proneness, boredom susceptibility, and cyberloafing. College students (N=78) responded to an anonymous questionnaire set containing the Boredom Proneness Scale, the Boredom Susceptibility Scale, and Cyberloafing Scale. The findings of the present study will consolidate the existing literature by providing new insights into the non-work-related Internet usage, coined here as cyberloafing, and its relation with boredom proneness and boredom susceptibility.","[Stanescu, Dan Florin] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Stanescu, DF (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",dan.stanescu@comunicare.ro,"Stanescu, Dan Florin/P-6421-2019","Stanescu, Dan Florin/0000-0001-8188-903X",,,,,46,0,0,3,23,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,193,200,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800015,0

To this end, 78 Islamic banks in 12 countries have been studied over the 2004-2013 period. A series of bank-specific and other country specific indicators are combined to explain the soundness of Islamic banking in terms of profitability as measured by ROA and ROE, and risk divided into credit risk measured by IMLGL and EQL, and insolvency risk measured by Z-SCORE. The aim is to estimate five regressions using dynamic panel data econometrics (GMM system). The results indicate that bank size and capital are the main factors responsible for increasing profitability and stability of Islamic banks and reducing their credit risk. However, the ratios forming the variable liquidity and asset quality often lead to inconclusive results. It is also found that macroeconomic variables, except inflation, are able to improve Islamic banks' stability. This is not the case for credit risk where the ratio is still unfavorable. The conclusion is that there are no major differences between IBs and CBs in terms of their profitability and risk features. (C) 2016 AEDEM.

The analysis is limited to Czech state administration units because of their importance as a redistributor and a consumer of financial sources and because of their complicated internal structure. Our former findings suggest that aggregated data may serve conveniently for budget negotiations, standards setting or various analytical purposes on the top managerial level. A question is whether these outputs are applicable also for internal managerial purposes which we do not account entirely convenient. To prove or disprove this opinion we examined cost allocation process within a selected cost unit of the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic. Our analysis suggests that aggregated financial accounting outputs represent relevant input data source however they are insufficient for managerial purposes within particular state administration units and need to be supplemented with any form of managerial or cost accounting that would allocate relating costs and link them with a place of their origin.","[Vodakova, Jana] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Masaryk, Czech Republic; [Sglundova, Nela] Univ Def, Fac Mil Leadership, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; University of Defence - Czech Republic,"Vodáková, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Masaryk, Czech Republic.",Jana.Vodakova@econ.muni.cz; nela.sglundova@unob.cz,"Vodáková, Jana/AAB-4325-2021","Vodáková, Jana/0000-0003-2923-6132",,,,,19,0,0,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,207,214,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100026,0

Conventional wisdom suggests that this will increase capital intensity with falling rates of return to capital and increasing wages. This decreases welfare for middle aged asset rich households. This paper takes the perspective of the three demographically oldest European nations - France, Germany and Italy - to address three important adjustment channels to dampen these detrimental effects of aging in these countries: investing abroad, endogenous human capital formation, and increasing the retirement age. Our quantitative finding is that endogenous human capital formation in combination with an increase in the retirement age has strong implications for economic aggregates and welfare, in particular in the open economy. These adjustments reduce the maximum welfare losses of demographic change for households alive in 2010 by about 2.2 percentage points in terms of consumption equivalent variation.","[Vogel, Edgar] Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ludwig, Alexander] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, SAFE, House Finance, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany; [Boersch-Supan, Axel] Max Planck Inst Social Law & Social Policy, Munich Ctr Econ Aging, Amalienstr 33, D-80799 Munich, Germany",Deutsche Bank; Goethe University Frankfurt; Max Planck Society,"Vogel, E (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",edgar.vogel@bundesbank.de,,,"U.S. Social Security Administration, SSA Retirement Research Consortium [5RRC08098400-03-00]; State of Baden-Wurttemberg; State of Bavaria; German Insurers Association (GDV); Research Center SAFE; State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","U.S. Social Security Administration, SSA Retirement Research Consortium; State of Baden-Wurttemberg; State of Bavaria; German Insurers Association (GDV); Research Center SAFE; State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was supported by the U.S. Social Security Administration through grant #5RRC08098400-03-00 to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) as part of the SSA Retirement Research Consortium.

We tested two hypotheses in one structural model by using structural equation modeling (SEM). The quantitative data was collected through an online survey on a sample of 525 primary school teachers in Slovenia. Findings show that teacher's perceptions of school leader's empowering behaviors are positively and statistically significantly related to psychological empowerment and career satisfaction. Our study shows that teacher's perceptions of school leader's empowering behaviors affect teacher's psychological empowerment together with their career satisfaction. Therefore, it is essential for school leaders to enhance awareness and capacity in exercising empowering behaviors towards their teachers to maximize teacher's work potential. Research in the area of school leader's leadership is relatively new; based on our research, we can add to these studies the effect on psychological empowerment together with career satisfaction.

A common pathway out of poverty included an intermediate step during which households accumulate assets through farming, petty trading, and migratory work.","[Walelign, Solomon Zena; Pouliot, Marieve; Larsen, Helle Overgaard; Smith-Hall, Carsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Copenhagen C, Denmark; [Walelign, Solomon Zena] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Copenhagen; University of Gottingen,"Walelign, SZ (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Copenhagen C, Denmark.",szw@ifro.ku.dk,"Smith-Hall, Carsten/L-6015-2018; Pouliot, Marieve/E-6245-2015","Smith-Hall, Carsten/0000-0003-3908-3002; Pouliot, Marieve/0000-0002-0611-1743",Erasmus Mundus consortium Forest and Nature for Society (FONASO),Erasmus Mundus consortium Forest and Nature for Society (FONASO),This work was supported by the Erasmus Mundus consortium Forest and Nature for Society (FONASO).,,49,37,38,9,70,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

An empirical survey was conducted with tea manufacturing firms located in a low grown area in Sri Lanka. Primary data were collected by administering a structured questionnaire at 109 tea factories. The findings indicated the importance of external relationships; specifically, relationships with supply chain partners and relationships with government facilitating institutions enhance the EO of tea manufacturing firms. However, relationships with other tea factories and educational and research institutions are not significant influences on firms' EO in the context of the Sri Lankan tea industry. When considering the dimensions of EO, risk taking is influenced by external relationships and not innovativeness and proactiveness. Further, the entrepreneurial infrastructure provided by related institutions except other tea factories have positive links with EO.

This telematics data allows the insurance companies to evaluate the driving habits and driving styles of their individual car drivers. The complexity of this increasingly large data set requires sophisticated methods of analysis. Therefore, classical statistical methods such as generalized linear models are replaced by machine learning methods like regression trees, boosting machines and neural networks. A common drawback of many (data driven) machine learning methods is that they are not very stable under slight changes in the data. The purpose of this paper is to analyze this instability and we present methods to improve on this point.

Determining what factors have influences on P/E ratios is beneficial to better interpretation and prediction of this ratio in practice. Historically, though some academic studies on this topic have identified some factors in terms of both microeconomics and macroeconomics, many of them were conducted in developed financial markets decades ago. This article proceeds with a combination of well-developed theoretical foundation and empirical studies in emerging market using latest data. It begins with traditional value theories and identifies three potential factors: dividend payout ratios, earnings growth rates and Beta coefficient. Then updated data from Chinese stock market are collected and analyzed to further find out the relationship.

Efficient analysis of information stored in these documents can have great benefits to any organisation that holds a substantial amount of text documents: both digital and analogue. Using computerised methods such as data mining, natural language processing and full text search one can recognize patterns and regularities that would not be obvious otherwise. One method of improving text analysis is adding structured annotations to text documents. Previous research has primarily concentrated on automatic recognition of named entities for fixed number of annotation classes. Although this provides quick identification of typical elements such as Persons, Organizations, Places, Dates and Numbers it also has its drawbacks. In many cases a manual reviewing of automatically generated annotations is still necessary and there is only a limited number of annotation classes available. In our research we use a different approach by letting data operators define any annotation classes that are necessary for their particular task and by introducing an Entity database that helps data operators to uniquely identify objects mentioned in text documents and to record any additional information about these objects. Besides typical object reference annotations we also propose structural and composite annotations. We also propose an annotation storage format based on well-established W3C standards that will improve data interchangeability between different systems.","[Zogla, Arturs; Bojars, Uldis] Natl Lib Latvia, Riga, Latvia",,"Zogla, A (通讯作者)，Natl Lib Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,747,754,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400074,0

We found evidence of structural breaks in the volatility of time series for the majority of markets. The results show also that, in view of the crisis, new significant causal linkages appeared together with the intensification of the causal relationship in 40% of the cases in which we find causality during both the tranquil and crisis period. These additional linkages during crisis periods in excess of those that arise during non-crisis periods contributes significantly in amplifying the international transmission of volatility and the risk of contagion.

Expert elicitation refers to formal procedures for obtaining and combining expert judgments. Expert elicitation is required when existing data and models cannot provide needed information. This makes validating expert judgments a challenge because they are used when other data do not exist and thus measuring their accuracy is difficult. This article examines the classical model of structured expert judgment, which is an elicitation method that includes validation of the experts' assessments against empirical data. In the classical model, experts assess both the unknown target questions and a set of calibration questions, which are items from the experts' field that have observed true values. The classical model scores experts on their performance in assessing the calibration questions and then produces performance-weighted combinations of the experts. From 2006 through March 2015, the classical model has been used in thirty-three unique applications. Less than one-third of the individual experts in these studies were statistically accurate, highlighting the need for validation. Overall, the performance-based combination of experts produced in the classical model is more statistically accurate and more informative than an equal weighting of experts.","[Colson, Abigail R.] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Management Sci, 199 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0QU, Lanark, Scotland; [Cooke, Roger M.] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St,NW,Suite 600, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Strathclyde; Resources for the Future,"Colson, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Management Sci, 199 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0QU, Lanark, Scotland.",abigail.colson@strath.ac.uk; cooke@rff.org,"cooke, roger/AGS-4583-2022; Colson, Abigail/H-6441-2017","cooke, roger/0000-0003-0643-1971; Colson, Abigail/0000-0002-3241-5855",,,,,50,69,75,1,121,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

Examining days with large increases in short positions and large downfalls in stock prices, we find evidence of both momentum and contrarian short selling taking place. For North American bank stocks, contrarian short selling appears more practiced than for European bank and insurance stocks.

Borrowers and lenders participate in a decentralized loan market for the purpose of establishing long-term credit relationships and the provision of loanable funds to productive firms. Locating credit relationships is costly in terms of time and real resources and the interest rate is negotiated via a bargaining mechanism. This structure is incorporated into an otherwise standard monetary business cycle framework and used to study how such frictions in the credit market contribute to explaining the contemporaneous impact and propagation of monetary growth shocks and inflation. While anticipated inflation negatively impacts real activity, it can also increase loan market participation and the inflow of newly established credit relationships. It is shown that (i) bargaining and costly search mitigates the traditional inflation tax effect of monetary injections and (ii) the existence of long-term lending relations tends to dampen liquidity effects. Monetary shocks in this environment lead to larger liquidity effects relative to the frictionless case and are capable of generating persistence in the nominal interest rate, labor, consumption, and output. It can also explain the excess volatility of credit creation relative to output and the observation that overall credit creation can lead output over the business cycle.","[Li, Victor E.] Villanova Univ, Econ, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",Villanova University,"Li, VE (通讯作者)，Villanova Univ, Econ, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",Victor.Li@villanova.edu,,,,,,,45,5,6,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

However, studies focusing on accessibility analyses of access/egress times to/from stations are less extended in the literature and centre mainly on the influence of access times to stations on HSR accessibility levels on a regional scale. This paper's aim is to evaluate the importance of access and egress times to/from HSR stations in an urban context. We carry out a spatiotemporal accessibility analysis that considers the temporal variations of both taxi and public transport travel times. General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files for public transport and TomTom Speed Profiles data for cars are used to measure access/egress times. These kinds of data allow for the calculation of travel times from/to HSR stations through network analysis GIS tools at different times of the day, and thus a spatiotemporal accessibility measure can be obtained. This accessibility measure is complemented by a mass factors representing the activity 'hotspots' in the visited city throughout the workday, which is derived from Twitter data, while population is considered for city of residence. This method was applied to the two largest metropolitan areas in Spain: Madrid and Barcelona, where the influence of access/egress times acquires a higher relevance for rail-based trips. The results obtained show that access and egress times vary significantly during the day, depending on the levels of traffic congestion and the frequency of public transport services, which are always more favourable for taxis. In addition, weighted average access and egress times at the home end are higher than those at the activity end since population tends to show more dispersed spatial patterns than activities. Another interesting finding is that the first and last mile of the HSR trip usually account for a high percentage increase in travel time (about 35% for taxis and 55% for public transport, respectively). These results have important policy implications. The paper suggests that HSR accessibility can be improved also by improving local transport services, scheduling coordination and land use policies.","[Moyano, Amparo] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Civil Engn, Avda Camilo Jose Cela S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Moya-Gomez, Borja; Gutierrez, Javier] Univ Complutense Madrid, Transport Infrastruct & Terr Res Grp T GIS, Dept Geog, C Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Complutense University of Madrid,"Moyano, A (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Civil Engn, Avda Camilo Jose Cela S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.",amparo.moyano@uclm.es; bmoyagomez@ucm.es; javiergutierrez@ghis.ucm.es,"Gutiérrez, Javier/AGZ-2959-2022; Moya-Gómez, Borja/K-2780-2015; Moyano, Amparo/I-5000-2015","Moya-Gómez, Borja/0000-0002-0520-039X; Gutierrez, Javier/0000-0003-2611-8587; Moyano, Amparo/0000-0003-1201-1025",Spanish Ministry of Education [FPU 13/01066]; Department of Civil Engineering in the University of Castilla La Mancha (UCLM); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [TRA2015-65283-R]; European Regional Development Fund [TRA2015-65283-R]; Madrid Regional Government (SOCIALBIGDATA-CM) [52015/HUM-3427],Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Department of Civil Engineering in the University of Castilla La Mancha (UCLM); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); Madrid Regional Government (SOCIALBIGDATA-CM),"This study was supported by a grant from the Spanish Ministry of Education (Grant N FPU 13/01066).

It differs from a conventional two-armed bandit problem in that there is no opportunity to alter behavior after an unsuccessful outcome. Introducing the risk of death into a sequential decision problem alters the structure of the problem. Even though play ends after an unsuccessful outcome, Bayesian learning after successful outcomes has a potential function in this class of two-armed bandit problems. Increasing uncertainty boosts the chance of long-term survival since ambiguous probabilities of survival are increased more after each successful outcome. In the independent choice experiments, a slim majority of participants displayed a preference for greater risk ambiguity. Particularly in the interdependent choice experiments, participants were overly deterred by ambiguity. For both independent and interdependent choices, there were several dimensions on which participants displayed within session rationality.

Design/methodology/approach The paper used random effects probit model. Findings Parent debt financing of OFDI by Indian parent firms is driven by the credit market development of the host country, the uniqueness of the industry to which parent firm belongs and systematic risk. Debt-oriented firms are found to invest more via parent debt. Research limitations/implications The limitations of this study are as follows: -first, time period before 2008 could not be considered due to unavailability of data in the public domain. Second, the characteristics of foreign affiliates that spread across diverse host countries have not been factored in. Third, in the case of parent's industry-level determinants, financial sector has not been included because the financing and risk-taking strategy of this sector are quite different from other sectors. Finally, the present study assumes financing decision to be centralized in the multinational system at the parent firm. Practical implications The practical implications of this study are as follows: first, industry innovativeness must be taken as a guide by the Indian MNEs to finance their OFDI and they must provide equity. Second, the study suggests that Indian MNEs rely on their existing capital structure while financing their OFDI. Third, parent firms are found to follow the industry norms. Fourth, parent firms must finance their OFDI by considering the development of credit market in the host country. Fifth, host government must focus on improving the credit market development of their economy and not just reducing tax rates to attract FDI into their economy. Originality/value Empirically examining internal flows in a multinational system has limited the research in the area of financing the OFDI. The paper is one of the first attempts to formally develop a model of factors that shape financing of OFDI in case of one such emerging market - India.","[Tripathi, Vanita] Univ Delhi, Dept Commerce, New Delhi, India; [Thukral, Sonal] Delhi Technol Univ, Delhi Sch Management, Delhi, India",University of Delhi; Delhi Technological University,"Thukral, S (通讯作者)，Delhi Technol Univ, Delhi Sch Management, Delhi, India.",vanitatripathi1@yahoo.co.in; sonalthukral@dtu.ac.in,"Thukral, Sonal/AAT-4754-2020","Thukral, Sonal/0000-0003-0926-5438",OFDI,OFDI,Tripathi and Thukral (forthcoming) assess the impact of parent firm's industry environment on the financing of OFDI.,,105,11,11,1,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate thoroughly the impact of micro and small enterprises' (MSEs') support programs on core intermediate and final outcomes of interest. Design/methodology/approach The impact evaluation employs a non-parametric matching procedure for parametric outcome analysis using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Aiming at a doubly robust evaluation process, the study applies parametric analyses than non-parametric permutation-based tests to investigate the causal effects of the public intervention. Findings The study reveals that the public intervention encouraged MSEs to develop innovative business practices and improve their human capital development process. Moreover, the intervention had a positive effect in expanding employment opportunities in urban areas. Contrariwise, the study shows that support beneficiaries are not at an advantage in investment intensity. The lower level of investment intensity on fixed capital resulted inefficiency among the recipients. Moreover, the intervention did not have an effect on changing the net-asset over time for the recipients. Practical implications This study implies that the support programs need to be dynamic and also targets on creating innovative high-growth MSEs. Originality/value This paper is fairly original and provides policy makers and MSE promoters/facilitators evidence-based information on the effectiveness of the support services, with looking at firm-level analysis.","[Yonis, Manex Bule] World Bank, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Woldehanna, Tassew] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Amha, Wolday] Ethiopian Inclus Finance Training & Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",The World Bank; Addis Ababa University,"Yonis, MB (通讯作者)，World Bank, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",mafiheye@yahoo.com; tassew.woldehanna@gmail.com; woldayam@yahoo.com,,,,,,,73,5,6,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

When involved in emission trading, a fiscally constrained government will potentially seek to close its fiscal gap through emission permit sales. This fiscal incentive therefore generates a fiscal externality in the permit market that is endogenous to the extent of fiscal constrainedness among the participating countries. Our theory explains how, and when, fiscal externalities may be expected to arise. Moreover, we show that in a permit market equilibrium with fiscal externalities, the initial allocation of emission permits between countries will affect: (1) the price of emission permits, (2) the global distribution of abatement effort, and (3) total greenhouse gas mitigation costs. This is contrary to the textbook model of emission permit markets. Our findings are especially relevant for the EU which is about to allow for trading in emission rights between EU member countries for all emissions outside the European Emissions Trading System.","[Andersen, Jorgen Juel] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Greaker, Mads] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School; Statistics Norway,"Greaker, M (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway.",mgr@ssb.no,,,Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"We are grateful for valuable comments and suggestions from Cathrine Hagem, TomReiel Heggedal, Bjart Holtsmark, and Espen R.

Employing a difference-in-differences design and exploiting the staggered adoption of the new rules, we find a statistically and economically significant increase in ERC for treated firms relative to control firms, largely driven by profit firms.

As this obstacle is growing at speed, market integration should be developed with a view to avoid this risk. In this study, we investigate exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to examine who takes this risk. Specifically, we estimate the degree of ERPT for individual products by using primary auction price data of used/second-hand construction machinery purchased in Japan and then exported to Thailand for resale. Our empirical analysis of these data at the individual product level enables us to avoid bias in estimating ERPT caused by the use of aggregated data. We find that ERPT is asymmetric and changes in exchange rates are reflected in baht-denominated resale prices only when the baht appreciates against the yen. This indicates that raising resale prices in the destination market is more difficult for the exporters than lowering them, meaning that they can suffer significantly from the exchange rate risk.

Although this might be correct for some kinds of household savings, we question the accuracy of this unitary model with respect to non-mandatory retirement savings. To do so, we analyze the intrahousehold allocation of retirement savings between partners in Germany through an individualistic approach. First, the decision to save at all is analyzed using a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model, showing that the possession of retirement saving accounts among spouses is positively correlated, hinting at a crowding-in of saving accounts. However, this could only be due to certain tax-related reasons. Thus, we further analyze the interaction of savings between spouses using three-stage least squares, allowing for endogeneity between the spouses' savings. These results additionally show a crowding-in of the total amount of retirement savings between spouses, probably due to some peer effect. We therefore conclude that the unitary model of household decision-making is not applicable with respect to retirement savings.","[Metzger, Christoph] Univ Freiburg, Res Ctr Generat Contracts, Inst Publ Finance 1, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Metzger, C (通讯作者)，Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Inst Publ Finance 1, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",christoph.metzger@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,19,3,3,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-828X,2212-8298,,J ECON AGEING,J.

Research on policy diffusion is characterised by coherent explanatory models that assess the importance of diffusion mechanisms. This study takes a different perspective on diffusion studies and advances public policy literature by introducing the concept of diffusion entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs represent (groups of) individuals, networks, and organisations promoting a certain policy innovation with a view to gain influence. First, drawing from the diffusion literature and linking it to studies investigating policy diffusion in polycentric contexts, we introduce analytical categories to study diffusion entrepreneurs' key features and actions. Second, to illustrate the analytical value of the concept, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the literature on the diffusion entrepreneurs of health performance-based financing (PBF) in Sub-Saharan Africa. We show how and why this recently diffused policy innovation provides a unique case for demonstrating our conceptual notion: in PBF, a nexus of strongly dedicated diffusion entrepreneurs have strived to induce policy diffusion. Specifically, we explore how the features of PBF diffusion entrepreneurs and their actions affect the outcomes of diffusion processes. Lastly, we reflect on the relevance of our conceptual propositions and offer practical insights to guide future investigations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a knowledge gap concerning what we can learn from the experience of people who voluntarily refrain from car ownership. This paper aims to explore how everyday life is organized and perceived by voluntarily carless households with complex travel needs, focusing on dual-income families with children living in an urban setting (Gothenburg, Sweden). Through a time-geographical theoretical lens and drawing on eight in-depth interviews with parents, we scrutinize the accessibility strategies of these families and the perceived implications of being voluntarily carless for daily living. We find that these families use largely proximity-oriented strategies and combine various practices in managing time-pressed everyday life. The findings underscore the situatedness of carlessness and the importance of the inherent constraints and fixities of different everyday life projects. Notably, adaptation is considered to be well functioning in the spheres of mandatory activities and bounded routines (related to work, school, and consumption). Regarding free-time activities, carlessness is associated with more friction and perceived inconvenience. Questions are raised regarding the long-term persistence of voluntary carlessness, as family life situations may change. The results merit further consideration in sustainable transport and land use planning as well as regarding the wider organization of society.","[Lagrell, Ellen; Thulin, Eva; Vilhelmson, Bertil] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Human Geog Unit, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Lagrell, E (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Human Geog Unit, Gothenburg, Sweden.",Ellen.Lagrell@geography.gu.se,"Vilhelmson, Bertil/HMD-8759-2023","Vilhelmson, Bertil/0000-0002-4548-4059",Swedish Research Council Formas [215-2013-1083],Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),The research was supported by the Swedish Research Council Formas (grant number 215-2013-1083).

It argues that the extent of these environmental externalities is contingent upon local industrial agglomeration. Using a panel dataset of 280 Chinese prefectural cities from 2003 to 2012, we employ a spatial economic approach. Although limited to evidence from soot and SO2 pollutants, our results suggest that FDI brings overall positive environmental knowledge externalities to a region, and also spillovers to nearby regions. Specialised cities may lock into a particular technological path, attenuating the absorption and diffusion of a variety of FDI environmental knowledge. Conversely, diversified cities promote cross-fertilisation of environmental knowledge and mitigate local pollution intensity at the aggregated city level. This study adds to the literature by highlighting the importance of considering both the spatiality of FDI and industrial structure in understanding FDI environmental knowledge spillovers.","[Ning, Lutao; Wang, Fan] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Francis Bancroft Bldg,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Ning, LT (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Francis Bancroft Bldg,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",L.ning@qmul.ac.uk; fan.wang@qmul.ac.uk,,"Ning, Lutao/0000-0002-9620-0554",,,,,83,50,50,1,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper fills the research gap, by investigate the mechanism behinds its cyclical behavior through a novel dataset. Different from developed economies, guaranteed OBS in China has long-run substitute relation with commercial loan. Therefore, any policy impacts on commercial loan growth will has a converse effect on guaranteed OBS growth indirectly. Furthermore, contrary to existing research about China's shadow banking, we find the Desirability lending policy conducted by People's Bank of China during 2011-2014 is the unique fundamental driving force, rather than traditional regulatory constraints, such as reserve requirement ratio and loan-to-deposit ratio. It's an example of macroprudential policy induces shadow banking activity. Moreover, guaranteed OBS growth is also influenced by macroeconomy, risk and return factors of itself, operation efficiency and creditworthiness of the bank. Hence empirical results of this paper could also be viewed as the first time to test OBS development theories with China's data.","[An, Ping] Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [An, Ping] Peoples Bank China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Mengxuan] SOA, North China Sea Data & Informat Serv, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; People's Bank of China,"An, P (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",anp.14@pbcsf.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,59,15,15,1,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

In recent years, a growing literature on the price premium paid by consumers to access more energy efficient and sustainable buildings has emerged as a common topic in hedonic model estimations. In this paper, we aim to provide a summary of this literature by conducting a meta-analysis of more than 50 studies from around the world. In this way, based on a random effects models and weighted OLS robust clustering estimations, we offer an average estimation of the price premium accepted by economic agents (in terms of sale prices) in order to enjoy energy efficient and sustainable buildings. This supports the argument that investing in building refurbishment is worthwhile and economically relevant. However, our data seem to show a major publication bias. Correcting for this bias leads us to halve the original estimation (from 8% to 4%). In addition, we analyze the sources of result dispersion by performing a meta-regression using different moderators (type of publication, bibliometric variables, sample analysis period, econometric method, etc.). We also carry out different statistical tests and use alternative selection criteria in order to check whether our estimations are robust. Finally, we make recommendations for future hedonic studies as well as for upcoming meta-analyses of the green building premium.","[Fizaine, Florian] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, IREGE, 4 Chemin Bellevue, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France; [Voye, Pierre] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, LEDi Lab Econ Dijon, Dijon, France; [Baumont, Catherine] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, LEDi, 2 Blvd Gabriel, F-21066 Dijon, France; [Baumont, Catherine] CESAER, AgroSup Dijon, Dijon, France; [Baumont, Catherine] Inra Dijon, Dijon, France",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc; Universite de Bourgogne; Universite de Bourgogne; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; INRAE,"Fizaine, F (通讯作者)，Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, IREGE, 4 Chemin Bellevue, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France.",florian.fizaine@gmail.com; voye.pierre@gmail.com; catherine.baumont@ubfc.fr,,"Fizaine, Florian/0000-0002-7844-7668",Conseil Francais de l'Energie (Habiter Program); Bourgogne Franche-Comte Regional Council (PARI SHS Program),Conseil Francais de l'Energie (Habiter Program); Bourgogne Franche-Comte Regional Council (PARI SHS Program),"This study is part of a scientific program supported by the Conseil Francais de l'Energie (Habiter Program) and by Bourgogne Franche-Comte Regional Council (PARI SHS Program).

But, as yet, scholars have not fully considered how middle-income countries are responding to the new global goals on international development (the Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs) outlined in Agenda 2030. Equally, insufficient attention has been paid to how - if at all - the SDGs shape domestic development policies and practices in middle income countries. We ask these questions in Ecuador, a country that recently moved from being a lower middle income and donor dependent country to a more autonomous higher middle-income country with the capacity to promote its own national domestic development approach, Buen Vivir (in English: living well). Deploying a qualitative case study methodology and drawing primarily on in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with policy makers working in Ecuador's national government and in the capital Quito, we show that policy makers' engagement with the SDGs is selective, with an emphasis on those goals and targets which are considered of domestic importance. Both the national government and Quito's local government are currently focussing mainly on SDGs 10.2 (breaking inequalities) and 11 (inclusive cities). We demonstrate that, in practice, how policy makers understand implementation of these priority goals is not consistent; it depends on political preferences, where policy makers are located in the architecture of decentralised governance and the context-specific challenges they face. Evidence from Ecuador suggests that the SDGs cannot be understood as a single coherent template for development that states will simply adopt. Rather they should be analysed in the context of a rapidly changing architecture of global power, shaped by the context-specific nature of national development challenges and national political structures, including decentralisation.

We use the rural samples of the three waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey, and estimate panel regressions of child height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) controlling for time-invariant child-level heterogeneity. On the whole, we find no impact of short-term changes in total gross income on HAZ but document small positive correlations for younger children. Sector-differentiated analyses indicate that compared to wage earnings, only share of income from non-farm self-employment correlates positively with HAZ. Within agriculture, shares of income from consumption of own crop production and from low-protein crop production underlie the negative effect of share of income from crop production. While we cannot claim causal relationships, our findings suggest the possibility of stickiness of crop production to own consumption. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It has been widely identified that the multiple, and somewhat veiled, side-effects of such actions necessitate further research. We specifically investigate financial market spillovers that took place during the QE programmes of three central banks, namely: the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. We find evidence of significant idiosyncratic contagion transfer to a number of international financial markets, during each of the three respective QE programmes. The most significant contagion is found to be generated during the United States QE period, primarily with Western European financial markets. Strong internal and international idiosyncratic contagion is observed during the European QE programme. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We adopt a fixed-effects estimation strategy, thereby taking into account household-level heterogeneity in health status and private insurance coverage. We find that, before Medicare eligibility, households in poor health, who face a higher risk of medical expenses, are less likely to hold stocks than their healthier counterparts.

Such minority-friendly payout is also associated with higher subsequent minority shareholder investment.

A multilevel analysis of malnutrition and health deprivation in 49 low- and middle-income countries",WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Child poverty; Gender equity; Developing countries; Malnutrition; Health deprivation,CORRUPTION; INEQUALITY; DEMOCRACY; GROWTH; MONEY,"Mothers are often perceived as key agents in safeguarding the interests of children. If the assumption that women, given the opportunity, are more likely than men to see to the interests of children is true, children can be expected to be less exposed to severe forms of deprivation in countries where women have a relatively strong position in society. The hypotheses that fewer children are exposed to health deprivation and to severe forms of food deprivation in countries where there is a high degree of gender equity are tested. A combination of country-level data and micro-level survey data, makes it possible to analyze whether and to what degree gender equity in a country only benefits children of mothers who have been able to take advantage of a high degree of gender equity or if it also benefits children of less resourceful mothers. The analysis is based on a combination of macro- and micro-data (N = 391,817) from 49 low- and middle income countries to analyze the relationship between gender equity and malnutrition, and gender equity and health deprivation among children. The results indicate that gender equity in education and employment decreases child malnutrition, and that women's empowerment decreases health deprivation for children with unschooled mothers. The results support the notion that women are instrumental in children's welfare. Even when we control for a whole range of both country-level and individual-level factors, gender equity at the country level still comes out as an important determinant of children's nutrition and access to health care. Thus, strengthening women's position is important if we wish to improve children's living conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To ensure robust inference, we estimate scope economies for the microfinance industry using a novel approach which, among its other advantages, accommodates inherent heterogeneity across loans-only and loans-and-savings MFIs as well as controls for endogenous self-selection of institutions into the either type. For analysis, we use a large 2004-2014 Mixmarket dataset. Unlike earlier studies, we do not find prevalent scope economies in the microfinance industry. We find that the median degree of scope economies is statistically indistinguishable from zero and that scope economies are significantly positive for less than a half of loans-and-savings MFIs. For a non-trivial 14% of institutions, the empirical evidence suggests the existence of significantly negative diseconomies of scope indicating that the separate production of loans and savings accounts actually has the potential to reduce an MFI's costs. We also find that the failure to account for endogenous selectivity dramatically overestimates the degree of scope economies resulting in the failure to detect scope diseconomies among MFIs. Thus, our findings call for caution when invoking scope economies as a blanket justification for universal expansion of the scope of financial operations by MFIs. Instead, promoting integrated loans-and-savings MFIs may be justifiable as a means to meeting the needs of the poor rather than as a way for the industry to save costs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These are focused on: knowledge, investment in research, innovation and technological performance, which give meaning to the concept of smart economic growth;, green energy, low-carbon policies, reduced environmental collateral effects, which are attributes of sustainable economic growth. The paper dwells on the influence of bioeconomy on economic growth through an empirical study conducted between 2008 and 2015, using cross-sectional analysis applied to the interconnections between the data relative to the EU-28 member countries. Three econometric models, based on the Ordinary Least Square regression, have been developed to highlight the interdependencies between intellectual capital, circular economy and economic growth in the context of bioeconomy. The number of patents is the proxy variable designed to quantify innovative performance in the bioeconomic sectors, value added is the dependent variable that measures the achievements specific to the circular economy and gross domestic product quantifies the sensitivity of economic growth to the use of intangible resources (knowledge / intellectual capital) and of renewable resources used in cascade (specific to circular economy). The findings confirm the positive influence of research-development funding and of fiscal freedom on intellectual property rights materialized in patents. The added value created in circular economy responds well to recyclable raw material export, to population employment in circular economy and to municipal waste recycling rate.

Many of those regulations disproportionately benefit older people, but most estimates of the VSL come from hedonic wage regressions with few older workers and no retirees. Using automobile purchase decisions, I estimate a VSL for individuals from the age of 18 up to the age of 85. Combining information on vehicle holdings and use, household attributes, used vehicle prices, crash test results, and yearly fatal accidents for each make, model, and vintage automobile, I calculate a separate willingness to pay for reduced mortality for different age groups. I find a significant inverted-U shape to the age-VSL function that ranges from $1.5 to $19.2 million (in 2009 dollars). The shape and magnitude of the vehicle-based age-VSL relationship corroborate labor market estimates and extend the age range of revealed preference evidence on the relationship between age and the VSL.","[O'Brien, James] Gettysburg Coll, Dept Econ, 300 N Washington St, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA",Gettysburg College,"O'Brien, J (通讯作者)，Gettysburg Coll, Dept Econ, 300 N Washington St, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA.",jobrien@gettysburg.edu,,,,,,,75,12,13,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

This paper shows, in contrast, that sigma is affected by both globalization and technology, and that different intensities in these drivers have different consequences for the OECD and the non-OECD economies. In the OECD, we find that the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is below unity; that it increases along with the degree of globalization; but it decreases with the level of technology. Although results for the non-OECD area are more heterogeneous, we find that technology enhances the substitutability between capital and labor. We also find evidence of a non-significant impact of the capital-output ratio on the labor share irrespective of the degree of globalization (which would be consistent with an average aggregate Cobb-Douglas technology). Given the relevance of sigma for economic growth and the functional distribution of income, the intertwined linkage among globalization, technology and the elasticity of substitution should be taken into account in any policy makers' objective function.","[Sala, Hector] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Sala, Hector] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Trivin, Pedro] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona 17071, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Universitat de Girona,"Sala, H (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.;Sala, H (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",hector.sala@uab.es; pedro.trivin@udg.edu,"Sala, Hector/K-6370-2017","Sala, Hector/0000-0002-3043-2790; Trivin, Pedro/0000-0003-2277-0279",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-75623-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We acknowledge helpful comments from three anonymous referees, which have led to significant improvements in the original version of this paper.

Monitoring progress towards this goal however is challenging due to the limited availability of gender-disaggregated data, particularly in low-income countries. In this data sparse context, we examine the potential of a source of digital trace 'big data' - Facebook's advertisement audience estimates - that provides aggregate data on Facebook users by demographic characteristics covering the platform's over 2 billion users to measure and 'nowcast' digital gender gaps. We generate a unique country-level dataset combining 'online' indicators of Facebook users by gender, age and device type, 'offline' indicators related to a country's overall development and gender gaps, and official data on gender gaps in internet and mobile access where available. Using this dataset, we predict internet and mobile phone gender gaps from official data using online indicators, as well as online and offline indicators. We find that the online Facebook gender gap indicators are highly correlated with official statistics on internet and mobile phone gender gaps. For internet gender gaps, models using Facebook data do better than those using offline indicators alone. Models combining online and offline variables however have the highest predictive power. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of using Facebook data for real-time tracking of digital gender gaps. It enables us to improve geographical coverage for an important development indicator, with the biggest gains made for low-income countries for which existing data are most limited.

As the Fourth Estate, news media have a crucial role in this context. However, due to selective exposure, media bias, and endogeneity it is not a priori clear if news consumption increases voter information. Focusing on the increase in leisure time that is associated with retirement, this study investigates whether changes in the consumption of political information affect campaign-related knowledge. For that purpose, I use survey data pertaining to the 2000, 2004, and 2008 US presidential elections. Instrumenting with eligibility for old age benefits, the results show that retirement improves respondents' performance in answering knowledge questions. The effect is mostly driven by additional exposure to newscasts and newspapers. There is also evidence of increasing polarization due to retirement.","[Garz, Marcel] Hamburg Media Sch, Finkenau 35, D-22081 Hamburg, Germany; [Garz, Marcel] Univ Hamburg, Finkenau 35, D-22081 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Garz, M (通讯作者)，Hamburg Media Sch, Finkenau 35, D-22081 Hamburg, Germany.;Garz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Finkenau 35, D-22081 Hamburg, Germany.",m.garz@hamburgmediaschool.com,,"Garz, Marcel/0000-0003-0722-4202",,,,,26,9,9,3,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

We find that shareholders use inferences from facial appearance in corporate elections, as a better (higher rated) appearance measure of a director reduces voting dissent. These heuristics are based on perceived competence, trustworthiness, likability, and intelligence, but not on physical beauty. The results are valid for director re-elections but not for first appointment elections as in the latter cases, shareholders may not as yet be familiar with a director's looks. In firms with few institutional shareholders and more retail investors owning small equity stakes, the latter tend to rely more on facial appearance than institutional shareholders, presumably as institutions conduct more research on the director's background and performance, and consequently rely less on facial appearance. While female directors generally experience lower voting dissent, their facial appearance does not affect their elections results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It provides an ex post mechanism to enforce implicit insurance contracts protecting employees against adverse shocks. Results based on German establishment-level data show that skilled employees of firms with 50% labor representation on boards are protected against layoffs during adverse industry shocks. They pay an insurance premium of 3.3% in the form of lower wages. Unskilled blue-collar workers are unprotected against shocks.

The combination of these three factors creates a general class of filterable spatial-dynamic externalities (FSDE) in which one person's risk reduction investments reduce or filter undesirable events experienced by others and underestimates the option value placed on being able to respond to new information about the consequences of ecological change. By focusing on the optimal intervention decision, we illustrate how and when the opposing forces created by an FSDE will lead to a divergence in private and collective risk reduction strategies. We use bioinvasions as our motivating example. The bioinvasion first hits one jurisdiction, and that jurisdiction's risk reduction investment reduces the risk faced by all other jurisdiction. We find that efforts to internalize the full benefits of risk reduction investments may have unintended consequences on the responsiveness of environmental policy. There is a social welfare gain from asking the first jurisdiction to delay a risk reduction investment to internalize the option values of all at-risk jurisdictions.","[Sims, Charles] Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Sims, Charles] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Stokely Management Ctr 521, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Finnoff, David; Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Wyoming,"Sims, C (通讯作者)，Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.;Sims, C (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Stokely Management Ctr 521, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",cbsims@utk.edu; finnoff@uwyo.edu; Jramses@uwyo.edu,"Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X; Finnoff, David/0000-0003-0775-9733; Sims, Charles/0000-0002-0458-8249",NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program [1414374]; UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/M008894/1]; NOAA CSCOR Grant [NA09NOS4780192]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health [1R01GM100471-01],NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program; UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); NOAA CSCOR Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"We thank Eli Fenichel and Glenn Sheriff for helpful comments on an earlier draft of the paper.

We illustrate how the estimates can be used to detect information events in the time series and to characterize the information content of prices in the cross-section. We also compare the estimates to those from other models on various criteria.","[Back, Kerry; Crotty, Kevin] Rice Univ, Jones Grad Sch Business, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Back, Kerry] Rice Univ, Sch Social Sci, Houston, TX USA; [Li, Tao] City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Rice University; Rice University; City University of Hong Kong,"Crotty, K (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Jones Grad Sch Business, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",kevin.p.crotty@rice.edu,"Li, Tao/L-7424-2013","Li, Tao/0000-0002-9859-2491; Crotty, Kevin/0000-0002-5435-6112",,,,,56,21,25,3,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Our key interest is the extraction of intradaily volatility patterns from high-frequency integer price changes. We account for the discrete nature of the data via two different approaches: ordered probit models and discrete distributions. We allow for stochastic volatility by modeling the variance as a stochastic function of time, with intraday periodic patterns. We consider distributions with heavy tails to address occurrences of jumps in tick by tick discrete prices changes. In particular, we introduce a dynamic version of the negative binomial difference model with stochastic volatility. For each model, we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation method that takes advantage of auxiliary mixture representations to facilitate the numerical implementation. This new modeling framework is illustrated by means of tick by tick data for two stocks from the NYSE and for different periods. Different models are compared with each other based on the predictive likelihoods. We find evidence in favor of our preferred dynamic negative binomial difference model.","[Barra, Istvan; Borowska, Agnieszka; Koopman, Siem Jan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business & Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Borowska, Agnieszka; Koopman, Siem Jan] Tinbergen Inst Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koopman, Siem Jan] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; CREATES; Aarhus University,"Koopman, SJ (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.j.koopman@vu.nl,"Koopman, S.J./M-7814-2019","Koopman, S.J./0000-0002-4440-9524; Borowska, Agnieszka/0000-0001-9123-6227","Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO); CREATES, Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series [DNRF78]; Danish National Research Foundation","Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); CREATES, Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond)","I.B. thanks Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO) for financial support.

Norway provides an excellent setting with monthly holding data of all investors on all listed firms over a period of 15 years. The results show that foreign investors increase stock return volatility because they trade the most, are momentum traders, and have the shortest investment horizon. In contrast, individual investors reduce stock return volatility because they trade the least, are contrarian traders, and have the longest investment horizon. Domestic institutional investors fall in-between these extremes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The modeling framework assumes that a student's choice for the mode of travel to school is impacted by numerous factors such as neighborhood crime rates, traffic safety, built environment amenities, and socio-demographic factors. A generalized linear model is employed to capture longitudinal changes in the mode share of students who walk or bike to school based on data collected from 53 schools in the city of Seattle, Washington. The modeling results indicate that (1) enhanced sidewalk modifications and bike lane accommodations encourage students walking and biking to school; (2) the implementation of Seattle's student assignment plan helps promote students walking to school possibly due to the change from school choice to neighborhood-based school assignment; (3) the size of the school attendance area is not significantly correlated with students' active travel activities, while the size of school enrollment is negatively associated with walking; (4) in school areas with high employment density, biking to school may be a more attractive option for students; (5) greater crosswalk density may encourage more students to walk to school; (6) the density of bike crashes is negatively associated with students biking to school. In terms of policy implications, transport planners should continually promote walking and biking supportive environments and implement policies to encourage active student travel.","[Chen, Peng] Tongji Univ, Coll Transportat Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Junfeng; Bischak, Chris] Univ Texas Austin, Urban Informat Lab, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Xu, Mengyuan] Huazhong Agr Univ, Key Lab Urban Agr Cent China, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Gao, Xu] Univ Calif Irvine, Donald Bren Sch Informat & Comp Sci, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA USA",Tongji University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Huazhong Agricultural University; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Xu, MY (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, 1 Shizishan Rd, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",mxu@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"Chen, Peng/Y-1337-2019; Gao, Xu/X-4702-2019; Chen, Peng/F-6531-2016","Chen, Peng/0000-0002-3201-7339; Gao, Xu/0000-0002-5780-3897",,,,,74,20,21,7,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We find that RND, especially higher moments, has superior explanatory power in predicting and explaining crash risk and its risk premiums.

This article investigates a duality in the exploratory component of R&D activity with regard to innovation failure: while exploration is likely to increase firms' exposure to failure, it might also provide learning opportunities to reduce failure. Our study contributes to the innovation management and organizational learning literatures by demonstrating the value of exploratory R&D for enabling two types of learning mechanisms. The first, experience-based learning, is based on the learning opportunities derived from accumulated experience in exploratory R&D: it involves improvements to procedures associated with experimentation and provides guidance for current exploration and to navigate the search space. The second, inferential-based learning, is based on the learning opportunities derived from current exploratory R&D efforts, which are associated with improved interpretation of ill-defined problems and timely responses to unstructured information. We draw on a longitudinal data set of 2226 Spanish manufacturing companies and show that, when past experience is associated with current exploration, innovation failure in the conception phase is reduced. We also find an inverted Ushaped relation between current exploratory R&D and innovation failure, in both the conception and implementation phases of innovation activities, showing that increasing levels of investment in current exploration activities attenuate the initial positive association between exploratory R&D and failure.","[D'Este, Pablo] Univ Politecn Valencia, INGENIO CSIC UPV, Inst Innovat & Knowledge Management, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Marzucchi, Alberto] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Rentocchini, Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Rentocchini, Francesco] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; CSIC-UPV - Instituto de Gestion de la Innovacion y del Conocimiento (INGENIO); University of Sussex; University of Milan; Solent University; University of Southampton,"Rentocchini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, I-20122 Milan, Italy.;Rentocchini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",pdeste@ingenio.upv.es; a.marzucchi@sussex.ac.uk; f.rentocchini@soton.ac.uk,"Rentocchini, Francesco/A-5399-2009","Rentocchini, Francesco/0000-0002-6414-0577; Marzucchi, Alberto/0000-0002-4161-8734; D'Este, Pablo/0000-0002-4040-8209",,,,,98,27,27,8,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

As often noted, the development towards e-participation not only transforms the nature of government interactions with citizens but also affects the efficiency and effectiveness of public services and thus fosters competitiveness. Crowdsourcing is one mechanism of undertaking e-participation. It is a method for harnessing the collective intelligence of online communities to solve specific problems or produce goods, which has proved to be a successful supplemental public participation tool for city governance, as a way to engage citizens in the process of urban planning. This paper highlights how crowdsourcing can overcome the limitations in a traditional urban planning process. Using Ostrava, Czech Republic as a case study, this paper explores how city government engages citizens in creating the strategic urban development plan. The results show how crowdsourcing contributes to better civic engagement, improves citizens' perceptions of their city, and thus helps to find ways to encourage the competitiveness of the city of Ostrava, which is facing the problem of depopulation.","[Haltofova, Barbora] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Haltofova, B (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",haltofova@fame.cz,"Haltofová, Barbora/A-6046-2018",,,,,,50,15,16,6,21,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.
