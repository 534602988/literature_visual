The dynamic expansion of globalization process in the EU (mainly by the free movement of labour, goods, services, investments) over the last decades has promoted economic efficiency and so called employment flexibility (particularly among the youth population). In the employers' opinions, employment flexibility is a key to reduction of unemployment rate and a way towards stable work careers, especially among youth. The empirical surveys show that being part-time worker, in the selected EU-28 countries, is one of the most important factor preventing youth from subsequent unemployment and the risk-of-poverty in the conditions of globalization. In the year 2015, about 28% of European graduates were part-time workers because they were unable to find full-time work and above the 40% of them were employed as a temporary workers. The incidence of part-time employment, temporary employment and fixed-term contracts have been particularly widespread in selected countries after the accession to the European Union. To achieve the objective of the paper there will be compared basic income measure (median income) and poverty measures (at-risk-of-poverty rate, in work at-risk-of-poverty rate) of youth. There will be assess the relationship between calculated measures (mentioned above) and part-time employment, and relationship between these measures and temporary employment.","[Saczewska-Piotrowska, Anna; Wasowicz, Jaroslaw] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Labour Market Forecasting & Anal, Fac Econ, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Wasowicz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Labour Market Forecasting & Anal, Fac Econ, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",anna.saczewska-piotrowska@ue.katowice.pl; jaroslaw.wasowicz@ue.katowice.pl,"Wąsowicz, Jarosław G/T-6530-2018",,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2228,2235,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204018,0

The key elements of the institutional structure of capitalization mechanism of pension contributions were identified: mandatory or voluntary participation; the source of contributions to the pension system; government regulation of pension assets investment; the types of organizations managing pension savings; the nature of the relationship between a payer of contributions and a provider of pension services; taxation of retirement savings. The author assesses the quality of functioning of the national funded pension systems by such criteria as the real rate of return, risk level of investment portfolios, as well as administrative costs for pension accounts management. The work concludes that globalization has led to a greater influence of such factors as migration, international capital flows and the investment climate on the structure and performance of national pension systems. The results of the analysis of the international experience allowed the author to determine the causes of the negative results of accumulative part of pension system operation in Russia from 2002 to 2016. The paper argues that currently proposed reforms of the Russian pension system do not consider the global trends of pension systems and therefore will not solve the existing problems.","[Tumanyants, Karen] Volgograd State Univ, Chair Econ Theory & Econ Policy, Volgograd, Russia",Volgograd State University (VOLSU),"Tumanyants, K (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Univ, Chair Econ Theory & Econ Policy, Volgograd, Russia.",tka210@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2738,2745,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205017,0

It is given especially by two reasons. First, decisions about capital structure has a significant meaning for good functioning of an enterprise, and also because structure change demands quite a long time for implementation. With regard to the impact of a decision, it immediately influences the enterprise's ability to generate profit. Concerning change implementation, we may talk about a period of three and more years. Capital structure may be optimized based on recommendations for industrial enterprises, or we may calculate the impact of capital structure change on enterprise profit. However, it is necessary to consider the irregular capital price in relation to enterprise indebtedness. As enterprise indebtedness grows, not only foreign capital costs grow, costs on equity grow as well. It may be even assumed that costs on equity will grow faster in such a case - owners undergo a greater risk than creditors. The aim of this contribution is to analyse the indebtedness of a sample of industrial enterprises, and subsequently their ability to generate operating profits. Thus, we have been looking for a turning point, which determines the level of indebtedness at which the enterprise does not use the positive effect of financial lever and at the same time, the effect of financial lever is not yet negative. The data package will contain financial statements data from industrial enterprises in the Czech Republic. The output is a recommendation of capital structure for industrial enterprises in today's globalized world.","[Vrbka, Jaromir; Rowland, Zuzana] Univ Zilina, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Vrbka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",vrbka@mail.vstecb.cz; rowland@mail.vstecb.cz,"Vrbka, Jaromir/AAH-4429-2019; Rowland, Zuzana/AAF-9592-2021",,,,,,15,0,0,0,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2943,2950,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205043,0

The ranking of the top 20 countries is then presented according to two indices: KOF and MGI. Attention is drawn to the fact that, depending on the elements involved and the weightings assigned to them, the position of the states in these rankings varies. The main purpose of the paper is the measurement of globalization and presentation of the advantages and disadvantages of this measurement. The next part of the paper focuses on this issue, presenting arguments for measuring this process and arguments against measurement. The conclusion states that, given the various specific reasons, measuring globalization is necessary. It is essential to create teams, composed of specialists of different fields, who will improve the measures. It is also important to combine quantitative and qualitative research on globalization in order to be able to develop a set of complementary measures that will reflect the nature of globalization in the most comprehensive manner.","[Zagora-Jonszta, Urszula] Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Zagora-Jonszta, U (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",urszula.zagora-jonszta@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,24,0,0,3,8,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,3037,3044,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205055,0

Nowadays, firms are held responsible for both the societal and environmental impacts of their activities but, it is still difficult to find appropriate tools to turn the overall sustainability of business into reality. Soft methods, such as voluntary reporting, play a prominent role. To support sustainability through voluntary reporting, numerous initiatives appeared in the past decades, some of them with truly global ambitions. However, despite their rapid spread, their practical use is rather unbalanced geographically, since some regions remain under-represented. The under-representation is typical also for the Visegrad Four (V4) countries that are connected to worldwide reporting initiatives primarily through foreign multinationals rather than domestic companies. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the initiatives both by practitioners and scholars in these countries. To fill in the research gap, the paper examines the participation of V4 firms in one of the prominent global reporting projects - the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Using the data from the Sustainable Disclosure Database (SDD), the analysis reveals the structure of subjects involved, the durability and nature of their reporting and the compliance of their reports with GRI standards. It shows that not only the involvement of V4 business entities is really rather limited but there are also obvious differences among the V4 countries in terms of the significance of the GRI reporting system.","[Zemanova, Stepanka; Drulakova, Radka] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zemanova, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",zemanova@vse.cz; radka.drulakova@vse.cz,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,3061,3068,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205058,0

Two forecasts about the working time dynamics made by C. Marx and J.M. Keynes are analyzed. The methodological basis of these forecasts is revealed. This basis is characterized by the use of macroeconomic approach to labor input research. It is fixed that because of this approach the regularity of liberation of labor from production as a result of labor productivity rise was found. It is shown that following this logic Marx and Keynes made the conclusion about the possibility of labor input absolute reduction long before such a reduction in the modern developed countries. It is revealed that Marx's suggestion about the transformation of the majority of employees in an unemployed population was wrong because of exaggeration of class interests contradiction. It is found that forecast about the implementation of three-hour shifts in 2030 made by Keynes ignored some tendencies contradicting the working time reduction. The conclusion is made that the approach used in the forecasts should be being developed. Comparing the two forecasts by C. Marx and J.M. Keynes unfulfilled, but has a deep scientific content, it is possible to note the similarity of positions of principle of the great economists. Both consider the problem of the dynamics of working time, based on the dynamics of the social productivity of labor, the analysis of changes in the level of total labor input and employment.

A solution for the reduction of fossil fuel use-and all the negative effects that their use implies- is the application of renewable energy technologies, among which Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) systems are included. The present study examined awareness and adoption intention issues concerning this technology in Greece, through the conduction of a questionnaire survey. Specifically, it investigated public's knowledge on issues involving this technology, intention of installing it in households, main information sources and installation barriers. Socioeconomic and residence characteristics, as well as consumers' preferences and attitudes affecting the knowledge and adoption issues were examined. Factors affecting the subjects under investigation are gender, age, education level, environmentally friendly behavior and awareness, as well as having an occupation, studies or interests related to environment, technology or engineering. Additionally, the intention of installing a GSHP system is affected by specific household characteristics, infrastructure and consumers' preferences on characteristics of heating systems. In order to promote GSHPs, suitable financial incentives, regulatory improvements and awareness activities are required.","[Karytsas, Spyridon] Ctr Renewable Energy Sources & Saving CRES, Geothermal Energy Dept, 19th Km Marathons Ave, Athens 19009, Greece",,"Karytsas, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Renewable Energy Sources & Saving CRES, Geothermal Energy Dept, 19th Km Marathons Ave, Athens 19009, Greece.",spkary@cres.gr,,"Karytsas, Spyridon/0000-0002-6015-1949",,,,,99,26,29,3,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,167,179,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.001,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700017,0

The NRC cost functions provide a unique time series of technology supply functions constructed by balanced expert panels and comprised of specific technologies proven to increase fuel economy. Effects of fuel economy improvements on used vehicle prices are based on an analysis of the CES data. Retrospective analysis indicates that all income quintiles received net savings and that the effect on the distribution of income was progressive. A prospective analysis of future fuel economy improvements produced similar results.

Suboptimal decisions related to cost overruns in Brazil,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Energy; Megaprojects; Cost overruns; Integrated assessment model; Energy planning; Brazil,POWER; PLANTS,"Cost minimization is arguably the most important criterion governing decisions about energy sector infrastructure construction. Usually, a winning project is picked among similar alternatives based on lowest levelized cost of energy, because, ceteris paribus, economies of scale drive down the unit cost of energy delivered. As such, megaprojects - here defined as costing more than a benchmark US$ 1 billion - are perceived as more competitive than smaller-scale options. However, megaprojects are prone to construction cost overruns and delays that, if included ex ante, may change the optimality of decision for a given project. We hypothesize that optimistic assumptions on techno-economic performance of megaprojects favor their inclusion in the solution of integrated assessment models (IAMs), preventing higher shares of non-hydro renewables, energy efficiency and other low carbon options. To test this hypothesis, we ran the COPPE-MSB energy system cost-optimization model for infrastructure expansion. We estimate a factor (named Z factor, for zillions) to determine cost differences both within Brazil and vis-a-vis international parity and adjust the model's parameters for CAPEX and construction times of projects qualifying as megaprojects. Results show decreased coal and increased wind power generation, and a reduction in the number of new refineries leading to higher imports of diesel and gasoline.","[Koberle, Alexandre C.; Garaffa, Rafael; Cunha, Bruno S.

The results suggest four outcomes of energy policies are most important to citizens at the national level: 1) environmental quality, 2) energy costs, 3) job creation, and 4) greenhouse gas emissions. This pattern of importance for the outcomes of energy policy persists across important demographic groups including those related to political-party affiliation. At the state level, the four preferred outcomes of energy policies seen at the national level also appear-although in a different order of preference in some states.

This is even more important as incumbent energy companies in many European countries struggle to adjust their business model to changing market conditions. This article reports on a choice experiment with pension fund and energy managers conducting 1,129 experimental investment choices in Swiss hydropower. We find that complementarities exist with regard to financing different stages of project development - pension funds are averse to construction and development risk but comfortable in deploying capital to existing projects, while incumbents are willing to invest in all project stages. The two groups show surprising similarities in their aversion to fluctuating electricity prices. When fully exposed to revenue risk, energy firms and pension funds demand a risk premium of 5.98% and 7.94% respectively. For policy makers, this suggests that shielding investors from revenue risk, as has been done with feed-in tariffs for other renewables, might be an effective way of lowering the financing cost of hydropower. When it comes to their preferred co-investors, the two groups express mutual distaste for each other: energy firms would rather invest in consortia with other incumbents, and the same goes for institutional investors.","[Salm, Sarah; Wuestenhagen, Rolf] Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ & Environm, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Salm, S (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ & Environm, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",sarah_salm@outlook.com,,"Wustenhagen, Rolf/0009-0000-5306-3628",Energy Economy Society programme of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy [SI/501293-01]; Innosuisse Swiss Innovation Agency,Energy Economy Society programme of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy; Innosuisse Swiss Innovation Agency,"This work was supported by the Energy Economy Society programme of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy [Grant number: SI/501293-01].

Yet, in the EU, the energy- and emissions-saving potentials of this strategy continue to be framed as secondary outcomes of resource-related policies. Understanding why material efficiency has been overlooked as an energy/climate solution is a prerequisite for proposing ways of changing its framing, but existing studies have failed to do so. This paper fills this gap by triangulating interviews, policy documents and three policy theories: namely, historical and rational choice institutionalism, and multiple streams framework. Factors discouraging material efficiency as an energy and climate strategy include: difficulties in reframing the prevailing rationale to pursue it; the inadequacy of monitored indicators; the lack of high-level political buy-in from DG Energy and Clima; the ETS policy lock-in; uncoordinated policy management across Directorates; the lack of a designated industry lobby. Policy solutions are proposed. Before 2030, these are limited to minor amendments, e.g. guidance on embodied energy calculations or industry standards. Post-2030, more radical interventions are possible, such as introducing new fiscal drivers, re-designing the ETS emissions cap or benchmarks for allowances. This evidence suggests that the transition to a low-carbon industry will require Member State- and industry-level action.","[Hernandez, Ana Gonzalez; Skelton, Alexandra C.

Since the energy sources are directly related to the lives of people, it is important to identify the public's acceptability of changes in the energy mix. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze public preferences for changes in the shares of energy sources. For estimation of preference, this study used a mixed logit model that reflects the reference point to consider the relative shares of the energy sources and the relative level of attributes. In addition, this study used a hierarchical Bayesian logit model to examine whether the public characteristics result in any preference difference on the electricity service attributes. The results show that the Korean public's acceptability is high for renewable energy source expansion policy.

Efforts to expand cross-border electricity cooperation and trade in SAR need to address not only regional barriers, but also barriers stemming from domestic electricity sector policies in the region. Expanding the scope of bilateral electricity cooperation in the short- and medium-term, and especially opening up to commercial as well as government-to government projects, can build confidence in the process of cross-border trade and the potential benefits it can provide.

There is virtually no evidence, however, of how incentives for attaining energy efficiency interact with countries' regional development aims. This article presents recent experiences from Estonia, where an energy renovation subsidy programme financed with carbon emission trading funds was carried out between 2010 and 2014. We show that despite equal access to subsidies for residents living in various places, a regionally unequal distribution of subsidies occurred. Empirical analyses confirm that low-performing regions acquire less public subsidy, thus adding another layer of regional inequality to existing socio-economic differences. Findings suggest that renovation subsidy distribution is related to regional socio-economic indicators and that real estate value explains 40% of subsidy distribution variations between regions. Although the energy policy goal of carbon conservation is important, ignoring the location and organisational capacity of local communities results in missed opportunities to mitigate growing regional disparities.","[Lihtmaa, Lauri] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Tartu, Estonia; [Hess, Daniel Baldwin] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Buffalo, NY USA; [Leetmaa, Kadri] Univ Tartu, Dept Geog, Tartu, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of Tartu,"Lihtmaa, L (通讯作者)，Estonian Univ Life Sci, Tartu, Estonia.",lauri@ecobon.ee,"Leetmaa, Kadri/G-9875-2017","Leetmaa, Kadri/0000-0002-4418-5022; Hess, Daniel/0000-0003-2239-236X; Lihtmaa, Lauri/0000-0003-1143-7278",European Union [655601]; Ministry of Education and Science Estonia [IUT2-17]; Fund KredEx; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [655601] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union(European Union (EU)); Ministry of Education and Science Estonia; Fund KredEx; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 655601 and Institutional Research Grant no.

This extends to a special 'Automotive Sector Deal' that focuses on the shift to low emissions vehicles (LEVs). Here attention is on electric vehicle and battery production and innovation. In this paper, we argue that a more straightforward gain in terms of framing policy around potential economic benefits may be made through supply chain activity to support refuelling of battery/hydrogen vehicles. We set this in the context of LEV refuelling supply chains potentially replicating the strength of domestic upstream linkages observed in the UK electricity and/or gas industries. We use input-output multiplier analysis to deconstruct and assess the structure of these supply chains relative to that of more import-intensive petrol and diesel supply. A crucial multiplier result is that for every 1million pound of spending on electricity (or gas), 8 full-time equivalent jobs are supported throughout the UK. This compares to less than 3 in the case of petrol/diesel supply. Moreover, the importance of service industries becomes apparent, with 67% of indirect and induced supply chain employment to support electricity generation being located in services industries.

Nevertheless, the cost overrun of this promotion policy led to government legislation against existing PV plants. Although these investments will be profitable when the subsidy ends, according to the last law enacted in Spain (IRR = 7.4%), either a massive sale to vulture funds or the abandonment of PV plants is being planned. Owners are unable to cover the loans through which they were originally financed. In this scenario, investors find it more profitable to cancel all operational expenditures and allocate this working capital to cover their loans, although this measure implies a 22% energy reduction. This study analyses a representative Spanish PV plant based on real energy and economic data. The analysis shows the turn from an attractive IRR = 10.14% to a situation with limitations where the owner injects money annually to overcome potential bankruptcy of the investment. This paper reflects the influence of promotion policies in the profitability of PV plants. Additionally, the adverse legal framework in Spain identifies a profitable but unaffordable scenario, highlighting the differences between the economic and financial performance of a PV investment.","[Lomas, J.

Through interviews with roughly 250 local officials, we evaluate the fiscal effects of this development in 21 regions across every major US oil and gas producing state during boom and bust periods. Growing oil and gas production has increased local government revenues through a variety of mechanisms, including property taxes, sales taxes, severance taxes, and more. Industry activity has also increased costs and demand for local services led by road damage, water and wastewater infrastructure, and a range of staff costs including emergency services and law enforcement. Despite volatility in revenues and service demands, our interview results show that 74% of local governments have experienced net fiscal benefits, 14% reported roughly neutral effects, and 12% reported net fiscal costs. Local governments in highly rural regions experiencing large-scale growth have faced the greatest challenges. To further improve future outcomes, local officials can plan for impacts, state policymakers can reexamine revenue policies, and operators can pursue collaboration with local governments.","[Newell, Richard G.; Raimi, Daniel] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Raimi, Daniel] Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, 735 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Resources for the Future; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Raimi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, 735 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",newell@rff.org; raimi@rff.org,"Raimi, Daniel/JFJ-3573-2023; Newell, Richard/I-3838-2015","Raimi, Daniel/0000-0002-9154-3371; Newell, Richard/0000-0002-3205-5562","Alfred P.

However price dispersion and limited customer access to PV quotes prevents some prospective customers from obtaining low price offers. This study shows that improved customer access to prices - also known as price transparency - is a potential policy lever for further PV price reductions. We use customer search and strategic pricing theory to show that PV installation companies face incentives to offer lower prices in markets with more price transparency. We test this theoretical framework using a unique residential PV quote dataset. Our results show that installers offer lower prices to customers that are expected to receive more quotes.

This trend is expected to continue due to urbanization, industrialization, and expansion of domestic manufacturing, encouraged by the Make in India initiative. A framework that considers a long-term road map for energy security is necessary to transform India from a country of chronic power shortages to one with reliable sources of energy. Elements of this framework include a sustainable energy mix, stronger reliance on green energy sources like hydro, solar and wind power, less dependency on coal, and strengthened cooperation on energy trade with neighbouring countries in South Asia. This paper discusses the long-term transboundary energy collaboration between India and Bhutan and the benefits for India in terms of diversification of energy sources and overall energy security. By assessing reciprocal benefits for India, we attempt to substantiate our claim that the India-Bhutan energy collaboration is strongly based on the principle of mutual benefits that extend to overall security.

We further found that feasibility considerations - particularly economic and land use feasibility perceptions - significantly influence RE/EE policy preferences, with higher levels of perceived feasibility being associated with higher levels of support for RE/EE policies. However, feasibility perceptions were not strong enough to overcome the effects of cultural values, particularly for egalitarians and individualists. In sum, such feasibility considerations are present in policy elites' related policy preference formation, but are constrained by their cultural value predispositions.

We find little evidence of significant long run relationships between the different markets. We also fad that the NordPool and Phelix markets in particular exhibit volatility persistence and clustering behaviour that is inconsistent with the postulations of market efficiency. The existence of continued inefficiencies across these power markets indicates that the desired goal of achieving an efficient and unified electricity market in the EU context is still a work in progress.","[Morales, Lucia; Hanly, Jim] Dublin Inst Technol, Coll Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Aungier St, Dublin 2, Ireland",,"Morales, L (通讯作者)，Dublin Inst Technol, Coll Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Aungier St, Dublin 2, Ireland.",lucia.morales@dit.ie; James.hanly@dit.ie,"Morales, Lucia/ABB-2312-2021","Morales, Lucia/0000-0002-9111-813X; Hanly, Jim/0000-0002-4296-0347",,,,,39,14,15,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,78,85,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.061,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200009,0

Our results demonstrate that biofuel programs can benefit from ex ante analyses to improve their design. We find that most farmers (71%) are likely to adopt biofuel trees in most scenarios, especially species with relatively high yields, low labour requirements and high oilseed prices. Nevertheless, value chain reorganization through contracting and labour provision proves to be the key lever to stimulate adoption. This calls for further research on effective contract design and implementation, and for developing alternative business models. Our results imply that next to high opportunity costs of land, also high opportunity costs of labour can be a barrier to biofuel tree adoption. If biofuel programs are to succeed, they have to move beyond the idea of smallholder biofuel production on marginal lands with surplus labour.","[Dalemans, Floris; Verwimp, Anne; Van den Broeck, Goedele; Tollens, Eric; Maertens, Miet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Bioecon, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E-2411, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Dalemans, Floris; Muys, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E-2411, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Bohra, Babita; Sharma, Navin] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, United Nations Ave 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Gowda, Balakrishna] Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forestry & Environm Sci, Gandhi Krishi Vignan Kendra, Bellary Rd, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore,"Dalemans, F (通讯作者)，Celestijnenlaan 200E-2411, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",floris.dalemans@kuleuven.be; bart.muys@kuleuven.be; goedele.vandenbroeck@kuleuven.be; babitabohra@gmail.com; navin.sharma@cgiar.org; gowdabk@yahoo.com; eric.tollens@kuleuven.be; miet.maertens@kuleuven.be,"Maertens, Miet/A-5509-2013; Van Den Broeck, Goedele/AAD-3865-2020; Muys, Bart/ABN-3906-2022","Maertens, Miet/0000-0001-7245-0375; Van Den Broeck, Goedele/0000-0002-8480-3526; Muys, Bart/0000-0001-9421-527X",Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [11Z4617N]; World Agroforestry Centre [IFAD-1043],Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO); World Agroforestry Centre(CGIAR),"We thank Pieter Vlaeminck from KU Leuven for his scientific support during the design stage.

The district heating (DH) systems investigated in this paper use low-carbon heat sources: large-scale heat pumps (LSHP) or nuclear combined heat and power plants (NCHP). They are compared with electric boilers and central gas boilers in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and heating costs. The heating systems are dimensioned to supply the projected 2030 heat loads for two different land surface areas (extensive and compact). The key input data is the empirical residential and tertiary heat demand per square kilometre for 2015, extrapolated to 2030 to account for the potential decrease in the heat demand (energy-efficient buildings). Given the assumptions made in this paper, the heating system that obtains the best balance between CO2 emissions and heating cost relies on an NCHP located about 30 km from Lyon. Cases in which the heat has to be transported over longer distances are considered, hence providing insights for metropolitan areas with similar size and density as the Lyon area. Implications for stakeholders and policy makers are discussed, so that to optimize future French energy systems through the most efficient use of available technologies.","[Leurent, Martin; Jasserand, Frederic] Univ Paris Saclay, CEA, I Tese, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Leurent, Martin; Da Costa, Pascal] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Genie Ind, CentraleSupelec, 9 Rue Joliot Curie, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Rama, Miika] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, POB 1000, FI-02044 Espoo, Finland; [Persson, Urban] Halmstad Univ, Sch Business Engn & Sci, POB 823, SE-30118 Halmstad, Sweden",CEA; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Saclay; VTT Technical Research Center Finland; Halmstad University,"Leurent, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, CEA, I Tese, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",Martln.leurent@cea.fr; Miika.Rama@vtt.fi; Urban.persson@hh.se,"Persson, Urban/JXX-1188-2024","Persson, Urban/0000-0001-9118-4375; Da Costa, Pascal/0000-0002-5267-7836; Rama, Miika/0000-0002-2476-7498",,,,,100,14,14,0,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,616,630,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.043,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800056,0

In this paper, two simple tariffs aimed at residential consumers are reviewed: progressive tariffs (PTs), which penalise high consumption of electricity, and electricity saving feed-in tariffs (ESFITs), which provide incentives to reduce consumption of electricity. The effectiveness of these tariffs is quantified and compared using the price elasticity (for PT) and an incentive elasticity (for ESFIT). The results indicate that PTs are more effective in mobilising electricity saving than ESFITs and confirm biases in human decision-making (here loss aversion). While further research is necessary, we propose a tariff which would motivate consumers to reduce their consumption by offering both an incentive for reaching an energy saving goal and a disincentive for failing to reach this goal. The flexibility of such a tariff makes it a promising solution suitable for application in countries with a comparatively high household income and liberalised retail electricity market.","[Prasanna, Ashreeta] Empa, Urban Energy Syst Lab, Uberlandstr 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Patel, Martin K.] Univ Geneva, Chair Energy Efficiency, Inst Environm Sci ISE, Uni Carl Vogt 1211, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Patel, Martin K.] Fac Sci, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci DEFSE, Uni Carl Vogt 1211, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Mahmoodi, Jasmin; Brosch, Tobias] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol, Consumer Decis & Sustainable Behav Lab, 40 Blvd Pont dArve, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Prasanna, Ashreeta] Univ Geneva, Chair Energy Efficiency, Geneva, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); University of Geneva; University of Geneva; University of Geneva,"Prasanna, A (通讯作者)，Empa, Urban Energy Syst Lab, Uberlandstr 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",ashreeta.prasanna@empa.ch; Jasmin.Mahmoodi@unige.ch; Tobias.Brosch@unige.ch; martin.patel@unige.ch,"Prasanna, Ashreeta/AAB-8790-2019; Brosch, Tobias/J-4700-2012; Patel, Martin K./N-6853-2013","Patel, Martin K./0000-0002-3983-6003; Brosch, Tobias/0000-0001-6883-0383",National Research Programme Managing Energy Consumption under the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [NRP 71],National Research Programme Managing Energy Consumption under the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We thank the National Research Programme Managing Energy Consumption (NRP 71) under the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) for supporting this research.

HVHF may substantially affect the environmental, health, and economic and social realities faced by communities where drilling occurs. Yet how landowners in these areas learn about HVHF is largely unknown. Understanding landowner knowledge is important because HVHF development depends on voluntary choices of landowners, less knowledgeable landowners may be vulnerable to industry malfeasance, and support for HVHF is linked to familiarity with the industry. Using an original survey of Eastern Ohio landowners affected by HVHF, we find that they most frequently get information about HVHF from the news, oil/gas companies, social connections, and the internet. Information sourcing varies with demographics, socioeconomics, and political partisanship. Although landowners are exposed to many sources of information, most do not help them feel more informed about HVHF. Self-perceived familiarity with HVHF varies positively with the number of sources consulted, internet research, and receipt of information from the oil/gas industry and industry advocacy groups. Landowners often receive unsolicited information about HVHF, but this information rarely helps them feel more informed.","[Arnold, Gwen] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Farrer, Benjamin] Knox Coll, Dept Environm Studies, 2 E South St, Galesburg, IL 61401 USA; [Holahan, Robert] SUNY Binghamton, Environm Studies & Polit Sci, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Arnold, Gwen; Holahan, Robert] Ostrom Workshop Polit Theory & Policy Anal, Affiliated Fac, Bloomington, IN USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Arnold, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",gbarnold@ucdavis.edu; bdfarrer@knox.edu; rholahan@binghamton.edu,,,The Hellman Foundation,The Hellman Foundation,"The Hellman Foundation generously supported this research.

One of the open issues in this literature is the identification of the determinants of resilience, that is, the factors that influence the evolutionary dynamic process of robustness and adaptability registered in particular places. The selected sample of papers in this special issue provides original contributions for answering the question about what determines regional economic resilience. The common findings of the contributions can be seen as quite robust by relying upon different measures of resilience, cases, methodologies and time periods. Three main conclusions arise from the special issue: most of the determinants of economic resilience show regularities across time and space. The factors that contribute to explain the economic performance of places in normal times are also useful for understanding the patterns observed during and after recessionary events. Policymakers can play an active role in sustaining resilient economies by addressing resources and efforts in the right policy areas without waiting for crises.","[Di Caro, Paolo] Italian Minist Econ & Finance, Dept Finance, Rome, Italy; [Di Caro, Paolo] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Fratesi, Ugo] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Portsmouth; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Di Caro, P (通讯作者)，Italian Minist Econ & Finance, Dept Finance, Rome, Italy.;Di Caro, P (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",pdicaro@unict.it; ugo.fratesi@polimi.it,"Fratesi, Ugo/IAM-5881-2023","Fratesi, Ugo/0000-0002-0755-460X",,,,,22,48,49,15,80,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Energy prosperity in the US contrasts with a more fraught period for traditional energy exporting states where geopolitical challenges have been compounded by fiscal stress and rising domestic energy demand. America's relationship with energy exporting countries will continue to evolve as the US grows more self-sufficient and as more non-OPEC resources become viable, particularly in the Western Hemisphere. Expanded geographic diversification of oil production portends a gradual diminution of the strategic importance of large crude oil exporters. One longer term potential effect of the US shale revolution may be, for example, an unwillingness in Washington to maintain the Carter Doctrine's promise of protection for its interests in the Persian Gulf, although this appears unlikely in the near term. Nevertheless, continued economic growth in developing Asia and the unlocking of new energy resources around the world means the geostrategic relationships that have protected energy supplies over the last 40 years are unlikely to endure over the long run.","[Krane, Jim; Medlock, Kenneth B., III] Rice Univ, Baker Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX 77005 USA",Rice University,"Krane, J (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Baker Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",jkrane@rice.edu,,"Krane, Jim/0000-0002-2132-6769",,,,,19,27,31,1,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,558,565,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.050,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800052,0

As a result, alternative jet fuel (AJF) technologies have garnered interest as a means to achieve large, near-term emissions reductions for the industry. This analysis quantifies the potential for AJF to reduce aviation's CO2 emissions by assessing: the availability of AJF feedstock; AJF volumes that could be produced from that feedstock; the lifecycle emissions of AJF compared to petroleum-derived jet fuel; and the number of bio-refineries and capital investment required to achieve the calculated emission reductions. We find that, if the use of AJF is to reduce aviation's lifecycle GHG emissions by 50% or more by 2050, prices or policies will have to significantly incentivize the production of bioenergy and waste feedstocks, and AJF production will need to be prioritized over other potential uses of these resources. Reductions of 15% by 2050 would require construction of similar to 60 new bio-refineries annually (similar to growth in global biofuel production capacity in the early 2000s), and capital investment of similar to 12 billion USDzois per year (similar to 1/5 of annual capital investment in petroleum refining).","[Staples, Mark D.; Malina, Robert; Suresh, Pooja; Barrett, Steven R.

The growth in the support costs for electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) has often been singled out as a main driver of the increase in these prices. The aim of this paper is to analyse the degree of influence of RES-E promotion costs on the evolution of the retail price of electricity in the EU Member States. The analysis is carried out for households as well as for industry, with the help of a panel data econometric model. Our results show that the impact of renewable energy promotion costs on retail electricity prices is positive and statistically significant, although relatively small. Differences across consumer types can be observed. An increase of 1% in those costs induces an average increase of only 0.023% in industrial retail prices and 0.008% in the residential retail prices. This impact on retail prices is mediated by the type of support scheme which is adopted, with price-based support instruments showing a greater effect than quantity-based ones.","[Trujillo-Baute, Elisa] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Trujillo-Baute, Elisa] Barcelona Inst Econ, Chair Energy Sustainabil, Barcelona, Spain; [del Rio, Pablo] CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods IPP, Madrid, Spain; [Mir-Artigues, Pere] UDL, Madrid, Spain; [Mir-Artigues, Pere] Energy Sustainabil Res Grp UB, Madrid, Spain",University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP),"del Río, P (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods IPP, Madrid, Spain.",elisatrujillo@ub.edu; pablo.delrio@csic.es; peremir@econap.udl.cat,"Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/P-2285-2019","Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/0000-0002-6328-3242; Mir-Artigues, Pere/0000-0002-4157-8090","Chair of Energy Sustainability (IEB, University of Barcelona); MINECO / FEDER, EU [ECO2015-69107-R]; Government of Catalonia [2015-SGR-531]","Chair of Energy Sustainability (IEB, University of Barcelona); MINECO / FEDER, EU; Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya)","We are very grateful for the suggestions and comments from two anonymous referees.

Currently, biomass and biogas contribute with 1.8% of the total electricity generation, but only 0.6% of the electricity is produced in wind and solar farms. Adoption of smart grid technologies is key to transform the Ecuadorian electricity network and to positively impact the quality of the electricity supply. The future of the Ecuadorian electricity sector relies on the successful implementation of the new Organic Law of Public Service of Electricity and on external financing for new energy projects.","[Ponce-Jara, M.

In this context customer demand better and more innovative products and services. That has also been reflected in grocery sales where a major innovation of today is online grocery shopping through various platforms and technologies. Each innovation is accepted by its users in a different time horizon, but the path from the introduction to the plateau of productivity on the market is the same. The path of innovation is called the Hype Curve. By this curve it is possible to gauge at what stage of innovation the innovation is. The Hype Curve can be an important guideline for companies that recognize the importance of innovation as a factor of competitiveness. The aim of this paper is to evaluate into which phase in the concept of Hype Curve is online grocery shopping on the Czech market. Secondary data on the penetration of online grocery shopping and the publicity of this innovation on the Czech market will be used to identify this phase. Research outcomes are useful for strategic managers of traditional retail organizations that decide to switch to the e-tail or hybrid form. The results of this paper can also help retail organizations that are already trading in this market in deciding on the adoption of further innovations linked to OGS. Voice Purchases, Augmented and Virtual Reality, Chatbots, Smart Refrigerators, Echo Amazon and Amazon Dash, Delivery Droids and 3D technology are the other innovations that this paper also deals with.","[Bauerova, Radka] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Business Econ & Management, Univ Namestni 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Bauerova, R (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Business Econ & Management, Univ Namestni 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",bauerova@opf.slu.cz,"Bauerová, Radka/ABF-9689-2020","Bauerová, Radka/0000-0003-3110-5756",Student grant competition project: Acceptance of technology from the perspective of marketing tools [SGS/7/2017],Student grant competition project: Acceptance of technology from the perspective of marketing tools,This research was financially supported by the Student grant competition project SGS/7/2017: Acceptance of technology from the perspective of marketing tools.,,23,1,1,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1959,1966,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300250,0

Following the work of Pollard (1980), our approach uses a Cramer-von Mises minimum distance estimator for parameter estimation. The asymptotic null distribution of the resulting test statistic is represented by invariance principle arguments as a functional of a Brownian bridge in a simple regression format for which asymptotic critical values are readily delivered by simulations. Asymptotic power is examined under fixed and local alternatives and finite sample performance of the test is evaluated in simulations. The test is applied to measure top income shares using Korean income tax return data over 2007-2012. When the data relate to estimating the upper 0.1% or higher income shares, the conventional assumption of a Pareto tail distribution cannot be rejected. But the Pareto tail hypothesis is rejected for estimating the top 1.0% or 0.5% income shares at the 5% significance level.

The results show that a high presence of same or related industries speeds up the re-employment process, while high concentrations of unrelated activities do not.

We use the preaverage method to diminish the impact of noise, employ the filter method to exclude the strong dependence, and obtain the smoothed data, and estimate the Hurst parameter by the smoothed data.

Population change trends of different city types have been determined. Scales and specificity of changes in cities industrial sector were estimated with the help of balance method. In cities along the Trans-Siberian Railway (Transsib), the number of engineering and food industries decreased, and the number of petrochemical and construction materials industries grew. Correlation between the change of industrial functions and the number of population in different types of cities was defined. Tendencies of social and economic development of the largest city were traced on the example of Irkutsk city. In Irkutsk, there was a steady city growth due to young female population inflow together with increasing of the role of urban services functions. In the municipal budget, the share for education expenditures was high and it is still growing now, while the share for the health expenditures is decreasing. Revealed features of the economic development of Transsib cities coincide with trends, which are general across whole Russia.","[Marina, Mironova] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Econ & Geog, Geog,RUDN Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Alexander, Sholudko] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Econ & Geog, Econ,RUDN Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Nataliya, Kuznetsova] St Petersburg Natl Res Univ Informat Technol Mech, Urban Studies, Special Urban Informat, Inst Design & Urban Studies,ITMO Univ, St Petersburg, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; ITMO University,"Marina, M (通讯作者)，Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Econ & Geog, Geog,RUDN Univ, Moscow, Russia.",mironova_mn@pfur.ru; sholudko_an@pfur.ru; nataliya.kuznetsova95@yandex.ru,,,RUDN University Program 5-100,RUDN University Program 5-100,The publication was prepared with the support of the RUDN University Program 5-100.,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1220,1227,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300157,0

Internet sales make online marketing more effective. Its aim is not only the purchase itself, but also its subsequent repetition as a positive feedback, as well as customer satisfaction. Repeated visit to the online store or re-purchase can be accomplished by influencing the consumer behavior of the target customers. In order to know if vendor measures to achieve customer satisfaction are effective, we need to know their satisfaction with sales. This is an area, that is significantly affected by the different trends and results of specialized surveys and technical solutions. The paper will present a part of the results obtained from the complex research of international and Slovak companies, which are important online sales networks dealing with the sale of healthy foods with a wide selection of healthy and environmentally friendly nutrition. Healthy nutrition, as well as the constant degradation of the various components of the environment, including the soil, has become a global problem, which needs to be payed proper attention primarily from a global perspective. At present, strong pressure is being put from the side of consumers themselves and their needs in the field of organic nutrition, by which they force the company to deal with the issue.","[Miklencicova, Renata] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Mass Media Commun, Nam J Herdu 2, Trnava 91701, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Miklencicova, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Mass Media Commun, Nam J Herdu 2, Trnava 91701, Slovakia.",rmiklencicova@gmail.com,,"Miklencicova, Renata/0000-0002-7818-1652",,,,,23,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2244,2250,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300287,0

Since then the degree of state cooperation in the environmental field has been steadily increasing. Thanks to the process of globalization the creation and protection of the environment has been taking place in the various regions of the world. Although state stimulus for environmental care had supranational character in many countries (including the Slovak Republic), one of the basic principles of the European environmental policy is that of subsidiarity. Its main idea is to transfer environmental competences together with their funding to the lowest government level. This paper examines the extent of environmental care carried out at the supranational, national, regional and especially local levels in the Slovak Republic. The degree of environmental care is expressed by the volume of environmental public expenditures spent at individual government levels in the Slovak Republic. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the attitudes of individuals to public funding of environmental care as one of the elements of the globalization process and to confront them with the actual volume of environmental public expenditures spent at different levels of public administration of the Slovak Republic. In the analysis, we use the data of our own primary research and the official statistical databases of Eurostat and the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic.","[Mlynarova, Denisa; Scerba, Kamil; Orviska, Marta] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Scerba, K (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",denisa.mlynarova@umb.sk; kamil.scerba@umb.sk; marta.orviska@umb.sk,,,Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-15-0322],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This work was supported by Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract no.

That is why, there is ongoing work aimed at determining causes of accidents and methods leading to increasing traffic safety on the level crossings. These actions should ultimately reduce the number of occurring threats and accidents, thus improve safety. The authors of this article, on the basis on the law in effect today, have brought up the problem of the use of the level crossings in respect of ensuring safety. An analysis of accidents on the level crossings has been conducted, considering the up-to-date Level Crossing Protection Systems (LCPS). As a result of the analysis a series of actions improving safety has been proposed, among others: raising the category of level crossings and building new grade-separated junctions, education aiming at promoting safety culture in society, increasing the level of monitoring drivers' and pedestrians' behaviour on the level crossings, automatic accident notifications sent to competent authorities, introducing additional traffic signs informing about the level crossings. All this actions can make level crossings safer and help people use them correctly.","[Nowakowski, Waldemar; Ciszewski, Tomasz; Lukasik, Zbigniew] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect Engn, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland",Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Nowakowski, W (通讯作者)，Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect Engn, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",w.nowakowski@uthrad.pl; t.ciszewski@uthrad.pl; z.lukasik@uthrad.pl,"Łukasik, Zbigniew/X-8982-2019; Ciszewski, Tomasz/AAB-4766-2021","Łukasik, Zbigniew/0000-0002-7403-8760; Ciszewski, Tomasz/0000-0002-5493-2116; Nowakowski, Waldemar/0000-0003-0592-9065",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1268,1274,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300163,0

The tool of the machine has effect on the aggregate and vice versa. The aggregate puts complex forces on the machines. These loads are usually simplified and replaced with a mean, distributed force, which is the input of further computations (e.g. finite element (FEM) simulations). This can be done, because the difference between two different, but statically equivalent loads becomes very small at sufficiently large distances from load. However, near the area, where loads act, the results using the simplification are not real, therefore finding the optimal tool design is difficult. The discrete element method (DEM) models the materials using particles (elements) with independent translational and rotational degrees of freedom and arising forces (interactions) between them. This allows the simulation and tracking of each particle independently, which makes DEM ideal for modelling bulk materials. The FEM is usually used for modelling continua. If DEM is coupled with FEM, the result is a detailed stress distribution near the loads. In the possession of the detailed stress state, the optimization of the tool can be performed, and a better construction may be created.","[Orosz, Akos; Tamas, Kornel; Radics, Janos P.; Zwierczyk, Peter T.] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Machine & Prod Design, Muegyet Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Orosz, A (通讯作者)，Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Machine & Prod Design, Muegyet Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.",orosz.akos@gt3.bme.hu; tamas.kornel@gt3.bme.hu; radics.janos@gt3.bme.hu; z.peter@gt3.bme.hu,"Orosz, Ákos/AAI-1864-2019","Orosz, Ákos/0000-0002-4265-6900",,,,,13,4,4,1,2,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,399,404,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000059,0

The analysis of the factors influencing the development of the spatial potential of the region has shown that it is necessary to consider the development of the spatial potential of the region in the interaction of several groups of natural-ecological, socio-political and socio-economic factors. The analysis of the connectedness of the economic space of the regions of the Central Federal District is conducted. To do this, we examined the connectivity of federal districts according to the migration indicator, which, in turn, is dependent on the per capita incomes of the population.

Nowadays in the context of globalization, Internet marketers do not have a clear understanding of developing an integrated approach to assess the functioning of a company website. The most effective channels of attraction and tools for promoting educational services have not been determined yet. The article analyzes the most effective tools for promoting educational services on the Internet, provides a plan containing main stages in planning marketing activities of educational institutions based on the use of Internet tools. Regarding methodology and scientific approaches, the research work is mainly based on the SOSTAC model. It consists of several stages: situation analysis, objective, strategy, tactics, action plan, control and correction. The article comments on the provisions made to improve the work of educational computer centers in the online system, among which the authors note not only the appearance and usability of the site, but also the interactive and marketing components. The article has a practical focus on the findings and recommendations that can be used to manage the marketing activities of educational institutions, both higher education and additional one. The practical application of the developed plan for promotion on the Internet contributes to attracting the largest number of consumers, developing loyalty to the target audience and increasing competitiveness of the organization in educational services market, which are especially relevant in the context of globalization.","[Solosichenko, Tatyana Zh; Nesterova, Zinaida, V] Ural State Univ Econ, Mkt & Int Management Dept, 8 March St,62, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia; [Goncharova, Nadezhda A.] Ural State Univ Econ, Foreign Languages Dept, 8 March St,62, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia",Ural State University of Economics; Ural State University of Economics,"Solosichenko, TZ (通讯作者)，Ural State Univ Econ, Mkt & Int Management Dept, 8 March St,62, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia.",inter68@mail.ru; zvn@usue.ru; nadin1325x@yandex.ru,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2352,2360,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300301,0

Regional Studies. An extensive literature has emerged in regional studies linking organization-based measures of entrepreneurship (e.g., self-employment, new start-ups) to regional economic performance. A limitation of the extant literature is that the measurement of entrepreneurship is not able to incorporate broader conceptual views, such as behaviour, of what actually constitutes entrepreneurship. This paper fills this gap by linking the underlying and also more fundamental and encompassing entrepreneurship culture of regions to regional economic performance. The empirical evidence suggests that those regions exhibiting higher levels of entrepreneurship culture tend to have higher employment growth. Robustness checks using causal methods confirm this finding. ,Regional Studies. ,(),,,,,, RESUMECulture de entrepreneuriat, retombees du savoir, et l'expansion des regions. Regional Studies. Une documentation importante a vu le jour dans les etudes regionales etablissant le rapport entre d'une part des mesures de l'entrepreneuriat basees sur des organisations (p.ex. travailleurs independants, jeunes entreprises), d'autre part les performances economiques regionales. Une limitation propre a la litterature existante tient au fait que la mesure de l'entrepreneuriat n'est pas en mesure d'incorporer des principes conceptuels plus generaux, comme le comportement, par exemple, sur ce qui constitue effectivement l'entrepreneuriat. La presente communication comble cette lacune, en etablissant un lien entre la culture sous-jacente, mais aussi plus fondamentale et globale, de l'entrepreneuriat, et les performances economiques regionales. Les donnees empiriques semblent indiquer que les regions presentant une culture de l'entrepreneuriat de niveau superieur ont tendance a presenter une croissance superieure de l'emploi. Des controles de robustesse faisant usage de methodes causales confirment cette conclusion. ZUSAMMENFASSUNGUnternehmenskultur, Wissensubertragungen und das Wachstum von Regionen. Regional Studies. In den Regionalwissenschaften sind zahlreiche Studien erschienen, in denen firmenbasierte Ma ss stabe des Unternehmertums (z.B.

Eine Einschrankung der vorhandenen Literatur besteht darin, dass bei der Messung des Unternehmertums keine breiteren konzeptuellen - z.B. verhaltensbezogenen - Perspektiven der Frage berucksichtigt werden konnen, was genau Unternehmertum ausmacht.

Regional Studies. En los estudios regionales existe una amplia bibliografia que relaciona las medidas de la iniciativa empresarial en el ambito de la organizacion (p. ej., empleo autonomo, nuevas empresas emergentes) con el rendimiento economico regional. Una limitacion de la bibliografia actual es que la medicion de la iniciativa empresarial no es capaz de incorporar perspectivas conceptuales mas amplias, tales como la conducta, de lo que realmente constituye la iniciativa empresarial. En este articulo cubrimos este vacio al vincular la cultura empresarial subyacente y tambien mas fundamental e integral de las regiones con el rendimiento economico regional. La evidencia empirica indica que las regiones que muestran niveles mas altos de cultura empresarial suelen tener un crecimiento de empleo mas alto.

In tourism, a wide range of researches, focusing on guests' satisfaction, is conducted. However, the question of guests' preferences is often omitted, although it is obvious that preferences are crucial when choosing an accommodation facility. Besides this, preferences are also one of the important determinants of offering the right product what is essential in the globalised world where many other offers compete. For purposes of this paper, respondents from both segments were selected and a printed questionnaire was used. Collected data was subsequently analysed - means were calculated for each segment in order to identify major differences in guests' preferences. For better visual clarity, a semantic differential was created. The collected data shows current guests' preferences. From the researchers' point of view, the findings can be used to evaluate the level of preferences, especially in connection with the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in tourism and also with the competition in the form of globally operating hotel chains. From the point of view of destination management, it is possible to use these findings for the future development of a particular destination. From the point of view of managers and owners of accommodation facilities, these findings can be used as a starting point for creating new products,which will be competitive in the today's globalised world.","[Svec, Roman; Slaba, Marie; Martiskova, Petra] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Corp Strategy, Dept Tourism & Mkt, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Svec, R (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Corp Strategy, Dept Tourism & Mkt, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",17587@mail.vstecb.cz; slaba@mail.vstecb.cz; petramartisek@gmail.com,"Švec, Roman/KCK-8757-2024; Martiskova, Petra/W-6164-2018",,,,,,25,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,390,397,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300052,0

Experiments were conducted in the NARIC Institute of Agricultural Engineering soil bin facility filled with sandy soil with volumetric moisture content of 2% and 15%, at three different working speeds (0.5, 1, 2 m/s) at the working depth of 0.15 m. The improved DEM model contain a soil model consisting of discrete particles created within the Yade software and 3D laser scanned model of the sweep tools. Inserting the analyzed tool geometry into the simulation made it possible to investigate the characteristics of the tillage tools and also the effect of the different geometries appearing in the soil cutting forces.

In this article, we propose a counting-process-based Bayesian method for quantifying the effectiveness of email marketing campaigns in conjunction with customer characteristics. Our model explicitly addresses the seasonality of data, accounts for the impact of customer characteristics on their purchasing behavior, and evaluates effects of email offers as well as their interactions with customer characteristics. Using the proposed method, together with a propensity-score-based unit-matching technique for alleviating potential confounding, we analyze a large email marketing dataset of an online ticket marketplace to evaluate the short- and long-term effectiveness of their email campaigns. It is shown that email offers can increase customer purchase rate both immediately and during a longer term. Customers' characteristics such as length of shopping history, purchase recency, average ticket price, average ticket count, and number of genres purchased also affect customers' purchase rate. A strong positive interaction is uncovered between email offer and purchase recency, suggesting that customers who have been inactive recently are more likely to take advantage of promotional offers.

However, at present, there is no quantitative assessment of the presented factors. Intangible assets are the only indicator that is regularly quantitatively taken into account in the countries of Russia. We have compiled a regression dynamic model of panel data, based on which it was revealed, that the relationship between the volume of intangible assets and the nominal wage level, the number of personnel engaged in research and development is significant. We obtained the coefficients that we will use to compile the rating. 69 countries participated in the survey. A check on F-statistics showed that the model is statistically significant. Therefore, these indicators can be taken into account when compiling a rating of the country by the level of development of intangible property. The received data testify that intangible assets reflect only a small part of objects of non-material property. Unidentified, client capital, social, reputational and information capital are not always subject to commercialization, as they do not meet the requirements of the Russian Accounting Standards.

Identification of barriers and drivers is necessary to devise policies and strategies to facilitate the introduction and dissemination of renewable energy generation. In 2002 the Brazilian government encouraged the adoption of renewable energy technologies such as wind, biomass and small hydroelectricity. Beginning in 2014, Brazil's federal regulatory agency started auctions aiming to develop similar to 12 GWp of utility scale solar photovoltaic (PV). This paper explores the barriers and drivers to introduction of the solar photovoltaic technology in Brazil by focusing on the analysis of empirically determined subjectivities among the electricity power sector actors in the case of the Minas Gerais state. We identify and describe three perspectives (factors) using Q-method: (1) We can do it (2) Step-by-step; and (3) It's not the money. Within these perspectives, planning for siting power plants, lack of transmission network, and biodiversity impacts were identified as three main statistically significant and highly ranked barriers. Identification of social perspectives may avoid conflict barriers to introducing utility-scale PV and suggest socially acceptable solutions for technical and economic issues.","[Frate, Claudio Albuquerque] Brasilia Univ, BR-70919900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Brannstrom, Christian] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Universidade de Brasilia; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Brannstrom, C (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",claudiofrate@unb.br; cbrannst@geos.tamu.edu,,"Albuquerque Frate, Claudio/0000-0002-2087-371X; Brannstrom, Christian/0000-0002-6619-2020","Agencia Reguladora de Energia Eletrica (ANEEL), Chamada Estrategica [13/2011]","Agencia Reguladora de Energia Eletrica (ANEEL), Chamada Estrategica","Frate thanks the Agencia Reguladora de Energia Eletrica (ANEEL), Chamada Estrategica 13/2011 Projeto Arranjos Tecnicos e Comerciais para a Insercao da Geracao Solar Fotovoltaica na Matriz Energetica Brasileira.",,57,32,32,3,48,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,346,352,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.048,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700035,0

Urban hydrocarbon governance centered on establishing statutory setback distances between drilling sites and nearest houses or other protected uses. Here we analyze qualitative interview data obtained with a rigorous sampling frame to examine processes and outcomes of municipal-level hydrocarbon governance. We find that early municipal responses (2001-2002) revealed lack of technical expertise to respond to unconventional drilling and production. Controversial wells, which residents considered too close to houses, focused governance debates in several municipalities. Municipal policymakers reported that protecting public health and safety were top priorities in determining setbacks. After 2003, policymakers copied ordinance language from neighboring municipalities and established task forces and working groups to reduce political tensions. The role of the hydrocarbon industry included frequent claims seeking to exploit the longstanding separation of mineral and property estates, which encouraged municipalities to reduce setbacks and lower potential exposure to regulatory takings lawsuits. Over time, municipal regulatory power in hydrocarbon governance decreased while industry power increased, offering several implications for corporate responsibility and social license debates.","[Fry, Matthew] Univ North Texas, Dept Geog & Environm, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Brannstrom, Christian] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Fry, M (通讯作者)，Univ North Texas, Dept Geog & Environm, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",mfry@unt.edu; cbrannst@geos.tamu.edu,,"Brannstrom, Christian/0000-0002-6619-2020","National Science Foundation [1262521, 1262526]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1262526] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1262521] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Grants #1262521 and #1262526.,,79,13,15,1,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,383,393,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.042,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700039,0

This research evaluates the competitiveness of the castor bean agricultural production sector, organized around the biodiesel agro-industrial system (AIS). This research presents some of the challenges in the way of enjoying the benefits of the National Biodiesel Production and Use Program (PNPB), concerning the sectoral coordination of small castor bean producers in Minas Gerais and Bahia states and the position of the biodiesel and ricin chemical industries. Desk research, document analysis, and interviews with stakeholders are used to that end. The main results are: the detailing of the institutional environment around the PNPB; the mapping of the biodiesel AIS and of the castor bean organizational arrangement promoted via PNPB, as well as their contractual relations. It appears that the organizational arrangements of castor beans (OACB) exist only as a geographical concentration of producers and cooperatives. Although there are transactions, relations are still too fragile for the cooperation and coordination of collective actions. As part of a sectoral strategic agenda, however, there are actions that can be encouraged for building a horizontal coordination among producers.","[Conejero, Marco Antonio] Fluminense Fed Univ, Business Management Dept, GASA, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Cesar, Aldara Da Silva; Batista, Angelita Pereira] Fluminense Fed Univ, Agribusiness Engn Dept, GASA, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense; Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Cesar, AD (通讯作者)，Fluminense Fed Univ, Agribusiness Engn Dept, GASA, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",marcoac@id.uff.br; aldaracesar@id.uff.br; angelita_batista@yahoo.com.br,"Conejero, Marco Antonio/F-7924-2018","Conejero, Marco Antonio/0000-0002-9008-3473; Da Silva Cesar, Aldara/0000-0002-8140-0270",CNPq; FAPERJ,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)),The authors acknowledge the financial support of CNPq and FAPERJ.,,63,9,9,1,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,461,470,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.036,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800045,0

Results suggest that students consider natural amenities in their migration to college decision and, in a number of cases, preferences for natural amenities vary based on origin state amenity conditions.

This paper aims to quantify the effectiveness of various policies. After reviewing and quantifying the policies directly related to the sales and driving of NEVs in the past five years, we established a multivariate co-integration model and an error correction model to analyse the long- and short-term effects of these policies. The results demonstrate positive co-integration for the relationship between the NEV market share and the NEV purchase subsidy, tax exemption, the policy of restricting internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) purchase, and the abolishment of traffic restrictions for NEVs. China's unique policy of restricting ICEVs has in fact promoted NEV sales by adjusting the supply and demand to influence the consumers' choices. Finally, we found technology to still be a bottleneck factor in the NEV industry, and technological progress's effect on NEV diffusion is greater than the economic subsidy policy. Therefore, this study suggests that the funds being made available from the gradual reduction of the purchase subsidy should be transferred to research and development.","[Ma, Shao-Chao; Feng, Lianyong] China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fan, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; Beihang University,"Fan, Y (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yfan1123@busa.edu.cn,,"Feng, Lianyong/0000-0003-0953-5784","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71690245, 71210005, 71373285]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 71690245, 71210005 and 71373285) is greatly acknowledged.",,43,156,167,31,339,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,609,618,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.057,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800061,0

A $1/metric ton increase in California's CO2 price is estimated to have increased the electricity prices by $0.41/MWh (p-value < 0.0001) for NP15, $0.59/MWh (p-value < 0.0001) for SP15, $0.41/MWh (p-value = 0.0056) for Mid-C, and $0.15/MWh (p-value = 0.0925) for PV. These estimates reflect: (a) the NP15 and SP15 sellers' pricing behavior of fully including the CO2 price in their intra-state transactions; (b) the Mid-C price's 100% pass-through of the CO2 price in the Pacific Northwest's hydro export to California; and (c) the statutory obligation of paying the CO2 emissions cost by California's buyers of the electricity imported from the Desert Southwest. The policy implication is that internalization of CO2's externality in the Western U.S.A. requires a cap-and-trade program with a regional scope that encompasses all four hubs, thereby remedying the California program's limited geographic coverage which introduces distortions in neighboring markets.","[Woo, C.

Urban energy landscapes represent the spatial patterns of urban energy systems which are visible in the built environment. Spatial regularities in the way systems of energy provision and use are organised are manifest in urban energy landscapes. Energy uses may vary in relation to the structures of the built environment, and the perceptions that coevolve with technologies. This paper presents evidence from three case studies of urban energy landscapes in Hong Kong (PRC), Bengaluru (India) and Maputo (Mozambique). The cases suggest a variety of patterns (uniform, fragmented, scattered) in terms of how different fuels and electricity are provided and who has access to them. Qualitative research among policy makers reveals different trajectories towards sustainability. The paper concludes with the suggestion that the spatial organisation of urban energy systems shapes potential trajectories of change for an urban energy transition. This would call for forms of spatial planning that promote flexibility as a means to foster sustainability innovations. However, further evidence will be required to evaluate whether this exploratory analysis can be generalised beyond the three cities studied.","[Broto, Vanesa Castan] UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit, 34 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England",University of London; University College London,"Broto, VC (通讯作者)，UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit, 34 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9EZ, England.",v.castanbroto@ucl.ac.uk,"Hallstedt, Sophie I./A-4669-2015; Broto, Vanesa Castan/AAF-4485-2021",,UK's Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001361/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001361/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K001361/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK's Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This paper was funded by a grant from the UK's Economic and Social Research Council called 'Mapping Urban Energy Landscapes' (Grant reference: ES/K001361/1).,,113,57,59,3,56,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,755,764,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.009,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800070,0

To set up a baseline for further analysis and compare the impact of emission regulation policies, an improved framework for performance evaluation of sustainable operations is developed in this study by integrating classical data envelopment analysis (DEA) and exponential learning curve. The proposed mathematical models are applied into an empirical study of 27 major million-kW coal-fired power plants in mainland China. Empirical analysis shows that the interactions among official emission regulation policies, reusable environmental investment (REI), and sustainable operations management of coal-fired power plants in China. Several policy suggestions are provided for power firm managers and policy makers in China. Specifically, we suggest that the Chinese government should implement long-term protection policies in less developed regions instead of emergency response policies.","[Ji, Xiang] Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Li, Guo; Wang, Zhaohua] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 5 Zhongguancun S St, Beijing 10081, Peoples R China; [Li, Guo; Wang, Zhaohua] Beijing Inst Technol, Inst Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Guo; Wang, Zhaohua] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central South University; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Li, G (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 5 Zhongguancun S St, Beijing 10081, Peoples R China.",liguo@bit.edu.cn,"Li, Guo/ACY-6481-2022; Wang, Zhaohua/JJE-6996-2023; Wang, Zhaohua/AAP-5489-2021","Li, Guo/0000-0002-7127-1102;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71372019, 71573016, 71521002, 71501139, 71372018, 71602182]; National Science Fund of China [71625003]; Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; China Scholarship Council [201506340126]; Excellent Doctoral Dissertations of USTC",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Fund of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Municipal Commission of Education(Beijing Municipal Commission of Education); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Excellent Doctoral Dissertations of USTC,"The authors sincerely thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions.

This paper focuses on the latter, namely dynamic tariffs. However, a tension may exist between economic arguments for dynamic pricing and people perceiving such pricing as unfair. This paper seeks to assess the fairness of dynamic tariffs through a combination of theoretical and empirical research. Fairness is defined broader than inequality; it is understood more objectively than just people's perceptions and thus requires engagement with ethical theory; and the fairness analysis is not only based on abstract ethical reflection but also on analysing the underlying arguments for people's perceptions. Both the theoretical fairness assessment and the survey among Dutch households reveal that dynamic tariffs are less fair than transport and capacity tariffs and fairer than Ramsey pricing. The fairness of dynamic tariffs depends on implementation conditions such as: clear, non-economic arguments as justification, guarantying basic-needs fulfilment, decreasing perception that 'peak use is only for the rich', and increasing predictability.","[Neuteleers, Stijn; Hindriks, Frank] Univ Groningen, Fac Philosophy, Oude Boteringestr 52, NL-9712 GL Groningen, Netherlands; [Mulder, Machiel] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Mulder, M (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",stijn.neuteleers@uclouvain.be; machiel.mulder@rug.nl; f.a.hindriks@rug.nl,,"Mulder, Machiel/0000-0003-4175-6915; Neuteleers, Stijn/0000-0001-7550-2185; Hindriks, Frank/0000-0002-5818-4071",Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This paper is written as part of the research project Redesigning the electricity market in order to facilitate the transition towards a sustainable energy system, financed by the Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) and various stakeholders in the Dutch energy industry.

In this paper, we argue that cultural capital, specifically individuals' participation in cultural activities, is significantly related to pro-environmental behaviour and is therefore a relevant, additional driver of electricity-saving behaviours. We apply a Heckman two-step selection strategy approach to microdata gathered from the latest sample of the annual Aspects of daily life survey for the year 2014, conducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. Our results, besides confirming the role of the sodo-demographic determinants already investigated in the extant literature, also provide evidence that individuals who participate in some cultural activities show a higher probability of adopting electricity saving behaviours at home. Furthermore, the sign of such a relationship is differentiated depending on the characteristics of the cultural activity. Some policy implications are derived from the analysis.","[Quaglione, Davide; Sarra, Alessandro] G DAnnunzio Univ Chieti & Pescara, Dept Econ, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy; [Cassetta, Ernesto] Univ Udine, Dept Econ & Stat Sci, Via Tomadini 30, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Crociata, Alessandro] G DAnnunzio Univ Chieti & Pescara, Dept Philosoph Pedag & Econ Quantitat Sci, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; University of Udine; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Quaglione, D (通讯作者)，G DAnnunzio Univ Chieti & Pescara, Dept Econ, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.",d.quaglione@unich.it; ernesto.cassetta@uniud.it; crociata@gmail.com; sarra@unich.it,"Quaglione, Davide/AAK-1422-2020","Quaglione, Davide/0000-0002-8912-4506; CASSETTA, Ernesto/0000-0002-7876-4903; SARRA, Alessandro/0000-0001-6929-0681",,,,,98,33,35,1,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,503,511,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.030,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800047,0

Vincent in 1912. In certain cases, such as under Gaussianity, the Vincentized distribution belongs to the same family as that of the individual distributions and it can be obtained by averaging the individual parameters. This article compares the properties of quantile aggregation with those of the forecast combination schemes normally adopted in the econometric forecasting literature, based on linear or logarithmic averages of the individual densities. Analytical results and Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the properties of quantile aggregation are between those of the linear and the logarithmic pool. Larger differences among the combination schemes occur when there are biases in the individual forecasts: in that case quantile aggregation seems preferable on the whole. The practical usefulness of Vincentization is illustrated empirically in the context of linear forecasting models for Italian GDP and quantile predictions of euro area inflation.","[Busetti, Fabio] Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Busetti, F (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",fabio.busetti@bancaditalia.it,,"Busetti, Fabio/0000-0003-1637-8473",,,,,34,18,20,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Using a factorial survey experiment, we investigate the influence of both on the local acceptance of wind turbine developments in Germany and Poland two countries differing in installed wind power capacity. Respondents were surveyed with hypothetical situations describing the construction of wind farms varying in the opportunity to participate in the planning process (participatory justice), the distribution of turbines across regions (distributive justice), and ownership, among other characteristics. We find higher acceptance levels in Poland than in Germany. Respondents in both countries are willing to accept new turbines in their vicinity if they can participate in decision making, the turbines are owned by a group of citizens, and if the generated electricity is consumed in the region instead of being exported. Overall, participatory justice is more important than distributive justice. Confirming previous results, we also find that respondents who already have turbines in their vicinity show higher acceptance levels than those who are not yet affected. Thus, the negative externalities are likely to be overestimated in the planning and implementation process.","[Liebe, Ulf] Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Bartczak, Anna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw Ecol Econ Ctr, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland; [Meyerhoff, Juergen] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landscape & Environm Planning, Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Meyerhoff, Juergen] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",University of Bern; University of Warsaw; Technical University of Berlin; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Liebe, U (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",ulfliebe@soz.unibe.ch; bartczak@wne.uw.edu.pl; juergen.meyerhoff@tu-berlin.de,"Meyerhoff, Juergen/M-5640-2019; Bartczak, Anna/AAN-1875-2021; Bartczak, Anna Małgorzata/AAZ-9274-2020","Meyerhoff, Juergen/0000-0003-4333-8514; Bartczak, Anna/0000-0001-5917-5989; Bartczak, Anna Małgorzata/0000-0001-5917-5989","National Science Centre Poland [OPUS 5, UMO-2013/09/B/HS4/01493]; University of Bern","National Science Centre Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); University of Bern","We thank Benedikt Jahnke for his support in data collection.

Reducing this energy consumption will be critical for countries to achieve their national greenhouse gas reduction commitments. The ISO 50001-Energy management standard provides a continual improvement framework for organizations to reduce their consumption. Several national policies already support ISO 50001; however, there is no transparent, consistent process to estimate the potential impacts of its implementation. This paper presents the ISO 50001 Impacts Methodology, an internationally-developed methodology to calculate these impacts at a national, regional, or global scale suitable for use by policymakers. The recently formed ISO 50001 Global Impacts Research Network provides a forum for policymakers to refine and encourage use of the methodology. Using this methodology, a scenario with 50% of projected global industrial and service sector energy consumption under ISO 50001 management by 2030 would generate cumulative primary energy savings of approximately 105 EJ, cost savings of nearly US $700 billion (discounted to 2016 net present value), and 6500 million metric tons (Mt) of avoided CO2 emissions. The avoided annual CO2 emissions in 2030 alone are equivalent to removing 210 million passenger vehicles from the road.","[McKane, Aimee; Therkelsen, Peter; Scodel, Anna; Rao, Prakash; Aghajanzadeh, Arian] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hirzel, Simon] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Zhang, Ruiqin] Zhengzhou Univ, 100 Sci Ave, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Prem, Richard] Prem Consulting, Josefstaedter Str 51-1-30, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Fossa, Alberto] MDJ Consulting, Ave Vereador Jose Diniz 3720-7 Andar, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Lazarevska, Ana M.] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Mech Engn, Skopje, North Macedonia; [Matteini, Marco; Schreck, Bettina] Vienna Int Ctr, United Nations Ind Dev Org, POB 300, A-1400 Vienna, Austria; [Allard, Fabian] Nat Resources Canada, 580 Booth St, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Alcantar, Noe Villegal] Natl Commiss Efficient Energy Use, Av Revolut 1877,Piso 8, Mexico City 01090, DF, Mexico; [Steyn, Karel] Eskom, POB 1091, ZA-2001 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Hurdogan, Ertac] Osmaniye Korkut Ata Univ, TR-80000 Osmaniye, Turkey; [Bjorkman, Thomas] Swedish Energy Agcy, Kungsgatan 43 Eskilstuna,Rosenlundsgatan 9, Stockholm, Sweden; [O'Sullivan, John] Sustainable Energy Author Ireland, Wilton Pk House,Wilton Pl, Dublin D02 T228 2, Ireland",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Zhengzhou University; Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Natural Resources Canada; Osmaniye Korkut Ata University; Swedish Energy Agency,"Therkelsen, P (通讯作者)，Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",atmckane@lbl.gov; ptherkelsen@lbl.gov; ascodel@lbl.gov; prao@lbl.gov; AAghajanzadeh@lbl.gov; simon.hirzel@isi.fraunhofer.de; rqzhang@zzu.edu.cn; r.prem@premconsulting.eu; afossa@mdj.com.br; ana.lazarevska@gmail.com; M.MATTEINI@unido.org; B.SCHRECK@unido.org; Fabian.Allard@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca; noe.villegas@conuee.gob.mx; SteynJJ@eskom.co.za; ehurdogan@osmaniye.edu.tr; thomas.bjorkman@energimyndigheten.se; John.OSullivan@seai.ie,"Rao, Prakash/AFP-9679-2022; Hürdoğan, Ertaç/AFG-1277-2022","Rao, Prakash/0000-0003-4858-8328; HURDOGAN, ERTAC/0000-0003-1054-9964; Hirzel, Simon/0000-0002-6323-917X; Therkelsen, Peter/0000-0003-1413-8636","Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs of the U.S. Department of Energy, under U.S. Department of State [S-OES-12-1A-0010, 3012199]; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs of the U.S. Department of Energy, under U.S. Department of State(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was supported by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs of the U.S. Department of Energy, under U.S. Department of State Interagency agreement S-OES-12-1A-0010, Contract No. 3012199.; The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is supported by U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

The influence of learning effects and feedstock cost developments has been highlighted, including also gaseous fuels. Thorough sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Previously reported cost assumptions for advanced biofuels were found to have been too optimistic. The most cost-competitive biofuels for most of the time period remained conventional biodiesel and bioethanol, but the costs of these options and biomethane and Synthetic Natural Gas (bio-SNG) converged in the medium term and thus other factors will play a decisive role for market developments of biofuels. Feedstock cost uncertainties for the future remain a challenge for long-term planning, and low-cost short-rotation coppice may change the picture more than any other parameter. Of the advanced biofuels, bio-SNG was found significantly more cost-competitive and resource efficient than Fischer-Tropsch-diesel and lignocellulose-based ethanol, but still requiring a dedicated long-term policy. The results and the large sensitivities of biofuel competitiveness stress the need for more data transparency and for thorough sensitivity analyses of the results in similar system studies.","[Millinger, M.; Thraen, D.] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Bioenergy, UFZ Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Ponitka, J.; Arendt, O.; Thraen, D.] Deutsch Biomasseforschungszentrum, Dept Bioenergy Syst, DBFZ Torgauer Str 116, D-04347 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Millinger, M (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Bioenergy, UFZ Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",markus.millinger@ufz.de,"Millinger, Markus/AAP-9284-2021; Millinger, Markus/G-1573-2018; Thran, Daniela/E-7672-2015","Millinger, Markus/0000-0002-8428-4957; Millinger, Markus/0000-0002-8428-4957; Thran, Daniela/0000-0002-6573-6401; Arendt, Oliver/0009-0006-6716-7472",Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers; Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE),Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers(Helmholtz Association); Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE),"This work was funded by the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers and supported by Helmholtz Impulse and Networking Fund through Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE).

With recent cost trends, several countries are approaching retail grid parity. Some policymakers conclude that now is the time to remove feed-in tariffs, as grid parity creates a self-sustaining market, where economically rational investors will invest even in the absence of government incentives. Recent experience in key European solar markets, however, shows that with the advent of grid parity and the reduction of feed-in tariffs, investment in new solar capacity has decreased rather than increased, making it questionable whether low-carbon energy policy targets will be reached. We conduct a cross-case study analysis of three PV markets Germany, Italy and Switzerland to investigate the role of feed-in tariffs for the near- and post-grid parity stages of diffusion, accounting for investor diversity and distinguishing between implications for revenue-based and savings-based business models. We find that recent market trends are strongly driven by increased levels of risk, especially policy risk and exposure to revenue risk. We therefore suggest that relatively frugal but stable policy environments may be conducive to further growth of investment in photovoltaics and minimize cost to society.","[Karneyeva, Yuliya; Wuestenhagen, Rolf] Univ St Gallen, Chair Management Renewable Energies, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Karneyeva, Y (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Chair Management Renewable Energies, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",yuliya.karneyeva@unisg.ch; rolf.wuestenhagen@unisg.ch,,"Wustenhagen, Rolf/0009-0000-5306-3628",Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) [466 KTI.2014.0114]; Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship [2013.0181],Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship,"This research is part of the activities of SCCER CREST (Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research), which is financially supported by the Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) under Grant No. 466 KTI.2014.0114.

Since this capacity for resilience is uncertain, a probability distribution is defined that takes into account the growing loss of resilience when pollution goes from a prudent state to an imprudent one. The paper also finds that expected Pigouvian taxes are insufficient to maintain resilience due to the unaccounted cumulative effect of pollution, and that society would prefer a prudent tax. Furthermore, we introduce the transaction of payments for environmental services between the sector that provides drinking water and the polluting sector. This analysis reveals a redistribution of resources that very much favors the polluting sector, and thus there are no incentives to invest in these payments unless the affected sector has additional objectives to maximize its private benefit.","[Tobon Orozco, David; Molina, Carlos] Univ Antioquia, Dept Econ, Calle 67 53-108, Medellin, Colombia; [Vargas Cano, John Harvey] Univ Antioquia, Inst Math, Calle 67 53-108, Medellin, Colombia",Universidad de Antioquia; Universidad de Antioquia,"Orozco, DT (通讯作者)，Univ Antioquia, Dept Econ, Calle 67 53-108, Medellin, Colombia.",david.tobon@udea.edu.co; ca.molina11@uniandes.edu.co; harvey.vargas@udea.edu.co,,"Tobon-Orozco, David/0000-0003-4519-5617; Vargas Cano, John Harvey/0000-0001-8687-2085",CODI-Universidad de Antioquia (CODI) [8733/026/2013],CODI-Universidad de Antioquia (CODI),"This paper was supported by the CODI-Universidad de Antioquia (CODI registration 8733/026/2013) and derived of the research project Impact of pollution on the resilience of a natural system and scope of environmental policies and abatement technologies in a general equilibrium model.

Previous analyses focus solely on the former, which implicitly assumes that climate-induced changes in consumption do not affect price. But this assumption is untenable because a shift in demand alters quantity and price at equilibrium. Here we present the first empirical estimates for the effect of climate change on electricity prices. Translated through the merit order dispatch of existing capacity for generating electricity, climate-induced changes in daily and monthly patterns of electricity consumption cause non-linear changes in electricity prices. A 2 degrees C increase in global mean temperature increases the prices for and consumption of electricity in Massachusetts USA, such that the average household's annual expenditures on electricity increase by about 12%. Commercial customers incur a 9% increase. These increases are caused largely by higher prices for electricity, whose impacts on expenditures are 1.3 and 3.6 fold larger than changes in residential and commercial consumption, respectively. This suggests that previous empirical studies understate the effects of climate change on electricity expenditures and that policy may be needed to ensure that the market generates investments in peaking capacity to satisfy climate-driven changes in summer-time consumption.","[Veliz, Karina D.] Univ Diego Portales, Sch Ind Engn, Av Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile; [Veliz, Karina D.] Univ Chile, Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, Santiago, Chile; [Kaufmann, Robert K.; Cleveland, Cutler J.] Boston Univ, Ctr Energy & Environm Studies, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02466 USA; [Stoner, Anne M.

The realization of the urgency of providing modern energy technology and services particularly to rural areas has prompted both the Nepalese government and development institutions to focus on community-run renewable energy facilities. It is argued that off-grid and micro-scale energy development offers an alternative path to fossil-fuel use and top-down resource management as they democratize the grid and increase marginalized communities' access to renewable energy, education and health care. However, Nepal's energy development is also heavily influenced by demands from the fast-growing economies of neighboring countries such as China and India. As a result, this article evaluates the Nepalese national energy policies by applying the key aspects of the energy justice framework and showing the feasibility constraints due to geopolitical and biophysical factors to the implementation of energy just policies in this developing country context. The empirical evidence is derived from interviews during a one-month fieldwork in the Lalitpur and Katmandu districts of Nepal, site-visits, discourse analysis of expert statements, government policies and newspaper articles as well literature review on peer-review articles.","[Islar, Mine; Brogaard, Sara] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, POB 170, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Lemberg-Pedersen, Martin] Aalborg Univ, Dept Culture & Global Studies, Frederikskaj 10,Bldg B,303A, DK-2450 Copenhagen SV, Denmark",Lund University; Aalborg University,"Islar, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, POB 170, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",mine.islar@lucsus.lu.se; sara.brogaard@lucsus.lu.se; lemberg@cgs.aau.dk,,,Swedish Research Council; FORMAS [211-2014-1600],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas),"The authors would like to acknowledge Dipak Gyawali as well as our informants for their contributions.

It is expected that, once cost parity with fossil fuel generation is achieved, a transition towards renewable power should continue without the need for further renewable energy subsidies. However, this reasoning implicitly assumes that the cost of fossil fuel power generation does not respond to the large scale penetration of renewable power. In this paper we build a standard economic framework to test the validity of this assumption, particularly in the case of coal and gas fired power generation. We find that it is likely that the cost of fossil fuel power generation will respond to the large scale penetration of renewables, thus making the renewable energy transition slower or more costly than anticipated. More analysis is needed in order to be able to quantify this effect, the occurrence of which should be considered in the renewable energy discourse.","[Foster, Edward; Contestabile, Marcello; Workman, Mark; Shah, Nilay] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Foster, Edward; Contestabile, Marcello; Blazquez, Jorge; Manzano, Baltasar] KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Manzano, Baltasar] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Pontevedra, Spain",Imperial College London; Universidade de Vigo,"Foster, E (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, London, England.;Foster, E (通讯作者)，KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",edward.foster@rbs.com; marcello.contestabile@kapsarc.org; jorge.blazquez@kapsarc.org; bmanzano@uvigo.es; mark.workman07@imperial.ac.uk; n.shah@imperial.ac.uk,"Manzano, Baltasar/H-4367-2015","Blazquez, Jorge/0000-0001-5658-3418",,,,,46,71,74,3,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2017,103.0,,,,,,258,264,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.050,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NA,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397356000021,0

These policies led to an enormous success in terms of having a large share of renewables providing electricity services: wind alone accounts today for similar to 23.5% of electricity demand in Portugal. We explain the reasons wind power became a key part of Portugal's strategy to comply with European Commission climate and energy goals, and provide a detailed review of the wind feed-in tariff mechanism. We describe the actors involved in wind power production growth.

It uses meta-analysis to identify the main factors affecting short and long term elasticity results for energy, in general, as well as for specific products, i.e., electricity, natural gas, gasoline, diesel and heating oil.","[Labandeira, Xavier; Lopez-Otero, Xiral] Univ Vigo, Fac CCEE, Rede, Campus As Lagoas sn, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Labandeira, Xavier] European Univ Inst, FSR Climate, Via Boccaccio 121, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [Labeaga, Jose M.] UNED, Dept Anal Econ, Senda Rey 11, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; European University Institute; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Labeaga, JM (通讯作者)，UNED, Dept Anal Econ, Senda Rey 11, Madrid 28040, Spain.",jlabeaga@cee.uned.es,"Labeaga, Jose M/I-1375-2015","Labeaga, Jose M/0000-0002-5839-1484; Lopez-Otero, Xiral/0000-0002-9952-9670","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2012-39553-004-01, ECO2013-41183-P]; Catedra FENOSA at the University of Vigo",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Catedra FENOSA at the University of Vigo,"The authors are grateful to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

The basic specification used as a starting point for the spatial analysis is the relationship between real output growth and unemployment rate changes. This is extended to incorporate spatial lags, to test for the presence of commuting effects, and to accommodate spatial residuals dependence. We estimate various spatial panel models, controlling for heterogeneity across areas, and find consistent evidence of a significant Okun's coefficient. Results also show that spillover effects from labour mobility and interregional linkages matter and have important implications for the validity of the empirical law. Resumen Este articulo explora la Ley de Okun mediante el uso de un enfoque de panel de datos espaciales de nivel NUTS 3 de Gran Bretana durante el periodo 1985-2011. La especificacion basica empleada como punto de partida para el analisis espacial es la relacion entre el crecimiento de la produccion real y los cambios en la tasa de desempleo. Esta se amplio para incorporar retardos espaciales con los que poner a prueba la presencia de efectos de desplazamiento al trabajo, y para dar cabida a la dependencia de residuos espaciales. Se estimaron diferentes modelos de panel espacial en los que se controlo la heterogeneidad entre areas, y se encontraron pruebas robustas de un coeficiente de Okun significativo. Los resultados muestran tambien la importancia de los efectos de spillover derivados de la movilidad laboral y los vinculos interregionales y tienen implicaciones importantes para la validez de la ley empirica. ?? ????1985???2011?????NUTS3???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????","[Palombi, Silvia; Perman, Roger] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, 130 Rottenrow, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland; [Tavera, Christophe] Univ Rennes 1, 7 Pl Hocher, F-35065 Rennes, France",University of Strathclyde; Universite de Rennes,"Palombi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, 130 Rottenrow, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland.",silvia.palombi@strath.ac.uk; r.perman@strath.ac.uk; christophe.tavera@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,54,18,18,5,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

This has been made possible by a combination of federal financial incentives and state-level feed in tariffs. The federal policies are accelerated depreciation, which allows for higher depreciations in earlier years; and generation based incentive, which provides a premium for each unit of generation. Accelerated depreciation appears to be more effective from deployment and cost perspectives; whereas, generation based incentive is said to be more effective in incentivizing generation. In this paper, using multivariable linear regressions on a sample of approximately 40 wind plants, while controlling for wind regime and wind turbine technology, we investigate the incremental impact of generation based incentive compared to accelerated depreciation. We find that generation based incentive results in at least 3 percentage points higher plant load factors than accelerated depreciation. This indicates that, if higher generation is the goal of renewable policies, generation based incentive should be preferred to accelerated depreciation.

Reducing GHG emissions is essential to mitigate the threat of global warming. Household carbon (dioxide) emissions have been recognized as one of the most important contributors to climate change, with a significant impact on both the local and global environment, and various policy instruments have been implemented by governments to bring about the reduction. This paper reviews these carbon abatement policy measures from demand-side and supply-side perspectives based on 144 countries across the world. The advantages and disadvantages of the policies are analyzed and it is found that income level largely affects the choice of policy, with high-income countries being mostly associated with demand-side policy instruments. Low-income countries adopt less demand-side policy measures and mainly depend on supply-side polices such as targets and regulations. Geographic location is also an important factor influencing the choice of policy instruments due to the different climates between different regions, although targets, regulations and carbon taxes are dominant GHG reduction policy measures worldwide. In America, tendering and net metering are popular, while in Europe feed-in-tariff (FIT) policies are implemented for more than 70% of the time. In Asia, policy measures, whether supply-side or demand-side, are comparatively weakly implemented and influenced by location, urbanization and economic growth. This paper suggests that, although the economic level is different, low-income countries and particularly developing countries can promote carbon abatement as well as the financial market by gradually changing from supply-side policy instruments to demand-side policies. This critical review provides a systematic understanding of various carbon emission policies in different countries and regions worldwide, which will provide significant assistance for the development of policies to reduce household carbon emissions.","[Zhang, Xiaoling; Wang, Yue] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoling; Wang, Yue] City Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yue] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Beijing, Peoples R China","City University of Hong Kong; Shenzhen Research Institute, City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong; Peking University","Zhang, XL (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zhang, XL (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xiaoling.zhang@cityu.edu.hk; wangyuexuanxuan@pku.edu.cn,"Zhang, Xiaoling/AAT-4795-2020; Zhang, Xiaoling/AAT-4748-2020; Wang, Yue/E-9002-2010","Zhang, Xiaoling/0000-0002-6369-9424;","Environment and Conservation Fund - HKSAR Depts.

This paper evaluates energy and CO2 emissions performance using a newly developed non-radial directional distance function, and China's regional integration is investigated using a price approach. The study points to evidence that: (1) most provinces do not perform efficiently in terms of energy use and CO2 emissions with performance gaps among regions becoming larger, indicating regional segmentation; (2) magnitude of regional integration has increased dramatically, while China's eastern provinces are less integrated in domestic side due to their convenience to international openness; (3) regional integration has significant and robust positive effects on energy and CO2 emissions performance with over 70% of effects coming from artificial barriers, rather than geographical distance; (4) international openness is also beneficial for promoting energy and CO2 emissions performance, but cannot substitute for regional integration because of China's specialization in energy-intensive manufacturing in the global economy. Based on the empirical findings, we suggest that central government should continue to encourage regional integration given that local governments have incentives to fragment because it is a way of promoting energy and CO2 emissions performance and stimulating economy at the same time.","[Li, Jianglong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",lijianglong2014@sina.com; bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"LIU, JIALIN/JXN-8034-2024; zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023; Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X",Newhuadu Business School Research Fund; Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; Social Science Planning Project of Fujian Province [FJ2015C235],Newhuadu Business School Research Fund; Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; Social Science Planning Project of Fujian Province,"The paper is supported by the Newhuadu Business School Research Fund, the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No: 1260-Y07200), and the Social Science Planning Project of Fujian Province (No: FJ2015C235).

This paper aims at analysing the effectiveness and economic efficiency of energy saving measures implemented in the Energy Savings and Efficiency Action Plan (2008-2012) (EAP4+) in Spain for 2010. The lack of assessment related to energy savings achieved and public spending allocated by the EAP4+ justifies the need of this analysis. The results show that the transport and building sectors seem to be the most important, from the energy efficiency perspective. Although they did not reach the direct energy savings that were expected, there is scope for reduction with the appropriate energy measures. For the effectiveness indicator, the best performance are achieved by public service, agricultural and fisheries and building sectors, while in terms of energy efficiency per monetary unit, the best results are achieved by transport, industry and agriculture sectors. Authors conclude that it is necessary that central, regional and local administrations will get involved, in order to get better estimates of the energy savings achieved and thus to affect the design of future energy efficiency measures at the lowest possible cost to the citizens.","[Roman Collado, Rocio; Sanz Diaz, Maria Teresa] Univ Seville, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Econ Anal & Polit Econ, Avda Ramon y Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain; [Roman Collado, Rocio] Univ Autonoma Chile, San Miguel, Chile",University of Sevilla; Universidad Autonoma de Chile,"Collado, RR (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Econ Anal & Polit Econ, Avda Ramon y Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain.",rroman@us.es; mtsanz@us.es,"Román, Rocío/K-1240-2014; Sanz-Diaz, Teresa/F-4282-2017","Román, Rocío/0000-0001-8636-2093; Sanz-Diaz, Teresa/0000-0002-2403-8447",Andalusian Regional Government [SEJ-132]; Roger Torne Foundation through the Energy and Environmental Economics Chair at the University of Seville [1394/0103]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-56399-R]; FONDECYT of Chile's Ministry of Education [1150025],Andalusian Regional Government; Roger Torne Foundation through the Energy and Environmental Economics Chair at the University of Seville; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FONDECYT of Chile's Ministry of Education,"The authors wish to acknowledge the funding provided by the following institutions: the Andalusian Regional Government (project SEJ-132), the Roger Torne Foundation through the Energy and Environmental Economics Chair at the University of Seville (ref. 1394/0103), the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ECO2014-56399-R Project) and FONDECYT of Chile's Ministry of Education (1150025 Project).

We analyse biogas in a Danish setting where most biogas is based on manure, we use a case study with actual distances, and find that the benefits of scale in capital and operational costs dominate the diseconomies of increasing transport distances to collect manure. To boost the yield it is common to use co-substrates in the biogas production. We investigate how costs and income changes, when sugar beet is added in this case study, and demonstrate that transport cost can be critical in relation to co-substrates. Further we compare the new Danish support for upgraded biogas with the traditional support for biogas being used in Combined Heat and Power production in relation to scale economies. We argue that economies of scale is facilitated by the new regulation providing similar support to upgraded biogas fed into the natural gas grid, however in order to keep transport costs low, we suggest that the biogas plants should be allowed to use and combine as many co-substrates as possible, respecting the sustainability criteria regarding energy crops in Danish legislation.","[Skovsgaard, Lise; Jacobsen, Henrik Klinge] Tech Univ Denmark, Syst Anal Div, DTU Management Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Skovsgaard, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Syst Anal Div, DTU Management Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",lskn@dtu.dk,"Klinge Jacobsen, Henrik/C-7183-2011","Klinge Jacobsen, Henrik/0000-0002-3269-4807; Nielsen, Lise Skovsgaard/0000-0001-8562-0126",Innovation foundation under the Strategic Research in Sustainable Energy and Environment research programme [12-132631],Innovation foundation under the Strategic Research in Sustainable Energy and Environment research programme,The authors wish to thank the three anonymous reviewers for valuable insights and suggestions.

The era of globalization is replaced by de-globalization, the principles of free trade, the pressure of speculative capital, de-industrialization caused by the overflow of labor and capital from the real sector to services, in particular to the financial sector are violated. Financial markets do not pursue the goal of developing the entire economy. They are subject to the ideology of capital market liberalization, which facilitates the rapid export of capital and the regime of global governance. Economic policy is the reflection and realization of economic interests of certain groups or sectors. It is important to solve the problem of equitable distribution without which it is impossible to maintain sustainable economic growth in the long term. If we do not manage the process of resource allocation in the economy, labor and capital will flow from manufacturing to extractive, to trade intermediary, from the real sector to the financial sector. It is necessary to build economic policy at the level of macroeconomic planning. Development policy is a combination of planning and market self-organization.","[Altunyan, Armen G.; Urazgaliev, Vladimir Sh] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia; [Menshikova, Galina A.] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Sociol, Dept Social Management & Planning, Smolnogo Str 1-3,9-Th Entrance, St Petersburg 191124, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Saint Petersburg State University,"Menshikova, GA (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Sociol, Dept Social Management & Planning, Smolnogo Str 1-3,9-Th Entrance, St Petersburg 191124, Russia.",dioskuriya-box@mail.ru; uvsh54@yandex.ru; menshikova.g.a@mail.ru,"Urazgaliev, Vladimir/M-4294-2015; Urazgaliev, Vladimir/HPC-3429-2023","Urazgaliev, Vladimir/0000-0002-7794-4937",,,,,27,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,29,36,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200005,0

It is shown how the setting up of the industrial district took place and the latest version of its configuration is depicted with the presence of a local multinational (Cosentino).

Creating the policy environment to foster the scaling up of local energy infrastructure is, however, still challenging; despite national policy action and local authority interest the growth of heat networks in UK cities remains slow. Technoeconomic energy system models commonly used to inform policy are not designed to address institutional and governance barriers. We present an agent-based model of heat network development in UK cities in which policy interventions aimed at the institutional and governance barriers faced by diverse actors can be explored. Three types of project instigators are included municipal, commercial and community which have distinct decision heuristics and capabilities and follow a multi-stage development process. Scenarios of policy interventions developed in a companion modelling approach indicate that the effect of interventions differs between actors depending on their capabilities. Successful interventions account for the specific motivations and capabilities of different actors, provide a portfolio of support along the development process and recognise the important strategic role of local authorities in supporting low carbon energy infrastructure.","[Busch, Jonathan; Roelich, Katy; Bale, Catherine S.

Globalization comes along with shifting power from national governments towards multinational corporations accompanied by protests of its opponents. The international division of labour is changing due to shifts of labour-intensive production to countries with lower labour cost, such Middle European countries. However, the corporate governance, technology-intensive production and research are kept in wealthy countries. This significantly increases the development differences among countries, industrialization and employment opportunities. This article focuses on sociological, economic and social aspects of globalization and emphasizes the development of human potential and changes in working conditions and employment character. It intends to cover the employment possibilities in multinational corporations including requirements and bonuses in Czech and Slovak Republics.

This article explores the determinants of second-round voter turnout in small French towns with a focus on two hypotheses. First, an increase in the closeness of the race may lead to an increase in turnout. Second, a higher seats stake, that is, a higher proportion of the total number of seats that remain to be filled in the second round of the election, may increase turnout. Results show that increases in both closeness and seats stake lead to higher voter turnout.

In Eastern Europe, many of them protected the legacy during the socialist era and started their own business again as soon as it was possible. Family ownership can be a competitive advantage for businesses (Habbershon & Williams, 1999) if they know how to communicate it. According to researchers, the customers trust them more than public companies. People think they are honest with customers, and they prefer long-term goals because the reputation and the livelihood of the family are at stake. In the XXI. century the customers like to make connections, but impersonality is a psychological danger of the modern world. There is a growing popularity of bio and handmade products, a renaissance of farmer markets. In face to face transactions. the family members can develop a personal relationship with the customers. This can make a stronger connection with the family brand. For wineries, there are many festivals and tastings where they can show their product to the nonlocal customers and develop relationships. But not many family members can be a good brand ambassador, and it takes a lot of travel and small talk to do this. In online space, they can reach many customers. They can show or sell the products anytime for anybody. But what happens with the personal connection? How can they represent the family identity online? What kind of values do they express? How can they differentiate themselves from the competitors? Will they use the social media more to make more connections or less to protect the family privacy?

In particular, improving students' communicative skills, and their ability to establish smooth communication channels are more urgent. However, at present, the cultivation of English language talents in colleges and universities is not ideal. The number of high-quality language talents with good spoken English is far less than that of market demand.

In view of the influence that the diverse national and regional contexts of project partners has on the success of European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) projects, this article argues that a realistic evaluation of projects should consider not only the achievement of stated objectives (conformance) but also the range of dissemination activities and learning effects realized during the project (performance). Here a specific evaluation method is introduced that takes account both the conformance and the performance principles. Using the example of impact analysis of a transnational cooperation project and a cross-border cooperation project, it is shown that this evaluation method can contribute to a more suitable assessment of ETC projects.","[Knippschild, Robert; Vock, Alexander] Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, Dresden, Germany; [Knippschild, Robert] Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Vock, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, Dresden, Germany.",r.knippschild@ioer.de; a.vock@ioer.de,,"Knippschild, Robert/0000-0001-6643-7377",,,,,39,14,15,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Long run probability of default and expected loss can be estimated by various methods and has fifty-five years of history in literature. After studying literature and empirical models, the Markov chain approach was selected to accomplish lifetime probability of default modeling for Hungarian corporate debt instruments. Empirical results reveal that both discrete and continuous homogeneous Markov chain models systematically overestimate the long term corporate probability of default. However, the continuous non homogeneous Markov chain gives both intuitively and empirically appropriate probability of default trajectories.

This research proposed a theoretical cost optimization model to get the optimal flowback distribution solution for regional multi shale gas wells in a holistic perspective. Then, we used some empirical data of Marcellus Shale to do the empirical study. In addition, we compared the optimal flowback distribution solution by considering both the transportation cost and storage cost with the flowback distribution solution which only minimized the transportation cost or only minimized the storage cost.

Not only geographical but also other forms of proximity (technological, organizational and institutional) have a significant influence on the emergence of collaborations. Furthermore, the results suggest interdependences between proximity measures. Nevertheless, the analysis does not show that other forms of proximity may compensate for missing geographical proximity.

On the other hand, the risk of investing increases due to the uncertainty of future economic conditions. Therefore, it is important to know the significant factors that affect the project value. Traditional financial analysis uses a pyramidal decomposition (also known as DuPont analysis) to analyse the influence of financial indicators. Moreover, the deviation analysis quantifies the influence of changes of independent variable (financial indicators.) on the changes of dependent variable (Return on equity, Return on assets etc.). This method consists of four analyses: the method of gradual changes, the logarithmic method, the functional method and the integral method. Investment projects are traditionally quantified by net present value, but due to the global growth of corporate leverage, the adjusted net present value (ANPV) is used. It takes into account other financial effects, for example tax deductibility of interest (tax shield) and/or cost of financial distress. The aim of the paper is to describe the four methods of deviation analysis mentioned above and to derive a method for determining the factors influencing the ANPV by deviation analysis. A model example of the valuation of two comparable investment projects using an adjusted net present value is presented.","[Michalikova, Katarina Frajtova; Michalkova, Lucia] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Michalkova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",katarina.frajtova@fpedas.uniza.sk; lucia.michalkova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Michalkova, Lucia/P-6098-2015; Michalikova, Katarina Frajtova/O-8615-2015","Michalkova, Lucia/0000-0002-3072-7396; Michalikova, Katarina Frajtova/0000-0002-4550-6561",VEGA [1/0428/17],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0428/17 Creation of new paradigms of financial management at the threshold of the 21st century in conditions of the Slovak Republic.,,22,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,428,435,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200057,0

However, low angular resolution of hydro acoustic sonars is not enough for the good quality of tracking. Moreover, angular observations lead to nonlinear filtering such as Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) which usually produces estimations with unknown bias and quadratic errors. As it was mentioned long ago in a case of bearing-only observations target unobservability may take place, therefore, some special observer's motion become necessary. Other filters like the particle or unscented ones need the additional computer resources and also may produce the tracking loss. At the same time the pseudomeasurements Kalman filtering (PKF) method which transforms the estimation problem to the linear one and gives the current coordinates estimation with almost same accuracy could be modified to evaluate the moving target coordinates and velocities without bias. Since PKF gives unbiased estimate for the motion and the quadratic error it provides the good means for integration of various measurements methods such as passive (bearing-only) and active (range) metering. Using this filtering approach the good quality of target motion analysis (TMA) for randomly moving target may be achieved.","[Miller, Alexander B.; Miller, Boris M.] IITP RAS, Moscow, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences,"Miller, AB (通讯作者)，IITP RAS, Moscow, Russia.",amiller@iitp.ru; bmiller@iitp.ru,"Miller, Boris/S-3850-2018","Miller, Boris/0000-0002-9309-1129",Russian Basic Research Foundation [16-31-60049],Russian Basic Research Foundation(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"This research was conducted at the A.

In this paper, taking into account the recent findings on the movement of users over a landscape, we characterize the probability density function (pdf) of SIR under stochastic motion of communicating D2D pairs on planar fractals.

The proposed model can be further used to investigate time dependent user-centric performance metrics including the link data rate and the outage time.","[Orlov, Yurii; Zenyuk, Dmitry] Keldysh Inst Appl Math, Deparment Kinet Equat, Miusskaya Sq 4, Moscow 125047, Russia; [Orlov, Yurii; Samuylov, Andrey; Moltchanov, Dmitri; Gaidamaka, Yuliya; Samouylov, Konstantin] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, RUDN Univ, Dept Appl Probabil & Informat, Miklukho Maklaya St 6, Moscow 117198, Russia; [Samuylov, Andrey; Moltchanov, Dmitri; Andreev, Sergey] Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Korkeakoulunkatu 10, Tampere 33720, Finland; [Romashkova, Oxana] Moscow City Univ, Dept Appl Informat, 2nd Selskohoziaystvenny Pr 4, Moscow 129226, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Tampere University; Moscow City University,"Orlov, Y (通讯作者)，Keldysh Inst Appl Math, Deparment Kinet Equat, Miusskaya Sq 4, Moscow 125047, Russia.;Orlov, Y (通讯作者)，Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, RUDN Univ, Dept Appl Probabil & Informat, Miklukho Maklaya St 6, Moscow 117198, Russia.",ov3159f@yandex.ru; eldrich@yandex.ru; andrey.samuylov@tut.fi; dmitri.moltchanov@tut.fi; sergey.andreev@tut.fi; ox-rom@yandex.ru; gaydamaka_yuv@rudn.university; samuylov_ke@rudn.university,"Andreev, Sergey/AAA-9594-2020; Samuylov, Andrey/F-2739-2017; Gaidamaka, Yuliya V./E-5620-2014; Moltchanov, Dmitri/AAC-3870-2022; Moltchanov, Dmitri/J-5922-2017; Samouylov, Konstantin/E-9966-2014","Andreev, Sergey/0000-0001-8223-3665; Samuylov, Andrey/0000-0002-2087-769X; Gaidamaka, Yuliya V./0000-0003-2655-4805; Moltchanov, Dmitri/0000-0003-4007-7187; Samouylov, Konstantin/0000-0002-6368-9680","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [02.a03.21.0008]; RFBR [16-07-00766, 17-07-00845]","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation); RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR))","The publication was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (the Agreement number 02.a03.21.0008) and RFBR (projects 16-07-00766, 17-07-00845).",,14,4,4,0,3,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,726,731,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000108,0

For this purpose a questionnaire was made covering these fields and we sent to 100 companies from Spain with two or more management systems, of which it is possible to conclude that Spanish companies started to implement management systems from the year 2000 and that the management systems more implemented were ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. Although, it should be noted that only 68 companies replied to the questionnaire. The idea of writing this article emerged as a response to the gap in the literature, since, although there are many articles related to this subject, none makes an in-depth study on the way in which Spanish companies with two or more management systems have integrated such systems.","[Palacios Guillem, Maria; Blasco Torregrosa, Marta] Univ Politecn Valencia, PhD Sch, Cami Vera S7n, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Perez Bernabeu, Elena; Gisbert Soler, Victor] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat Aplicadas & Calidad, Cami Vera S7n, E-46022 Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Guillem, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, PhD Sch, Cami Vera S7n, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",mapagui1@epsa.upv.es; elenapb@eio.upv.es; vgisber@eio.upv.es; marblato@epsa.upv.es,"Perez-Bernabeu, Elena/E-3344-2018","Perez-Bernabeu, Elena/0000-0002-9221-7623",,,,,26,2,2,0,3,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-654-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,113,126,,10.7441/dokbat.2017.12,0.0,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6FF,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466528800012,0

It should make it easier to export goods and services, benefitting people and businesses in both the EU and Canada. CETA is an example of how Europe can leverage new partnerships in the world to promote an open and social economy. Of course, CETA also creates winners and losers, highly unequal distribution of benefits and costs of globalization. There is much scepticism about both globalization and trade these days - across Europe as well as in North America and elsewhere. The difficulties in getting the deal done showed that scepticism about globalization is a big global trend. However, blocking the treaty in European history would not substantially increase democracy and instead make it impossible for Europe to continue to promote its model of an open and social economy. It is now for the EU to utilise the opportunity for greater competition, trade and enhanced strategic partnerships in a manifestly globalized world.

The construction industry is undoubtedly the most changeable and far-reaching industry in the process of the expansion of VAT. Because the business model is multifaceted, the structure of the construction industry is complex as well. There are many subsidiaries, branches, divided project departments involving the longer management benefits chain. Multi-level management mode increases tax management costs and potential tax risks and the excessive burden of previous business tax; the old concept cannot disappear immediately. So the construction industry's tax risk will continue to erupt. After VAT expansion, the construction tax rate suddenly increased from 3% of the past business tax to 11% of VAT, even worse, whether the construction enterprise can obtain VAT invoices to deduct the input tax still remains to be resolved. Tax rate and invoice issues will undoubtedly bring a lot of tax-related problems to the construction industry. Fortunately, the tax policy also gives construction industry some special situations which can be taxed with a simple method including the method of contract for labor only, contract for materials and labor, the old projects (the construction project before April 30, 2016 of the commencement date of the contract), which can be applied to 3% VAT, but at this time must not deduct the input tax. This paper mainly aims at the method of contract for labor only, which can choose the simple method of tax calculation, and puts forward some tax-related planning methods to the construction enterprises after the VAT expansion, hoping to help the construction enterprises to avoid the tax reasonably.","[Peng, Shuyu] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Oxbridge Coll, Kunming 650106, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Kunming University of Science & Technology,"Peng, SY (通讯作者)，Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Oxbridge Coll, Kunming 650106, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-452-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,179.0,,,,,,235,238,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6MO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854700048,0

According to numerous statistic data, many European countries face the ever-growing extent of international migration, including irregular migration. The European Union has become one of the most important destinations for migration movements, resulting in a serious debate among Member States on migration control. Migration patterns differ widely among Member States. The changes of geopolitics and instability in the world, war in Syria and violations of human rights, other threats to human security determined the changes of migration. According to the data provided by FRONTEX (European Border and Coast Guard Agency), migratory situation has changed significantly since 2015. European countries recognized migration crisis as one of the most important issue and therefore European law-makers and policy-makers made many decisions regarding this question at the national and at the European level. It was realised that these spreading in-flows of immigrants have a strong impact on the social and political climate of host countries, which are often challenged by the growing number of immigrants and, thus, have to review their immigration politics to match them to contemporary processes of globalization. It is important to investigate the contemporary trends in international migration and to discuss current changes in the social situation and immigration politics in European countries.

The authors developed and applied a 'mixed-method' focus group approach involving 130 participants in 15 focus groups throughout Germany. This research aimed to specify participants' attitudes and preferences regarding electricity technologies and portfolios (evaluation categories); comparatively assess these preferences (technology/portfolio acceptance profiles); and identify participants' decision-making strategies and processes (decision rule typology). The evaluation basis of people's preferences comprises nine evaluation categories including, among others, trust, national and household economics, and environmental and health impacts. When assessing preferences regarding electricity technologies and portfolios, two overriding results need to be emphasized: first, that selective evaluation patterns produce unique acceptance profiles, and second, that a shift occurs from heterogeneous towards homogeneous evaluation patterns. In relation to decision rules guiding people's preference-making, the research reveals multiple mechanisms are at work when people express preferences about electricity portfolios.

Nowadays cost reduction is also getting more important as a part of the fierce competition. Logistics can really make a difference in this field. To have it as a supportive function we need to pay attention on the performance connected to it. Logistics performance has several fields and indicators and it can be measured several ways. We can hardly concentrate on the financial points and find some fields to improve, but in long term thinking it is worth to include a wider range of metrics, to pay attention on other perspectives also which can influence the processing and performance of the supply chain. Supply chain operation has several difficulties. One of the biggest issues is the bullwhip effect. As a result of the lack of communication, fear of shortage, price changes and several other obstacles the demand in different parts of the chain can highly differ from the end user's need. The bullwhip effect can increase the cost of the supply chain operation and with this the product cost will also increase. It can come out in warehousing, production, transportation etc. cost. It depends on the decisions made in the given part of the chain. At the end of the day it means that the company needs to work with higher price and it will be less competitive and lose market share. I my research I check out and example of the bullwhip effect. I introduce the theoretical background and I also show how it occurred in a real life situation.

The current global trends show the growing female representation on boards of public companies. The paper describes how the challenge of board diversity is addressed internationally. Russia is far away from such developed countries as Norway, France, Sweden, and Italy. The paper examines how female representation on Russian boards is affected by gender inequality within the country. The proposed paper will focus on the results of some studies on the role of women in corporate governance. The business case for gender diversity in the Russian boardroom has not been treated in much detail in empirical literature, which can be explained by non-transparency of many Russian companies. However, our research provides some evidence of board composition in a sample of large Russian public companies and local (regional) companies with state participation. It also evaluates this evidence in terms of the effectiveness of more diversifying boardroom in the Russian corporate governance. The paper aims at analyzing economic and financial performance of companies with women on their corporate boards; examining whether the women's representation on the corporate board contributes to company's growth and development, or it is just a tribute to `breaking the glass ceiling' trend.","[Tkachenko, Irina; Pervukhina, Irina] Ural State Univ Econ, 62-45,8 Marta Str Narodnoy Voli Str,Off 566, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia",Ural State University of Economics,"Tkachenko, I (通讯作者)，Ural State Univ Econ, 62-45,8 Marta Str Narodnoy Voli Str,Off 566, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia.",tkachenko@usue.ru; ivp@usue.ru,,"Tkachenko, Irina/0000-0003-0996-0684",,,,,19,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2682,2689,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205010,0

The results demonstrate that, for both countries, the level of development of the natural gas supply chain improved over time, although in recent years, growth in these markets has slowed down. The analysis also shows that while the focus in terms of development and growth for China is the downstream natural gas market, it is the upstream markets for the United States. The paper's analysis suggests that for China to improve growth and development of its natural gas industry, the country's policy should incentivize the development of production and transportation; the US, on the other hand, should allocate resources to the development of its pipeline distribution system.","[Dong, Kangyin; Sun, Renjin] China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Dong, Kangyin; Hochman, Gal] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Wu, Jin] TrinaSolar Co Ltd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Hochman, G (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",kangyin.dong@rutgers.edu; sunrenjin@cup.edu.cn; wujinchina@163.com; gal.hochman@rutgers.edu,"Sun, Renjin/AAF-3552-2020; Dong, Xiucheng/JOZ-2794-2023; Dong, Kangyin/O-3354-2019","Dong, Kangyin/0000-0002-5776-1498",National Social Science Foundation of China [17BGL014],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This work is sponsored by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 17BGL014).

The policies applied in the two countries, however, are not identical and differ most notably by the deadlines for receiving the subsidy. From the policy perspective, the important question is how these differences affect investment behavior in the renewable sector. This paper investigates the impact of the green certificate subsidy scheme on the value of renewable energy investments from the perspective of both Norwegian and Swedish investors based on a wind energy case study. We find that the impact of the policy is greatest when the distinctive Norwegian investment deadline is approaching, making investment optimal for the Norwegian investor for a larger range of prices. The Swedish investor, having no deadline to meet, will be more reluctant to investing. Furthermore, we find that the possibility of a collapse in the green certificate price reduces the values of the investment options. Being able to learn about the likelihood of such a price collapse leads to a small increase in the values of the options.","[Finjord, Fredrik; Hagspiel, Verena; Lavrutich, Maria; Tangen, Marius] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Lavrutich, M (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",maria.lavrutich@ntnu.no,,"Lavrutich, Maria/0000-0002-3068-0401",Research Council of Norway [268093],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),We would like to thank Knut-Harald Bakke and Stein-Erik Fleten for their valuable insights.

The main method consists of primary data collection used to determine the cost for a full range of energy efficiency measures and the calculation of primary energy consumption in the selected types of buildings. Due to decreasing energy prices in recent years and the lower price for EE measures and renewables, no significant movement of the cost-optimal measures was observed. This article primarily creates the basis for calculating the cost optimum at the national level.

This paper contributes to the literature by assessing the ex post quantitative effect that CDM projects have had on SD (employment and monetary welfare) in Peru, a country ranked among the most important CDM investment host countries worldwide. The econometric model estimates the direct and indirect effects of the CDM projects' investments on Peruvian households' monetary welfare for 2011-2015. Our results suggest that CDM investments had a slight effect on household consumption expenditure and had no effect neither on employment nor in poverty alleviation.

For facilitating charging possibilities for EVs typically two rollout strategies have been applied; demand-driven and strategic rollout. This study focuses on determining the differences in performance metrics of the two rollout strategies by first defining key performance metrics. Thereafter, the root causes of performance differences between the two rollout strategies are investigated. This study analyzes charging data of 1,007,137 transactions on 1742 different CPs by use of 53,850 unique charging cards. This research concludes that demand-driven CPs outperform strategic CPs on weekly energy transfer and connection duration, while strategic CPs outperform their demand-driven counterparts on charging time ratio. Regarding users facilitated, there is a significant change in performance after massive EV-uptake. The root cause analysis shows effects of EV uptake and user type composition on the differences in performance metrics.

However, the value of energy storage has been estimated mostly based on arbitrage benefit, and this does not reflect the true contribution of energy storage to the power system, especially when it is integrated with high levels of wind generation. This study analyzes a more complete set of contributions made by energy storage toward reducing the total cost of supplying electricity to customers. A simulation based on a stochastic form of multi-period Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF) is used to reflect the stochastic characteristics of wind resources. The results show that in addition to the arbitrage benefit, energy storage can generate an additional economic value by 1) reducing the variability of wind generation; 2) adopting more wind generation that is otherwise wasted because of high variability, and 3) lowering the peak capacity needed to meet system adequacy. Moreover, the results indicate that the benefit of energy storage is larger with higher wind generation capacity.","[Jeon, Wooyoung] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Kwangju 61186, South Korea; [Mo, Jung Youn] Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade, Sejong 30147, South Korea",Chonnam National University; Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET),"Mo, JY (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade, Sejong 30147, South Korea.",jymo@kiet.re.kr,,,,,,,19,6,7,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,101,111,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.071,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800011,0

Using a panel of 576 utility-scale wind farms between 2001 and 2012, this paper estimates the impacts of different learning mechanisms-learning through research and development in wind turbine manufacturing, learning from a wind farm operator or a turbine manufacturer's previous project experience, learning through collaboration among wind project participants, and knowledge spillovers-on technological change of wind power, measured as improved capacity factor. Empirical findings suggest that a wind farm's performance has improved over time as the project operator accumulates more experience. Moreover, its collaboration with turbine manufacturers and the transmission system operator leads to greater performance improvement, particularly when the transmission system is coordinated by an independent system operator or a regional transmission organization (ISO/RTO). This finding supports the institutional change in the US electricity market deregulation-the creation of ISO/RTOs. The ISO/RTO-govemed transmission networks promote wind power integration through regional collaboration and coordination. In addition, evidence of knowledge spillovers on wind farm operation at the state level provides justifications for state energy policies that subsidize wind power generation.","[Tang, Tian] Florida State Univ, Askew Sch Publ Adm & Policy, 659 Bellamy Bldg,113 Collegiate Loop, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Tang, T (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Askew Sch Publ Adm & Policy, 659 Bellamy Bldg,113 Collegiate Loop, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",ttang4@fsu.edu,,"Tang, Tian/0000-0003-3588-6828",Sustainability Science Program; Energy Technology Innovation Policy research group at Harvard University,Sustainability Science Program; Energy Technology Innovation Policy research group at Harvard University,"The author would like to thank Joern Huenteler and Gabriel Chan for their assistance with wind speed data and wind resource calculation.

However, reallocation of water use often generates third-party effects, or externalities, which prohibit transfers. We develop a spatial-dynamic hydro-economic model to assess the gains from redistributing water across irrigators, taking into account externalities that water use transfers may produce. Water use is optimized across space and time such that return flows in various segments of the watershed do not decrease relative to the flows obtained under current water use. Across a suite of water shortage scenarios in Idaho's Eastern Snake River Plain, the reallocation of water subject to third party externalities generates an 8-16% increase in aggregate annual profit earned by irrigators, relative to the Prior Appropriation-based allocation.

The procedure is applied to the Indonesia fuel subsidy policy as a case study. The application concentrates on the historical time period from 2011 to 2015 and attempts to retroactively forecast the evolution of prices and demand for fuel oil, and consequently the robustness of the presented fuel subsidy mechanism. The results of the quantitative analysis suggest that it is possible to construct an oil price stabilization fund that is able to minimize pump price volatility, while at the same time maintaining healthy economic as well as financial conditions. In view of the fact that the fuel subsidy mechanism presented in this paper works by replacing actual market prices with reference prices, it has a modular property, and the technical as well as the practical implementation would work equally well in a subsidy or non-subsidy environment. Hence, it is possible to extend the same approach to other countries and economies as well as to other commodities.","[Hassani, Hossein; Sattar, Mohammad; Odulaja, Adedapo] OPEC, Helferstorferstr 17, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Santoso, Wisnu Medan] PT Pertamina Persero, Jl Medan Merdeka Timur 1A, Jakarta 10110, Indonesia",,"Hassani, H (通讯作者)，OPEC, Helferstorferstr 17, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",hhasani@opec.org; msattar@opec.org; aodulaja@opec.org; wisnu.santoso@pertamina.com,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,666,673,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.012,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200061,0

Several modernization scenarios for energy policy are currently being discussed by the government and not yet concluded. The main objective of this paper is to provide a tool that allows to simulate such scenarios and to show the impact of decarbonisation on the whole economy. We propose an intertemporal hybrid general equilibrium modeling that incorporates energy technologies (bottom-up approach) directly into a macroeconomic structure (top-down approach). By accounting for wide adjustments in the economy, while controlling for all major constraints, the model gives a unique and detailed insight into the future shape of the energy sector and prospects of low carbon economy in Poland. Our simulation results suggest that there are no free lunches. No realistic energy mix allows to achieve sustainable positive economic growth when considerable emission reduction is to be achieved. The price on CO2 will exceed EUR 100 for 30% emission reduction with respect to business-as-usual scenario. Gradual phase-out of coal requires focusing on biomass technology (the first best), nuclear and wind power (the second best).","[Kiuila, Olga] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50 Str, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Kiuila, O (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50 Str, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",kiuila@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Kiuila, Olga/AAO-3699-2020","Kiuila, Olga/0000-0002-4622-0928",Polish National Science Center [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/01701],Polish National Science Center,"Financial support by the Polish National Science Center under the project #DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/01701 is gratefully acknowledged.

This article contributes to the literature by throwing light on how this process operates: as technicians of the State enterprise monopolize the knowledge, they are called on to participate in key policy decisions for the sector, and thus exert an influence that is not counter-balanced by other experts. Also, as these technicians' ethos identifies Petrobras's policy agenda with national interests, their participation in oil policymaking reinforces the enterprises dominance in the sector. This case study contributes to energy policy studies by bringing to the discussion questions addressed here on the institutionalist approach, relating particularly to bureaucratic agents' behavior and their influence as technical specialists on processes of change. It also addresses the problem of unexpected results of institutional reforms, in view of the challenges faced by governments that seek to alter regulatory frameworks. In other words, the study of a specific case of a government agency through institutional theory seeks to answer exhortations from scholars that indicate the necessity of applying institutionalist approach in the analysis of governance structures.","[Trojbicz, Beni] Univ Fed ABC, Publ Policy, Sao Bernardo Do Campo, Brazil; [Loureiro, Maria Rita] EAESP FGV, Publ Management Dept, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC); Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Trojbicz, B (通讯作者)，Univ Fed ABC, Publ Policy, Sao Bernardo Do Campo, Brazil.",btrojbicz@gmail.com,"Loureiro, Maria Rita/E-5780-2019","Loureiro, Maria Rita/0000-0003-3129-4956; Trojbicz, Beni/0000-0002-0537-8147",FAPESP; FGV/SP,FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); FGV/SP,The authors thank FAPESP and FGV/SP for their support for this research.,,28,4,4,1,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,588,595,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.060,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000053,0

Our analysis utilizes a three-dimensional dataset covering six consumer groups, 16 regions, and 1992-2015. We control for various fixed effects, and use an instrumental variable approach. Our estimates suggest that subsidy reductions since 2013 had induced savings in annual electricity use of around 7% relative to the no-reform counterfactual as of 2015. The phase-out of remaining subsidies has the potential to generate further improvements in the efficiency of electricity use, while freeing up resources for other priorities such as infrastructure spending.","[Burke, Paul J.; Kurniawati, Sandra] Australian Natl Univ, 9 Fellows Rd, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Burke, PJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, 9 Fellows Rd, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",paul.j.burke@anu.edu.au,"Burke, Paul J./G-3757-2010",,Australian Research Council [DE160100750]; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through the Australian-German Energy Transition Hub; Australian Research Council [DE160100750] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through the Australian-German Energy Transition Hub; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We are grateful for discussions with several stakeholders and research assistance from Donny Pasaribu.

Such environmental policies have major effects on the economy of emerging and developing countries whose activity is highly dependent on agricultural commodities involved in biofuel production. This paper tackles this issue by examining the price impact of biofuels on the current account for a panel of 16 developing and emerging countries, and the potential nonlinear effect exerted by the price of oil on this relationship. Relying on the estimation of panel smooth-transition regression models, we show that positive shocks in the price of biofuels lead to a current-account improvement for agricultural commodity exporters (rasp. producers) only when the price of oil is below 45 (reap. 56) US dollars per barrel. When the price of oil exceeds these thresholds, the effect of fluctuations in the price of biofuels on the current account tends to weaken and become non significant. Under these conditions, our findings indicate that, for agricultural commodity exporters which are also oil importers, the current account is pulled by two opposite forces, making its overall reaction modest or even nil.","[Gomes, Gabriel; Mignon, Valerie] Univ Paris Nanterre, Econ X CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Hache, Emmanuel] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1 & 4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Mignon, Valerie] CEPII, Paris, France; [Paris, Anthony] Univ Paris 08, LED, Univ Paris Nanterre, Econ X CNRS, 1 & 4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmalson, France; [Paris, Anthony] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1 & 4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmalson, France",IFP Energies Nouvelles; Universite Paris-VIII; IFP Energies Nouvelles,"Mignon, V (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nanterre, Econ X CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",gabriel.gomes@outlook.fr; emmanuel.hache@ifpen.fr; valerie.mignon@parisnanterre.fr; anthony.paris@ifpen.fr,", Gabriel Gomes/HSE-2721-2023; DEV, Direction Economie/C-1705-2013","HACHE, Emmanuel/0000-0002-3875-628X","French Energy Council, Paris, France","French Energy Council, Paris, France","This research has been supported by the French Energy Council, Paris, France.

The results show similar power system costs for different target levels. RES-E shares below 70% involve limited infrastructure costs that are below 2.6% of the overall system costs. The impacts of the modelled RES-E policies, an EU quota and national feed-in premiums on transmission costs are ambiguous: Contrary to expectations, the costs of transmission network development under quota obligations are lower than under technology-specific feed-in premiums for RES-E penetration levels up to 50%. The drivers of transmission costs include not only a concentration of renewable capacity, but also the exact location of RES-E capacity with respect to existing power plants and the strength of the existing infrastructure. Quota obligations lead to higher grid costs than feed-in premiums if the RES-E share amounts to 70% due to the stronger regional concentration of RES power plants.","[Held, Anne; Ragwitz, Mario; Sensfuss, Frank] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Resch, Gustav] Vienna Univ Technol, EEG, Inst Energy Syst & Elect Drives, Gusshausstr 25-29-370-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Olmos, Luis; Ramos, Andres; Rivier, Michel] Comillas Pontifcal Univ, ICAI Sch Engn, Inst Res Technol, C Santa Cruz de Marcenado 26, Madrid 28015, Spain",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Technische Universitat Wien; Comillas Pontifical University,"Held, A (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany.",anne.held@isi.fraunhofer.de,"Rivier, Michel/AAB-5207-2021; Resch, Gustav/JXN-3361-2024; Olmos, Luis/P-6924-2017; Ramos, Andres/A-6631-2014","Rivier, Michel/0000-0003-3323-3428; Resch, Gustav/0000-0001-6122-4081; Olmos, Luis/0000-0002-0088-3419; Ramos, Andres/0000-0002-8871-1872; Sensfuss, Frank/0000-0002-0630-7973; Ragwitz, Mario/0000-0001-9997-9551",,,,,29,15,15,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,112,126,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.025,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200012,0

Furthermore, the intake fraction method was adopted to assess the health benefits of reducing pollutant emissions. The results showed that energy consumption will reach 509-1284 Mtce under the different scenarios by 2050. The emissions of CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) will be 2601, 173, 3.4, 24.0, 0.94 and 0.78 Mt, respectively, under the BAU scenario in 2050. Regarding health benefits, economic losses caused by mortality will be reduced by 47, 40 and 72 billion USD in 2050 under the EEI, TMO and CP scenarios, respectively, compared to those under the MU scenario.

We find that differences between value function iteration (VFI) and other methods are economically significant and Euler equation errors fail to be a sufficient measure of accuracy in such models. VFI fails to accurately identify both the location and size of jump discontinuities, while the endogenous grid method (EGM) and the finite element method (FEM) are much better at approximating this class of models. We further show that combining VFI with a local interpolation step (VFI-INT) is sufficient to obtain accurate approximations. The combination of computational speed, relatively easy implementation and adaptability make VFI-INT especially suitable for approximating models with jump discontinuities in policy functions: while EGM is the fastest method, it is relatively complex to implement; implementation of VFI-INT is relatively straightforward and it is much faster than FEM.","[Gortz, Christoph; Mirza, Afrasiab] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Görtz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",c.g.gortz@bham.ac.uk; a.mirza@bham.ac.uk,,,British Academy,British Academy,"We thank Francesco Zanetti and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments, which significantly improved the paper.

This analysis reviews and updates several past studies to identify specific events that can be linked to oil supply shocks that remove oil production while increasing world oil prices. Using historical data, it finds that a 10% cut in world oil supplies arising from abrupt and large monthly disruptions of OPEC and Persian Gulf crude oil production correlates with a 35-43% increase in inflation-adjusted crude oil prices. The data also reveal that almost all sudden and large oil supply disruptions occurred prior to 2004, which raises some interesting issues about how to interpret the evidence from studies evaluating the impact of future oil disruptions on either prices or the economy.","[Huntington, Hillard G.] Stanford Univ, Energy Modeling Forum, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Huntington, HG (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Energy Modeling Forum, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hillh@stanford.edu,,,,,,,31,17,20,3,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,426,433,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.020,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800042,0

It discusses how current policy approaches to energy conservation have energy efficiency and individuals' behavioural change as principle target. It then argues that their limited impacts derive largely from how they are principally informed by quantitative estimates of reductions in energy inputs and neglect how qualitative changes generated in the energy outputs can either offset these reductions (e.g. more energy efficient motors can enable the production of larger cars consuming more energy) or cause higher savings (e.g. smaller cars can consume less energy even with less efficient motors). The paper also explains these limited impacts in terms of overly simplistic cause-effect relationships assumed to exist between given exogenous factors (e.g. provision of information, price signals, etc.) and individuals' behaviours. It then shows how radically alternative policies for energy conservation can target qualitative changes and re-organisations in energy outputs. In doing so, it takes social practice theories as theoretical background. Finally, it discusses the potentially very high impacts and the alternative character of policies informed by these theories and shows how and where they indicate to intervene.","[Labanca, Nicola; Bertoldi, Paolo] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Joint Res Ctr, Unit Energy Efficiency & Renewables C 02, Via E Fermi 2749, IT-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Labanca, N (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Directorate Gen Joint Res Ctr, Unit Energy Efficiency & Renewables C 02, Via E Fermi 2749, IT-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",nicola.labanca@ec.europa.eu; paolo.bertoldi@ec.europa.eu,"bertoldi, Paolo/AAT-6177-2020","Labanca, Nicola/0000-0002-5556-3981",,,,,48,62,63,2,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,494,502,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.027,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800048,0

Many EIM related to implementation of renewable energy (RE) projects are subject to disputes in Europe, including Denmark. Here, some RE projects lead to citizens forming protest groups and authorities abandoning plans. This is a significant obstacle for implementation of RE policies. This paper investigates the role of EIA, specifically the handling of social impacts, in such conflicts. The paper presents a study of cases of RE projects in Denmark, analysed using a framework based on conflict theories. It is found that social impacts of concern to residents are not properly addressed in EIAs. This constitutes a contradiction between the concerns of the public and the focus of assessments and discussions, forming part of the basis for conflict. Additionally, there is a negative perception among residents of the behaviour of authorities and proponents, which contributes to tensions and leads to mistrust and opposition. It is concluded that to mitigate conflicts over future RE projects and improve the implementation of RE policies, specific improvements can be made in the EIA content and processes.","[Larsen, Sanne Vammen; Nielsen, Helle Nedergaard] Aalborg Univ, Danish Ctr Environm Assessment, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen SV, Denmark; [Hansen, Anne Merrild] Aalborg Univ, Danish Ctr Environm Assessment, Rendsburggade 14, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University; Aalborg University,"Larsen, SV (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Danish Ctr Environm Assessment, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen SV, Denmark.",sannevl@plan.aau.dk; merrild@plan.aau.dk; helle@plan.aau.dk,"Hansen, Anne Merrild/AAH-6633-2020","Hansen, Anne Merrild/0000-0001-7889-4604",ForskEl [2016-1-12442],ForskEl,This article is based on work carried out as part of the research project EIAplus supported by ForskEl [grant number 2016-1-12442].,,36,27,29,1,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,43,53,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.002,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800005,0

This paper studies the impact of workplace charges on the adoption of two types of PEVs: battery electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in electric vehicle (PHEV). BEV users care more about the range anxiety issue. PHEV users, on the other hand, focus on the cost savings. The GPS-based longitude travel data of 143 vehicles covering 20 days to 18 months were employed in this paper. The dataset provides the detailed spatial and temporal travel information of a vehicle. With the known household locations, home-to-home tours were built for each vehicle, because home charges is usually regarded as a basic charging pattern. The detailed travel information of each vehicle was further used to help determine the workplace locations by analyzing its travel behavior over a period. Then, some home-to-home tours were broken into a series of home-to-work, work-to home and work-to-work (if applicable) tours. These tours were used for analyzing the impact of workplace charges on the adoption of BEVs and PHEVs in population, respectively, considering three different levels of charger powers, as well as different price of gasoline.","[Wu, Xing] Lamar Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 10024, Beaumont, TX 77710 USA",Texas State University System; Lamar University,"Wu, X (通讯作者)，Lamar Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 10024, Beaumont, TX 77710 USA.",xing.wu@lamar.edu,"Wu, Xing/O-6117-2016","Wu, Xing/0000-0002-0514-3292",Oak Ridge National Laboratory [237130],Oak Ridge National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),The author appreciates the comments and suggestions from three anonymous reviewers.

Energy Policy has published articles exploring CRE since 2008, including seminal pieces by Walker and Devine-Wright (2007) and Seyfang et al. (2013). CRE has proven to be a diverse field: having emerged in different contexts and having been driven by a range of motivators, it encapsulates a diversity of technological, organisational, economic and social features. Developing a working definition and delineating what can legitimately be considered CRE is difficult given its varied forms. Drawing on interviews and document analysis with 25 case studies, we analyse the influence of context and motivations through the development process to understand the diversity of forms that lay claim to the 'CRE' title. Rather than a single definition, we propose a set of conceptual tools for thinking about this nuanced field. The tools analyse what constitutes 'community' RE, enabling proponents to expose the motivations and choices layered into different enactments of CRE in policy and practice. This article contributes to developing a language and practice that can explicitly articulate what is meant by CRE, what forms of activity are pursued and why.","[Hicks, Jarra] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ison, Nicola] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Hicks, Jarra; Ison, Nicola] Community Power Agcy, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Hicks, J (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Hicks, J (通讯作者)，Community Power Agcy, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Jarra@cpagency.org.au,,,Cooperative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living,"Cooperative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme)","We are very grateful to the people and organisations that have contributed their time and insights to the reflexive processes of idea development and refinement.

One key question facing policymakers is the role of natural gas both during the transition towards, and in the achievement of, a future low-carbon energy system. Here we assess a range of possible futures for the UK, and find that gas is unlikely to act as a cost-effective 'bridge' to a decarbonised UK energy system. There is also limited scope for gas in power generation after 2030 if the UK is to meet its emission reduction targets, in the absence of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Without CCS, a 'second dash for gas' while providing short-term gains in reducing emissions, is unlikely to be the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions, and could result in stranded assets and compromise the UK's decarbonisation ambitions. In such a case, gas use in 2050 is estimated at only 10% of its 2010 level. However, with significant CCS deployment by 2050, natural gas could remain at 50-60% of the 2010 level, primarily in the industrial (including hydrogen production) and power generation sectors.","[McGlade, Christophe; Pye, Steve; Ekins, Paul] UCL, Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Bradshaw, Michael] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [McGlade, Christophe; Pye, Steve; Ekins, Paul; Bradshaw, Michael; Watson, Jim] UK Energy Res Ctr, 11 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England; [Watson, Jim] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Pye, Steve] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr, Cork, Ireland",University of London; University College London; University of Warwick; University of Sussex; University College Cork,"McGlade, C (通讯作者)，UCL, Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",christophe.mcglade@ucl.ac.uk,"Bradshaw, Michael/AAL-3664-2021","Bradshaw, Michael/0000-0001-8842-3953; Watson, Jim/0000-0001-8464-1718",UK Research Councils under EPSRC [EP/L024756/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Research Councils under EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This paper was produced as part of the research programme of the UK Energy Research Centre, supported by the UK Research Councils under EPSRC award EP/L024756/1.",,51,52,55,3,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,454,465,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.022,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500044,0

Some 86% of respondents reported their belief that shale gas exploitation causes more than three types of negative impacts, the most commonly perceived being noise, underground water contamination and geological disruption. Associated variables that were statistically significant predictors of risk perception include demographic characteristics (age, gender, education), environmental awareness level, landslide experience, awareness of past shale gas accidents, information sources, general knowledge about shale gas, and perspectives on whether negative impacts can be observed and controlled, along with trust in the central government and the petroleum company.

The state support is becoming especially significant, which effective implementation depends on efficient tools and mechanisms. Relevant issues are the creation and development of infrastructure of the state support. The aim of the article is the analysis of state support programs of small and medium-sized enterprises in modern Russian conditions. Works of the domestic and foreign scientists dealing with problems of functioning of small and medium-sized enterprises including their state support and its efficiency formed the methodological base of this research. As information base of research were used internet portals of the Russian Federation authorities. General scientific research methods were used in the data processing: the comparative analysis, synthesis, grouping, generalization. The Russian authorities and the development institutions through which the state performs its support for small and medium-sized enterprises are revealed in the article. The features of state support programs within each subject of management are researched. The main recipients of support, condition of obtaining and the amount of support are provided. The advantages and disadvantages of state support programs are revealed. Advantages are connected with the diversified nature of state support programs, the formation of a multi-channel support system. Disadvantages are connected with the presence of a set of restrictions that affect the development of Russian small and medium-sized enterprises, the lack of policy to encourage the regions and municipalities to implement their own support programs, adapted to the economic condition of the subject. The results of the analysis will allow estimating the influence of state support programs on indicators of success of small and medium-sized enterprises in Russia in further researches.","[Barhatov, Victor; Belova, Irina] Chelyabinsk State Univ, Dept Econ Ind & Markets, Chelyabinsk, Russia",Chelyabinsk State University,"Belova, I (通讯作者)，Chelyabinsk State Univ, Dept Econ Ind & Markets, Chelyabinsk, Russia.",ieo-science@csu.ru; belova@csu.ru,,,Russian Science Foundation [No14-18-02508],Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),The study was performed at the expense of a grant of the Russian Science Foundation (project No14-18-02508).,,16,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67913-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,8.0,1.0,,,,,169,181,,10.1007/978-3-319-67913-6_12,0.0,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BR9PT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679398800012,0

This paper considers the evolving debates over city-region boundaries in the United States, arguing that the two predominant perspectives (regionalism and public choice) each provide partial accounts of political fragmentation in city-regions. Regionalists and public choice theorists frame the urban question differently, leading to mismatched priorities that are ultimately self-defeating for both camps. Surmounting the conceptual impasse regarding regional boundary change will involve compromise and engagement with the communities who live there, and reflect the practical politics of specific city-regions.","[Glass, Michael R.] Univ Pittsburgh, Urban Studies Program, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Glass, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Urban Studies Program, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",glass@pitt.edu,"Glass, Michael/AAI-5455-2021","Glass, Michael/0000-0003-3522-1519",,,,,69,9,9,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Namely, the popular vote that opened up a process of the United Kingdom's disintegration from the EU has also shaken the Council Presidency structure. Presidencies are undertaken in groups of three EU Member States (MS) that form a common Trio programme and are bound to hold the helm of the Council of the EU for 18 months where each MS presides for 6 consecutive months. Estonia was planned to be the second partner in Trio 8 represented by the United Kingdom Estonia - Bulgaria, however shortly after the Brexit vote the UK has excused itself from the Presidency Trio leaving the later two 'new ' EU MSs without an experienced partner. Nevertheless, Estonia's level of preparedness and concentration marked its Presidency as successful.

We can witness it in new global markets of capital, production, service, labor, as well as in new planetary control and management structures. Global economy grows from integration process at very different levels - from households to transnational corporations. Most developed countries form the core of the global economy. How long would they dominate over others in the new era of globalization? The answer is unclear. In the last 50 years, emerging countries show significant progress. Nowadays we face another important challenge of globalization - economic migration, caused by huge difference in wellbeing. In comparison to very high dynamics of capital, goods and services in the process of globalization the dynamics of integrated labor force is rather modest. What is the reason behind that? People are not adjusted to new socio-economic reality automatically; migration is a complex social phenomenon. From this point, the experience of Great Britain in incorporating immigrants from very different origins is quite meaningful. The study is based on official statistics and recent reports of Equality and Human Rights Commission, covering the important issues of integration of non-white ethnic immigrants into the framework of European society.","[Kuvaldin, Victor B.; Moysa, Natalia, I] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow Sch Econ, Leninskiye Gory 1-61, Moscow, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Kuvaldin, VB (通讯作者)，Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow Sch Econ, Leninskiye Gory 1-61, Moscow, Russia.",kuvaldin@mse-msu.ru; moysa@mse-msu.ru,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,238,242,,,,,,5,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300031,0

This literature finds that using a larger-than-usual truncation parameter to estimate the long-run variance, combined with Kiefer-Vogelsang (2002, 2005) fixed-b critical values, can substantially reduce size distortions, at only a modest cost in (size-adjusted) power. Empirical practice, however, has not kept up. This article therefore draws on the post-Newey West/Andrews literature to make concrete recommendations for HAR inference. We derive truncation parameter rules that choose a point on the size-power tradeoff to minimize a loss function. If Newey-West tests are used, we recommend the truncation parameter rule S = 1.3T(1/2) and (nonstandard) fixed-b critical values. For tests of a single restriction, we find advantages to using the equal-weighted cosine (EWC) test, where the long run variance is estimated by projections onto Type II cosines, using = 0.4T(2/3) cosine terms; for this test, fixed-b critical values are, conveniently, t or F. We assess these rules using first an ARMA/GARCH Monte Carlo design, then a dynamic factor model design estimated using a 207 quarterly U.S. macroeconomic time series.","[Lazarus, Eben] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Lewis, Daniel J.] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Stock, James H.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stock, James H.; Watson, Mark W.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Watson, Mark W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Watson, Mark W.] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University; Princeton University,"Lazarus, E (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",elazarus@mit.edu; daniel.lewis@ny.frb.org; james_stock@harvard.edu; mwatson@princeton.edu,,"Lewis, Daniel/0009-0007-3161-3474",,,,,44,66,74,1,11,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

This paper addresses the relationship between income inequality and resilience by evaluating the vulnerability of urban counties in the United States entering recession between 2006 and 2010 and tests whether income inequality contributes to their probability of recession survival. A Cox proportional hazards model is used to determine factors contributing toward urban counties' resilience to the external shock of the Great Recession; the research is focused on the relationship between the level of income inequality in a county and its recession risk. It is found that areas with increased income inequality entered recession earlier.","[Lewin, Paul A.; Watson, Philip; Brown, Anna] Univ Idaho, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho,"Lewin, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",plewin@uidaho.edu; pwatson@uidaho.edu; brow9169@vandals.uidaho.edu,"Watson, Philip/AAW-7523-2020; Lewin, Paul A/H-5610-2012","Watson, Philip/0000-0002-0540-2370; Lewin, Paul A/0000-0002-2343-7059","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture [2015-68006-22840]; HATCH [1000150]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); HATCH(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This material is based on work supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture [award number 2015-68006-22840] and HATCH [project number 1000150].",,66,23,24,3,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Legal Undertakings for Securing Liabilities represent, from the point of view of the applicable law, the most important and also the most effective way to protect the interests of the parties to the fulfilment of the content of the contract. However, as is clear from the legal regulation, the security institute cannot exist without the main reinsurance obligation, which is in practice a contract concluded. The securing of commitments is therefore a subsidiary body performing a security and reimbursement function. In general, they can also be characterized as sanctions for non-compliance. In practice, it is also possible to seek protection of their rights by fulfilling the obligation through the work of the court. Examined legal institutions for securing liabilities are included in the Slovak legal order both in the Civil Code and in the Commercial Code, which constitute the lex generalis of civil law and commercial law.

Small economies, such as the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, play a completely different role. However, both countries are part of a larger entity, the European Union. The EU already has greater global ambitions. It is able to compete to some extent with the economies of the US, China, Japan. However, the EU as a whole, consisting of 27 states, represents a very heterogeneous economy. We can talk about advanced Germany, France, northern Italy, or the exiting UK. There are also more underdeveloped states in Central and Eastern Europe and others. If we want to predict the EU future gross domestic product, we can do so based on an EU-wide Gross Domestic Product time series. The aim of this paper is to predict the evolution of the gross domestic product of the European Union based on an analysis of the individual sectors of the EU economy. As a tool for time series alignment, artificial neural networks were used. Specifically, the classic multilayer perceptron neural networks were used. In addition, neural networks of basic radial functions were used. This type of neural network uses fuzzy logic.

Particular importance has the strategic cost management where cost monitoring and cost management are perhaps the most important prerequisites for the successful development of business entities. Business costs affect business performance, growth and market position. Business entities should be able to identify factors that influence cost management and should manage these factors as well. It is important to note that not every enterprise that achieves a positive economic result works economically. Many enterprises do not have system of cost management and control, which may be related to their economic literacy. Based on an analysis of secondary sources it was found, that small and medium-sized enterprises do not implement forward-looking cost calculations, which would be directed to targeted cost control and should be an incentive for cost-effective business utilization. The aim of the contribution is to identify the key factors of business management, especially in the area of economic literacy, which have an impact or can influence the management of the corporate costs. In addition, the article aims to identify deficiencies in the company cost management. The study proposes areas, which could be improved in cost management through the analysis of secondary sources and the results of the survey carried out among enterprises in the Czech Republic in 2017.

We address a comparatively new but increasingly important challenge to electricity markets with a uniform price zone: Renewable curtailment due to grid constraints. Our goal is to provide a model framework suitable to investigate the impact of expanding the grid operator's flexibility under varying congestion management regimes. We aim to expose the limitations of the current regime and to present a favorable alternative. For our analysis, we develop an optimal power flow program to replicate the current congestion management regime for distribution grids with high penetration of distributed generation in Germany. Furthermore, we introduce district heating as additional flexibility option and investigate the impact under different approaches to congestion management. Our results suggest that introducing additional flexibility, while keeping the current congestion management regime, bears significant risk to increase the cost of congestion management. Adjusting the regime to take into account economic criteria, as outlined in this work, eliminates this risk and grants direct control on the trade-off between curtailment and cost.","[Schermeyer, Hans; Fichtner, Wolf] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Chair Energy Econ, Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Vergara, Claudio] MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, 77 Massachusetts Ave E19-307, Cambridge, MA USA",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Schermeyer, H (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Chair Energy Econ, Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany.",hans.schermeyer@kit.edu; cvergara@mit.edu; wolf.fichtner@kit.edu,,"Fichtner, Wolf/0000-0001-6013-4674",Karlsruhe House of Young Scientists (KHYS),Karlsruhe House of Young Scientists (KHYS),"Part of the work presented here is the result of a research stay (April - August 2016) of Hans Schermeyer at the MIT Energy Initiative, which was financed partly by the Karlsruhe House of Young Scientists (KHYS).",,29,74,78,0,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,427,436,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.037,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800042,0

In the process, there are worries about the existence of traditional retailer as a result of the strengthening of modern retailer. Therefore, it is important to pay special attention to the traditional retailer to grow and evolve along with the growth and development of modern retailer, so that traditional retailer marketing can run optimally. This study aims to formulate the strategy for traditional retailer to keep sustainability concerning to the proper implementation of knowledge management through the developing of socio-entrepreneurship. This research uses SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) to measure the correlation between independent and dependent construct in term of increasing knowledge management of traditional retailer. Based on the result analysis, competitive advantage in traditional retail is affected by the choice of strategies implemented by retailer. However, the implemented strategy is not optimal because it is not supported by the implementation of a good knowledge managements, especially in terms of accessibility to knowledge and practices required in the retail business. Traditional retail are difficult to gain an access to training and mentoring on strategies and techniques to manage retail business professionally in order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. When traditional retail want a more optimal to achieve a competitive advantage, they should improve their ability in implementing the management knowledge systematically, for example, building an association of traditional retail with the main vision to organize a training program or mentoring about strategy and technique management of retail business.","[Wahyudin, Moh; Yuliando, Henry] Gadjah Mada Univ, Fac Agr Technol, Dept Agroind Technol, Jl Flora 1, Bulaksumur 55281, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University,"Wahyudin, M (通讯作者)，Gadjah Mada Univ, Fac Agr Technol, Dept Agroind Technol, Jl Flora 1, Bulaksumur 55281, Indonesia.",moh.wahyudin@ugm.ac.id,"Wahyudin, Moh./GOP-1602-2022; Yuliando, Henry/GQQ-0667-2022","Wahyudin, Moh./0000-0003-2092-7754;",,,,,12,1,1,1,5,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2413-0877,,,KNE LIFE SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,117,127,,10.18502/kls.v4i2.1663,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BL1IO,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447763100013,0

This is also true for the planning of new high-voltage overhead transmission lines. In this context, a question of interest for policy makers and energy operators is how residents react when they realize that they may be affected by future transmission lines in close proximity to their homes. This study provides evidence of how local residents respond to the announcement of transmission line corridor route alternatives (TLCRAs). By means of a natural experiment, it estimates the causal effects of spatial proximity to proposed TLCRAs during the planning phase of an energy project. The results reveal that proximity significantly enhanced residents' risk perceptions with respect to landscape deterioration, property/house value reduction, and damages to human health. We also found that increasing proximity decreased residents' support for grid expansion and increased the likelihood of performing information seeking behavior and becoming a member of a local citizens' initiative. Finally, our findings suggest that the relationship between spatial proximity and the dependent variables are appropriately modeled by a distance decay function, showing that effects attenuate with increasing distance from the infrastructure site.","[Mueller, Christoph Emanuel; Keil, Silke Inga; Bauer, Christian] German Res Inst Publ Adm, Inst Regulatory Impact Assessment & Evaluat, Freiherr vom Stein Str 2, D-67346 Speyer, Germany",,"Mueller, CE (通讯作者)，German Res Inst Publ Adm, Inst Regulatory Impact Assessment & Evaluat, Freiherr vom Stein Str 2, D-67346 Speyer, Germany.",mueller@foev-speyer.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) [50/15],German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi),The research reported in this article used data collected within the evaluation of a citizen education program about power grid expansion in Germany.

Intentional islanding enables the use of distributed energy resources (DERs) to power critical loads and accelerate grid restoration. In this study, an innovative dynamic microgrid islanding scheme was investigated as a means of enhancing distribution grid resilience. If customers in a dynamic microgrid request emergency electricity services during an outage, the question of how the distribution system operator should price the DER emergency power service arises. To answer this question, an economic load dispatch model was implemented in a single-bid auction market to forecast the market-clearing price of electricity in the dynamic microgrid island. The results show that the cost of emergency service is impacted by the power supply and demand in the island.

However, urban policymakers must operate within the constraints imposed by national energy policies. This study aims to understand the impacts of different national energy strategies on long-term urban energy systems planning through a case study for the city of Basel in Switzerland. A cost optimization modeling approach is employed and heat and electricity demand sectors are considered. Energy efficiency measures, particularly building renovations, are found to be cost optimal and enable significant energy demand reductions. Decentralized generation and storage technologies, including rooftop PV, heat pumps, small gas CHPs, and batteries, also provide pathways to reduce emissions and improve energetic self-sufficiency in the long-term. Heat generation using municipal waste provides a cost optimal, low emissions generation pathway as well. Carbon taxes are found to have a significant impact on the uptake of low-emission technologies. The urban environment encourages policymakers to pursue strategies to reduce local CO2 emissions across all national energy policy options evaluated, not only achieving, but also exceeding relative national policy targets in a cost optimal solution.","[Yazdanie, Mashael; Densing, Martin; Wokaun, Alexander] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Energy Syst Anal, Energy Econ Grp, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute,"Yazdanie, M (通讯作者)，Paul Scherrer Inst, OHSA-E03, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",mashael.yazdanie@psi.ch; martin.densing@psi.ch; alexander.wokaun@psi.ch,"Densing, Martin/K-3077-2013","Densing, Martin/0000-0003-4477-1299; Yazdanie, Mashael/0000-0003-3834-1073",Competence Center for Energy and Mobility (CCEM) [801_IDEAS4cities],Competence Center for Energy and Mobility (CCEM),The authors would like to thank the Competence Center for Energy and Mobility (CCEM) for its funding support (grant number: 801_IDEAS4cities).,,53,43,44,4,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,176,190,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.009,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800018,0

And if so, what are the key factors that influence the corresponding abnormal return to enterprises? To answer these questions, we employed an event study methodology to evaluate the stock market reaction to the CDM projects certification in China since 2005. We illuminated three sources of ambiguity in the relationship between corporate CDM initiatives and shareholder value, namely the impacts from time, CDM types, and credits of carbon emission reduction (CER). Our empirical results showed that the CDM initiatives could benefit corporate shareholder values. The expected CER credit is the main driver for the increase in shareholder value. However, we also found that the positive shareholder value effect of CDM decreases over time. In particular, industrial gas CDM projects rather than renewable energy and energy efficiency projects are preferred by shareholders; but there are no significant differences in the shareholder value effect between bilateral contracting and unilateral implementation. This paper advanced knowledge on the shareholder value effect of corporate CDM initiatives, and more generally, the impact of corporate carbon trading on financial performance of enterprises in an emerging country context.","[Zhang, Bin; Wang, Bo; Wang, Zhaohua] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kee-hung] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bin; Wang, Zhaohua] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bin; Wang, Zhaohua] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Wang, ZH (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wangzhaohua@bit.edu.cn,"Wang, Bo/AAO-8707-2021; Wang, Zhaohua/JJE-6996-2023; Wang, Zhaohua/AAP-5489-2021; Lai, Kee-hung/B-4054-2009","Wang, Bo/0000-0002-9245-1006; Lai, Kee-hung/0000-0001-9296-0882","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602502, 2016YFA0602504]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403021, 71521002, 71573016]; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [71625003]; Hong Kong Scholar Program [XJ2014002]; Humanities and Social science Fund of Ministry of Education of China [17YJC630145]; Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); Hong Kong Scholar Program; Humanities and Social science Fund of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education","This study is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Reference Nos. 2016YFA0602502, 2016YFA0602504), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Reference Nos. 71403021, 71521002, 71573016), National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Reference No. 71625003), the Hong Kong Scholar Program (Reference No. XJ2014002), Humanities and Social science Fund of Ministry of Education of China (Reference No. 17YJC630145) and Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.

This paper presents the key findings and detailed analysis from a 2014 survey of 378 standards developers and policy makers in 37 countries conducted by the International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) Strategic Advisory Group on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Sources. This survey represents the first large effort by ISO to systematically seek external input in mapping policy and standardization needs in EE and RE markets. The survey identified eight key findings, most notably a disconnect between policy makers and standards developers as a potential barrier to developing effective and relevant standards. Specific steps are described to support greater engagement of policy makers during the early stages of standards development and improve standard making outcomes. Greater dialogue and better coordination is needed among standards, as well as between standards and related policies in order to achieve this potential and to make positive contributions to the broader goals of policy cohesion.","[McKane, Aimee; Daya, Tala] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Richards, Gideon] Consulting Purpose Ltd, Media Ctr, Studio 43,4th Floor,Friendly St, Huddersfield HD1 1QA, W Yorkshire, England",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"McKane, A (通讯作者)，Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",atrockane@manage4energy.com,,,,,,,17,5,6,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,389,399,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.064,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400036,0

The analysis is based on a computable general equilibrium model with multiple households and a detailed power generation sector. It is found that using additional government revenues from higher domestic gas prices to increase the income of low- and middle-income households could improve the welfare of these households and alleviate income inequality in Russia, e.g., total private consumption of the poorest decile could increase by 3%. Nevertheless, the most efficient revenue-recycling policy would be to invest in the energy efficiency of buildings, which have the largest energy savings potential in Russia. In the long term, investing in the energy efficiency of buildings could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 240 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year and increase the welfare of low- and middle-income households, e.g., total private consumption of the poorest decile increases by 1%. It is also found that increasing the regulated domestic gas price could lead to windfall profits for non-Gazprom producers. Hence, to increase government revenues, the gas-price reform could be supplemented by an increase in the capital income tax in the gas sector.","[Orlov, Anton] Ctr Int Climate Res CICERO, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",,"Orlov, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Climate Res CICERO, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",anton.orlov@cicero.oslo.no,,"Orlov, Anton/0000-0003-3670-597X",,,,,28,11,12,0,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,590,600,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.047,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400057,0

The method was applied to conduct an empirical study using inter-provincial panel data in China from 1995 to 2012. The results highlighted three key points. First, the general rate of change in energy productivity was mainly influenced by a steady positive rate of change in technical progress, combined with a steady negative rate of change in technical efficiency. The core factors causing fluctuations in energy productivity included: a positive rate of change in the substitution of capital and energy, and a negative rate of change in the substitution of labor and energy. Second, from a geographic perspective, provinces with a high rate of change in technical progress experienced a weaker deterioration in technical efficiency. However, the rate of change in technical efficiency tends to decline as the rate of change in technical progress increases.

The amount of CO2 storage in these scenarios depends on the CO2 price and exogenously determined availability and costs of storage capacity. We analyze investment in CCS in more detail by taking the opportunity costs of CO2 storage into account, assuming that CO2 injection and resource extraction are mutually exclusive. Using real option valuation, we study the impact of i) correlation between gas and CO2 prices, volatility of CO2 prices, and regulatory deadlines on the value of the option to invest in CCS. We find that the value of the option to exchange gas production for CO2 injection is decreasing in the correlation of gas and CO2 prices, but increasing in the volatility of CO2 prices, and in shorter regulatory deadlines for removal of gas production facilities. This implies that next to consistent and high pricing of CO2, extending the deadline for removal of gas production facilities could increase the incentive to invest in CO2 storage in mature gas fields. We argue that considering these dynamics in mitigation scenarios could lead to more realistic projections of CCS application.","[Hauck, Dominic] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies TVM, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hof, Andries F.] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 30314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands; [Hof, Andries F.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Utrecht University,"Hauck, D (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies TVM, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Hauck.dominic@gmail.com; andries.hof@pbl.nl,"Hof, Andries/AFB-4199-2022","Hof, Andries/0000-0002-7568-5038",,,,,24,8,8,2,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,322,329,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.002,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800032,0

We find that participants both value reducing carbon emissions and expect that others support reductions. The results have implications for non-monetary strategies for affecting household energy consumption. In particular, they suggest that it may be possible to harness the power of social norms not only to directly affect household electricity consumption, but also to shift time of use in ways that facilitate increased incorporation of renewable sources of electricity generation, and therefore a reduced carbon footprint for the grid.","[Horne, Christine; Kennedy, Emily Huddart] Washington State Univ, Dept Sociol, 204 Wilson Short Hall, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Horne, C (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Dept Sociol, 204 Wilson Short Hall, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",chorne@wsu.edu; emily.kennedy@wsu.edu,,"Huddart Kennedy, Emily/0000-0002-6723-4210",Washington State University Energy Systems Innovation Center (ESIC) [2320-9863]; National Science Foundation [1441357]; Directorate For Engineering; Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities [1441357] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Washington State University Energy Systems Innovation Center (ESIC); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),This work was supported by grants from the Washington State University Energy Systems Innovation Center (ESIC) #2320-9863 and by the National Science Foundation #1441357.,,70,32,36,4,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,43,52,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.029,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200005,0

Energy statistics of high quality, systematically compiled and effectively disseminated, not only support governments to ensure national security and evaluate energy policies, but they also guide investment decisions in both the private and public sectors. Because of energy's close link to greenhouse gas emissions, energy data has a particularly important role in assessing emissions and strategies to reduce emissions. In this study, energy data management in four countries - Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States - are examined from both organizational and operational perspectives. With insights from these best practices, we present a framework for the evaluation of national energy data management systems. It can be used by national statistics compilers to assess their chosen model and to identify areas for improvement. We then use India as a test case for this framework to assess how India may adapt and evolve its energy data management systems.

We develop simple methods to translate different policy types including incentives, infrastructure deployment and supply mandates into 2040 market share points based on policy stringency and duration. To aid in the communication of this analysis, we assign an overall letter grade (A, B, C, D or F) to a given region based on the suite of policies in place. We apply this framework to Canada's 10 provinces based on policies in place in November 2016. Seven provinces have enacted little or no effective policies and are assigned F and D grades. Three provinces demonstrate greater policy effort (British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec), though only one is on track to achieve a B- grade (Quebec). Our framework provides an accessible tool for policymakers to assess the effectiveness of different PEV-supportive policy packages, and our application identifies uncertainties that can be better understood through further research.","[Melton, Noel] Navius Res Inc, Box 48300 Bentall, Vancouver, BC V7X 1A1, Canada; [Melton, Noel; Axsen, Jonn; Goldberg, Suzanne] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, START, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Melton, N (通讯作者)，Navius Res Inc, Box 48300 Bentall, Vancouver, BC V7X 1A1, Canada.",nkmelton@gmail.com,,,Metcalf Foundation; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [890-2011-0143],Metcalf Foundation; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was funded by the Metcalf Foundation and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (890-2011-0143).

The approach allows us to isolate the growth contributions of changes in regional touristic attractiveness from those induced by the structure of visitors, but does not share the caveats of the conventional shift-share approach. Our application to regional tourism in Austria reveals important results: First, differences in long-run performance between regions are mostly related to idiosyncratic changes in the tourist appeal of individual regions rather than a result of more or less favorable structures of visitors. Second, none of several mega-events during the period observed seem to have left prolonged positive effects on the tourist performance of the host regions. And third, performance appears uncorrelated with tourism intensity of a region. Thus, from a policy and destination management perspective, tourism authorities and local suppliers should mainly focus on upgrading the permanent destination attractiveness rather than investing too much effort into landing mega-events or targeting the visitor mix toward promising source markets.","[Firgo, Matthias; Fritz, Oliver] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Fritz, O (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",matthias.firgo@wifo.ac.at; oliver.fritz@wifo.ac.at,,"Firgo, Matthias/0000-0003-3978-3009",,,,,42,13,16,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Regional Studies. Research on the relevance of amenities for urban wages, jobs or housing prices has mainly focused on the case of US cities. In many (European) countries, the labour and housing markets function, however, rather differently than in the case of the United States. As a result, amenities may affect urban labour or housing markets differently. In addition, in European countries the proximity of cities is such that spatial interdependencies between cities have to be taken into account as well. By using a very rich dataset, this paper analyses the relationship between urban amenities, agglomeration and housing prices for the case of a highly urbanized European country, the Netherlands. It finds that Dutch cities that combine a favourable job location with a variety of urban amenities have significantly higher housing prices. Relatively safe cities, offering a variety of history and cultural events, as well as good restaurants, also have significantly higher housing prices.","[Garretsen, Harry; Marlet, Gerard] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Marlet, Gerard] Utrecht Sch Econ, Atlas Gemeenten, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Utrecht University,"Marlet, G (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands.;Marlet, G (通讯作者)，Utrecht Sch Econ, Atlas Gemeenten, Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.h.garretsen@rug.nl; marlet@atlasvoorgemeenten.nl,,,,,,,39,27,30,9,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Our cash flow models resemble the cash flow of buy-back service contracts before the Iranian government changed the way it determined the capital cost ceiling and pre-defined the oil price in these contracts in 2008-2009. Our actual and contractual cash flow models reveal that Shell Exploration's actual ROR was much lower than the contractual level. Furthermore, we find that among the risk factors that we considered, a capital cost overrun has the greatest negative effect on the IOC's ROR. Moreover, we show that there is a potential for modifying the contracts in order for the IOC to face an actual ROR closer to the contractual ROR even if the contract faces cost overrun or delay, without exceeding the maximum contractual ROR that the National Iranian Oil Company is willing to give.","[Ghandi, Abbas] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lawell, C. -Y.

The paper undertakes a systematic literature review to find the status of review of the promising Act. More than a decade has passed since its enactment and amendments are due with the legislative body of India but none of the literature reviewed gives a comprehensive view encompassing all the objectives of the Act. Moreover, these documents study either the probable impact or the impact on a particular segment only. It has important implications for the Power sector which highlights a significant gap in literature and provides a basis on which future research can be built upon.","[Mukherjee, Shilpi] UPES, Dept Power Management CoMES, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Dhingra, Tarun] UPES, Dept Strateg Management CoMES, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Sengupta, Anirban] UPES, CoMES, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India",University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES); University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES); University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES),"Dhingra, T (通讯作者)，UPES, Dept Strateg Management CoMES, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.",shilpi.mjee@gmail.com; replytarun@gmail.com; asengupta@ddn.upes.ac.in,"Dhingra, Tarun/JBS-0037-2023","Mukherjee, Shilpi/0000-0002-6559-5645",,,,,42,17,18,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,237,248,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.001,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200024,0

Such claim, if accurate, would call into question many energy investment decisions. In the same paper, a comparison is also drawn between PV and nuclear electricity. We have carefully analysed this paper, and found methodological inconsistencies and calculation errors that, in combination, render its conclusions not scientifically sound. Ferroni and Hopkirk adopt 'extended' boundaries for their analysis of PV without acknowledging that such choice of boundaries makes their results incompatible with those for all other technologies that have been analysed using more conventional boundaries, including nuclear energy with which the authors engage in multiple inconsistent comparisons. In addition, they use out-dated information, make invalid assumptions on PV specifications and other key parameters, and conduct calculation errors, including double counting. We herein provide revised EROI calculations for PV electricity in Switzerland, adopting both conventional and 'extended' system boundaries, to contrast with their results, which points to an order-of-magnitude underestimate of the EROI of PV in Switzerland by Ferroni and Hopkirk.","[Raugei, Marco] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Math Sci, Oxford, England; [Raugei, Marco; Fthenakis, Vasilis] Columbia Univ, Ctr Life Cycle Anal, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Sgouridis, Sgouris] Masdar Inst, Dept Engn Syst & Management, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Murphy, David] St Lawrence Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Canton, NY 13617 USA; [Fthenakis, Vasilis] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Natl Photovolta Environm Res Ctr, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Frischknecht, Rolf; Stolz, Philippe] Treeze, Uster, Switzerland; [Breyer, Christian] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Energy Syst, Lappeenranta, Finland; [Bardi, Ugo] Univ Florence, Dept Chem, Florence, Italy; [Barnhart, Charles] Western Washington Univ, Huxley Coll Environm, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Barnhart, Charles] Western Washington Univ, Inst Energy Studies, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Buckley, Alastair] Univ Sheffield, Dept Phys & Astron, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Carbajales-Dale, Michael] Clemson Univ, Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Clemson, SC USA; [Csala, Denes] Univ Lancaster, Dept Engn, Lancaster, England; [de Wild-Scholten, Mariska] SmartGreenScans, Groet, Netherlands; [Heath, Garvin] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Strateg Energy Anal Ctr, Golden, CO USA; [Heath, Garvin] Univ Colorado, Dept Mech Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Jaeger-Waldau, Arnulf] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Brussels, Belgium; [Jones, Christopher] Univ Manchester, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Keller, Arthur] Nouvelle Donne, Paris, France; [Leccisi, Enrica] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Sci & Technol, Naples, Italy; [Mancarella, Pierluigi] Univ Manchester, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Pearsall, Nicola] Northumbria Univ, Dept Math Phys & Elect Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Siegel, Adam] Insight Anal, Washington, DC USA; [Sinke, Wim] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Phys, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Oxford Brookes University; Columbia University; Khalifa University of Science & Technology; Saint Lawrence University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; University of Florence; Western Washington University; Western Washington University; University of Sheffield; Clemson University; Lancaster University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; European Commission Joint Research Centre; University of Manchester; Parthenope University Naples; University of Manchester; Northumbria University; University of Amsterdam,"Raugei, M (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Math Sci, Oxford, England.;Raugei, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Ctr Life Cycle Anal, New York, NY 10027 USA.",marco.raugei@brookes.ac.uk,"Jäger-Waldau, Arnulf/H-8692-2019; Csala, Dénes/A-1478-2017; Bardi, Ugo/L-1978-2015; Leccisi, Enrica/AAD-4624-2019; Carbajales-Dale, Michael/I-7914-2015; Raugei, Marco/N-4737-2015; Sgouridis, Sgouris/K-3009-2019; Breyer, Christian/W-2106-2018; Carbajales-Dale, Michael/G-1308-2013","Jäger-Waldau, Arnulf/0000-0003-3942-4137; Csala, Dénes/0000-0001-7450-5739; Leccisi, Enrica/0000-0002-4166-8555; Raugei, Marco/0000-0001-5026-8556; Sgouridis, Sgouris/0000-0002-4241-3765; Frischknecht, Rolf/0000-0001-6376-0355; Heath, Garvin/0000-0001-6010-4475; Breyer, Christian/0000-0002-7380-1816; Mancarella, Pierluigi/0000-0002-9247-1402; Carbajales-Dale, Michael/0000-0002-1568-384X; Stolz, Philippe/0000-0003-2647-3159; de Wild-Scholten, Mariska/0000-0003-3238-6721",,,,,52,45,46,2,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,377,384,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.042,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200035,0

Denmark is renowned for its pioneering use of wind energy, Finland and Sweden bioenergy, Norway hydroelectricity and Iceland geothermal energy. All countries aim to be virtually fossil free by 2050. This study explores the Nordic energy transition through the lens of three interconnected research questions: How are they doing it? What challenges exist? And what broader lessons result for energy policy? The study firstly investigates the pathways necessary for these five countries to achieve their low-carbon goals. It argues that a concerted effort must be made to (1) promote decentralized and renewable forms of electricity supply; (2) shift to more sustainable forms of transport; (3) further improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings; and (4) adopt carbon capture and storage technologies for industry. However, the section that follows emphasizes some of the empirical barriers the Nordic transition must confront, namely political contestation, technological contingency, and social justice and recognition concerns. The study concludes with implications for what such historical progress, and future transition pathways, mean for both energy researchers and energy planners.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Business & Social Sci, Birk Centerpark 15, DK-7400 Aarhus, Denmark; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business & Econ, Sch Management & Econ, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",Aarhus University; University of Sussex,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Business & Social Sci, Birk Centerpark 15, DK-7400 Aarhus, Denmark.",BenjaminSo@hih.au.dk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant [EP/K011790/1]; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant [4182-00033B]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The author is appreciative to the Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1 and the Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant 4182-00033B, which have supported elements of the work reported here.

Based on earlier literature, various regional factors could affect firms' profitability in urban areas in comparison to periphery during a major export demand shock, such as what the GR was in Finland. Yet, there are both negative and positive location specific factors in play. We use micro-data from 2005 to 2010, and employ different profitability indicators and fixed effects panel regressions. Our results indicate that firm and sector level factors affected the profitability changes the most. Regional differences seem to stem mainly from a composition of firm and sector level factors. Resumen Se analizan los efectos de la Gran Recesion (GR) en la rentabilidad de empresas ubicadas en las ciudades principales de Finlandia, en comparacion con el resto.

Sin embargo, entran en juego factores especificos de localizacion tanto negativos como positivos. El estudio empleo microdatos de 2005 a 2010, e hizo uso de diferentes indicadores de rentabilidad y regresiones de panel de efectos fijos.

Our findings suggest that post-crisis growth is faster for trade in goods further downstream of the value chain and thus closer to the final consumer. Trade recovery at the firm-level does not crucially hinge on locational factors such as the province in which a firm is located or regional revealed comparative advantages in particular product groups.

It develops and applies a framework for analyzing low-carbon electricity transitions based on interplay of techno-economic, political and socio-technical processes. We explain why in the 1970s-1980s, the energy paths of the two countries were remarkably similar, but since the 1990s Germany has become a leader in renewables while phasing out nuclear energy, whereas Japan has deployed less renewables while becoming a leader in nuclear power. We link these differences to the faster growth of electricity demand and energy insecurity in Japan, the easier diffusion of onshore wind power technology and the weakening of the nuclear power regime induced by stagnation and competition from coal and renewables in Germany. We show how these changes involve the interplay of five distinct mechanisms which may also play a role in other energy transitions.","[Cherp, Aleh; Vinichenko, Vadim; Antal, Miklos] Cent European Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Nador U 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Cherp, Aleh] Lund Univ, Int Inst Ind Environm Econ, Tegnerplatsen 4, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Jewell, Jessica] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Energy Program, Schlosspl 1, Laxenburg, Austria; [Suzuki, Masahiro] Inst Global Environm Strategies, 2108-11 Kamiyamaguchi, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [Antal, Miklos] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Inst Empir Studies, Dept Social Res Methodol, Pazmany Peter Setany 1, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",Central European University; Lund University; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Eotvos Lorand University,"Cherp, A (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Nador U 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.;Cherp, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Int Inst Ind Environm Econ, Tegnerplatsen 4, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",cherpa@ceu.edu; vinichenko@gmail.com; jewell@iiasa.ac.at; masahiro.suzuki@mespom.eu; antalmi@gmail.com,"Cherp, Aleh/I-7917-2012; Antal, Miklos/I-6328-2017","Cherp, Aleh/0000-0002-9299-9792; Jewell, Jessica/0000-0003-2846-9081; Antal, Miklos/0000-0003-3426-9916; Suzuki, Masahiro/0000-0002-3720-7377",Central European University's Intellectual Theme Initiative; European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme [642147],Central European University's Intellectual Theme Initiative; European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)Horizon Europe Research Infrastructures),The research reported in this paper was supported by Central European University's Intellectual Theme Initiative and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 642147 (CD-LINKS).

This can be concluded from a review of the Comprehensive Assessments on the energy efficiency potential in the heating and cooling sector performed by European Union Member States under Art. 14 of the Energy Efficiency Directive. This article estimates the potential space cooling demands in the residential sector of the EU and the resulting impact on electricity generation and supply systems using the United States as a proxy. A georeferenced approach was used to establish the potential residential space cooling demand in NUTS-3 regions of EU. The total potential space cooling demand of the EU was estimated to be 292 TW h for the residential sector in an average year. The additional electrical capacity needed was estimated to 79 GW. With proper energy system development strategies, e.g. matching capacity of solar PV with cooling demand, or introduction of district cooling, the stresses on electricity system from increasing cooling demand can be mitigated. The estimated potential of space cooling demand, identified in this paper for all EU Members States, could be used while preparing the next iteration of EU MS Comprehensive Assessments or other energy related studies.","[Jakubcionis, Mindaugas; Carlsson, Johan] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Energy & Transport, POB 2, NL-1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Energy & Transport (IET),"Jakubcionis, M (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Energy & Transport, POB 2, NL-1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands.",mindaugas.jakubcionis@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,26,71,74,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,225,235,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.047,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800022,0

For the estimation, we used a Type II Tobit model with firm-level survey data for 430 firms, and considered factors affecting the outage cost such as outage duration, average annual sales, and average monthly electricity consumption, among others. In addition, we analyzed the effect of the preannouncement of a rolling blackout on outage cost savings, and also examined the value of an emergency generator. From the estimation results, we found that the estimated outage cost is 1.24-1.3 times greater than the simple value of lost load (VoLL), and this difference increases when companies have emergency generator. The commercial and public service sector can reduce the outage cost the most compared to other sectors when a preannouncement is provided, and operating emergency generators can lower the outage cost in these sectors. Finally, we confirm that South Korea's rolling blackout in the predetermined order by the industry is appropriate to minimize the outage costs for the national economy when the outage is preannounced, but is not appropriate when there is no preannouncement.","[Kim, Kayoung; Cho, Youngsang] Yonsei Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Cho, Y (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",kytkim@yonsei.ac.kr; y.cho@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A2A01010922],"Ministry of Education of Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",Funding: This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2015S1A5A2A01010922).,,32,25,26,2,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,236,245,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.048,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800023,0

Policy targets to achieve decarbonisation goals for national energy systems will therefore impact levels of air pollution. Advantages can be gained from considering these co-impacts when analysing technology transition scenarios in order to avoid tension between climate change and air quality policies. We incorporated non-GHG air pollution into a bottom-up, technoeconomic energy systems model that is at the core of UK decarbonisation policy development. We then used this model to assess the co-impacts of decarbonisation on other types of air pollution and evaluated the extent to which transition pathways would be altered if these other pollutants were considered. In a scenario where the UK meets its existing decarbonisation targets to 2050, including the costs of non-GHG air pollution led to a 40% and 45% decrease in PM10 and PM2.5 pollution (respectively) between 2010 and 2050 due to changes in technology choice in residential heating. Conversely, limited change in the pollution profile for transportation were observed, suggesting that other policy strategies will be necessary to reduce pollution from transport.","[Lott, Melissa C.; Dodds, Paul E.] UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Pye, Steve; Dodds, Paul E.] UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Lott, MC (通讯作者)，UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",Melissa.Lott.13@ucl.ac.uk; s.pye@ucl.ac.uk; p.dodds@ucl.ac.uk,"Dodds, Paul/AAA-3294-2022","Dodds, Paul/0000-0003-1476-1137","UK Department of Energy and Climate Change; UK Energy Research Centre [NE/G007748/1]; wholeSEM [EP/K039326/1]; Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Supergen Hub [EP/J016454/1]; UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources - BHP Billiton; RCUK Energy Programme; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1, EP/P022405/1, EP/K011839/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1, EP/K011839/1, EP/P022405/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Department of Energy and Climate Change; UK Energy Research Centre; wholeSEM; Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Supergen Hub; UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources - BHP Billiton; RCUK Energy Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of Birgit Fais (formerly UCL) and their colleagues from Aether - in particular Melanie Hobson, Richard Claxton, Christofer Ahlgren.

This new regulation started with offering subsidies at a national level and this was later followed by local subsidies in addition to the national one. Being a large country, China has rdgions with good solar exposure and others with poor exposure. Each region has a different electricity price and the energy is purchased based on the Grid Coal Power electricity price that also varies throughout the country. In this work we analyze the economic profitability of different regions considering the solar radiation levels, savings in self-consumption, cash flows from injecting power into the grid and local prices for installations to show that the best return is obtained in the places with better solar radiation or where the electricity price is higher. The regional Feed-In tariffs help to compensate for lower radiation levels but do not make these regions very attractive from an investment perspective.","[Rodrigues, Sandy; Morgado-Dias, F.] Univ Madeira, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Sandy; Morgado-Dias, F.] Madeira Interact Technol Inst, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal; [Chen, Xiaoju] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Universidade da Madeira; Carnegie Mellon University,"Morgado-Dias, F (通讯作者)，Univ Madeira, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal.;Morgado-Dias, F (通讯作者)，Madeira Interact Technol Inst, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal.",sandy.carmo@m-iti.org; xiaojuc@cmu.edu; morgado@uma.pt,"Chen, Xiaoju/Q-2025-2017; Morgado-Dias, Fernando/J-7770-2012; Rodrigues, Sandy/F-1399-2015","Chen, Xiaoju/0000-0002-9974-2447; Morgado-Dias, Fernando/0000-0001-7334-3993; Rodrigues, Sandy/0000-0003-1989-4852",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PEst-OE/EEI/LA0009/2011]; Program+Conhecimento II: Incentive System to Research and Technological Development and Innovation of Madeira Region II [MADFDR-01-0190-FEDER-000015],Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Program+Conhecimento II: Incentive System to Research and Technological Development and Innovation of Madeira Region II,"The authors would like to acknowledge the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology for their support through project PEst-OE/EEI/LA0009/2011.; Also acknowledged is the Funding Program+Conhecimento II: Incentive System to Research and Technological Development and Innovation of Madeira Region II, through the project SmartSolar MADFDR-01-0190-FEDER-000015.",,33,57,59,1,47,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,467,472,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.039,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800046,0

The information provided by either the road itself or the activities on the road can help to void common issues such as broadcast storms, hidden node problems and lost data caused by an increase in road traffic density or sparse road traffic respectively. Routing protocols must therefore be able to dynamically adjust to the current road traffic information.

The goals of the river restoration in terms of ecosystem services are identified, as are the valuation methods used. More than two-thirds of the 38 river restorations reviewed sought to restore and protect fish populations, including in many cases threatened or endangered species. River restorations were also frequently undertaken to improve wildlife habitat, and water quality for boating. In terms of the use of non-market valuations in decision making, six of 38 restorations reviewed involved benefit-cost analyses or environmental assessments or equivalent decision documents. While both revealed preference and stated preference methods were used for valuing river restorations, the majority of restoration valuations (27 out of 38, about 70%) utilized stated preference methods such as the contingent valuation method (CVM) and choice experiments (CE). Annual willingness-to-pay per household estimated from the stated preference methods appear logically and positively related to the miles of river restored demonstrating weak scope.","[Bergstrom, John C.] Univ Georgia, Publ Policy, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bergstrom, John C.] Univ Georgia, Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Loomis, John B.] Colorado State Univ, Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Colorado State University,"Bergstrom, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Publ Policy, Athens, GA 30602 USA.;Bergstrom, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jberg@uga.edu,,,U.S. Department of Agriculture Regional Research through Colorado State University and University of Georgia Agricultural Experiment Stations [W-3133],U.S. Department of Agriculture Regional Research through Colorado State University and University of Georgia Agricultural Experiment Stations,Support for this research was provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Regional Research Project W-3133 (Benefits and Costs of Natural Resources Policies Affecting Ecosystem Services on Public and Private Lands) through the Colorado State University and University of Georgia Agricultural Experiment Stations.,,49,43,48,3,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4284,,,WATER RESOUR ECON,Water Resour.

FDI is conducive to technology transfer and constitutes a significant source of capital for host economies. Additionally, it contributes to job creation. Affecting the scale of connections between particular national economies and the world economy, FDI determines, to a significant extent, the degree of their globalization and makes an impact on trade volumes between particular countries. Hence, it contributes to the increased competitiveness of national economies. The significance of FDI in the globalization process is also connected with a substantial share in its flows of transnational corporations. The paper attempts to evaluate the degree of globalization measured with the share of the V4 group countries in the FDI international flows compared to the EU-28. The analysis uses the FDI share of particular actors in the world FDI flows. The FDI share in the GDP of particular countries, and the range of investment diversification by a country of origin and a host country. The analysis conducted as part of the study confirms a growing degree of globalization of the countries under examination as well as the differences in globalization levels that put the Visegrad Group countries at a disadvantage. In terms of FDI dispersion, similar trends can be observed in the EU-28 and the V-4. It was noted that a substantial percentage of investment (outward and inward) was concentrated in several countries, mostly EU member states. This points to the significance of integration within the EU for the investment decisions of its members.","[Czech, Katarzyna; Fronczek, Malgorzata] Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Czech, K; Fronczek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",katarzyna.czech@uekat.pl; malgorzata.fronczek@ue.katowice.pl,"Czech, Katarzyna/HNI-9110-2023; Fronczek, Malgorzata/W-1554-2018","Fronczek, Malgorzata/0000-0002-1502-1168",,,,,23,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,307,314,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200041,0

Regional Studies. A city's core and suburban property tax differentials can affect sprawl within an urban area. This paper empirically addresses this issue by analyzing the pattern of density growth of 72 Italian functional urbanized areas. Results show that the density of an urban area declines in response to an increase in the city's core property tax rate. This effect is due to changes in dwelling size. By contrast, the density of an urban area significantly rises when suburban property tax rates increase, making the urban area more compact. This effect is attributable to changes in the improvement effect of property taxation.","[Ermini, Barbara] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Ancona, Italy; [Santolini, Raffaella] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Marche Polytechnic University,"Santolini, R (通讯作者)，Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Ancona, Italy.",b.ermini@univpm.it; r.santolini@univpm.it,"Santolini, Raffaella/AFV-2513-2022; Ermini, Barbara/AAJ-4047-2021","ERMINI, Barbara/0000-0002-2983-8785; SANTOLINI, Raffaella/0000-0001-5307-5653",,,,,34,11,11,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Its production resulted in greater investment in new technologies, including the production of artificial refrigeration, which led to a marked increase in fixed costs. This meant, on the one hand, external financing requirements. Furthermore, it encouraged the development of partnership strategies due to overproduction. Finally, launched mergers appeared, motivated by the emergence of economies of scale and leading to the formation of an oligopoly in 1910. These strategies, used to consolidate a new structure in the Barcelona brewing industry, have many points in common with the principles of big business enunciated by Chandler.","[Garcia Barber, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Barber, XG (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,7,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Problems of increasing the level of competitiveness of transition economies, which undoubtedly the economies of the V4 countries belong to, have long been of interest to the authors of this article (Gregova & Dengov, 2015). All four countries had approximately identical starting conditions. In each of them systematic economic reforms were implemented, accompanied by quantitative and qualitative changes in the transition from a centralized planned economy to a market one. At this stage it is important to estimate a condition of a business environment of the V4 countries, to compare them among themselves, to determine who and how successfully advanced in solving this task, and who is in the lagging behind. The authors compared quality of a business environment of the Visegrad Group countries on the basis of use of a global competitiveness index. As a result, on the basis of the analysis which was carried out with use of three world indexes of competitiveness: GCI, DB and an index of economic freedom, the authors came to a conclusion that the Czech Republic which showed the best result on two of three indicators achieved the greatest success in creation of a business environment, favorable for the competition. After it there are Poland and Slovakia which are a little yielding to it. The least competitiveness in the V4 group was shown by Hungary, which was the last in all selected indicators.","[Gregova, Elena] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Novikov, Andrey V.] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia",University of Zilina; Saint Petersburg State University,"Novikov, AV (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia.",elena.gregova@fpedas.uniza.sk; a-novikov08@mail.ru,"Gregova, Elena/P-1820-2015",,,,,,15,2,2,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,549,556,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201006,0

Tax benefits are understood as an element that affects the value of a company in connection with the effect of a tax shield. The problem is important in connection with the possibility of choice of territorial allocation and territorial allocation of production. The issue of tax benefits interception has become the subject of close observation and survey by state authorities, which implemented clauses against the tax avoidance in many countries. Corporations operating on global markets in their tax strategies use tax competition between countries. In many countries this competition leads to race down in terms of tax rates. This action encourages companies to allocate sales precisely in these countries. The article shows how company called Zara used tax competition for territorial sales allocation (taxation of income). It is becoming increasingly important to exploration how clothing industry companies have used the processes of globalization to shape the tax burden.","[Kozub-Skalska, Sonia] Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Kozub-Skalska, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland.",sonia.kozub.skalska@edu.uekat.pl,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1129,1135,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202012,0

Social networks can be characterized as usage of Internet-based social media programs to create new contacts and connect with friends, classmates, customers or clients (whether existing or potential). These networks can be used for various reasons, but most often, they are social and business reasons. The social networks are associated with concepts of engagement or interaction now, so social networks are the target area of marketers trying to capture potential customers and to take care existing customers. The main objective of this article is to point out the importance of social networking by companies to acquire new and maintain existing customers in a specific environment of a company doing business in Portugal. The company has an international network of customers and its social networking activity is key to its financial health. In the analytical part of article the various types of social networks (blogs, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram) are analysed as a typical platform for communication of the Internet community in Portugal. Based on the correlation analysis methods, the importance of using Facebook's social network to generate traffic on websites and, consequently business leads will be highlighted. Finally, the model of engagement of this type of enterprise on social networks will be outlined.","[Madlenak, Radovan; Madlenakova, Lucia] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Drozdziel, Pawel] Lublin Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, 36 Nadbystrzycka Str, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland",University of Zilina; Lublin University of Technology,"Madlenák, R (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",radovan.madlenak@fpedas.uniza.sk; lucia.madlenakova@fpedas.uniza.sk; p.drozdziel@pollub.pl,"Madlenakova, Lucia/P-9180-2016; Madlenak, Radovan/A-5369-2011; Droździel, Paweł G/A-5467-2013","Madlenakova, Lucia/0000-0002-0518-0325; Madlenak, Radovan/0000-0002-4376-0830; Droździel, Paweł G/0000-0003-2187-1633",project VEGA [1/0515/15],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This work was supported by project VEGA 1/0515/15 Endogenous factors of the IPR intensive Industries in the regional enterprise environment in Slovak Republic,,20,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1404,1411,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202045,0

AP is a tool for symbolic regression tasks which enables to synthesise an analytical solution based on the required behaviour of the system. Some tasks do not need any constant estimation - AP is used in its basic version without any constant estimation handling. Compared to this, cases like data approximation need constants (coefficients) which are essential for the process of precise solution synthesis. This paper offers another strategy to already known and used by the AP from the very beginning and approaches published recently in 2016. This paper compares these procedures and the discussion also includes nonlinear fitting and metaevolutionary approach. As the main evolutionary algorithm, a differential algorithm (de/rand/1/bin) for the main process of AP is used.","[Oplatkova, Zuzana Kominkova; Viktorin, Adam; Senkerik, Roman; Urbanek, Tomas] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Appl Informat, Nam TG Masaryka 5555, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Oplatkova, ZK (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Appl Informat, Nam TG Masaryka 5555, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",oplatkova@fai.utb.cz; aviktorin@fai.utb.cz; senkerik@fai.utb.cz; turbanek@fai.utb.cz,"Viktorin, Adam/HNS-8152-2023; Urbanek, Tomas/B-5165-2015; Urbanek, Tomas/HMP-5380-2023; Senkerik, Roman/H-6353-2012; Kominkova Oplatkova, Zuzana/H-6354-2012","Urbanek, Tomas/0000-0002-6307-2824; Senkerik, Roman/0000-0002-5839-4263; Kominkova Oplatkova, Zuzana/0000-0001-8050-162X; Viktorin, Adam/0000-0003-0861-0340","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Programme [LO1303, MSMT-7778/2014]; European Regional Development Fund under the project CEBIA-Tech [CZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0089]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic - GACR [P103/15/06700S]; Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University in Zlin [IGA/CebiaTech/2017/004]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Programme; European Regional Development Fund under the project CEBIA-Tech; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic - GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University in Zlin","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Programme project No. LO1303 (MSMT-7778/2014) and also by the European Regional Development Fund under the project CEBIA-Tech No. CZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0089, further it was supported by Grant Agency of the Czech Republic - GACR P103/15/06700S and by Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University in Zlin under the project No. IGA/CebiaTech/2017/004.",,22,2,2,0,1,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,326,332,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000049,0

Pakistan is an agricultural country and agriculture is the backbone of Pakistan` s economy. For the rapid growth of population food security should be under guarantee as well as the food production. In that farmers overused agrarian inputs, such as fertilizer, pesticide and water, environment and farmers were affected from the perspective of contamination and disease increase respectively. Due to over-exploitation of fertilizer and irrigation, ground water was contaminated, soil fertility weakening, salinity increasing and waterlogged. Consequently, soil was hard to be cultivated. In Pakistan 70% of people live in rural areas who are directly or indirectly involved in agriculture. As a result of land degradation farmers can not gain much benefit from agricultural activities and they are also unable to feed their children. Many of them became criminals, therefore, poverty deepened day after day. In order to alleviate poverty, Pakistan government should subsidize farmers on environmentally friendly inputs and; government should also open agricultural training schools to engage farmers in modern methods of cultivation, and provide modern technologies with subsidy rate. When the farmers are aware of how to increase the fertility of soil by employing modern methods, they can gain higher production, and obvious higher production is critical for living a better life and reducing poverty.","[Qiu, L.

Meanwhile, flipped classroom has some distinguishing features such as clear information, reversed process and proper evaluation, etc., which can free class time for hands-on work and benefit both the advanced and less advanced students. Although some restraining factors including teachers, students, schools and parents have deep influence on the teaching effect of flipped classroom, the implementation of flipped classroom in the information age will definitely change the traditional educational system and gradually accepted by people, which is of great value to fostering future diversified and innovative talents.","[Ren, Ling] Anshan Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Anshan, Peoples R China",Anshan Normal University,"Ren, L (通讯作者)，Anshan Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Anshan, Peoples R China.",renling416@163.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-436-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,107.0,,,,,,360,363,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426885200093,0

The aim of the paper is to focus on a new approach to tackling unemployment of young people under the age of 25 offered by the Youth Guarantee. There are several reasons why the initiative has emerged. It is the high number of unemployed young people under the age of 25 within the EU 28 and the youth unemployment rate that is more than twice as high as the overall rate of adult unemployment. Another reason is that more than seven million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are not employed nor they continue in education or vocational training, etc. Investing in the Youth Guarantee is therefore a good investment. On the other hand, costs of not doing anything would be much higher. Major responsibility for the areas of employment and education lies on the backs of the Member States, but, of course, the European Union can have and does have a supportive and stimulating role.","[Rievajova, Eva; Klimko, Roman] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Rievajová, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",eva.rievajova@euba.sk; roman.klimko@euba.sk,,,VEGA [1/0001/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The paper is the outcome of scientific project VEGA No. 1/0001/16 Sucasnost a perspektivy zmien zamestnanosti a suvisiacich procesov v kontexte naplnania cielov Europskej strategie zamestnanosti.,,8,0,0,1,1,UNIV SOCIAL & ADM AFFAIRS,HAVIROV,"VITEZSLAVA NEZVALA 801-1, HAVIROV, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87291-20-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,257,266,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations; Public Administration,BP4JR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000552892500021,0

Both portmanteau and omnibus-type tests for lack of residual autocorrelation are considered. The resulting test statistics are asymptotically pivotal when innovations are uncorrelated but possibly exhibit higher order serial dependence. Moreover, the tests are able to detect local alternatives converging to the null at the parametric rate T- 1/2, with T the sample size. The finite sample performance of the test statistics are examined by means of Monte Carlo experiments. Using a dataset on U.S. corporate bankruptcies, the proposed tests are applied to check if different risk models are correctly specified.

Economic changes transform the NEET by expanding their education cycles. The education cycle has been extended and that has several consequences on the family and on training these individuals for work. It also involves the increasing incorporation of unconventional students, with very specific interests and preferences that educational systems must value. The current analysis firstly sets out the data for dependent young people in Europe. After a comparative analysis of the available data, alternatives are offered regarding the future of training. Statistical data on families and social welfare budgets are presented as well as the cost of training in different countries. It deals with a possible mismatch in terms of integrating models developed by the Higher Education system in Europe. The debate also arises on a financial level suggesting subsidy lines or strategies to support the role of families. Families have been transformed from production units to consumer units and are now moving closer to becoming maintenance units. This is an innovative function of families. It corresponds to a level of specialisation that is difficult to sustain. It also implies substituting services that welfare states could initially offer.","[Vargas-Vergara, Montserrat; Perez-Gonzalez, Beatriz A.] Univ Cadiz, Dept Hist Geog & Philosophy, Cadiz, Spain; [Sanchez Torrejon, Begona] Univ Cadiz, Dept Didact, Cadiz, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz; Universidad de Cadiz,"Vargas-Vergara, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cadiz, Dept Hist Geog & Philosophy, Cadiz, Spain.",montse.vargas@uca.es; beatriz.perez@uca.es; begonia.sanchez@uca.es,"Pérez-González, A.

Regional Studies. Community enterprises have become a widely used mechanism in addressing problems associated with socio-economic decline in rural areas. Using a legitimacy perspective, this paper explores how emerging community enterprises access resources needed to start and sustain their operations. Studying two music festivals that aim to improve the identity and economy of rural communities, three legitimation strategies emerge: conformance to the internal (rural community) environment; conformance to the external (cultural festival) environment; and changing the internal (rural community) environment. The legitimation process requires different legitimacy-building strategies within different environments, and community enterprises can benefit from differences in legitimacy judgements.","[Vestrum, Ingebjorg] Nordland Res Inst, Bodo, Norway; [Rasmussen, Einar] Nord Univ, Sch Business, Bodo, Norway; [Carter, Sara] Univ Strathclyde, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Nord University; University of Strathclyde,"Vestrum, I (通讯作者)，Nordland Res Inst, Bodo, Norway.",ikv@nforsk.no; einar.rasmussen@nord.no; sara.carter@strath.ac.uk,,"Rasmussen, Einar/0000-0001-7130-3752",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,60,20,21,7,67,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Russia actively participates in globalization and the international division of labour taking into account the experience of foreign partner countries. The development of a network of industrial districts is an example of such an experience, which is a combination of social, economic, financial, production and marketing relationships. The resulting environment allows industrial enterprises to participate in global competition in consumer goods markets, despite the small size of each. The article is devoted to the development of the industrial districts in Russia on the basis of foreign, in particular Italian experience. The article provides the historical aspects of the phenomenon of the industrial districts. The aspects explore the detail analysis of the specificity of the Italian economy, which is based on small and medium-sized enterprises, which contribute to the success of such projects. The analysis revealed the typology of the universal territorial industrial policy instruments. Considerable attention is devoted to the subject of the internationalisation of the Italian experience in this sphere and prospects of development of the industrial districts in Russia.

Using the 2014-2015 ACCESS survey with over 8500 households from six energy-poor Indian states, our study reports on results from a comprehensive survey of LPG use in rural India using a holistic approach to understanding the integration of a clean cooking fuel into rural household's energy mixes. There are three principal findings: (i) fuel costs are a critical obstacle to widespread adoption, (ii) fuel stacking is the prevailing norm as few households stop using firewood when adopting LPG, and (iii) both users and non-users have highly positive views of LPG as a convenient and clean cooking fuel. These findings show that expanding LPG use offers great promise in rural India, but affordability prevents a complete transition from traditional biomass to clean cooking fuels.","[Gould, Carlos F.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Urpelainen, Johannes] Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies SAIS, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Columbia University; Johns Hopkins University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies SAIS, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,"Gould, Carlos F/HKO-7881-2023","Gould, Carlos/0000-0002-7736-3905",National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant [R25GM62454],National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"This work was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant #R25GM62454 to CFG.

Carbon flow is one of the profiles that is closely connected to the urban metabolic system. Here, a global environmentally extended multi-scale input-output model was employed to accurately trace the carbon flow in a multi-scales economic system from production and consumption perspectives. Beijing was selected as the case, and the results were as follows: Beijing is typically a net importer of carbon flow (net consumer), which is consistent with Beijing's profile as a consumer metropolis. Further, all seven domestic regions in China were net producers corresponding to Beijing, supporting nearly 96.56% of the net carbon inflows driven by Beijing's final demand. Beijing mainly imports carbon flows from domestic regions and developing areas around the world, while exporting little to developed countries. Aside from the Mining (S2), Nonmetallic (S9), and Transport (S17) sectors, all other industrial sectors were net inflows of carbon for Beijing in 2010. In addition, Beijing is located at the bottom of the global production supply chain, transferring the embodied carbon flow to the origin by domestic and international imports. These results indicate that regional coordination and regional trade structure adjustment should be the main measures to tackle global climate change in the future.","[Meng, Fanxin; Su, Meirong; Yang, Zhifeng] Dongguan Univ Technol, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Engn, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China; [Meng, Fanxin; Liu, Gengyuan; Yang, Zhifeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yuanchao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yuanchao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, 19A Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Dongguan University of Technology; Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Yang, ZF (通讯作者)，Dongguan Univ Technol, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Engn, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China.",zfyang@bnu.edu.cn,"Liu, Gengyuan/ADC-8297-2022; CAS, KLUEH/T-5743-2019; Su, M/HLP-8374-2023","Liu, Gengyuan/0000-0002-3488-9536; Meng, Fanxin/0000-0002-8956-4149; Hu, Yuanchao/0000-0002-1965-5395",Projects of Sino-America International Cooperation of National Natural Science Foundation [51661125010]; Fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51721093]; Consulting Project of Chinese Academy of Engineering [2017-XY-23],Projects of Sino-America International Cooperation of National Natural Science Foundation; Fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Consulting Project of Chinese Academy of Engineering,"This work is supported by the Projects of Sino-America International Cooperation of National Natural Science Foundation (No. 51661125010), the Fund for Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51721093), Consulting Project of Chinese Academy of Engineering (No. 2017-XY-23).",,53,32,37,8,88,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,553,564,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.044,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800054,0

Main results are: i) going for the unilateral European Union carbon mitigation target without any complementary technological policy will produce large economic losses; ii) by investing in clean energy technologies (energy efficiency and renewable energy) with a carbon tax revenue recycling mechanism, these losses will decrease substantially; iii) when complementary clean energy technology policies are implemented, the optimal timing of binding targets changes; iv) the higher the public support to clean energy technologies, the larger the economic gains in early adoption of challenging abatement targets.","[Corradini, Massimiliano] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Business Studies, Rome, Italy; [Costantini, Valeria; Paglialunga, Elena; Sforna, Giorgia] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy; [Markandya, Anil] BC3, Bilbao, Spain",Roma Tre University; Roma Tre University; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Costantini, V (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Dept Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",valeria.costantini@uniroma3.it,"Costantini, Valeria/I-8461-2016; Markandya, Anil/K-9381-2013; Paglialunga, Elena/ABD-4495-2020; Paglialunga, Elena/ISB-5979-2023","Costantini, Valeria/0000-0001-6249-3099; Paglialunga, Elena/0000-0002-3874-0712; Sforna, Giorgia/0000-0003-3988-8839","EU D.G.

In May 2016, the Taiwan government began promoting renewable energy (RE) and phasing out nuclear power. However, it has not used the Renewable Energy Development Act, which is similar to the German Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, as the main instrument. Instead, the new government has prioritised the revision of the Electricity Act and the introduction of liberalisation to allow RE producers to compete in the market and sell directly to end consumers. The main purposes of this article are to provide a critical review of this unique way of promoting RE under an energy transition and to determine the significance of Germany's energy transition strategy as a framework to promote RE development. The finding is that ambitious RE promotion schemes should remain at the core of energy transitions, while the liberalisation of electricity could play a supplementary role in an interconnected continental energy system to mitigate intermittency, which is one of the weaknesses of RE. Permitting expensive RE to be sold directly at the low market price of electricity would fail to give impetus to further RE development.","[Gao, Anton Ming-Zhi; Fan, Chien-Te] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Law Sci & Technol, 101,Sect 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Liao, Chao-Ning] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, 101,Sect 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University; National Tsing Hua University,"Gao, AMZ (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Law Sci & Technol, 101,Sect 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",antongao@mx.nthu.edu.tw; ctfan@mx.nthu.edu.tw; liaocn@mx.nthu.edu.tw,"GAO, Anton Ming-Zhi/GPS-8076-2022","FAN, Chien Te/0000-0002-6482-8320; GAO, Anton Ming-Zhi/0000-0001-9200-0769","National Energy Research Programme; Topic-oriented study under the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [106B0009Q4, 105B2006Q4]","National Energy Research Programme; Topic-oriented study under the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","This work was supported by the National Energy Research Programme and Topic-oriented study under the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [grant numbers 106B0009Q4, 105B2006Q4, 2017], which was vital for the completion of this article.",,75,23,23,2,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,644,654,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.010,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300060,0

Using bounding scenarios of attributional lifecycle analysis, this study finds that the climate impacts of United States exports to China, Japan, India, or South Korea could vary significantly, with annual global lifecycle emissions ranging from -88,000 metric tons CO(2)e to + 170,000 metric tons CO(2)e per Bcf of exports. Exact emissions will depend on factors such as (a) the final end-use of the LNG, (b) domestic market impacts from increased natural gas prices in the United States, (c) induced additional energy consumption in importing countries, and (d) methane leakage rates. Country specific greenhouse gas outcomes can differ from global outcomes, with major implications for extraction and consumption based emissions accounting. The study's results indicate the need for more robust consideration of the climate impacts of all energy exports in terms of country specific energy analyses, global climate regulations, and market uncertainty. Thus, how gas is governed becomes of critical importance, for it will determine whether LNG is a net sink or source of additional emissions.","[Gilbert, Alexander Q.] Spark Lib, Washington, DC USA; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, AU Herning, Birk Ctr Pk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark",University of Sussex; Aarhus University,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, AU Herning, Birk Ctr Pk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",alexgilbert@sparklibrary.com; BenjaminSo@hih.au.dk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; Gilbert, Alexander/0000-0001-7906-6106",,,,,43,10,11,2,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,635,643,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.063,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300059,0

To address this need, we augment our previous work to include data from a new survey conducted three years after the FNAJ in the same study area. The results showed that three years after the FNAJ, factor knowledge continued to increase, whereas the other four perception factors acceptance, risk, benefit, and trust had recovered from their post-FNAJ changes to different degrees. The sensitive groups whose acceptance declined more after the FNAJ showed a greater increase as time passed. It was also found that median acceptable frequency for level 1 nuclear events (anomaly) showed little change from Survey 2 to Survey 3, while tolerance of more severe events (incidents and serious incidents) has decreased substantially. The overall recovery of public acceptance shown in our study was in line with the nuclear development trend of China.

This is even more surprising since Russia was an early leader in RES deployment. Moreover, it raises the question whether renewables may be competitive in Russia, and if they may, how should the legal framework for their integration in the energy system evolve. Thus, the goals of this paper are twofold. Fist, the authors explore the potential competitiveness of wind and solar PV against new conventional power generation capacities. They find that international capital and operation costs put into Russian climatic (solar radiation, wind speed) and economic (discount rate, domestic fuel prices) conditions give levelized costs of wind and solar PV, which are comparable to these of new conventional power generation, and wind may be the second cheapest energy source after natural gas. Second, the authors give an overall review of the Russian RES regulation and its new developments to show that Russia has started to recognize its need to gain core competencies in renewable energy technologies. Still, Russia has much room to improve its regulation and to narrow the existing gap between policies and their implementation.","[Lanshina, Tatiana A.; Laitner, John A.

The Global Apollo Programme called for collective action to develop renewable energy. This paper sets out a method for assessing whether a trajectory of investment that involves initial subsidies is justified by the subsequent learning-by-doing spillovers and if so, computes the maximum justifiable additional subsidy to provide, taking account of the special features of renewable electricity - geographically dispersed and variable quality resource base and local saturation. Given current costs and learning rates, accelerating the current rate of investment appears globally socially beneficial for solar PV in most but not all cases, less so for on-shore wind. The optimal trajectory appears to involve a gradually decreasing rate of growth of installed capacity.","[Newbery, David] Univ Cambridge, Energy Policy Res Grp, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DE, England",University of Cambridge,"Newbery, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Energy Policy Res Grp, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DE, England.",dmgn@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,24,26,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,684,696,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.029,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300064,0

It is easy to compute and interpret, but its limitations as an energy efficiency indicator are also well known. Another widely used indicator is the composite energy intensity (CEI) index constructed from disaggregated energy and activity data. The CEI index is seen as a better proxy for energy efficiency but it is more difficult to construct as compared to the EGR. Countries have computed and compared the two indexes and reported their divergence in capturing energy efficiency trends. While economic structure change is one explanation for the divergence, it is not the only contributing factor and the issue has not been studied in detail. This study seeks to fill the gap. It dissects and discusses the fundamentals of the two indicators, and establishes a formal linkage between them by introducing a factor termed the activity correction (AC) effect.

In this paper we investigate both the temporal and spatial dynamics of formative phases by which energy technologies prepare for growth. Drawing on a review of diverse literatures, we offer a definition of the formative phase which clarifies its scope and duration, and identifies its main technological and economic determinants. We use parametric hazard models to assess the relative strengths of these determinants on formative phase durations for a sample of 15 energy technologies diffusing over time in their respective initial markets. We find that substitutability has stronger effects in accelerating the end of formative phases than installed capacity and prices. We extend our analysis using nonparametric models to analyze the spatial diffusion of formative phase durations from initial to follower markets. We find that formative phase durations are long outside initial markets as well, showing only signs of acceleration in latecomer regions. Our results imply risks for policies trying to accelerate the diffusion of large innovations without ready markets in both initial and follower markets.","[Bento, Nuno] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET, Ave Forcas Armadas,Edificio ISCTE,Sala 2N19, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Bento, Nuno] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, 79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wilson, Charlie] UEA, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Wilson, Charlie] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Anadon, Laura Diaz] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Ctr Environm Energy & Nat Resource Governance, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Harvard University; University of East Anglia; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Cambridge,"Bento, N (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET, Ave Forcas Armadas,Edificio ISCTE,Sala 2N19, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",Nuno.Bento@iscte.pt,"Wilson, Charlie/D-4127-2011","Bento, Nuno/0000-0002-5923-0666; Wilson, Charlie/0000-0001-8164-3566",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Harvard Kennedy School; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH/BPD/91183/2012]; European Union [730403 - INNOPATHS],International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Harvard Kennedy School; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research on which this article is based was supported by a grant from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), and Harvard Kennedy School.

In fact, energy retrofit of residential dwellings, ceteris paribus, results in a new socio-technical system characterized by higher room temperatures. In the new environment, individuals might change their type of interaction with the building and exert a certain level of effort to adapt to the new comfort situation depending on their previous practices. Some of the new practices, such as opening the window when it is too warm, might explain why energy-saving policies in buildings are not leading to the desired results. In this paper, by means of a Discrete Choice Experiment conducted among 3161 tenants and owner-occupiers in Germany, we investigate preferences for practices implemented to adjust thermal comfort in retrofitted buildings. Our results reveal a mix of behaviors in response to energy retrofits, some of which may offset energy savings (e.g. tilting the window) while others have more benign effects (e.g. wearing lighter clothes).","[Galassi, Veronica; Madlener, Reinhard] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Sch Business & Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; E-ON,"Galassi, V (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Sch Business & Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",VGalassi@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) [03ET4004],German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support received from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) under research contract No. 03ET4004.

After reviewing the rationales for conducting such projects and providing partial public funding for them, five assessment criteria derived from the literature are applied to the portfolio, pertaining to project selection and termination, cost-sharing, partnerships, information-sharing, and the environment for follow-on investment. The assessment is mixed. DOE performed best, relative to expectations, on project selection and termination and partnerships, and not as well on cost-sharing, information-sharing, and the follow-on environment. This performance does not warrant establishing a new agency to replace DOE for management of demonstration projects. The recommendations include implementing cost-sharing more flexibly, making information-sharing a higher priority, avoiding too-rapid scale-up of technologies, and being explicit about project milestones and considering termination if they are not met.","[Hart, David M.] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Hart, DM (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",dilart@gmu.edu,,,Information Technology and Innovation Foundation,Information Technology and Innovation Foundation,The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation provided in-kind support in the preparation of this paper.,,44,10,10,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,367,376,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.047,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200034,0

In this analysis, we examine the impact of early retirements for oil, coal, and natural gas-fired generators required to follow a given 2 degrees C emissions trajectory (the IEA 2DS) and explore the policy implications surrounding this challenge. Modelling the period up to 2060, the drop in retirement age required to meet this scenario potentially creates $541 billion worth of stranded power plant assets across the US, EU, China, and India alone. In some cases, coal plants built within the past 5 years will need to be retired after only half the nominal operating lifetime. Regional analysis exposed disproportionate impacts in China and India, shouldering the vast majority of the costs and amplifying concerns over energy access and affordability. Policies such as burden-sharing for equitable mitigation, investment into CCS technology, and international financial compensation are discussed as potential avenues for mitigating this impact. However, limitations in all avenues highlight the need for further consideration of the inferred requirement to force early retirements, in order to avoid exacerbating regional imbalances and improve the feasibility of imposed targets.","[Kefford, Benjamin M.; Ballinger, Benjamin; Schmeda-Lopez, Diego R.; Greig, Chris; Smart, Simon] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, Dow Ctr Sustainable Engn Innovat, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Smart, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, Dow Ctr Sustainable Engn Innovat, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",s.smart@uq.edu.au,"Smart, Simon K/D-2983-2009; Ballinger, Benjamin/C-1565-2016",,Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation at The University of Queensland,Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation at The University of Queensland,This research was supported by the Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation at The University of Queensland.,,77,42,47,3,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,294,306,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.018,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200027,0

Heteroscedasticity tests are found to be useful tools for deciding whether time-varying volatility is present but do not discriminate well between different types of volatility changes.

The purpose of this study was to improve understanding on the measured and calculated energy efficiency of Finnish schools and daycare centers. The study analyzed the energy consumption of 134 schools and 71 daycare centers and compared the regulatory building permit calculations to measured values for 18 case buildings. According to the results, the specific electricity consumption (kW h/(m(2)a)) has increased in schools but not in daycare centers. The heating energy consumption was lower in schools, but this might be explained by that they had clearly larger gross floor area than daycare centers. When compared to the technical requirements in the building code, the actual heating energy consumption has decreased less than what the changes in the building code would suggest. The building energy consumption calculated for building permits with the monthly calculation method and standard use clearly underestimated the measured building energy consumption. The differences were larger in heating energy than in electricity consumption. In conclusion, different regulatory limit values should be considered for the two building types. The calculation methods and input data should be analyzed to ensure that they truly guide towards cost-optimal design choices.","[Ruusala, Annu; Laukkarinen, Anssi; Vinha, Juha] Tampere Univ Technol, Civil Engn Lab, Korkeakoulunkatu 10, FI-33720 Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Laukkarinen, A (通讯作者)，Tampere Univ Technol, Civil Engn Lab, Korkeakoulunkatu 10, FI-33720 Tampere, Finland.",anssi.laukkarinen@tut.fi,"Laukkarinen, Anssi/D-8741-2015; Vinha, Juha/ABY-3830-2022","Laukkarinen, Anssi/0000-0002-5825-1721; Vinha, Juha/0000-0003-2426-4687; Ruusala, Annu Kaisu/0000-0002-1208-0058",European Regional Development Fund [A70256]; Tekes - The Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation [4676/31/2014],European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); Tekes - The Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation(Finnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund [grant number A70256]; Tekes - The Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation [grant number 4676/31/2014]; and 37 companies.,,44,9,9,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,183,195,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.029,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200018,0

Some governments have accelerated this development through specific financial support schemes to offset the costs, which still remain high. Compared to the use of single-household systems, the sharing of mid-scale electricity storage systems in neighborhoods could reduce the Levelized Costs of Storage (LCOS). However, a model for the shared usage of storage by multiple households has yet to emerge. We investigated eight demonstration projects in Germany and Western Australia with capacities between 100 and 1100 kW h with respect to potential business models and barriers in a cross-case study based on document analyses and expert interviews. We found that models relying on the transmission of electricity from individual rooftop photovoltaics to a shared storage system through the public grid are facing significant regulatory barriers. Removing these policy barriers would enable a more efficient use of electricity storage systems. By contrast, projects relying on a less regulated microgrid managed by the administration or strata entities of multi household developments already seem promising under the current regulatory framework.","[Mueller, Simon C.; Welpe, Isabel M.] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Chair Strategy & Org, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Müller, SC (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Chair Strategy & Org, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",simon.mueller@tum.de,,,"Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology","Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology","This work has been supported by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology [via the project EEBatt].

In theory, a composition of power plants that is optimally adapted to residual load always leads to the most cost efficient supply of electricity.

Thus, it may play an important role in the future, especially to balance fluctuating sources in increasingly renewables-based power systems. Today, its costs are higher than those of PV and wind power and, as most countries do not support CSP, deployment is slow. Unless the expansion gains pace and costs decrease, the industry may stagnate or collapse, and an important technology for climate change mitigation has been lost. Keeping CSP as a maturing technology for dispatchable renewable power thus requires measures to improve its short-term economic attractiveness and to continue reducing costs in the longer term. We suggest a set of three policy instruments - feed-in tariffs or auctions reflecting the value of dispatchable CSP, and not merely its cost; risk coverage support for innovative designs; and demonstration projects - to be deployed, in regions where CSP has a potentially large role to play. This could provide the CSP industry with a balance of attractive profits and competitive pressure, the incentive to expand CSP while also reducing its costs, making it ready for broad-scale deployment when it is needed.","[Lilliestam, Johan; Hanger, Susanne; Komendantova, Nadejda; Patt, Anthony] Fed Swiss Inst Technol ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Climate Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lilliestam, Johan] Fed Swiss Inst Technol ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Renewable Energy Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Barradi, Touria] MENARES, Casablanca, Morocco; [Caldes, Natalia] CIEMAT, Energy Syst Anal Unit, Madrid, Spain; [Gomez, Marta] Dow Chem, Tarragona, Spain; [Kern, Jurgen] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Engn Thermodynam, Stuttgart, Germany; [Mehos, Mark] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Thermal Syst Grp, Golden, CO USA; [Hong, Wai Mun] Univ Autonoma Madrid, MERIGG, Madrid, Spain; [Wang, Zhifeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Elect Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales Tecnologicas; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Autonomous University of Madrid; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Electrical Engineering, CAS","Lilliestam, J (通讯作者)，ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Renewable Energy Policy Grp, Univ Str 22, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",johan.lilliestam@usys.ethz.ch,"Komendantova, Nadejda/AAI-1536-2021","Komendantova, Nadejda/0000-0003-2568-6179; Hanger, Susanne/0000-0001-7223-9991; Patt, Anthony/0000-0001-8428-8707",European Research Council [313553]; European Research Council (ERC) [313553] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This paper is based on a workshop held in Abu Dhabi in October 2016, to which all authors attended.

We make a clear distinction between the mainstream of BEVs and a hypothetical group of BEVs that are technically on a par with internal combustion vehicles (ICVs). To do so, we introduce a new index, in which the driving range and max-speed of a vehicle are coupled together, i.e., the Mobility-Diffusion coefficient. We highlight different shares of battery packs (i.e., 19 +/- 1%), and the ensemble of electrification components (e.g., battery pack, electric motor, power electronics), i.e., electrification cost (52 +/- 2%), in the price of a BEV. Our price projections suggest that there is no prospect of breakeven between BEVs and ICVs before 2040 for both groups of BEVs, because the current learning rates of 9 +/- 2% and 15 +/- 1% for the price and electrification costs, respectively, of BEVs.

In this study, the life cycle assessment (LCA) method was adopted to analyze the environmental impact of coal-fired power generation in China. Further, the relevant cost theory was used to calculate the resource consumption cost and external environmental cost of coal-fired power generation. The key environmental impact category was smoke and dust, and the main emissions were CO2, CO, SO2, TSP, COD, and boiler ash. The emissions with high environmental cost were coal, SO2, COD, and boiler ash. The environmental cost at the power generation stage was the highest, with a value of $50.24. The resource consumption cost and external environmental cost per unit of MWh power in the life cycle was $46.01 and $22.90, respectively. Upgrading the facilities for emission reduction, improving emission standards of pollutants, and strengthening process management of coal-fired power generation are effective ways to reduce the burden on the environment.","[Wang, Jinman; Wang, Ruogu; Zhu, Yucheng; Li, Jiayan] China Univ Geosci, Coll Land Sci & Technol, 29 Xueyuanlu, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinman] Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Land Consolidat & Rehabil, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Beijing; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,"Wang, JM (通讯作者)，China Univ Geosci, Coll Land Sci & Technol, 29 Xueyuanlu, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wangjinman@cugb.edu.cn,"li, yao/IYJ-1364-2023; Wang, Jinman/AAK-6513-2021; LIU, JIALIN/JXN-8034-2024","Wang, Jinman/0000-0002-8140-997X","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [2652015179, 2652015336]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (2652015179, 2652015336).",,97,112,124,38,337,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,374,384,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.040,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800037,0

The results indicate that corruption not only exhibits spatial spillovers but also a persistent effect over time.

A lot has been written about the retroactivity of the new Spanish regulation and its negative impact on investors' confidence and future deployment. The aim of this paper is to analyze the implications of this regulation on the profitability of those plants in Spain. Using real data from a very common PV plant, the results show that the new support scheme has a considerable impact on the cash-flows of those plants. However, our simulations also show that the degree of reduction in the internal rates of return critically depends on different factors. Under some restrictive assumptions, the savings in support costs due to the new regulation are only around 7.6% if remuneration for investment is maintained after 2019, and around 57% if such support is removed after 2019.","[Mir-Artigues, Pere] Univ Barcelona UdL, Energy Sustainabil Res Grp, Barcelona, Spain; [Cerda, Emilio] Univ Complutense Madrid, Inst Complutense Estudios Int, Campus Somosaguas,Edificio A, Madrid 28223, Spain; [del Rio, Pablo] CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods IPP, Madrid, Spain",University of Barcelona; Complutense University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP),"del Río, P (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods IPP, Madrid, Spain.",peremir@econap.udl.cat; ecerdate@ccee.ucm.es; pablo.delrio@csic.es,,"Mir-Artigues, Pere/0000-0002-4157-8090","MINECO/FEDER, EU [ECO2015-69107-R]; MINECO [ECO2015-70349-P]","MINECO/FEDER, EU(Spanish Government); MINECO(Spanish Government)","The authors are grateful to J.P. and partners for the information provided on the solar PV plant which has been used in this study.

The Aegean archipelago comprises scattered islands, whose electricity supply relies on oil-based thermal power plants. These islands attract large numbers of tourists, while the archipelago is an environmentally sensitive area. Efficient maritime transportation of crude oil is critical for maintaining adequate power supply in the Aegean islands, especially during tourist seasons. Tanker closed-sea shipping operations in the Aegean Sea raise considerations on carbon footprint impacts. Also, despite potential impacts to local economies and the environment, the case of a maritime accident leading to an oil spill is largely overlooked. We investigate the possible integration of environmental and accident related objectives, in the decision-making process of planning an efficient oil maritime transportation service for the Aegean archipelago. We showcase a risk mitigation strategy for oil transport route planning considering spill-related impacts to local, tourism dependent economies under a more socially and environmentally conscious policy framework. We model the problem as a multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem and solve it using an alternating objective genetic algorithm. Results show that certain routes are considered optimal for both objectives, while risk reduction may be achieved at small operational cost increase.","[Iliopoulou, Christina] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Transportat Planning & Engn, 5 Iroon Polytech Str,Zografou Campus, Athens 15773, Greece; [Kepaptsoglou, Konstantinos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, 5 Iroon Polytech Str, Athens 15773, Greece; [Schinas, Orestis] Hamburg Sch Business Adm, Maritime Business Sch, Alter Wall 38, D-20457 Hamburg, Germany",National Technical University of Athens; National Technical University of Athens,"Kepaptsoglou, K (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, 5 Iroon Polytech Str, Athens 15773, Greece.",christiliop@central.ntua.gr; kkepap@central.ntua.gr; orestis.schinas@hsba.de,"Iliopoulou, Christina/AEN-7981-2022; Schinas, Orestis/K-6785-2013; Kepaptsoglou, Konstantinos/AAL-1778-2021","Schinas, Orestis/0000-0001-8464-5671; Kepaptsoglou, Konstantinos/0000-0002-5505-6998; Iliopoulou, Christina/0000-0002-9888-1947",,,,,53,12,12,1,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,608,620,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.032,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500056,0

We focus on three European markets in which the natural gas share in the fuel mix varies considerably: Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We fad that spark spread returns are partially predictable, and consequently, the Ederington and Salas (2008) minimum variance hedging approach should be applied. Hedging the spark spread is more difficult than hedging electricity and natural gas price risks with individual futures contracts. Whereas spark spread risk reduction for monthly periods produces values of between 20.05% and 48.90%, electricity and natural gas individual hedges attain reductions ranging of between 31.22% and 69.06%.

It quantifies the current scale, costs and value of different types of mature EES and compares them to peaking generators, interconnectors and demand-side response. Worldwide, dams have 2700 times the storage capacity of pumped storage, which accounts for 99% of conventional EES, batteries making up most of the rest. Indirect use of hydro power, and in future, electric vehicles, adds to their value and if accessible at reasonable cost, would be cheaper than conventional EES. EES, peakers and DC interconnectors can offer flexibility services which considerably enhance their value, but hopes of a battery revolution enabling a smarter electricity system should not be exaggerated.","[Newbery, David] EPRG, Cambridge, England; [Newbery, David] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Newbery, David] Fac Econ, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge, England",Imperial College London,"Newbery, D (通讯作者)，EPRG, Cambridge, England.;Newbery, D (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, London, England.;Newbery, D (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge, England.",dmgn@cam.ac.uk,,,Imperial College London [295367],Imperial College London,Support by the FP7 project eStorage at Imperial College London (295367) is gratefully acknowledged,,30,46,49,0,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,711,720,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.044,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500066,0

In particular, this paper constructs an autoregressive distribution lag model to study the elasticity of natural gas demand in various sectors of China. The results show that, except for the residents sector, the long-run price elasticity of natural gas demand in other sectors is greater than 0, which is contrary to the estimates of developed countries. The demand for natural gas is complementary to coal in industrial and power generation sectors, which is also different from developed countries. The elasticity of natural gas demand in residents sector is lack in price elasticity but abundant in income elasticity, which is similar to the developed countries.

We suggest a new way of testing the Newcomb-Benford law that turns out to be particularly attractive for the detection of frauds in customs data collected from international trade. Our approach has two major advantages. The first one is that we control the rate of false rejections at each stage of the procedure, as required in antifraud applications. The second improvement is that our testing procedure leads to exact significance levels and does not rely on large-sample approximations. Another contribution of our work is the derivation of a simple expression for the digit distribution when the Newcomb-Benford law is violated, and a bound for a chi-squared type of distance between the actual digit distribution and the Newcomb-Benford one.","[Barabesi, Lucio] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Siena, Italy; [Cerasa, Andrea; Perrotta, Domenico] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [Cerioli, Andrea] Univ Parma, Dept Econ, Parma, Italy",University of Siena; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Parma,"Barabesi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Siena, Italy.",lucio.barabesi@unisi.it; andrea.cerasa@jrc.ec.europa.eu; andrea.cerioli@unipr.it; Domenico.Perrotta@ec.europa.eu,"Perrotta, Domenico/AAS-7812-2020; Barabesi, Lucio/ABH-2829-2021; Cerioli, Andrea/AAF-6959-2019","Perrotta, Domenico/0000-0002-0987-3823; Cerioli, Andrea/0000-0002-2485-5674; Cerasa, Andrea/0000-0002-2749-9142; BARABESI, LUCIO/0000-0002-7210-4541",,,,,34,21,21,3,29,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

However, we tend to overlook dynamics within autonomous areas, which tend to centralize power with the local ethnic majority and enable localized nation-building.

Existing research has mostly relied on the localized knowledge spillover (LKS) model to explain this. This model holds that knowledge transfer across distance is costly, and collaborating locally reduces the risk of information loss when the knowledge is transferred. However, there are various other reasons that could also explain the pattern. If the local university can make a useful contribution, firms might choose to look no further. Firms may also see collaboration as a long-term investment, helping to build research quality at the local university with the hope of benefiting in future. Finally, firms may want to contribute to the local community. We extend the LKS model with these additional motivations and explore their validity using data from 23 semi-structured interviews of firms that collaborate intensively with lower-tier local universities.","[Fitjar, Rune Dahl] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway; [Gjelsvik, Martin] Int Res Inst Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Fitjar, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway.",rune.d.fitjar@uis.no; martin.gjelsvik@iris.no,"Fitjar, Rune Dahl/C-2580-2013","Fitjar, Rune Dahl/0000-0001-5333-2701; Gjelsvik, Martin/0000-0001-9463-4001",Research Council of Norway under the programme FORFI [P212275]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [722295],Research Council of Norway under the programme FORFI(Research Council of Norway); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions(European Union (EU)),"This research was funded by the Research Council of Norway under the programme FORFI [grant number P212275].

In the case study reported, it is proposed to use business process based simulation. A business process is constructed jointly with domain experts and a simulation model is created directly from the business process model, where simulation specific features are represented in sub-processes. That streamlines model validation and communication of modeling results with stakeholders. Business process simulation is used to compare ambulatory treatment and hospitalization in the case of ectopic pregnancy treatment. Simulation results show that the ambulatory treatment should be adopted according to the cost minimization criterion. However, appropriate measures should be taken to mitigate potential negative effects exhibiting in the simulation results as an increase of waiting time.","[Grabis, Janis] Riga Tech Univ, Inst Informat Technol, Kalku 1, LV-1658 Riga, Latvia; [Grabe, Zane] Riga East Univ Hosp, Unit Obstet & Gynecol, 2 Hipokrata St, LV-1038 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University; Riga East University Hospital,"Grabis, J (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Inst Informat Technol, Kalku 1, LV-1658 Riga, Latvia.",grabis@rtu.lv,,"Grabis, Janis/0000-0003-2196-0214",,,,,22,0,0,0,2,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,96,102,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000015,0

Other authors use the expression globalization as a result of fundamental changes in the development of the world economy since the end of the 70s of the 20th century. The main objective of the paper is to analyse and compare the intensity of globalization in the Slovak republic and V4 countries, after the decay of the centralised economy and its transition to the market economy. The data used for the analysis are obtained from the dataset of Swiss Economic Institute. In order to assess the level of globalization and compare it within V4 countries, the analysis using the Globalization Index (KOF) has been used. The index measures the economic, social and political dimensions of globalization.

However, due to the seasonal characteristics of agricultural products in-situ tests of constructions are limited in time and often prove to be very expensive. With more than 1000 billion tons of annual production, corn is one of the most essential agricultural crops in the world. Consequently, our study focuses on the modeling of corn harvesting through coupled discrete element and finite element method (DEM-FEM) to provide more input for machine development. With the use of a complex DEM model of maize and the CAD model of a common corn header unit a large-scale simulation was carried out. The main phenomena were directly analyzed by quantitative and image-based qualitative evaluation methods. For further analysis the stalk rollers of the corn header unit were also investigated by finite element analysis. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that the discrete element model of maize is capable of modeling the crucial phenomenon during corn harvesting in the future.","[Kovacs, Adam; Zwierczyk, Peter Tamas] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Machine & Prod Design, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Kovács, A (通讯作者)，Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Machine & Prod Design, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.",kovacs.adam@gt3.bme.hu; z.peter@gt3.bme.hu,,,,,,,11,2,2,1,6,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,405,411,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000060,0

Short- and long-run elasticities with respect to regional gross domestic product (GDP) are estimated between 2001 and 2012 for the surtax on central personal income tax (RPIT) and for the regional tax on productive activities (RTPA). Cyclical reactions are more marked for the RTPA and higher in the southern regions. Significant long-run growth of the RPIT and RTPA, on the other hand, is found only in the northern regions. The results suggest that the behaviour of regional taxes may increase the Italian north-south gap and cast some doubt on these taxes in financing essential public services, such as health, in each region.","[Lagravinese, Raffaele] Univ Bari, Dept Econ & Math Methods, Bari, Italy; [Lagravinese, Raffaele; Liberati, Paolo] Univ Roma Tre, Ctr Ric Econ & Finanza Pubbl CEFIP, Rome, Italy; [Liberati, Paolo] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy; [Sacchi, Agnese] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy; [Sacchi, Agnese] Univ Vigo, Governance & Econ Res Network GEN, Vigo, Spain",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Roma Tre University; Roma Tre University; Sapienza University Rome; Universidade de Vigo,"Sacchi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy.;Sacchi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Governance & Econ Res Network GEN, Vigo, Spain.",raffaele.lagravinese@uniba.it; paolo.liberati@uniroma3.it; agnese.sacchi@uniroma1.it,,,"Regione Puglia; project on 'Crisi economica, distribuzione dei redditi e criteri di accesso alle politiche di assistenza' [R876/2015]","Regione Puglia(Regione Puglia); project on 'Crisi economica, distribuzione dei redditi e criteri di accesso alle politiche di assistenza'","Raffaele Lagravinese acknowledges financial support from the Regione Puglia (Future in Research Project).

With the powerful support provided by the government, China has become the world's largest electric vehicle market and continues to maintain a high-speed growth. This paper examines the factors that may affect the public's purchasing intention of electric vehicles via a survey. An electric vehicle purchasing intention model is proposed based on the literature review and the reality in China. The model takes into consideration a number of demographic characteristic factors and attitude factors. A survey was conducted in China's four largest cities which include: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Based on the survey data, the paper examines the public's cognition of each influencing factor and analyses the impacts of these factors. The results reveal that attitude factors such as network externality, price acceptability, government subsidies, vehicle performance, environmental concerns, and demographic characteristics such as gender, age and marital status have significant impact on respondents' willingness to purchase electric vehicles. The finding of this paper provides constructive advices to diverse stakeholders.","[Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wei] Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Wu, Wei/0000-0001-8613-3135",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; China National Social Science Fund [15ZD058],Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; China National Social Science Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No: 1260-Y07200) and China National Social Science Fund (No. 15ZD058).",,55,197,211,26,310,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,233,241,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.026,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800024,0

Probably due to strict competition, it is difficult for cement companies to pass the policy cost on to their clients. The sampled companies intend to make self-mitigation efforts for compliance. It is highly likely that cement companies would mitigate emissions themselves if the carbon price is higher than 108% of the self-abatement cost. The surveyed cement companies anticipate an increase in the carbon price in China, from about 35 Yuan/t-CO2 in 2020, to 60 Yuan/t-CO2 in 2025 and 90 Yuan/t-CO2 by 2030. The analysis provides reference for the smooth introduction and effective implementation of national carbon market in China from the business viewpoint.","[Liu, Xianbing] IGES, 2108-11 Kamiyamaguchi, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [Fan, Yongbin] China Cement Assoc, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Liu, XB (通讯作者)，IGES, 2108-11 Kamiyamaguchi, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan.",liu@iges.or.jp,,,,,,,40,19,21,2,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,141,151,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.019,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800016,0

The paper deals with the global crises impact on economic growth rate in the period of post-crises recovery. Several stylized facts, characterizing the business cycles, were highlighted. Global recessions covering synchronously the bigger part of global economy are rare phenomenon. During the review period, only two crises can be attributed to this type. Autonomic recessions appear in particular countries or in a group of countries, mismatch in the inflection point is from 1 to 5 years. The business cycles running time can differs from 1.5 to 30 years, frequency is not strict, at the same time the majority of cycles duration is 7 years. The beginning of recessions were at the same time or close to each other only in the period of global recessions and in the countries that have grate coherence in economic growth or in interconnected countries. Growth rates are not constant during some of the cycles. Regression analysis showed that growth rate in one cycle (which is determined as the period of time between two nearby peaks) depends on duration and depth of recession which was at the beginning of the cycle. The acceleration of recovery growth is not enough to compensate the crisis losses.","[Lyakin, Alexander; Darovski, Ivan] St Petersburg Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,Off 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Lyakin, A; Darovski, I (通讯作者)，St Petersburg Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,Off 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia.",a.lyakin@spbu.ru; ivan.darovsky@gmail.com,"Alexander, Lyakin/A-3672-2015","Alexander, Lyakin/0000-0002-0722-2517",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [8-010-00145],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"This paper is an output of a scientific project The Russian crisis 2014-2016: Cyclic, structural or systemic implemented with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research No. 8-010-00145.)",,18,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2612,2619,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300334,0

Cyber-resilience, i.e., the ability of a system to sustain - possibly malicious - alterations while maintaining an acceptable functionality, is recognized as one of the keys to understand how much damage can be brought to a system and its surrounding environment in case of a successful cyber-attack. In this paper we compare methods to assess resilience considering both concrete simulation and symbolic simulation. Our ultimate goal is to provide maintainers and other stakeholders with a dynamic and quantitative measure of cyber-resilience.

This process brings many benefits to the people of individual countries and to the world economy as a whole. These benefits include increased productivity, increased opportunities for self-realization, improved quality of life, increased cultural exchange and other positive effects. Indeed, unification and standardization processes provide the opportunity to produce many products based on standards that are acceptable to virtually all countries, thereby reducing production costs, leading to lower market prices, as well as greater understanding and mutual understanding of cultures and values of different peoples. However, many scholars and practitioners point to the negative consequences of globalization, which are devoted to the relevant research papers and articles. Consolidation of production companies through mergers and acquisitions leads to a narrowing of competitive space, both in individual countries and in the world as a whole. Reduced competition in any market has always been considered a negative factor, as it reduced incentives for companies to develop. At the same time, the proponents of globalization argue that larger companies have greater opportunities for development. The main task of civilization is to prevent such a course of development of globalization processes, which can lead not to increase, but to reduce the quality of life and the emergence of a situation where the voice of the consumer is completely insignificant for those who want to make money on it.","[Popov, Yuri Leonidovich] Kovrovskaya St 10,Apartment 37, Volgograd 400001, Russia; [Gushina, Yulia Valeryevna] Eliseeva St 17,Apartment 170, Volgograd 400120, Russia; [Karpushova, Svetlana Evgenievna] Lermontov Str 8,Apartment 8, Mikhailovka 403343, Volgograd Regio, Russia",,"Gushina, YV (通讯作者)，Eliseeva St 17,Apartment 170, Volgograd 400120, Russia.",yur76823754@yandex.ru; jgushina@mail.ru; sfkse@yandex.ru,"Gushina, Julia/ABE-2469-2021",,,,,,22,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2321,2327,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300297,0

In the context of globalization, the socio-economic situation and the security situation, expressed through indicators, are among the most important aspects of quality of life. The security indicators and social component of socio-economic indicators are closely interconnected. Proof of the connection is the crime, which is one of the most important indicators of both the security and social situation in the society. The emergence of crime is influenced by several factors including the socio-economic situation of the population, the level of achieved education in the population, legal standards and the level of legal awareness of the population, but also in the context of globalization, by immigration and migration. The paper deals with the investigation of crime committed in Slovakia by citizens of other nationalities. The aim of the paper is to examine the impact of the process of globalization and open borders on the security situation expressed by crime. Research results in the form of proposals can be used to develop crime prevention programmes and projects focused on the elimination of the crimes committing by citizens of other nationalities. This should eventually lead to the decline of the crimes committed by citizens of other nationalities and increase the protection of persons and property.","[Soltes, Viktor] Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Dept Secur Management, Zilina, Slovakia; [Stofkova, Katarina Repkova] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Commun, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Soltes, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Dept Secur Management, Zilina, Slovakia.",Viktor.Soltes@fbi.uniza.sk; Katarina.Stofkova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Soltes, Viktor/E-4014-2017","Soltes, Viktor/0000-0002-2237-2249","VEGA [1/0696/16, 1/0755/18]",VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0696/16, VEGA 1/0755/18.",,17,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2805,2812,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300359,0

Company managers, if they want to succeed in the today's dynamic and highly competitive environment, should pay more attention to the strategic management process itself. In this paper results of a large-scale research survey are presented, conducted for a set of 456 companies from all over the Czech Republic, aimed at the status and importance of strategic management and at the impact of business environment on prosperity of enterprises. Using Pearson's chi-squared test we will determine dependence/independence of selected categorical variables on profitability of enterprises, including determination of the role and significance of the internal and external business environment using the general linear model. The obtained results indicate underestimation of strategic management in Czech enterprises, especially in the size category of small and medium-sized enterprises. From the point of view of influence of the corporate environment on profitability of the enterprises, the logit model has confirmed high importance of internal corporate resources and the mezzo-environment. Based on our comprehensive survey among Czech companies about their approach to strategic management we can conclude that strategic management and decision-making play and will continue to play an important role in corporate management, future development and competitiveness of enterprises, not only at the national but especially at the international level.","[Strakova, Jarmila] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Corp Strategy, Dept Management, Okruzni 10, Ceske Budejovice 37011, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Straková, J (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Corp Strategy, Dept Management, Okruzni 10, Ceske Budejovice 37011, Czech Republic.",strakova@mail.vstecb.cz,"Straková, Jarmila/ABE-8222-2020",,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1366,1376,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300175,0

This reflects the adoption of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) concept into corporate operations. Enterprises are responsible not only for the economic results, but also, among others, for their social and employee outcomes, which is why their activity is important in building good relations with employees, clients or local communities. In Poland, the obligation to disclose a certain minimal amount of information about corporate social responsibility in reports of non-commercial entities has existed for a long time. However, due to globalization processes, the manner and scope of these disclosures has changed over the years. In recent years, as a result of the adoption of Directive 2014/95/EU on disclosure of non-financial information and diversity by the European Union, the Member States, including Poland, have been obliged to harmonize domestic regulations regarding the manner and scope of disclosures on corporate social responsibility issues, including social and employee matters. The aim of the paper is to analyze the impact of international law regulations on the manner and scope of social and employee disclosures in non-financial reports of selected public interest entities in Poland, subject to the reporting obligation under Directive 2014/95/EU. The paper uses the methods of literature studies as well as analysis, deduction, and induction of data contained in non-financial reports of selected public interest companies. In the light of the conducted research, the authors positively assess the changes introduced by international law on the disclosure of social and employee issues, indicating that thanks to this a greater number of entities in Poland became subject to this obligation, and, at the same time, the rules of these disclosures have been clarified.","[Tkocz-Wolny, Katarzyna; Wszelaki, Aneta] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Accounting, Ul Bogucicka 3, PL-40257 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Tkocz-Wolny, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Accounting, Ul Bogucicka 3, PL-40257 Katowice, Poland.",katarzyna.tkocz-wolny@ue.katowice.pl; aneta.wszelaki@ue.katowice.pl,,"Wszelaki, Aneta/0000-0002-3790-6311",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,421,428,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300056,0

Creating a global rail transport system requires technical unification and standardization in particular countries. Railway in Poland constantly needs to care about its market position. It concerns also the accomplishment of long-term plans, including joining the common European and Asian rail transport system. It is a huge financial and technical challenge. Since the beginning of the economic transformation in 1989, the Polish railway has been working on its position on the market of cargo and passengers transport. Undoubtedly, today's Polish railway is very different from in the times of the political transformation. Changes concern not only a modernized rolling stock, but mostly technical and organizational transformation. However, on the brink of the Polish railway joining the high-speed transport system, one needs to ask about the preparation status of the country before entering the global, European railway transport system.

Therefore, improving conditions for digital economy development and reducing disparities in this regard has been considered as an important objective for the European Union. This aim was stressed in the most important strategic documents of the EU such as the Europe 2020 plan.

In a simple model of optimal volunteering, negative selection implies that a lower cost of volunteering would produce both an expanded and higher-skilled pool of volunteers, and greater societal benefits from volunteer work.","[Cozzi, Guido] Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Mantovan, Noemi] Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Sauer, Robert M.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England",University of St Gallen; Bangor University; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Cozzi, G (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ, St Gallen, Switzerland.",guido.cozzi@unisg.ch; n.mantovan@bangor.ac.uk; robert.sauer@rhul.ac.uk,"Sauer, Robert M./G-6472-2012","Mantovan, Noemi/0000-0002-5930-4880",,,,,28,7,7,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Several scholars have begun advocating the socio-technical approach to energy by noting that the mainstream conceptualization of energy challenges in strictly technological or economic terms does not capture the complexity and inertia inherent to energy systems. Moreover, the article also seeks to examine how well have recent interventions integrated pro-poor and low-carbon concerns, two of the major tenets of UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7. Findings suggest that initiatives studied take only partial consideration of key aspects of a socio-technical approach to the energy problem. Nonetheless, the initiatives have taken on board pro-poor and low-carbon concerns to a certain extent. Two main policy implications are drawn from this study: a continued focus on status quo approaches has the potential to generate investment inefficiencies; and an effective low carbon transition will require a broader discussions about the types of lifestyles people in sub-Saharan Africa aspire to.","[Baptista, Idalina; Plananska, Jana] Univ Oxford, Dept Continuing Educ, Sustainable Urban Dev Programme, Rewley House,1 Wellington Sq, Oxford OX1 2JA, England; [Plananska, Jana] Klasterem 371, Tabor 39003, Czech Republic",University of Oxford,"Baptista, I (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Continuing Educ, Sustainable Urban Dev Programme, Rewley House,1 Wellington Sq, Oxford OX1 2JA, England.",idalina.baptista@conted.ox.ac.uk; plananska.j@email.cz,"Baptista, Idalina/J-1589-2015","Baptista, Idalina/0000-0001-7052-8589",,,,,69,17,17,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,1,8,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.006,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800001,0

The recognition of a number of private sector initiated certification schemes as mechanisms to verify compliance with the requirements of the EU-Renewable Energy Directive has provided a strong stimulus for biofuels certification. The question asked in this article is: To what extent does the application of these standards effectively contribute to the sustainable production of bioenergy? The question is answered on the basis of a conceptual framework and literature review. Three elements of the effectiveness of market-based certification standards are reviewed: the substantive scope of emergent standards, the effectiveness of implementation, and levels and trends in market conversion. The proliferation of certificates for low quality standards, deficiencies in the certification process and low market conversion suggest that certification is an inadequate substitute for public regulation. For certification to hold any meaningful potential to strengthen sustainability governance in the biofuel sector, it must be embedded within a public governance system committed to redressing these deficiencies and structuring accountability not just towards global environmental values, but to local people and place.","[de Man, Reinier] Sustainable Business Dev, Rivierforel 45, NL-2318 MG Leiden, Netherlands; [German, Laura] Univ Georgia, Dept Anthropol, 255 Baldwin Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"German, L (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Anthropol, 255 Baldwin Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",reinier.de.man@rdeman.nl; lgerman@uga.edu,"German, Laura/AAM-9934-2020","German, Laura/0000-0003-4943-4515",,,,,94,34,36,0,47,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,871,883,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.047,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400084,0

The research results showed that growth in the scale of tourists and the scale of tourism output both result in the rapid growth of carbon emissions; the constant decrease in energy intensity helped inhibit carbon emissions from the stage of exploration to the stage of consolidation. However, the scale effects of tourists and the energy intensity had become the important positive factors to the growth of carbon emission, while the effects of energy structure and output scale on the growth of carbon emission had become negative factors. The inhibition of the growth of carbon emissions from optimizing the industrial structure was rapidly weakening at the stage of transformation and upgrading.

Four main clusters were investigated, structuring quantifiable indicators for financial, environmental, social and health related impacts of the use of a certain energy technology. The findings suggest that the Centrafricain stove alone or in combination with the mlc stove, was the most appropriate cooking technology for use in the case study region. These technologies were more appropriate than the traditional cooking system of the three stone fire.

It shows how, since the financial crisis, core players in the European energy industry ended up in a dualist limbo, between conventional and emerging business models. It documents how strategies and business models that delivered extraordinary financial performance in the first decade of the 21st century often failed dramatically after the 2008 financial crisis. Yet it finds that incumbents with 1) a greener energy mix, 2) smaller scale and, quite naturally, 3) better financial performance fared better than others The study explores the emergence of new business models and finds that most of the emerging business models circle around the customer interface where digital solutions allow more flexible interplay between consumption and production of energy, and/or between several service alternatives to fulfill basic needs for customer home comfort. The article also discusses important policy implications: For competition policy, it indicates a shift from challenges of scale and scope towards challenges of regulating networks and dominant platforms.

To increase the assumed positive effect of the feedback, the Dutch government aims to increase this download rate. Drawing upon insights from behavioral economics, the present study investigates the effects of alternative emails, inviting to download the feedback report, on 505 companies' download behavior, in a randomized controlled field experiment with two treatment groups and one control group. The download rates for our treatment groups are more than three times higher compared to the control group. Survey results indicate that the follow up behavior does not differ between the respondents who were nudged and those who were not. Moreover, we found indications that downloading the report induces the energy coordinators to consider energy-saving measures.

Located strategically between two continents, Turkey has a desire of becoming an international physical hub and transit corridor for natural gas, while at the same time improving its own energy security. Domestic Turkish demand and market regulations, existing and new sources of supply, as well as internal and external economic, regulatory and political factors interplay in the realization of these goals. The article argues that the potential Turkey has to become a significant player in natural gas transit depends on the simultaneous developments of the domestic political situation and the great political uncertainties in its neighborhood. If market developments allow, Turkey may become a hub for Russian gas through the Western part of the country, and it may become a hub for gas from Central Asia and the Middle East while also serving its Middle and Eastern parts. The outcome depends on domestic decisions colored by the economics of natural gas transportation and political developments in its surroundings.","[Austvik, Ole Gunnar] Lillehammer Univ Coll, Lillehammer, Norway; [Rzayeva, Gulmira] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England; [Austvik, Ole Gunnar] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rzayeva, Gulmira] World Energy Councils Global Gas Ctr, Geneva, Switzerland; [Rzayeva, Gulmira] Ctr Strateg Studies President Republ Azerbaijan, Baku, Azerbaijan",Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences; University of Oxford; Harvard University,"Austvik, OG (通讯作者)，Lillehammer Univ Coll, Lillehammer, Norway.",oga@oga.no; Gulmira.rzayeva@sam.gov.az,,,,,,,33,25,28,2,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,539,547,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.008,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200053,0

In this study, we assess the impact of various socioeconomic factors in a household's cooking fuel choice and motive for making a transition toward cleaner fuels. This study uses household level cross-sectional data (2011) and pooled data (1996, 2004, and 2011) from the Nepal Living Standard Survey. We use multinomial and binomial logit models for the empirical analysis. The results suggest that along with household income, other social and ecological factors play a critical role in inter-fuel switching decisions. We find that transferring property rights of government-owned forests to the communities encourages households to move towards cleaner cooking fuels. We also find that household head's education, distance to the firewood sources, energy access status and household income are significant factors influencing the households' fuel choice decisions. The policy implication is that increasing information spillover, involving local communities in forest management, and expanding alternative socioeconomic opportunities such as jobs and modern fuels in the remote regions play a vital role in encouraging the households to move towards cleaner energy sources.","[Joshi, Janak; Bohara, Alok K.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Joshi, J (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",jjoshi@unm.edu,,,,,,,72,50,54,4,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,507,523,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.031,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200050,0

However, countries such as India have recently made major progress in rural electrification. Who has benefited from these achievements? We focus on 714 villages in six energy-poor states of northern and eastern India to investigate trends in electricity access. We use data both from the 2011 Census of India and an original energy access survey conducted in 2014 and 2015. During the three years that separated the surveys, distance to the nearest town and land area lose their power as predictors of the percentage of households in the village that has access to electricity. In this regard, the Indian government's flagship rural electrification program seems to have managed to overcome a major obstacle to grid extension. On the other hand, socio-economic inequalities between villages related to caste status and household expenditure remain strong predictors. These findings highlight the importance of socio-economic barriers to rural electricity access and alleviate concerns about remoteness and population density as obstacles to grid extension.","[Dugoua, Eugenie; Liu, Ruinan; Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，420 West 118th St,712 Int Affairs Bldg, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,,ClimateWorks Foundation; Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation,ClimateWorks Foundation; Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation,"Urpelainen participated in original data collection.

We analyze data reported to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from 1994 to 2014 using linear regression to understand how the number of customers in a utility's territory, annual peak demand, and annual energy sales affect annual TD &A spending. Then, we use Edison Electric Institute data for 1960 to 1992 to show trends in TD &A spending between 1960 and 2014. We find that the number of customers in a utility's territory is the single best predictor for annual TD &A costs. Between 1994 and 2014, the average cost per customer was $119/Customer-Year for transmission, $291/Customer-Year for distribution, and $333/ Customer-Year for utility administration. Total TD &A costs per customer have been approximately $700 $800/Customer-Year since 1960, but the cost per kWh of energy sold was significantly higher in the 1960s because the average customer used less than half as much energy annually versus 2014. Thus, TD &A costs per kWh are likely to increase if kWh energy sales decline in the future unless cost recovery is transitioned to a mechanism not based solely on kWh sales.","[Fares, Robert L.; King, Carey W.] Univ Texas Austin, Energy Inst, 2304 Whitis Ave Stop C2400, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Fares, Robert L.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mech Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"King, CW (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Energy Inst, 2304 Whitis Ave Stop C2400, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",careyking@energy.utexas.edu,,,University of Texas Energy Institute,University of Texas Energy Institute,"This work was sponsored by the University of Texas Energy Institute as part of its Full Cost of Electricity study.

This paper documents the nation's struggle to build an electricity system, to improve security of electricity supply through portfolio diversification and to promote indigenous energy sources. This was a challenge for an (electrically) isolated island with little natural resources. The paper also identifies the ineffective policy decisions that left Ireland exposed to the 1970s energy crises. The crises did, however, provide a clear impetus for focusing Irish energy policy going forward. The successful deployment and integration of large-scale wind power was due to strong national and supranational policy decisions. In 2015, Ireland had the third highest wind energy share of national electricity demand (22.8%) of all IEA Wind Member Countries. The paper also traces Ireland's transition through market reform, regional fragmentation, and looks onwards to the EU internal market for electricity. In essence, this paper provides a holistic view of the implications of various policy decisions on the electricity sector along with the stresses of external factors on the electricity market and should be useful for policy makers elsewhere faced with similar decisions.","[Gaffney, F.; Deane, J.

Based on the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms in China during 1998-2005, this paper employs the Cox proportional hazard model to confirm that global, provincial and local forces are critical for the sustaining of large firms. Particularly, the presence of foreign firms shows strong competition effect at the prefecture city level but no spillover effect at the provincial level. Provincial market-oriented institutions and market potential however are crucial to sustain businesses in China. Non-state-owned enterprises such as private and foreign firms are more dependent on market-oriented institutions than state own enterprises. Firms which are able to reap from agglomeration economies and local governmental supports are more likely to sustain. In addition, local factors show different impacts on business sustaining in different regions. The findings indicate that both market and state can play a substantial role in sustaining businesses in transitional economies.","[He, Canfei] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Guo, Qi] Nankai Univ, Coll Econ & Social Dev, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Rigby, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Peking University; Nankai University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"He, CF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",hecanfei@urban.pku.edu.cn; guoqi0610@gmail.com; rigby@geog.ucla.edu,"Guo, Qi/HHM-6602-2022","Guo, Qi/0000-0003-2594-8634","Natural Science Foundation of China [41425001, 41271130]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"An earlier version was presented at the Third International Workshop of Urban, Regional and Spatial Economics in China, June 5-6, 2014, Shanghai.

Our paper first proposes a type of endogenous equilibrium methodology to dynamically derive the industrial carbon emissions standards. At the equilibrium, the sum of all carbon assets and liabilities is zero in the considered industry. Moreover, the standards fall over time with low carbon technological advance. Most importantly, combining Pigou's and Coase's ideas, we construct a fiscal instrument accounting for both carbon taxes and allowances based on the dynamically improved emissions standards and carbon trading prices. This No revenue for government method implements a self-operated ecology for carbon trading market. Finally, considering the Waterloo recession of carbon prices, we introduce an adjustment factor into the model, which generates a negative-feedback mechanism with carbon prices. To support our idea, we present the application to Beijing taxi industry in detail and raise relative policy implications based on the evidence.","[Liu, Yang; Han, Liyan; Yin, Ziqiao; Luo, Kongyi] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Beihang University,"Han, LY (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",hanly@buaa.edu.cn,"Yin, Ziqiao/AAL-8826-2020","Yin, Ziqiao/0000-0003-4340-5414; Liu, Yang/0000-0002-7720-2204","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173008, 71673020]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under projects no. 71173008 and no. 71673020.,,45,30,31,1,46,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,414,422,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.038,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200039,0

Social licence is a dominant narrative in the mining sector today and as a signifier of the sector's CSR credentials, the term is an influential one. Its capacity to confer project legitimacy, and hence avoid the risks of community opposition, helps explain why most companies seek to gain one. Today both gas proponents and opponents talk the language of social licence: the former to defend their projects, the latter to challenge them. Yet, beyond rhetoric, the precise meaning of social licence remains elusive. This paper uses a case study of community opposition to primarily coal seam gas projects in an eastern Australian region to explore how the absence of a precise meaning for social licence has created a strategic opportunity space for the industry's opponents to invest social licence with a potent democracy frame. This democracy framing has proved particularly effective as a contestation tool and helps explain the outcomes in this case.","[Curran, Giorel] Griffith Univ, Sch Govt & Int Relat, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Curran, G (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Sch Govt & Int Relat, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",g.curran@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,55,51,55,2,42,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,427,435,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.042,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800042,0

However, the nature and potential of various energy technologies that are capable of improving the energy and environmental conditions globally is a challenging task for governments and policy makers that have to make decisions on the allocation of funds in R & D. To do so, the optimal resource allocation to R & D should be determined by estimating the social rate of return for R & D investments. This paper aims to estimate the social rate of return of R & D on various energy applications and technologies such as energy efficiency, fossil fuels, renewable energy sources, and nuclear for the G7 countries. The results show that primarily R & D investment on Energy Efficiency technologies and Nuclear are the ones that yield high social benefits for all G7 countries while exactly the opposite holds for Fossil fuels.","[Inglesi-Lotz, Roula] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Inglesi-Lotz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",roula.inglesi-lotz@up.ac.za,,"Inglesi-Lotz, Roula/0000-0001-7509-4687",Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),The author would like to acknowledge the financial support received from Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA) for publishing working paper 618 and the insightful comments received from colleagues at various conferences and most importantly three anonymous referees that improved the paper.,,20,34,37,1,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,521,525,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.043,0.0,,,5,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800052,0

Therefore, over a brief period of time the probability of duplication is higher at short geographical distance.

Restructuring of the EU energy system induces changes in the energy mix and production with small effects on the EU GDP, 0.4% in 2030 and 1% in 2050 compared to the Reference scenario. Energy efficiency improvements, increasing penetration of renewables, fuel switching towards natural gas, and technical progress in process related to emissions abatement are identified as essential options to the EU INDC implementation. The electrification of final energy demand, particularly transport electrification, complemented with decarbonised power supply is found to play a critical role in the successful transition towards a low-carbon economy by 2050.","[Fragkos, Panagiotis; Tasios, Nikos; Paroussos, Leonidas; Capros, Pantelis; Tsani, Stella] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Lab E3M, 9 Iroon Politech St,Zografou Campus, GR-15773 Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Tsani, S (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Lab E3M, 9 Iroon Politech St,Zografou Campus, GR-15773 Athens, Greece.",stellatsani@gmail.com,"Tsani, Stella/I-5167-2015; Fragkos, Panagiotis/AAF-6123-2020","Tsani, Stella/0000-0002-7302-4930; Fragkos, Panagiotis/0000-0003-3596-0661; Capros, Pantelis/0000-0002-8463-5729; Paroussos, Leonidas/0000-0001-8251-7270",European Union [21.0104/2014/684427/SER/CLIMA.A.4],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union, MILES project, under contract to DG CLIMA (No. 21.0104/2014/684427/SER/CLIMA.A.4).",,43,138,142,10,121,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,216,226,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.023,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900021,0

It does not concern only economic indicators. Also related are the sociological and psychological impacts of regionalisation on the inhabitants. Until the inhabitants of a particular region start to feel the reflection of economic stability in the nearest surrounding regions, it is difficult to talk about the social stability of the state. The inhabitants want to feel their participation in positive globalisation trends in their own place of residence. Authorities of the European Union also understand that the importance of the region should be enhanced. There exist significant differences between regions in Europe - 75 % of investment is concentrated in Europe in the 14 % of the region in the Pentagon which lies between London, Hamburg, Munich, Milan, and Paris. On one hand the European Union is interested in growth, on the other side every growth can be a potential cause of further economic and social disparity between regions. European regional policy tries to implement practical solidarity among nations. In a number of areas which affect the country (region) in different ways and to varying degrees, it has become clear that citizens' participation in projects can greatly influence their success in the region. This concerns for example architecture, urbanism, but also the development of the region's economy. Interest in the development of the region is not entirely new. We cannot explain it just as a response to current globalization trends.","[Janosova, Denisa; Rybansky, Rudolf] Fac Mass Media Commun UCM, Namestie J Herdu 2, Trnava, Slovakia",,"Rybansky, R (通讯作者)，Fac Mass Media Commun UCM, Namestie J Herdu 2, Trnava, Slovakia.",djanosova@azet.sk; rudolf.rybansky@ucm.sk,"Jánošová, Denisa/AHB-4513-2022","Jánošová, Denisa/0000-0003-2826-7463",VEGA [1/0283/15],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is a partial report of VEGA No. 1/0283/15 project titled The aspects of marketing communication in the process of creating customer value on the B2C market in the context of maximizing market share in retail shopping gradient.,,15,0,0,2,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,804,811,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201038,0

These sanctions can be divided into three groups: 1. the restriction of access to Western financial markets and services; 2. a ban on exports to Russia of certain types of equipment; 3.a ban on exports to Russia of certain types of military equipment and dual-use equipment. In response, Russia has imposed a ban on imports of certain agricultural products from the EU, US and other Western countries and turned off certain programs within the framework of international cooperation in the field of security, science, education, culture and the interaction of non-profit organisations. At first, the macroeconomic effects of the sanctions were negligible due to the gradual introduction of sanctions, as well as measures taken by the Russian Government for their compensation. Later, however, the international sanctions have led to adverse effects within the Russian economy: loss of low interest credit financing for Russian companies, devaluation of the Rouble, high inflation, reduction of public consumption, loss of foreign investment etc. Additionally, the drop in energy prices, especially for oil and gas, has increased pressure on the Russian economy. This article discusses the impact of international sanctions on the Russian economy in terms of investment activity, analyses the positive and negative effects of international sanctions and gives forecasts of future developments of the situation.","[Meliksetyan, Svetlana Nikolaevna] Rostov State Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Finance, Dept Finance, Bolshaya Sadovaya Str 69, Rostov Na Donu, Russia; [Nusratullin, Ilmir Vilovich] Bashkir State Univ, Inst Econ Finance & Business, Dept Management & Mkt, Zaki Validi Str 32, Ufa, Russia",Rostov State University of Economics; Southern Federal University; Ufa University of Science & Technology,"Nusratullin, IV (通讯作者)，Bashkir State Univ, Inst Econ Finance & Business, Dept Management & Mkt, Zaki Validi Str 32, Ufa, Russia.",m.s88@bk.ru; nusratullin.iv@gmail.com,"Nusratullin, Ilmir/B-9365-2015","Nusratullin, Ilmir/0000-0001-7810-2945",,,,,19,2,2,2,9,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1549,1556,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202063,0

These processes require the uniformity of European Union policies, including monetary policy, cohesion policy, regional policy, and also fiscal policy. Fiscal policy decisions should primarily stimulate economic growth as well as stimulate or curb demand in the economy, mitigate business cycle fluctuations, reduce unemployment and ensure the sustainability of the public finance sector. So far, the fiscal policy has been national nature and has been shaped by national socioeconomic and political factors. In the context of globalization, decisions are increasingly made on the basis phenomena resulting from globalization and on the basis phenomena resulting from the openness of economies. The global economic crisis has intensified and widened the problem of rapidly rising debt of the Member States of the European Union. This problem requires making increasingly radical fiscal policy decisions. In the condition of globalization, fiscal policy decisions continue to be national solutions, but increasingly they have to take into account external shocks related to the internationalization of economic processes and they have take into account the impact of globalization on public revenues and expenditures. While business cycles are crucial for determining the dynamics of government budget deficits, in this paper we study the dynamics of budget deficits along the cycle. Thus, we present the model in which fiscal rules take into account two components: the cyclical bias and discretionary tax reductions.

A dynamic spatial panel approach. Regional Studies. This study analyzes unemployment differentials in European regions during the period 2000-11. To that end, a theoretical model with substantive spatial interactions among regions is developed. The solution implies a dynamic-spatial Durbin model specification including regional and institutional-level factors as explanatory variables. In conjunction with dynamic-spatial panel estimates, relative importance metrics are used to quantify the effect of regional disequilibrium, equilibrium and national-level factors. Relative importance analysis suggests that during the pre-crisis period, unemployment disparities were mainly driven by regional-level equilibrium factors. Nevertheless, labour market institutions are of major importance to explain increasing disparities during 2009-11.","[Rios, Vicente] Univ Publ Navarra, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Rios, V (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain.",vicente.rios@unavarra.es,"Rios, Vicente/GPP-4330-2022; RIOS, VICENTE/ABE-8312-2020","RIOS, VICENTE/0000-0002-9678-1379",'Excellence Grants Program' of the Caja Navarra Foundation,'Excellence Grants Program' of the Caja Navarra Foundation,This work was supported by the 'Excellence Grants Program' of the Caja Navarra Foundation.,,33,27,30,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Many countries of the world are currently pursuing a national energy policy in the field of the use of renewable energy sources. Among the government measures aimed at developing alternative energy are the formation of a new tariff policy in favor of the use of alternative energy sources, the use of insurance mechanisms, the establishment of a minimum level of energy costs produced with the use of alternative energy sources, etc. At the same time, the Russia's fuel and energy complex based on the use the traditional technology to ensure the national security.","[Rodionova, Irina A.; Shuvalova, Olga, V; Sakharchuk, Natalia S.] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, RUDN Univ, Moscow, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Sakharchuk, NS (通讯作者)，Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, RUDN Univ, Moscow, Russia.",rodionova_ia@rudn.university; shuvalova_ov@rudn.university; sakharchuk_ns@rudn.university,"Natalia, Sakharchuk/AAB-6048-2021","Natalia, Sakharchuk/0000-0001-7303-7961",,,,,16,1,1,1,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2191,2197,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204013,0

Their development is determined by many factors among which globalization, reindustrialization and technological revolution are really important. The visions of a collapse in global industry have not proved to be true, and the need for reindustrialisation has become a new paradigm for Europe. The large share in worldwide export of high-tech products became a key element in the development of modern economies, on the basis of which their competitive advantage is built on international arena. The development of high-tech industries in Poland, similarly to other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, started significantly late in comparison with developed countries. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to present spatial diversification of the level of high-tech industry development in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, with special emphasis on employment changes. The research period covers the years between 2008 and 2015. Implementation of the goal formulated in this way is achieved through discussions regarding the following areas: 1) the substance of the high technology industry; 2) trading in high-tech products; 3) innovativeness of high-tech sector; and 4) changes in employment in the high-tech industry in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.","[Skorska, Anna] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Labour Market Res & Forecasting, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland; [Wojcik, Andrzej] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat Econometr & Math, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice; University of Economics in Katowice,"Wojcik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat Econometr & Math, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",aanna.skorska@ue.katowice.pl; andrzej.wojcik@ue.katowice.pl,"Skórska, Anna/S-4599-2018",,,,,,15,3,3,1,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2409,2416,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204041,0

In this context, one of the directions of the EU's Common Commercial Policy towards the third countries in the last ten years has been the promotion of international trade with the rapidly developing countries of the BRICS region. For this reason, as early as in 2006, EU and India have launched the negotiations on signing a mutual preferential (free trade) agreement, which is continuing up to this day. It is obvious that such agreement could help to diversify the structure of EU's international trade, especially when trade relations with the more traditional trading partners (such as Russia) are becoming more problematic due to political disputes and sanctions. Therefore, the article seeks to answer the question what are the specific practical regulatory problems currently facing the international trade operators engaged in international trade business between the EU Member States and India and how they can be reflected/solved in the possible free trade agreement between them? To answer this question, the article discusses specific practical trade regulation issues in the last decade (since 2006), which are identified based on a case study of trade disputes between the EU and India on the World Trade Organization (WTO) level, EU level and national level of the EU Member States (using the Republic of Lithuania as the main example).","[Valantiejus, Gediminas] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Finance, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Katuoka, Saulius] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Law, Inst Int & European Union Law, Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University; Mykolas Romeris University,"Valantiejus, G (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Finance, Vilnius, Lithuania.",gvalantiejus@mruni.eu; skatuoka@mruni.eu,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2783,2791,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205023,0

Results revealed that the interregional trade has important spillover effects (SEs) on the emissions of each region, particularly in the middle and western regions, but the feedback effects are few. Although the eastern regional final demands have a smaller economic SE per unit than those of the middle and western regions in 2002-2010, its emission SE gradually exceeded that of the two other regions. The interregional trade policy has to be enforced in the future, but the emission SEs should be controlled efficiently. Therefore, the central government should continue to implement the policies on the reduction of energy and carbon intensities from the past decade, limit coal consumption, and encourage renewable fuel development. At the same time, the central government and the eastern region can help the middle and western regions control their carbon intensity by providing fiscal, technological, and training assistance. The middle and western regions should set strict admittance standards for energy-intensive plants that transferred from the eastern region.","[Zhang, Youguo] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Quantitat & Tech Econ, 5 Jianguomennei St, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Youguo] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Ctr Environm & Dev, 5 Jianguomennei St, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Zhang, YG (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Quantitat & Tech Econ, 5 Jianguomennei St, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China.",zhyouguo@cass.org.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [13CJY009]; Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 13CJY009) and Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

By analyzing all the main financial flows linked to the electric bill, the sales of electricity and the investment in photovoltaic systems, this study aims to identify the stakeholders that benefit or suffer the most from value transfers caused by photovoltaic electricity self-consumption compared to full injection. The results suggest a shortfall of revenue for the distribution system operator. An increase in the electric bill of other grid customers will undoubtedly offset this shortfall. Simultaneously, the French State would make savings for individual self-consumption projects below 100 kWp. The new policy also incentivizes the self-consumption for big consumers for whom it is more profitable and competitive. Self-consumption projects tend to be economically more attractive than projects in full injection when the photovoltaic system is not oversized for the electric demand. The policy may consequently imply risks for the equalization of electric grid charges among consumers, the sustainability of the current business strategy of utilities and the security of supply.","[Roulot, Jonathan; Raineri, Ricardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 340, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Roulot, Jonathan] Ecole Cent Nantes, 1 Rue Noe, F-44300 Nantes, France",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Nantes Universite; Ecole Centrale de Nantes,"Roulot, J (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 340, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.",roulot.jonathan@gmail.com; rraineri@ing.puc.cl,"Raineri, Ricardo/IXN-5000-2023",,,,,,26,10,10,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,459,473,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.035,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700043,0

However, the wind sector has witnessed a temporal and spatial asymmetrical growth in India over the last decade, attributed to policy inconsistency. We analyzed wind growth in six resource rich states of India from 2003 to 2016, using panel data regression, considering 16 exploratory variables categorized under policy, geographic, economic, social, technical and commercial heads. Contrary to expectation, both policy variables FIT and RPO came out as insignificant factors. The existing wind capacity and its share in the total generation capacity came out as significant drivers. Commercial factors like industrial tariff and utility's performance got reflected as other determinants. Stark variations were observed in state-wise analysis, with wind growth in some states responding to infrastructure factors like road network. Scaling up wind deployment in resource rich Indian states would require policy instruments contextualized to their economic profile, energy resources and power market.","[Thapar, Sapan; Sharma, Seema] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Management Studies, Delhi, India; [Verma, Ashu] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Energy Studies, Delhi, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Thapar, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Management Studies, Delhi, India.",sapan.thapar@yahoo.co.in; seemash@dms.iitd.ac.in; averma@ces.iitd.ac.in,"Sharma, Seema/ABE-5508-2020; Verma, Ashu/B-4782-2016","Sharma, Seema/0000-0001-8218-5560;",,,,,59,29,30,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,622,638,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.004,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700058,0

Energy is used in the production of the final consumption good. The energy sectors differ on the exhaustibility of the energy resource. Oil is an exhaustible resource, coal is an abundant resource, and a green energy sector uses labor. Oil and coal use increases the stock of carbon in the atmosphere, which generates a climate externality. Standard Pigouvian taxation prescribes that a uniform tax on all carbon energy inputs is optimal. This uniform tax must be equal to the social cost of carbon because this is the externality that the usage of these inputs generates. I consider a policymaker who cares about future generations and may discount the future less than the individuals in the economy. This paper's main theoretical result is that the uniform taxation rule does not carry over to an economy with a low social discount rate. In particular, the optimal carbon tax on oil does not equal the optimal carbon tax on coal. Moreover, while the optimal tax on coal equals the social cost of carbon, the optimal carbon tax on oil follows a more general formula.","[Elisa Belfiori, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Argentina, Fac Ciencias Econ, Av Alicia Moreau de Justo 1400, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Pontificia Universidad Catolica Argentina,"Belfiori, ME (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Argentina, Fac Ciencias Econ, Av Alicia Moreau de Justo 1400, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",elisa_belfiori@uca.edu.ar,,,,,,,17,7,7,1,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,292,299,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.026,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800030,0

This analysis focuses on the following three types of disputes caused by: (i) PV system installation quality, (ii) PV system performance degradation and (iii) natural disaster damage. Based on interviews and examination of the PV plants in dispute, it was drawn that conflicts between the stakeholders stem from limitations to utility-scale PV plants' evaluation and technical dispute management, lack of PV module reliability and lax contract terms for procurement. To mitigate the conflicts between domestic PV stakeholders, the following four policy improvements are suggested: improvements of PV plants' deployment procedure and quality assurance system that can detect failures of equipment in early stages, introduction of a government-led dispute settlement system, enforcement of strict quality standards for PV modules and provision of information on PV procurement specifications. The lessons and suggested remedies will help policy makers understand the domestic PV market and redesign the policies for mitigation of potential disputes.","[Kim, Ik-Pyo] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept New & Renewable Energy Engn, 30 Pildong Ro 1 Gil, Seoul 04620, South Korea; [Hwang, Ha Sung] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Media & Commun, 30 Pildong Ro 1 Gil, Seoul 04620, South Korea; [Jung, Jin-Woo] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Div Elect & Elect Engn, 30 Pildong Ro 1 Gil, Seoul 04620, South Korea",Dongguk University; Dongguk University; Dongguk University,"Hwang, HS (通讯作者)，Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Media & Commun, 30 Pildong Ro 1 Gil, Seoul 04620, South Korea.;Jung, JW (通讯作者)，Dongguk Univ Seoul, Div Elect & Elect Engn, 30 Pildong Ro 1 Gil, Seoul 04620, South Korea.",hhwang@dongguk.edu; jinwjung@dongguk.edu,"Kim, Ikpyo/JCO-7100-2023; Jung, Jin-Woo/AAL-4134-2020","Jung, Jin-Woo/0000-0003-3429-5049",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2018R1D1A1B07046873],Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education,This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (No. 2018R1D1A1B07046873).,,58,5,5,2,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,452,463,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.038,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800045,0

This paper extends the component-based approach to estimating future learning rates to the case of a technology with multiple variants. It sets out a bottom-up method for estimating the composite learning rate including the situation where the proportional contribution of the different variants changes as cumulative production increases. The method is demonstrated for carbon storage using representative cost and distribution data from recent studies of storage in the European region. Carbon storage comprises four technology variants defined by the nature of the storage reservoir - (onshore or offshore) depleted oil & gas reservoirs and (onshore or offshore) saline aquifers - and each variant has a different learning rate reflecting its different cost structure. Moreover, the proportional contribution of each variant to total storage is likely to change with the growth of global storage capacity. The composite learning rate for carbon storage is estimated for scenarios in which the relative contributions change: a negative learning rate is determined in one scenario.","[Upstill, Garrett; Hall, Peter] UNSW Canberra, Sch Business, Northcott Dr, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Upstill, G (通讯作者)，UNSW Canberra, Sch Business, Northcott Dr, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",g.upstill@adfa.edu.au; p.hall@adfa.edu.au,,,,,,,39,8,9,3,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,498,505,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.017,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800049,0

This paper examines the carbon value of distributed photovoltaic generation, analyzes the influencing factors and further illustrates how these factors affect the value. First, it introduces the method of carbon asset valuation to distributed photovoltaic generation, which produces lower carbon emissions than most other energy sources. Second, based on mean estimates of the internal determining factors for the carbon assets of distributed photovoltaic generation, this paper provides an estimated value of the carbon assets. Third, under uncertain conditions and accounting for the time factor, it uses Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the sensitivity of the carbon asset value of distributed photovoltaic generation. The results indicate that (1) distributed photovoltaic generation has a carbon asset value; (2) the carbon asset value of distributed photovoltaic generation is determined by the carbon reduction level, the power generation capacity and the carbon price; and (3) carbon price fluctuations affect the carbon asset value of distributed photovoltaic generation much more than the power generation capacity.

Drawing from the source credibility theory, this study examines the public's credibility perceptions of nuclear-related information sources, and their trust in potential stakeholders. Guided by the psychometric paradigm, this study also explores public perceptions of risks, benefits, and support. Four focus group discussions were conducted with Singaporeans aged 18-69. Participants across different age groups (e.g., Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers) concurred in their trust of potential stakeholders, risk perception, cost perception, and support. Intergenerational differences were observed for participants' media use, credibility perceptions of nuclear-related information sources, and benefit perception. This study contributed theoretically by applying the source credibility theory and psychometric paradigm in an under-studied context. Practical implications were provided for policymakers and communication practitioners to effectively evaluate public awareness and acceptance for nuclear energy. Directions for future research were discussed. In conclusion, intergenerational similarities were observed for Singaporeans' perceptions of risks, costs, and support. Meanwhile intergenerational differences were noted for their credibility perceptions of nuclear-related information sources, trust in potential stakeholders, and benefit perception.","[Ho, Shirley S.; Looi, Jiemin; Chuah, Agnes S.

This renewed interest in capacity mechanisms raises the question of the cohabitation of both relatively well-integrated short-term energy markets and national generation capacity mechanisms. This paper examines a key issue of generation adequacy policies in a multi-market environment: the effect of foreign generators' and interconnectors' inclusion in national capacity mechanisms. The results show that the absence of cross-border participation could lead to significant social welfare losses associated with over and under-capacity procuring risk. This implies a vicious circle: as capacity mechanisms over or under-procure capacity, cross-border trade of electricity becomes more distorted, which in turn undermines the effectiveness of capacity mechanisms themselves. The findings also show that the inclusion of interconnectors in national capacity mechanisms could induce investments in merchant interconnections by compensating for network externalities and adjusting profit levels on the basis of the interconnection costs. However, despite the participation of interconnectors in capacity mechanisms, the exclusion of foreign generation of this market-based scheme undermines efficiency. In the absence of a wider EU single capacity mechanism, the inclusion of foreign generators and interconnectors in national capacity mechanisms should ensure the most efficient cohabitation of the EU Single Market and national capacity mechanisms.","[Cepeda, Mauricio] Paris Dauphine Univ, Chaire European Elect Markets, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Cepeda, M (通讯作者)，Paris Dauphine Univ, Chaire European Elect Markets, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",mauricio.cepeda@fondation-dauphine.fr,,,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine University under aegis of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation; RTE; EDF; EPEX Spot; CELEST,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine University under aegis of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation; RTE; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); EPEX Spot; CELEST(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"This paper has benefited from the support of the Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine University under the aegis of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation, supported by RTE, EDF, EPEX Spot and CELEST.

For identification, we rely on a generalized ordered probit model. The findings reveal that, as the size of the enterprise becomes larger, it is more likely the enterprise will undertake energy efficient practices and technologies. This may be because larger enterprises are less likely to face constraints related to capital or know-how to adopt these technologies. Further, clustered enterprises are also more likely to use energy efficient technologies, revealing spillover effect of being located in the same place or it may reflect entrepreneurs' predisposition towards efficiency. By contrast, entrepreneurs who perceive pro-environmental activities as unnecessary and costly are less likely to use energy efficient technologies. Our results imply that expansion of industrial zones (clusters) to newly established enterprises may help in increasing adoption of energy efficient technologies. Further, informational (educational) campaigns about the private and public (environmental) benefits of energy efficient technologies are also important.","[Hassen, Sied; Gebrehiwot, Tagel; Arega, Tiruwork] Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, Environm & Climate Res Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",,"Hassen, S (通讯作者)，Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, Environm & Climate Res Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",seidy2004@gmail.com; tagelgebrehiwot@gmail.com; tiruarega21@gmail.com,"Arega, Tiruwork/L-2518-2019",", Tiruwork Arega/0000-0002-1717-5144","Norwegian Embassy at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; European Union; Canadian International Development Research Center (IDRC)","Norwegian Embassy at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; European Union(European Union (EU)); Canadian International Development Research Center (IDRC)(International Development Research Centre - IDRC)","We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers and editors of this journal for providing useful comments and suggestions.

Applying chaos theory, this case study focuses on Petrobras, a listed corporation controlled by the Brazilian government, in its role of implementing the national energy policy. The main findings of semi-structured interviews show that the slump in oil prices in 2015 associated with a corruption scheme in the company led to institutional and organizational chaos. Recent events led to Petrobras' internal reorganization in favor of the national market instead of internationalization. Nowadays, strategic management policy is the board of directors' primarily responsibility, and without political interference at the organizational decision-making level, Petrobras can be a social and economic policy tool while achieving its own financial goals. SOEs can make strategic decisions that allow facing chaotic events, thus restoring the internal equilibrium. Finally, the political will to define institutional rules leading to improved corporate governance is essential for successful organizational achievements.","[Silvestre, Hugo Consciencia; Lamba, Jorge Routte; Correia, Aldenisio Moraes] Univ Integracao Int Lusofonia Afrobrasileira UNIL, Ctr Policy & Publ Adm, Campus Liberdade,Ave Abolicao 3, BR-62790000 Redencao, CE, Brazil; [Gomes, Ricardo Correa] Univ Brasilia, Fac Econ Adm & Contabilidade FACE, Campus Darcy Ribeiro,Modulo 25, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Silvestre, HC (通讯作者)，Univ Integracao Int Lusofonia Afrobrasileira UNIL, Ctr Policy & Publ Adm, Campus Liberdade,Ave Abolicao 3, BR-62790000 Redencao, CE, Brazil.",hmcsilvestre@unilab.edu.br; gomesric.rg@gmail.com; jlambaroutte@gmail.com; aldenisio.mc@gmail.com,"Gomes, Ricardo/V-4450-2019; Silvestre, Hugo C/D-6578-2017; Gomes, Ricardo/AAY-4978-2020; Correia, Aldenisio Moraes/R-2766-2019","Gomes, Ricardo/0000-0002-4164-5986; Silvestre, Hugo C/0000-0001-7654-6577; Correia, Aldenisio Moraes/0000-0002-8058-9542",,,,,76,7,8,2,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,87,96,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.028,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200009,0

This policy has led to the empowerment of women and protection against health hazards. A decision support system (DSS) is proposed to quantitatively analyse the implementation of PMUY in real time. This approach is first of its kind for analysis of a national level energy policy. The system uses mixed integer linear programming approach to mathematically formulate the policy using input parameters, decision variables and their relationships. The DSS requires input parameters namely distributing capacity of a LPG dealer, subsidised cylinders available per connection, number of households, and LPG penetration required. We have analysed different scenarios varying the input parameters mentioned. The decision support system has deterministically found the number of dealers required and LPG penetration in a region projecting both BPL and aggregate household coverage. The system helps in making sound decisions based on quantitative modelling ensuring optimal implementation of the policy. This kind of decision support system can be formulated for various policies to make sound decisions based on strong quantitative evidences.","[Aggarwal, Shubham; Tiwari, Manoj Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Kumar, Sudhanshu] Indian Oil Corp Ltd, Minist Petr & Nat Gas, Delhi, India; [Aggarwal, Shubham] House 881,Raggha Pathak St, Hathras 204101, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Indian Oil Corporation Ltd,"Aggarwal, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.;Aggarwal, S (通讯作者)，House 881,Raggha Pathak St, Hathras 204101, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shubhamaggarwal027@gmail.com; sudhansu@indianoil.in; mkt09@hotmail.com,"Tiwari, Manoj Kumar/B-3592-2012","Tiwari, Manoj Kumar/0000-0001-8564-1402",,,,,21,14,15,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,455,461,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.011,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000040,0

SDA reveals that size-related, technological and structural components have contributed substantially to changes in virtual water use. Network analysis offers new insights about the vulnerability of the system to shocks through trade links across country-sector pairs. Our analysis highlights a possible trade-off in the increasing importance of virtual water trade: the efficiency improvement in granting access to virtual water might come at the cost of increasing systemic vulnerability. Overall, the great unbalance between water availability and usage combined with rigidity of global consumption and production networks and the risk of cascade effects imply increasing vulnerability of the virtual water network to shocks propagation.","[Distefano, T.] Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Riccaboni, M.] IMT Sch Adv Studies, AXES, Piazza S Francesco 19, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Riccaboni, M.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat MSI, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Marin, G.] Univ Urbino, Dept Econ Soc Polit, Via Aurelio Saffi 2, I-61029 Urbino, Italy; [Marin, G.] SEEDS, Ferrara, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; KU Leuven; University of Urbino,"Distefano, T (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",tiziano.distefano@polito.it,"Marin, Giovanni/A-1917-2014; Distefano, Tiziano/AAR-2458-2021; Riccaboni, Massimo/D-4102-2009","Marin, Giovanni/0000-0002-7396-1561; Distefano, Tiziano/0000-0002-1593-6480; RICCABONI, Massimo/0000-0003-4979-8933",,,,,61,31,34,5,60,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4284,,,WATER RESOUR ECON,Water Resour.

Detection and evaluation of both spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence in discrete Markov chain models, which have been widely applied to the study of regional income distribution dynamics and convergence, are vital, but under-explored issues. Indeed, in this spatiotemporal setting, spatial effects can take much more complex forms than that in a pure cross-sectional setting. In this paper, we address two test frameworks. The first is a conditional spatial Markov chains test framework, which can be used to detect spatial heterogeneity and temporally lagged spatial dependence; the second is a joint spatial Markov chains test framework, which tests for contemporaneous spatial dependence. A series of Monte Carlo experiments are designed to examine size, power and robustness properties of these tests for a range of sample sizes (spatial temporal dimensions), for different levels of discretization granularity and for different number of regimes. Results indicate that all tests display good size property except when sample size is fairly small. All tests for spatial dependence are similar in almost all aspects-size, power and robustness. Conditional spatial Markov tests for spatial heterogeneity have highest power for detecting spatial heterogeneity. Granularity of discretization has a major impact on the size properties of the tests when sample size is fairly small.","[Kang, Wei] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Rey, Sergio J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Geospatial Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Kang, W (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",wkang12@asu.edu; sergio.rey@ucr.edu,"Kang, Wei/Z-4424-2019","Kang, Wei/0000-0002-1073-7781",National Science Foundation [SES-1421935],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant SES-1421935.,,28,7,7,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The results show that areas experiencing a natural gas extraction boom suffer an increase in overall violent crimes, while property crimes remain similar to non-boom areas.

Thus, this study aims to measure factor price distortions and estimate their impact on energy efficiency based on an empirical analysis of 30 provinces of China during 2004-2013 using the stochastic frontier analysis framework. Results yielded three important findings: (1) Technical efficiency was the highest in eastern China, which still remains low at around 0.7980, followed by central China and western China, and there were growing gaps among the above areas. (2) Capital price was relatively high while energy price was relatively low compared with labor price, and the relative allocative efficiency of energy got worse over time. (3) Energy efficiency loss among the three regions showed convergence trends. Policy implications are summarized as follows: (1) Measures such as adjusting energy consumption structure and improving production technology and management levels can reverse the trend of declining technical efficiency.

As such, methods are needed to assess local energy systems on a broad scale. This study demonstrates one such approach for Switzerland. Clustering techniques are applied to multidimensional municipal data sets in order to define a set of representative local energy system archetypes for Switzerland. Data includes local energy resource potentials, existing heat and electricity energy demands by sector, and the developed environment classification for approximately 2300 municipalities. Select archetypes are analyzed using a cost optimization model to determine the optimal utilization of local resources and decentralized generation technologies until 2050 under different national energy policy scenarios. Local energy resources provide approximately 40% of municipal heat generation (largely using solar, waste, and wood potentials) and 20% of municipal electricity generation (largely using photovoltaics) by 2050, on average across the modeled archetypes. Urban archetypes demonstrate high rooftop solar and waste potentials and usage rates, while smaller rural and suburban archetypes exhibit relatively high manure, wood and small hydro potentials and usage. Efficiency measures (e.g., renovations) and high CO2 prices are vital to achieving long-term local energy demand and emissions reductions.","[Yazdanie, Mashael; Densing, Martin; Wokaun, Alexander] Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy Econ Grp, Lab Energy Syst Anal, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute,"Yazdanie, M (通讯作者)，Paul Scherrer Inst, OHSA E03, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",mashael.yazdanie@psi.ch; martin.densing@psi.ch; alexander.wokaun@psi.ch,"Densing, Martin/K-3077-2013","Densing, Martin/0000-0003-4477-1299; Yazdanie, Mashael/0000-0003-3834-1073",Competence Center for Energy and Mobility (CCEM) [801_IDEAS4cities],Competence Center for Energy and Mobility (CCEM),This work has been supported by the Competence Center for Energy and Mobility (CCEM) (grant number: 801_IDEAS4cities).,,44,13,14,1,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,516,533,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.045,0.0,,,18,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000047,0

Yet, this never materialised. This article examines a previously unanalysed component of this policy failure by comparing and contrasting policy and farmer perspectives on marginal land as a suitable site for energy crops. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 32 livestock, arable and mixed farmers in England this research suggests that the policy framing of energy crops on marginal land to resolve sustainability controversies, was translated by the farming community into 'energy crops are for marginal land'. This acted as a multifaceted barrier to dedicated energy crops due to complex interactions between farmers' personal and cultural values, on farm practices, technologies, regulations and market developments. Farmers, never considered their land marginal enough, consequently this policy framing invoked considerable resistance. This highlights the importance of embedding understandings of farmers' cultural values, on-farm practices, technological change, and tensions between different bodies of regulation when articulating new policy initiatives and the way in which policy narratives translate into practical settings.","[Helliwell, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Inst Sci & Soc, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Helliwell, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Inst Sci & Soc, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",lqzrh@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Helliwell, Richard/0000-0002-3765-7482",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the University of Nottingham Doctoral Training College (DTC) [1095542],Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the University of Nottingham Doctoral Training College (DTC),"The author would like to thank Dr. Sujatha Raman, Dr, Susanne Seymour, Dr. Paul Wilson, and Dr. Alison Mohr for their constructive comments on an earlier version of this paper.

As a cost-savings measure, many cities have recently made large investments in energy efficient light emitting diode (LED) streetlights. Most LED streetlights produce a different wavelength of light that is often brighter than that produced by existing lights, which has led to high-profile debates on their impacts to the environment, human health, crime, and transportation safety. However, there is a lack of credible empirical evidence on the direction and magnitude of LED streetlight externalities, including their impacts to subjective well-being. To address this knowledge gap, we investigate local externalities of investments in LED streetlights across the 100 largest US counties by population using subjective well-being data from the US CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System over 2005-2010. Difference-in-differences results suggest that LED retrofits generate significant positive well-being impacts, varying by respondent demographic characteristics and the number of streetlights replaced. On average, installing LED streetlights generates an externality equivalent to a $477 (6.9%) increase in per capita monthly household income.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate two types of environmental regulations government intervention and voluntary regulation, showing that both can induce the collective action of imperfectly competitive firms to abate pollution, which increases their profits as well as social welfare. A pollution tax can prompt a firm to raise output if the productivity gain arising from total pollution reduction offsets the firm's pollution cost. We characterize the optimal pollution tax and demonstrate that the combination of a pollution tax and an output subsidy can lead to the social optimum. Voluntary regulation tends to fully internalize the productivity effect of reduced pollution for firms, although it facilitates firms' collusion in restricting production. Moreover, we conduct a simulation evaluating the welfare consequences of the two regulations in comparison with the social optimum. (C) 2017 ElsevierB.V.

Despite the role of biogas in achieving these wider benefits, the engagement of stakeholders such as farmers has been low and the barriers to their participation in biogas production is not well understood. This study examines farmers' willingness to participate in a unique, manure-based collective biogas investment based on a discrete choice experiment study of Danish farmers. Our results show that the majority of farmers, including farmers who never considered investing in biogas before and farmers that already participate in conventional biogas plants, are interested in a partnership-based biogas investment (PBI). A mixed logit model with flexible distribution shows that farmers' participation in PBI is mainly motivated by a moderate number of partner farmers, short distance between the farm and the plant, contract options to sell biogas, an option to cancel the partnership, and free startup consultancy. Farmers are willing to accept a significant reduction in subsidy to acquire favorable aspects of the PBI. A second stage analysis of farmers' intensity of participation also reveals that an increase in livestock units, involvement in off-farm activity, increase in farm size, and positive view towards investment enhance willingness to supply manure. Linking results from discrete choice and corner solution models, we estimate the average manure supply to a partnership-based biogas plant to be around 96,000 tons/year. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This research aims to assist organisations in choosing a service by modelling the selection process along decision criteria via the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This analysis includes evaluations by surveying experts for their opinions and an assessment of objective decision factors such as technical feasibility, business potential, behavioural change and innovativeness. It was found that behavioural and business factors are most important for organisations choosing new services, indicating that there should be a stronger focus on highlighting and assessing these aspects in future research. Additionally, all ICT-based services still ranked closely to each other, demonstrating that it is neither imperative nor easy to identify a single service. It can be concluded that energy providers should adopt a wider approach by offering a digital platform of energy services.

The investigation offers detailed information about this interaction, for different sub-periods of time and frequencies. It also reveals the lead-lag nexus between variables under cyclical and anti-cyclical shocks. The main findings reveal no comovement at high frequency between trade openness and gas emissions, confirming the 'neutral hypothesis' on short term. The CO2 emissions positively drive the trade openness at medium frequency. Hence, on medium term, the inexistence of strong environmental rules stimulate the international trade, especially the exports obtained based on 'pollutant capacities'. Curiously, the trade openness positively runs the gas emissions at low frequency. Herein, on long term, the interaction between trade and CO2 emissions is driven by the business cycle.","[Mutascu, Mihai] ESCE Int Business Sch, 10 Rue Sextius Michel, F-75015 Paris, France",,"Mutascu, M (通讯作者)，ESCE Int Business Sch, 10 Rue Sextius Michel, F-75015 Paris, France.",mihai.mutascu@esce.fr,"Mutascu, Mihai/AAK-5981-2020; MUTASCU, Mihai/AAK-5972-2020","Mutascu, Mihai/0000-0003-3837-3243;",,,,,63,95,97,6,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,443,455,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.034,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800044,0

This study uses a discrete choice model to analyse the factors influencing residents' mode choice in Beijing. A questionnaire survey was conducted in 2015, with sample data containing 865 respondents and 1704 trips collected. The results suggest that residents' mode choice is closely related to their characteristics. Moreover, our study has linked residents' mode choice with travel carbon emissions and estimated the emissions reduction potential of those policy measures aiming to improve public transport. For commuting and education trips, public transport improvements can reduce carbon emissions by 12.3-16.6% on average, but for other trip purposes, the reduction is only 2.9-6.8%. As commuting and education trips account for the largest proportion of urban residents' daily travels, it suggests that policy should primarily focus on the improvement of public transport and its particular support for major commuting routes.","[Yang, Yuan; Wang, Can] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wenling] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Peng] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Beijing Institute of Technology; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",canwang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"WANG, CAN/GWV-0969-2022; Zhou, Peng/A-6527-2012","Zhou, Peng/0000-0003-4726-3054","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71773062, 71525007, 71403141]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71773062, No. 71525007, and No. 71403141).

Policy discourse has increasingly asserted the role played by innovation in facilitating rapid recovery from economic shocks, whilst evolutionary thinking has highlighted the specific importance of innovation capacity. However, empirical evidence on this is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by providing new empirical analysis of the relationship between regional innovation capacity and the resilience of European regions to the crisis. It finds that regions identified as Innovation Leaders at the time of the crisis were significantly more likely to have either resisted the crisis or recovered quickly from it (i.e. within 3 years). This provides important insights for evolutionary approaches theorising the relationship between innovation and resilience.","[Bristow, Gillian; Healy, Adrian] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Bristow, G (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",Bristowg1@cardiff.ac.uk; HealyA2@cardiff.ac.uk,"Bristow, Gillian/M-6122-2015","Bristow, Gillian/0000-0002-5714-8247",,,,,68,110,120,33,139,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

At the same time, the emergence of the prosumer has created new opportunities for co-creation of distributed flexibility. As of yet, there is surprisingly little empirical analysis in terms of whether individuals are actually ready to co-create flexibility, and if so, under which conditions these resources can be mobilized by grid operators or electricity supply companies. We address this gap in the energy economics literature with three studies analyzing in total 7216 individual decisions in a series of choice experiments with 902 study participants in three main domains of residential energy prosumption: (1) solar PV plus storage, (2) electric mobility, (3) heat pumps. We develop a novel measure of the prosumers' willingness to co-create flexibility, and solicit their preferences for power supply contracts with varying levels of flexibility to derive implied discomfort costs. Our results indicate, that current and potential electric car and solar PV users exhibit a higher willingness to co-create flexibility than heat pump users. Reaping the potential in those two domains requires taking the prosumer perspective into account when designing policy instruments and creating adequate business models.","[Kubli, Merla; Loock, Moritz; Wuestenhagen, Rolf] Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ & Environm, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Kubli, Merla] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Sustainable Dev, Technopk Str 2, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland",University of St Gallen; Zurich University of Applied Sciences,"Wüstenhagen, R (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ & Environm, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",merla.kubli@unisg.ch; moritz.loock@unisg.ch; rolf.wuestenhagen@unisg.ch,,"Wustenhagen, Rolf/0009-0000-5306-3628; Kubli, Merla/0009-0007-3948-3491",nano-tera project HeatReserves; European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation programme [646476]; Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [646476] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,nano-tera project HeatReserves; European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)Horizon Europe Research Infrastructures); Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the nano-tera project HeatReserves, the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 646476 (EMPOWER) and from SCCER CREST and SCCER Mobility, which are financially supported by the Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI).

It considers a regulatory scenario in which the tax is applied only to emissions from the electricity sector and another scenario in which tax is applied to emissions from all economic sectors. The results show that the effects of a CO2 tax on sectoral prices and emissions in each country are very different for the same tax rate, but these effects are similar in each country when comparing both regulatory scenarios. This is explained by the composition (carbonization) of the electric generation (and energy matrix) of each of the countries, which significantly affects the effectiveness of CO2 taxes to reduce emissions. In addition, the economic sectors most affected by the different regulatory scenarios are similar in all countries.","[Mardones, Cristian] Univ Concepcion, Dept Ind Engn, Edmundo Larenas 217, Concepcion, Chile; [Baeza, Nicolas] Univ Concepcion, Dept Ind Engn, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion,"Mardones, C (通讯作者)，Univ Concepcion, Dept Ind Engn, Edmundo Larenas 217, Concepcion, Chile.",crismardones@udec.cl; nbaeza@udec.cl,"mardones, cristian/AAX-9163-2020; mardones, cristian/AAV-5245-2020","mardones, cristian/0000-0002-9389-7368;",,,,,34,55,56,1,61,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,262,273,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.001,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800025,0

It is found that the energy security conceptualization of the four economies in effect returns to the very original and conventional one: stable and reliable energy supply. However, these economies are different in the level of stability and reliability demanded. Why are they similar in energy security conceptualization whereas different in the level of stability and reliability demanded? Adopting documentation analysis, comparative study, and the varieties of capitalism theory, we find that the nature of economy constitutes the decisive factor that shapes energy security conceptualization. The coordinated market economies (CMEs) are more concerned about energy supply disruption than the liberalized market economies (LMEs). The paper demonstrates that despite numerous energy security concepts in the literature, resource-poor economies still adopt the original and conventional one in practice. The findings suggest that security of supply is the top measure for resource-poor economies to improve their energy security and creating a joint petroleum and LNG market would be desirable for the four economies in this study.","[Yao, Lixia; Shi, Xunpeng; Andrews-Speed, Philip] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,10-01,Bld A, Singapore 119620, Singapore; [Shi, Xunpeng] Univ Technol Sydney, Australia China Relat Inst, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia",National University of Singapore; University of Technology Sydney,"Shi, XP (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,10-01,Bld A, Singapore 119620, Singapore.;Shi, XP (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Australia China Relat Inst, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",xunpeng.shi@gmail.com,"Andrews-Speed, Philip/W-9578-2019; Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019; Andrews-Speed, Philip/Q-5692-2019","Andrews-Speed, Philip/0000-0003-1639-2021; Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395;",,,,,61,37,38,2,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,394,402,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.029,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800036,0

The study has employed a single-country regression to investigate the existence of the Kuznets curve hypothesis for the Ukraine economy over the period 1995-2016. The bounds testing (ARDL) approach to cointegration is applied to examine the long-run relationship between the variables. The results, when regressing Gini index and GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity, confirm the presence of hidden cointegration. The Granger causality test is also applied in order to test the existence of a causal relationship between the economic growth and income inequality.

An appealing feature of our approach is the possibility to control the underlying transition probabilities and, therefore, incorporate them within standard estimation methods. Given the resulting representation of the transition density, a Gibbs sampler algorithm based on the slice method is proposed and implemented. In the discrete-time case, special attention is placed to the class of generalized inverse Gaussian distributions. In the continuous case, we first provide a brief treatment of the class of gamma distributions, and then extend it to cover other invariant distributions, such as the generalized extreme value class.

Applying a matching procedure, we obtained a database of 170 in-park firms, together with 7190 out-park firms. After applying a fixed-effects quantile regression, the results showed that being located in an STP has a dual effect on firm performance. Although the location in an STP has a positive effect for high-growth firms, it has a negative effect for low-growth firms. Furthermore, among all STPs, the effect for science parks is stronger than that for technological parks. Regional Studies.

Dieser Aufsatz leistet einen Beitrag zum Verstandnis der Rolle von Wissenschafts- und Technologieparks bei der Forderung des Firmenwachstums. Unter Anwendung eines Abgleichverfahrens erhielten wir eine Datenbank mit 170 in Parks angesiedelten sowie mit 7190 nicht in Parks angesiedelten Firmen. Nach einer quantilen Festeffektregression zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass sich ein Standort in einem Wissenschafts- und Technologiepark in zweierlei Hinsicht auf die Firmenleistung auswirkt. Ein Standort in einem Wissenschafts- und Technologiepark wirkt sich auf Firmen mit hohem Wachstum positiv, aber auf Firmen mit geringem Wachstum negativ aus. Daruber hinaus fallt die Auswirkung in samtlichen Wissenschafts- und Technologieparks bei Wissenschaftsparks hoher aus als bei Technologieparks.

The European Union has been a global leader in the field that implements environmental restrictions and supports environmental friendly sustainable growth objectives. The example of these actions are climate change and energy objectives included in the Europe 2020 plan, which must be implemented by all the European economies. The disparities between the old and new EU countries can be considered as a natural result of differences in development level and consequence of different historical path. However, an interesting question relates to the problem of differences and similarities in this field concerning the developed old EU countries. As a result, the main aim of the article is to analyse similarities and differences between the EU-15 economies in regard to reaching climate change and energy objectives declared in the Europe 2020 plan. In order to monitor the result of the European countries the European Commission suggested five benchmark criteria. Therefore, the scientific problem should be considered as a multiple-criteria analysis task. As a result, to obtain the objectives of the article the Ward's clustering method was applied. The method allowed grouping the countries into homogeneous clusters for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015. The analysis was based on data from Eurostat. The conducted research confirmed disparities between the EU-15 countries, which are stable in time.","[Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Balcerzak, AP (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland.",adam.balcerzak@umk.pl,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,978,985,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300127,0

The main purpose of this study is to analyse the impact of local products on competitive abilities of small and medium-sized hotel enterprises. The survey results show that supply quality is significantly influenced by the offer of dominantly local products and also tourist satisfaction is significantly influenced by the offer of dominantly local products. The offer of dominantly local products is not significant for market share and quality of business cooperation with suppliers. The study also investigates that in small and medium-sized hotel enterprises, which mainly offered local products from farmers the share of organic ingredients is higher and that they give priority to domestic meals.","[Beran, Ivona Milic] Univ Dubrovnik, Maritime Dept, Dubrovnik, Croatia; [Krzelj-olovic, Zorica] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik; University of Dubrovnik,"Beran, IM (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Maritime Dept, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",imberan@gmail.com; zkrzelj@unidu.hr,"Krželj-Čolović, Zorica/ABD-9246-2020",,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,730,737,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300095,0

When thinking about the relationship between globalization and tourism, globalization can be considered a significant factor. This factor has a negative and positive impact on the development of tourism. Sophisticated logistics systems, the introduction of modern technologies and the removal of barriers (e.g., distance, boundaries, social connections, etc.) allow large numbers of inhabitants to overcome large distances. The paper deals with the development of outbound tourism in the Czech Republic. We analyse outbound tourism in the context of globalization trends. We analyse the period from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present. There is a wide range of conditions for the development of tourism, such as a reasonable disposable income, a sufficient pool of free time for the population or security. There are numbers of other important factors for client decision and destination choices. An important factor for decisionmaking is price competition, attractiveness of the destination, and more. Comparison of destinations for outbound tourism between different periods is based on selected indicators of the TTCI index (index of tourism competitiveness) and search of the literature.

Currently, we can find several research studies which examine the different methods of country risk and the empirical relationship between sovereign rating of a country and the components of its capital market. In our contribution, we will focus on two different methods of the country risk measuring. On the one hand, we have a sovereign rating method that measures the credit risk of the issuer (state). Using this method, we analyze in more details individual indicators used by credit rating agencies in the process of assessment the country credit risk. In contrast, we will use market based method - bond spreads, which responds more flexibly to the market situations. Similarly, the country risk in the stock market can be quantified - risk spreads on the stock market, warns the investor almost instantly about the emerging market situation.","[Chovancova, Bozena; Slobodnik, Patrik] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Banking & Int Finance, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Chovancova, B; Slobodnik, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Banking & Int Finance, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",bozena.chovancova@euba.sk; patrik.slobodnik@gmail.com,,,VEGA [1/0009/17]; Research & Development Operational Programme - ERDF [ITMS 26240120032],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Research & Development Operational Programme - ERDF,"This contribution is the result for the project VEGA (1/0009/17) The making of the Capital union in Europe and its impact on individual member counties, and the project,Creating excellence in economic research department for addressing the challenges of civilization in the 21th century (ITMS 26240120032) supported by the Research & Development Operational Programme funded by the ERDF.",,16,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2554,2561,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300327,0

IT-NE employment is spatially polarized in all three cities with a dual concentration in some suburban poles and central neighbourhoods.

Accordingly, we propose the nonparametric additive instrumental variable estimator (NAIVE) with the adaptive group Lasso. We theoretically demonstrate that the proposed estimator is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal. The adaptive group Lasso helps us select the valid instruments while the dimensionality of potential instrumental variables is allowed to be greater than the sample size. In practice, the degree and knots of B-spline series are selected by minimizing the BIC or EBIC criteria for each nonparametric additive component in the reduced form equation. In Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the NAIVE has the same performance as the linear instrumental variable (IV) estimator for the truly linear reduced form equation. On the other hand, the NAIVE performs much better in terms of bias and mean squared errors compared to other alternative estimators under the high-dimensional nonlinear reduced form equation. We further illustrate our method in an empirical study of international trade and growth. Our findings provide a stronger evidence that international trade has a significant positive effect on economic growth.","[Fan, Qingliang] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ WISE, Dept Stat, Sch Econ, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,,michaelqfan@gmail.com; wzhong@xmu.edu.cn,"Fan, Qingliang/J-9205-2019; Zhong, Wei/HKW-5896-2023","Fan, Qingliang/0000-0001-9560-3311;",,,,,51,13,15,0,29,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

However, barriers of agri-food trade were reduced or eliminated; there are still many obstacles to the totally free trade of agricultural products (e.g. restrictions, safeguards, bans, limitations, etc), especially in the European Union. Besides the WTO 's liberalization pressure and its multilateral negotiations, there are a lot of countries that have signed bilateral agreements. In this study, it was examined, what kind of bilateral agreements were entered into force by the EU and how was international agri-food trade influenced by these bilateral agreements as well as by restrict measures. For this, secondary data were analyzed by different statistical methods and the effect of trade measures was characterized by using this results. From the results it can be concluded that EU has preferred different agreements with the various country groups as well as EU has applied different kind of agreements in different eras. The EU's average growth rate of food trade and average share of food trade is highly variable by partner countries. Bilateral agreements have not always caused trade growth between the two partner regions. The EU's restrict measurements effect the EU's foreign trade, because these restrictions are applied to meat products and these commodities are imported the less in the EU.","[Gombkoto, Nora] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Var Ter 2, H-9200 Mosonmagyarovar, Hungary",,"Gombköto, N (通讯作者)，Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Var Ter 2, H-9200 Mosonmagyarovar, Hungary.",gombkoto.nora@sze.hu,,,[EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00017],,"This contribution is the result of the project EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00017 Initiatives to establish a new source of researchers and graduates, and development of knowledge and technological transfer",,9,0,0,0,1,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4571-6,,,,2018,,,,,,,141,148,,,,,,8,Business; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BN0SZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000473407100018,0

It is obtained annual data for the hotels' balance sheets and the profit and loss statements from Bureau van Dijk's AMADEUS international statistical database. It is argued that turnover of creditors' claims is positively affected by turnover of debtors' receivables among hotels in all selected countries. In some cases even current liquidity has a significant impact on that.

The internationalization and the entry of foreign producers into the national market shift the requirements to the quality of service to constantly higher levels due to competition. The quality of service is based on the quality of human resources, on the mutual interaction of the customer and the service provider. In services, there is larger place for ethics and enterprise culture, which is transferred to the external environment. The aim of the paper is to emphasize the importance of human resources in the direct contact with a customer, in the process of providing services, that combines the internal and external environment of the enterprise, and it is an important element in ensuring and building of the quality. Based on the results of an empirical survey, pointing to the individuality and the difference in the perception of the quality of service on the customer's side, and on the side of the manager of the company, through the evaluation of the contact persons. Among the contact persons of service presented identified socio-economic factors directly or indirectly influence the creation of the quality of services. Based on the achieved results, a model of implementation and quality assurance was developed for enterprise services. The model highlights the socio-economic factors of the each affected element and of critical points. By respecting these factors, elements and relationships, service processes can be continually improved or upgraded and they can become more effective.","[Jarmila, Klementova; Zuzana, Strokova] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Business Econ, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Jarmila, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Business Econ, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",jarmila.klementova@tuzvo.sk; zuzana.strokova@tuzvo.sk,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,600,607,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300079,0

The main causes of the crisis are known, but the consequences have not been expected to such an extent. Due to the continuous intensification of integration processes in the current period of globalization, it is possible to talk about a situation where there are virtually no significant barriers between individual economic entities at all levels, especially in the area of communication, movement and trade. Individual business entities perceive the quality of the business environment differently depending on a number of factors, for example depending on the subject matter, the life cycle of the business or the product, the conditions of the competitive environment, but also the phase of the economic cycle in which the economy is located. Many businesses suffer from problems that arise not only from the outside environment but also from their own internal environment. On the one hand, therefore, there may be sectorial risks, the general risks that operate outside the enterprise and usually affect all businesses or businesses operating in a particular sector or region. On the other hand, there may be problems arising from the internal environment, for example, lack of financial resources as an internal barrier, which may have different causes. Some small and medium-sized enterprises need foreign financial resources, which, however, due to their unfavourable credit ratings may be unavailable to them. The subject of the study is the impact of the financial and economic crisis on the availability of foreign financial resources for small and medium-sized enterprises, its manifestations in the management of enterprises.","[Juris, Roman; Gregova, Elena] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Juris, R (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",roman.juris@fpedas.uniza.sk; elena.gregova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Gregova, Elena/P-1820-2015",,project VEGA [1/0428/17],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0428/17 CREATION OF NEW PARADIGMS OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AT THE THRESHOLD OF THE 21STCENTURY IN CONDITIONS OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC.,,15,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1630,1636,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300208,0

Citizen reporting systems offer citizens fast and very simple way to draw attention to a problem in a particular territory (damaged benches, mess, broken pavement, uncut grass, landfills, etc.). We can distinguish mainly three types of citizen reporting systems: web based; module, which is part of city mobile application; and specialized mobile application for issue reporting. Such systems use citizens as sensing devices gathering data that help cities make their operations more flexible. This way of participation activates people to care about place they live - their city. Smart cities need active people who care and feel responsible for the city that is why the participation is one of main pillars of smart cities.

It is crucial for passengers how long the journey between two places will take. Due to the development of the infrastructure, the running time gradually decreases and the quality of the services provided gradually increases. The data for the analysis were primarily drawn from the annual reports of the most important carrier in the Czech Republic - Ceske Drahy. The annual report is a significant accounting document informing about the corporate economic phenomena. The aim of this article is to evaluate the development of running time when using the rail passenger services between selected cities in the Czech Republic between 2009 and 2018. In the article, those cities of the Czech Republic are selected, where the connection is provided by high quality trains. The conclusions of the analysis show that the most significant reduction of running time in the last 10 years occurred between Prague and Ceske Budejovice or Prague and Cheb. Paradoxically, in case of the fastest SuperCity Pendolino connections, running time between Prague and Ostrava was reduced by only 8 minutes. However, SuperCity services remain the fastest links in the country with an average service speed exceeding 118 km/h. On the other hand, line connections that have experienced the highest reduction in running time continue to show the lowest service speed.","[Krajnak, Michal] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic; [Meier, Vojtech] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Management, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava,"Krajnák, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",michal.krajnak@vsb.cz; vojtech.meier@vsb.cz,"Krajňák, Michal/T-5741-2017; Meier, Vojtěch/I-6309-2018","Krajňák, Michal/0000-0003-4924-3583;",[SGS SP2018/62],,This paper is an output of the science project SGS SP2018/62 Application of Selected Methods for Evaluation of Degree of Neutrality and Equivalence of Obligated Social Security Contributions.,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1179,1186,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300152,0

Global brands are playing a key role when positively influencing consumer behaviour for the benefit of long-term sustainability. By their attitude to the environment, producers are able to transfer such positive behaviour to their consumers and thus contribute to the challenge the whole society is currently facing - protection of natural resources and maintenance of sustainability.

During 2013-16, the Queensland government in Australia, examined establishing a fair and reasonable retail Feed-in Tariff (FiT) policy, noting it regulates state retail electricity consumption prices. A combined cost avoidance and stakeholder analysis was applied to show that determination of a fair and reasonable FiT for all stakeholders, while aspirational, is difficult to achieve. Typically, agreement on a fair tariff rate will depend on stakeholders' relative position in energy supply chains (service providers, retailers, suppliers, customers, advocates), and interpretations of fairness that can be shaped by competition in the supply area. Also, increases in financial benefits to PV customers might be considered unreasonable by non-PV customers and retailers that experience increases in electricity prices and operating costs. Importantly, the application of a retail FiT in regional and isolated areas requires careful energy policy design, taking account of network losses, remote and isolated customer metering, cost effective network control technologies, and diesel generator operating limits. The study also observed that shifting funding of FiT schemes from electricity distributors to competitive retailers will likely have negative consequences for retail FiT offerings and PV customer servicing.","[Martin, Nigel] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Management, ANU Coll Business & Econ, Copland Bldg 24,Room 1103,Acton Campus, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Rice, John] Univ New England, UNE Business Sch, W42 Rm 101,Armidale Campus, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",Australian National University; University of New England,"Martin, N (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Management, ANU Coll Business & Econ, Copland Bldg 24,Room 1103,Acton Campus, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",nigel.martin@anu.edu.au; john.rice@une.edu.au,"Rice, John/AAO-4080-2021","Rice, John/0000-0002-3923-4424",,,,,112,24,24,1,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,19,28,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.050,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800004,0

While this approach performs well there remain some unresolved issues, in particular; the optimal window length and the linking method. In this note, these questions are addressed.

It mentions twelve megatrends: mutual conditioning of globalization and localization, strengthening polarization of preferences by tourist oriented on comfort and adventure, downsizing the world for travel, informational and communicational technology, the so called fast track travel, increasing predominance of buyers, destination as a fashion accessory, creating product and marketing. This is followed by the analysis of impact of globalization on demand trends in international travel. The demand is made by customers, who extremely emphasize quality, original experiences, nontraditional experiences, high comfort, and safety. Interest in cultural and sports activities, wellness or health improvement stays is sharply increasing, too. Globalization influences regions therefore the article also focuses on the trends connected to globalization in The Moravian-Silesian Region (MSR). Current trends in tourism for this region are stated in The Strategy of Directing Tourism in the MSR, in the complete version of 2015. The research from 2017-2018 was targeted on services of travel agencies. The research showed that three fifths of customers use the Internet whereas one fifth uses the sale portals.

Water is indispensable for primary production, in the production of all foods, and it forms the basis of all beverages. Sufficient quantities of drinking water, as well as plenty of food and drinks for all people, is a prerequisite of their lives in economic, social and environmental terms. The US ranks 1st in the world in the waste of food. Total value of snack foods is $ 48.3 billion. This waste costs around a million dollars (Kalousova, 2015). It is important to avoid an enormous waste of everything, where water is an indispensable resource. In our department, we are dealing with the issue of food waste in scientific research. The largest share of food waste, as reported by expert studies, has households (42-53%). Previous research therefore explored the reasons why and what food is wasting in households and how to prevent such waste. Subsequent research focuses on wasting beverages because water is the basis for its production.

We find that the proposed governance amounts to a densely meshed coordination of policies between the European level and Member States. Compared to the present governance system, the enhanced mechanism can draw on significant synergies and reduce administrative costs. Our review of stakeholder positions reveals strong acceptance of enhanced coordination. Nonetheless, our review identifies some potential flaws in terms of governance effectiveness.

RESUMENLa relacion a largo plazo entre I+D y el conocimiento regional: el caso de Francia, Alemania, Italia y Espana. Regional Studies. En este articulo integramos la dependencia temporal en un marco regional de la funcion de produccion de conocimiento. En este contexto, analizamos el comportamiento dinamico a largo plazo de la investigacion y desarrollo (I+D) y el conocimiento en cuatro paises europeos Francia, Alemania, Italia y Espana mediante tests de raices unitarias y tecnicas de cointegracion. Observamos que la provision regional de conocimientos esta cointegrada con el uso de I+D y el conocimiento externo. Sin embargo, los efectos de la transferencia de conocimiento desempenan un papel mas importante en la generacion y acumulacion de nuevas ideas. Esto indica que las politicas de innovacion deberian tener por objeto mejorar la difusion de conocimiento y la capacidad de absorcion regional.","[Sanso-Navarro, Marcos] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza, Spain; [Vera-Cabello, Maria] Ctr Univ Def Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Sanso-Navarro, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza, Spain.",marcossn@unizar.es; mvera@unizar.es,,"Sanso-Navarro, Marcos/0000-0002-5926-2166; Vera Cabello, Maria/0000-0001-8973-6804",Centro Universitario de la Defensa [UZCUD2015-SOC-04]; Gobierno de Aragon [S16-ADETRE]; Universidad de Zaragoza [JIUZ-2014-SOC-12],Centro Universitario de la Defensa; Gobierno de Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); Universidad de Zaragoza,This work was supported by the Centro Universitario de la Defensa [grant number UZCUD2015-SOC-04]; the Gobierno de Aragon [grant number S16-ADETRE Research Group]; and the Universidad de Zaragoza [grant number JIUZ-2014-SOC-12].,,32,9,9,4,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

It is now clear that subprime mortgage-backed securities lay at the heart of this catastrophe and that the risk underlying these securities was vastly underestimated. This paper examines this risk by performing principal component analysis, OLS regression analysis and rolling regression analysis on ABX.HE Indexes data. The results of the principal component analysis results show that the main principal component falls in importance with each new vintage issuance, suggesting that there were other unobserved factors contributing to the variation in the data. The OLS regression analysis also suggests that other factors were coming into play as the crisis evolved and the rolling regression analysis allows us to link these changes to important events in the crisis, namely the onset of the liquidity crisis in September 2008. Overall the results indicate that these are assets are heterogeneous in nature, and not simply a continuation of the previous issuance.","[Sheenan, Lisa] Cent Bank Ireland, Financial Stabil Div, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Sheenan, L (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Financial Stabil Div, Dublin, Ireland.",Lisa.sheenan@centralbank.ie,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67913-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,8.0,1.0,,,,,63,87,,10.1007/978-3-319-67913-6_5,0.0,,,25,"Business; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BR9PT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679398800005,0

Globalization influences the possibilities to obtain financial resources and the cost of financial resources. It is removing barriers in the business environment, which provides better conditions for increasing in revenues, profits or introducing innovations and achieving cost savings due to the free movement of labour. All of these aspects are necessarily reflected in the value of the enterprise financial indicators. The level of financial indicators denotes the financial performance of the companies and therefore it is necessary to confront these indicators in a set of comparable enterprises. Only in this way, the judgment about the financial results of Slovak companies can be objective. However, the large differences between financial indicators complicate the conclusions and company evaluation. The contribution is therefore focused on examining the variability of the Slovak sectoral financial indicators, especially on the quantitative definition of the variability of the sectoral financial results, on identifying the trends of the variability in the last decade, on measuring the dependence between the variability of the financial indicators of the sectors and the macroeconomic indicators and looking for indicators that most and least distribute Slovak companies across the different sectors.

Globalization has led to the concentration of economic activity within a small number of multinational corporations. These corporations can shift profits among their entities across borders to low-tax countries and tax havens to reduce their pre-tax profits. In order to avoid the tax evasions the rules of transfer pricing are applied. Transfer pricing is a system that tries to protect the domestic tax authority and to prevent international tax evasion. The transfer pricing relates to the transactions realized between related parties which may be influenced by mutual relations of these parties. If the prices applied in the transactions of related parties are not comparable with the prices which shall be used by unrelated parties in comparable transactions, the tax evasions can occur. The transfer pricing is still more discussed issue in the world, as well as in the Slovak Republic, where every year the number of tax controls is growing due to this area. The aim of the paper is to assess the issue of transfer pricing in the conditions of the Slovak Republic. The theoretical research was applied for reaching the aim of the paper.

In the past few years, the number of local action plans towards climate change mitigation has been increasing, and it is essential to analyze their contribution to the achievement of global targets. Even if the relationship between local action plans and the reduction of energy use and GHG emissions is often assumed, this has not yet been validated nor quantified by empirical studies involving a large number of municipalities. Thus, the aim of this paper is to. perform an empirical analysis on the link between local action plans and energy use and GHG emissions. The analysis is composed by a test of hypothesis and a regression analysis, performed for the municipalities of three European countries Portugal, Sweden and United Kingdom. The main conclusion is that, in the context of these three countries, the analysis performed was not able to detect a significant impact related to the existence of local plans on GHG emissions. From the panel data regression analysis, it was possible to confirm that external factors, not directly related to local climate change mitigation actions, have a significant impact on GHG emissions.","[Azevedo, Isabel; Leal, Vitor M.

Modifying energy consumption choices through nudging has shown significant promise for promoting sustainable consumption behaviors. However, policy makers have been reluctant to embrace nudges, due to concerns over potential ethical objections. This paper argues that the major ethical objections to nudging are not ultimately convincing when applied to energy production and consumption. The most common ethical objections claim that nudging is paternalistic and reduces human autonomy. It is argued here that energy production and consumption are massively architectured, which means that they are strongly influenced by factors external to individuals. The infrastructure and framework for producing and consuming energy is largely determined prior to human decision-making. As a result, it is not clear how nudging for sustainable energy consumption could be paternalistic or autonomy-reducing. Ethical objections should thus not be a deterrent for policy makers pursuing nudges for sustainable energy consumption.","[Kasperbauer, T.

While this pattern has been occurring for a long time, the effects are becoming acutely visible and impactful. The long-term loss of younger individuals has in many ways drained the labor market and the economic market power of rural areas. This is the context of our research: the locational choice of university graduates from an urban-rural perspective. Using micro data covering the entire Swedish population, we identify all university graduates from the year 2001. We analyze them with respect to whether they live in a rural or urban region before starting university and where they live after graduation at two points in time: 5 and 10 years. We use a series of multinomial logit regressions to determine what factors affect their short-term and long-term choices of location. We find that having children is one of the most influential factors for moving back home after graduation, irrespective of type of region. We find only minor differences between the two time perspectives.","[Bjerke, Lina; Mellander, Charlotta] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Box 1026 551 11, Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Bjerke, L (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Box 1026 551 11, Jonkoping, Sweden.",lina.bjerke@ju.se; charlotta.mellander@ju.se,,,,,,,37,29,29,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Although U.S. natural gas prices closely tracked those of world oil prices from the mid-1990s to early 2009, U.S. natural gas prices have been much lower relative to those for oil since early 2009. The break owes to technological change that substantially increased the supply of U.S. shale gas resources. Although recent weakness in world oil prices has restored at least some temporary comparability between U.S. natural gas prices and those for petroleum products, EIA projects U.S. natural gas prices will rise more slowly as world oil prices recover. Relatively weaker gains in U.S. natural gas prices would support the substitution of natural gas for other fuels-such as petroleum products in transportation-whether such substitution is driven by business or policy decisions. Will U.S. natural gas prices be sustainably lower relative to those for petroleum products so as to support the increased use of natural gas in the transportation sector?

The benefit of mobilising community level action in addressing climate change action has already been seen in many European countries. While Irish governmental policy envisions as necessary greater community involvement in energy projects and other efforts to reduce carbon emissions, little progress has been encouraging or supporting such action. Using the Q-method, this study examined and identified where commonalities exist in Irish communities that have successfully implemented sustainable development goals, in terms of their motivation, attitudes, perceived barriers and opportunities for continued action. Results indicate that participants' main motivations are derived from a sense of responsibility to future generations and the need to live more balanced lifestyles. Results further suggest that short-term central government strategy, poor support, bureaucracy, and a lack of collaboration are seen as key limitations in developing and achieving effective community level sustainability action. This study contributes in understanding how climate change policy can be aligned to the preferred future vision of communities in bringing about effective change in transitioning to a low-carbon society.","[Byrne, Rosemary; Byrne, Susan; Ryan, Ray; O'Regan, Bernadette] Univ Limerick, Ctr Environm Res, Limerick V94 T9PX, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Byrne, R (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Ctr Environm Res, Limerick V94 T9PX, Ireland.",rosemary.byrne@ul.ie,"O'Regan, Bernadette/AAZ-6124-2020","O'Regan, Bernadette/0000-0002-5873-6390; Byrne, Rosemary/0000-0002-6949-4577",Irish Research Council [GOIPG/2015/3759]; Irish Research Council (IRC) [GOIPG/2015/3759] Funding Source: Irish Research Council (IRC),"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Irish Research Council (IRC)(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)",This work was supported by the Irish Research Council (GOIPG/2015/3759).,,126,16,16,1,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,40,50,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.007,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800005,0

Some are region-specific (e.g. availability of charging infrastructure) while others are global in nature (e.g. battery prices) where improvements spill over between regions. This study explores regional spillover effects and GHG impacts of strong ZEVfocused policy, specifically the ZEV mandate in place in ten U.S. states (ZEV States) which requires automakers to sell a minimum amount of ZEVs each year. We use a dynamic technology adoption model to simulate passenger vehicle sectors in North America, focusing on the case of one small region (British Columbia, covering 0.7% of the market) as potentially free-riding off of ZEV States' policy (covering 23% of the market). Results indicate that free-ridership is not effective; even with the ZEV mandate driving very high sales in ZEV States, British Columbia cannot achieve significant ZEV adoption without also implementing its own ZEV mandate. Further, for British Columbia to meet its 2050 GHG targets, it may need a ZEV mandate in addition to complementary climate policies pushing ZEVs to account for 40-93% of new vehicle sales in 2050. In short, regions seeking low-carbon transportation likely need to implement their own stringent policies.","[Sykes, Maxwell; Axsen, Jonn] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Axsen, J (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",jaxsen@sfu.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This project was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,101,61,69,4,55,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,447,460,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.031,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800044,0

We further use the large register data set and quasi-experimental strategy to estimate whether the class size effect depends on external conditions facing students and schools, such as teacher quality, extent of upper secondary school choice, school district size, local fiscal constraints and labour market conditions. Overall, we find that the class size effect does not depend on these factors measured at the school district level.

Such transitions have given rise to more complex government-utility-consumer relationships. However, these stakeholder relationships remain largely under-researched. This paper critically examines and explains the role of incumbent utilities in sustainable energy transitions, using SG developments in China as a case study. We have three major findings. First, China has developed an incumbent-led model for deploying SGs. Second, two incumbents, the major-state-owned grid companies, act as enablers of SG deployment. They are strategic first-movers and infrastructure builders of SGs. They have also developed five types of networks as they increasingly reach out to other state actors, businesses, and electricity consumers. Thirdly, these two grid companies also act as a fundamental block to structural changes in socio-technical regimes. Disincentives to these large existing grid companies coupled with excessive reliance on them to provide public goods have resulted in major weaknesses in China's incumbent-led model. Our findings have clear policy implications. Innovation in regulating incumbents is needed in order to provide sufficient regulatory incentives for advancing SG developments in China.","[Mah, Daphne Ngar-yin] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Asian Energy Studies Ctr, Dept Geog, 12-F,Acad & Adm Bldg,15 Baptist Univ Rd, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yun-Ying] Hanshan Normal Univ, Dept Chem, Chaozhou, Peoples R China; [Hills, Peter Ronald] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Asian Energy Studies Ctr, Room 1231,Acad & Adm Bldg, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hills, Peter Ronald] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hills, Peter Ronald] Univ Hong Kong, Kadoorie Inst, 8-F,Tsui Tsin Tong Bldg,Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University; Hanshan Normal University; Hong Kong Baptist University; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Mah, DNY (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Asian Energy Studies Ctr, Room 1231,Acad & Adm Bldg, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,"Mah, Daphne/0000-0002-4032-1402","FROCORE-France/Hong Kong Joint Research Scheme, Hong Kong Baptist University (through the Faculty Research Grants from the Faculty of Social Sciences) [FRG2/12-13/057, FRG2/13-14/074, FRG1/1/13-14/051]; Research Grants Council's Early Career Scheme [HKBU 22400614-ECS]","FROCORE-France/Hong Kong Joint Research Scheme, Hong Kong Baptist University (through the Faculty Research Grants from the Faculty of Social Sciences); Research Grants Council's Early Career Scheme","We gratefully acknowledge the funding of our research by the 2014/15 FROCORE-France/Hong Kong Joint Research Scheme, Hong Kong Baptist University (through the Faculty Research Grants from the Faculty of Social Sciences, FRG2/12-13/057; FRG2/13-14/074; FRG1/1/13-14/051) and the Research Grants Council's Early Career Scheme (Project no.

This paper critically analyses the evolution of the process of rural electrification in India, the factors that potentially determine the household electricity access and juxtaposed that with the policies adopted over three distinct time periods: the pre-independence period; the period of state ownership and the post-reforms period. The paper then builds on the key insights that could be drawn from the evolution in retrospect and attempts to highlight key historical challenges that the electricity sector has been constantly grappling with. The paper observes that during the early period of Five Year Plans, electricity was mainly used for productive input in agro-industries and for irrigation. Household access was only given priority when it was started to be considered as a basic input in the 1980s. With the enactment of the Electricity Act in 2003, the importance of electricity as an infrastructure for changing the rural landscape was felt. Based on the insights gained from the critical analysis of process of rural electrification in retrospect, the paper provides specific inputs for policy making for rural electrification in India.","[Palit, Debajit; Bandyopadhyay, Kaushik Ranjan] TERI Univ, Delhi 110070, India; [Bandyopadhyay, Kaushik Ranjan] Int Inst Sustainable Dev, 9 Chemin Balexert, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland",TERI University,"Palit, D (通讯作者)，TERI Univ, Delhi 110070, India.",debajitp@teri.res.in; kaushik.banerjee@gmail.com,"Palit, Debajit/F-1975-2016","Palit, Debajit/0000-0002-5554-6209",,,,,49,56,60,0,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,109,120,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.025,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400011,0

A feasibility study was conducted under three scenarios in order to estimate the value of Advanced Lead-Acid (ALA) and Lithium-Ion (LI) batteries for domestic households in the UK. A profit optimization model was built using historical market data, and technical parameters of the batteries. An aggregated system of 5000 batteries was simulated and used to compare and stack value streams of seven different grid-scale services in the UK, including energy arbitrage, reserve and frequency regulation services. The results showed that using a battery system for domestic services is currently not economically viable, however grid-scale provision of dynamic frequency response and fast reserve services yield sufficient annual revenue to compensate for these losses. The annual profit margin per household obtained was 532/692 for ALA and LI batteries respectively, allowing a shared margin of 230-300 after accounting for household costs. The promotion of an aggregated storage system is hindered by current regulatory barriers in the UK, such as a double payment structure for storage operators, lack of subsidy and lack of separate definition for storage devices.","[Rappaport, Ron D.; Miles, John] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England",University of Cambridge,"Rappaport, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",,,,,,,,44,37,42,0,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,609,622,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.044,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400059,0

Active power flow by itself causes active and reactive losses. Considering such losses in the reactive power market is the main purpose of this paper. Therefore, this study attempts to improve the reactive power market and create fair competition between producers. To that end, first, a new allocation method for reactive power losses is presented and the contribution of each producer in reactive losses is calculated. In the next step, this share of losses is used to modify the mandatory generation region of units. Then, a new structure is proposed for the reactive power market. This novel structure leads to reduction of system costs in the deregulated power system, which is one of the main policy implications of this paper. Finally, simulations show that the total payment by Independent System Operator will be reduced via application of the proposed methods leading to reduction in system costs. This cost reduction will be significant enough to encourage Independent System Operators to utilize such a structure. In addition, by implementing the new proposed methods, assignment of costs related to reactive power loss will be more justifiable for each generator.","[Ahmadimanesh, A.; Kalantar, M.] Iran Univ Sci Technol, Ctr Excellence Power Syst Automat & Operat, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Kalantar, M (通讯作者)，Iran Univ Sci Technol, Ctr Excellence Power Syst Automat & Operat, Tehran, Iran.",alireza_ahmadimanesh@elec.iust.ac.ir; kalantar@iust.ac.ir,"Ahmadimanesh, Alireza/ABA-5693-2020; Kalantar, Mohsen/T-2887-2018","Ahmadimanesh, Alireza/0000-0003-2652-696X; kalantar, mohsen/0000-0001-6432-7625",,,,,37,12,12,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,702,711,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.046,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800065,0

Contrary to what has been argued in the literature, Brazil may not be prepared to face the technological and market challenges now emerging in the biofuels domain worldwide. Important productive investments were made by oil, energy, and chemical companies in bioethanol production in Brazil in the first decade of the 2000s; however, that sector has not shown levels of investment in innovation-either for first- or second-generation bioethanol-compatible with the challenges of making bioethanol a global commodity. Even considering recent policies in Brazil toward cellulosic bioethanol, the results achieved have been far from sustainable. This situation is partially due to uncertainties surrounding biofuels worldwide and partially due to contradictory policies toward liquid fuels in Brazil. The Brazilian government has simultaneously promoted both fossil fuels and renewables, thereby creating ambiguity among decision makers. These and other findings were drawn from an in-depth survey on innovation in the bioethanol sector in Brazil conducted in 2014 among 35 productive units affiliated to 58 industrial groups.","[Monteiro Salles-Filho, Sergio Luiz; Drummond de Castro, Paula Felicio; Portilho Ferro, Ana Flavia; Corder, Solange] Univ Estadual Campinas, Univ Campinas, Inst Geosci, Dept Sci & Technol Policy DPCT, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Bin, Adriana] Univ Estadual Campinas, Univ Campinas, Sch Appl Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Edquist, Charles] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden",Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Lund University,"Salles, SLM (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Univ Campinas, Inst Geosci, Dept Sci & Technol Policy DPCT, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",sallesfi@ige.unicamp.br,"de Castro, Paula F.

We analyze empirically the impacts of agglomeration on regional economic return using an econometric approach, assuming three types of agglomeration economics: urbanization agglomeration, localization agglomeration, and mixed agglomeration. We estimate the agglomeration elasticities of 11 industries using inter-regional transportation network data and regional socioeconomic panel data for 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006, covering 47 prefectures in Japan. Our results show that, on average, the indirect benefit of regional productivity improvement from localization agglomeration tends to be more significant than that from urbanization agglomeration. While the mining industry enjoys significant benefit from urbanization rather than localization agglomeration and the transportation/communication industry enjoys significant benefit from localization rather than urbanization agglomeration, finance/insurance and real estate can benefit from both agglomeration economies. We further find negative elasticities in the agriculture and service industries; this could be partly due to the industries' characteristics.

We divide this history into six phases: Emergence (1949-1957), Socialist construction (1958-1965), Turbulence (1966-1978), Reform (1979-2000), Contestation (2001-2014), and Transition (2015-present). Over the whole history of more than sixty years, China's energy production and consumption grew at a surprising speed, while energy intensity exhibited early fluctuations and a subsequent gradual decrease after the turbulence phase. In tracing this history, the article offers new historical and policy insights into the world's largest developing country and a theoretical contribution to the role of the state in shaping economy and society through energy policy. The article lastly offers an in-depth exploration of how command-and-control style administrative intervention and low levels of market liquidity have had a prophylactic effect on innovation and competition.","[Zhang, Long] Xinyang Normal Univ, Sch Business, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Ely, Adrian] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Zhang, Long; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Zhang, Long] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jingzheng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Xinyang Normal University; University of Sussex; Aarhus University; China University of Geosciences - Wuhan; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark.",BenjaminSo@hih.au.clk,"Zhang, Long/AAO-5529-2020; Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019; Zhang, Long/AAM-2252-2021; Ren, Jingzheng/ABF-5240-2020","Zhang, Long/0000-0002-4976-0428; Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; Ren, Jingzheng/0000-0002-9690-5183; Ely, Adrian/0000-0002-3242-839X","National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2015S1A3A2046684]; ESRC [RES-588-28-0001, ES/K006002/1, EP/K011790/1]; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/K006002/1, ES/I021620/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I021620/1, ES/K006002/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2015S1A3A2046684), as well as by ESRC Grants RES-588-28-0001 (The STEPS Centre) and ES/K006002/1 (Low Carbon Innovation in China Prospects, Politics and Practice) in addition to RCUK Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1 (Center on Innovation and Energy Demand).

Carbon allowances are financial assets, potentially vulnerable to the behavior of traders and investors. In fact, the carbon price has been quite volatile since the inception of the market, and it has recently hit very low values. However, to date, no work exists to evaluate whether volatility and price spikes are due to episodes of speculation and price bubbles. Our paper fills this gap. We use the recent approaches developed by Phillips and Yu (2010), Phillips et al. (2011), and Phillips et al. (2015a, 2015b) who propose a recursive right sided unit root approaches to detect and date-stamp mildly explosive behaviors and carbon market exuberance. We complement this methodology by using the wild bootstrap procedure by Gongalves and Kilian (2004) to control for the heteroschedasticity of carbon price data. Analyzing the EU ETS front month contract price, from 2005 to 2014, we find different episodes of price bubbles. These episodes are not explained by similar behavior of the fundamentals but seem related to energy and environmental policy announcements. Our results can provide insightful policy implications in the context of the actual carbon market reform, as well as the implementation of stricter financial regulations rules to CO2 trading.","[Creti, Anna] PSL Res Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, LEDa, Pl Marechal Delattre De Tassigny, F-75016 Paris, France; [Joets, Marc] Univ Paris Ouest, Int Macroecon Div, Banque France, Paris, France; [Joets, Marc] Univ Paris Ouest, CNRS, EconomiX, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite Paris Saclay; European Central Bank; Bank of France; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Cretí, A (通讯作者)，PSL Res Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, LEDa, Pl Marechal Delattre De Tassigny, F-75016 Paris, France.",marc.joets@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,80,38,39,0,48,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,119,130,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.018,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200012,0

We apply energy justice as an analytical framework to analyse the political, societal and environmental impacts of energy policies in the context of post-conflict instability. Using the Kosovo C project as a case study, a planned lignite power plant and its associated infrastructure, we utilise the three tenets of energy justice (distributional, procedural, and justice as recognition) and Sovacool and Dworkin's (2015) eight aspects of just energy decision-making to depict the opportunities and challenges of the empirical application of energy justice in a post-conflict environment. The application of energy justice to the Kosovo case identifies the legal/regulatory and the temporal dimensions as crucial challenges to just energy policies in a context in which: (i) the lack of due process, good governance, and ongoing post-conflict tensions aggravate the societal, economic and environmental impacts of energy policies; (ii) accessibility and affordability of energy is prioritised over the promotion of sustainability; and (iii) infra- and intergenerational equity concerns take a backseat in the face of immediate state-building priorities.","[Lappe-Osthege, Teresa] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England; [Andreas, Jan-Justus] Univ York, Environm Dept, Wentworth Way, York Y01 5NG, N Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of York - UK,"Lappe-Osthege, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",t.lappe-osthege@sheffield.ac.uk; ja973@york.ac.uk,,"Lappe-Osthege, Teresa/0000-0002-3853-2016",University of Sheffield (Harry Worthington Scholarship),University of Sheffield (Harry Worthington Scholarship),We thank those individuals in Pristina and Brussels who kindly shared their opinions and provided valuable insights to develop the present research.

Using a unique panel dataset of 60 two-digit industries across 64 provinces from 2000 to 2010 in Vietnam, we investigate the importance of spatial and sectoral heterogeneity in an analysis of the determinants of entrepreneurship and empirically explore the interaction effect of geographic conditions and industry dynamism. Overall, our results confirm the significance of industry structural variables and their joint effect with geographic conditions in fostering new firm formation. Particularly, (i) growth-driven entries are generally higher in provinces that offer higher salaries; (ii) technology-intensive industries within regions that have strong knowledge spillover effects are appealing to new entries. Others noteworthy findings include: (i) 'necessity entrepreneurship' is prevalent in Vietnam, but limited to extractive and service industries that are typically labor intensive; (ii) firms tend to concentrate more in agglomerated locations. This effect, however, evaporates for high-tech industries; and (iii) industry profitability and niche dynamism all play a crucial role in stimulating new start-ups.

A system with a high share of generators with nearly no marginal costs requires new services that facilitate transmitting the right economic signals to the system stakeholders. To this end we refine the notion of energy services and propose a framework to systematically design quality differentiated energy services for consumers. This approach facilitates a value based economic assessment of energy services that deviates from the marginal-cost-paradigm. We further illustrate pricing options for these new energy service products and outline infrastructural needs and additional use case-specific product properties. Moreover, we discuss how the morphological approach can be formalised using a mathematical programming formulation and introduce a complexity measure that facilitates assessing potential adoption obstacles for end consumers. Additionally, we illustrate the practical applicability of these findings by using a prototypical implementation of a decision support system. To foster differentiated energy services, we recommend a more lenient regulatory regime lowering the barriers for new market entrants.","[Salah, Florian; Will, Christian; Weinhardt, Christof] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Schuller, Alexander] Univ Wurzburg, Josef Stangl Pl 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Flath, Christoph M.] FZI Res Ctr Informat Technol, Haid Und Neu Str 10-14, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Wurzburg,"Salah, F (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",florian.salah@kit.edu,"Aly, Ibrahim/JEZ-5539-2023","Flath, Christoph/0000-0002-1761-9833; Weinhardt, Christof/0000-0002-7945-4077; Will, Christian/0000-0002-4817-5665",,,,,76,14,14,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,614,624,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.024,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600057,0

Regional Studies. Michigan's school finance reform significantly increased state aid to low-spending districts and placed restraints on the growth of spending in high-spending districts. It is noteworthy that there is no literature yet on the impact of such reforms on resource allocation by school districts. This study begins to fill this gap. It finds that the reform led the high-spending districts to allocate a lower share of their total expenditure to support services and a higher share to instruction (relative to the low-spending districts). To the extent that instructional expenditures are more productive and contribute to student achievement more than support services expenditures, these results suggest that the reform led to a relative increase in productivity in the high-spending districts.","[Chakrabarti, Rajashri] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Roy, Joydeep] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Roy, Joydeep] Independent Budget Off, New York, NY USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Columbia University Teachers College; Columbia University,"Chakrabarti, R (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA.",rajashri.chakrabarti@ny.frb.org; jr3137@columbia.edu,"Roy, Joydeep/AFU-4807-2022",,,,,,24,2,2,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A labor allocation problem is coupled with species population dynamics using a Gordon-Schafer framework in order to numerically estimate approach paths for population and poaching. Our model reveals that population dynamics can witness convergence to steady states, period-doubling bifurcation, and deterministic chaos for variations in policy parameters. We find that poaching fines, wage rates in and around protected areas, anti-poaching enforcement, and black market prices for the protected resource each have qualitatively different effects on population dynamics. Moreover, the effects differ significantly across a broad range of species. We find several instances of policy-induced counterintuitive population dynamics that result from unstable equilibriums in resource systems. Bifurcation diagrams and harvest feedback policies are derived to provide insight into counterintuitive dynamics that can arise in coupled ecological-economic systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Regional Studies. The productivity of non-farm enterprises in rural Africa can be associated with the productivity of other spatially proximate non-farm enterprises. To test for the presence and significance of such spatial autocorrelation, the article uses data from the georeferenced 2011 Ethiopian Rural Socioeconomic Survey (ERSS) and the 2010/ 2011 Nigeria General Household Survey (NGHS), and employs exploratory spatial data analyses. There is evidence of significant spatial clustering of firm performance in both countries. This spatial dependence is empirically modelled using average distance measures between firms. It is found that in addition to other household, firm and community characteristics, spatial proximity between firms plays an important role in explaining firm productivity in Nigeria and Ethiopia.","[Owoo, Nkechi S.] Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, Accra, Ghana; [Naude, Wim] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Sch Management, Dept Org & Strategy, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Naude, Wim] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Naude, Wim] IZA Inst Study Lab, Bonn, Germany",University of Ghana; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Owoo, NS (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, Accra, Ghana.",nowoo@ug.edu.gh; w.naude@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Naudé, Wim/E-3812-2017","Naudé, Wim/0000-0003-2496-6945; Owoo, Nkechi/0000-0002-5220-9733",,,,,57,16,16,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A literature review found significant variability among the outlooks on China's gas sector. Further assessment found that uncertainties in economic growth, structural change in markets, environmental regulations, price and institutional changes contribute to the uncertainties. The analysis of China's demand and supply uncertainties with a world gas-trading model found significant changes in global production, trade patterns and spot prices, with pipeline exporters being most affected. China's domestic production and pipeline imports from Central Asia are the major buffers that can offset much of the uncertainties. The study finds an asymmetric phenomenon. Pipeline imports are responding to China's uncertainties in both low and high demand scenarios while LNG imports are only responding to high demand scenario. The major reasons are higher TOP levels and the current practice of import only up to the minimum TOP levels for LNG, as well as a lack of liberalized gas markets. The study shows that it is necessary to create LNG markets that can respond to market dynamics, through either a reduction of TOP levels or change of pricing mechanisms to hub indexation.","[Shi Xunpeng] Univ Technol Sydney, Australia China Relat Inst, 15 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Shi Xunpeng; Variam, Hari Malamakkavu Padinjare; Tao, Jacqueline] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,10-01,Bld A, Singapore 119620, Singapore",University of Technology Sydney; National University of Singapore,"Variam, HMP (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,10-01,Bld A, Singapore 119620, Singapore.",hari.271@gmail.com,"Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019","Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395",,,,,62,32,33,1,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,382,394,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.015,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500038,0

The empirical results confirm the existence of cointegration long-run relationship among the variables. We find that, in the long-run, economic growth and non-renewable electricity consumption have a detrimental effect on the environment quality, whereas renewable energy use has a beneficial environmental effect. Furthermore, in the short-run, results reveal unidirectional causality relationship running from GDP to NREC, supporting the conservation hypothesis, i.e. electricity consumption is dictated by economic growth. The results suggest broadly that renewable electricity consumption can help to enhance environmental quality in Algeria. But so far, renewable electricity generation has not reached a level that allows a significant contribution to energy-based carbon dioxide emissions reduction target.","[Belaid, Fateh] Univ Paris Est, Sci & Tech Ctr Bldg, 84 Ave Jean Jaures, F-77447 Champs Sur Marne 2, Marne La Vallee, France; [Youssef, Meriem] Univ Sousse, LaREMFiQ IHEC, BP 40,Route Ceinture Sahloul 3, Sousse 4054, Tunisia",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite de Sousse,"Bélaïd, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, Sci & Tech Ctr Bldg, 84 Ave Jean Jaures, F-77447 Champs Sur Marne 2, Marne La Vallee, France.",Fateh.BELAID@cstb.fr; youssef.sorbonne@gmail.com,"BELAID, Fateh/AAO-6406-2020; Youssef, Meriem/I-8542-2019","BELAID, Fateh/0000-0002-1077-2798;",,,,,50,226,234,5,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,277,287,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.012,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200027,0

Public support of biofuels has been a public policy goal since 2008, and the promotion of ethanol remains an active part of the government agenda. The evidence used to encourage or alter the policy is (by necessity) chiefly based on international experience. In this study we use a computable general equilibrium model (CGE) to estimate the impact of ethanol production on the Mexican economy. Using cost data from Brazil we introduce ethanol into a Mexican social accounting matrix, and insert a latent sector into the model to analyze ethanol promotion.

The study shows that the thermal efficiency of the dwellings is not the same across all dwellings, impacting the internal temperatures experienced by the elderly occupants and their finances. This has implications for energy efficiency policy, policy governing the energy performance of buildings specifically designed for older people, as well as the mandatory disclosure of building performance.

Time-of-use pricing (TOU), which has higher electricity prices during peak hours and lower prices during non-peak hours, is a pricing scheme that can help achieve more efficient levels of electricity consumption. This study examines factors influencing consumers' participation in voluntary TOU programs with particular attention to individual-specific risk and time preferences elicited through multiple price-list experiments. Evidence from a study of 398 homeowners in Arizona and California, U.S., indicates that more risk averse consumers are less likely to enroll in TOU programs. The results suggest evidence of adverse selection, with households who consume less energy during peak hours being more likely to enroll in TOU programs. Time preferences are found to have a statistically significant and negative impact on consumers' adoption of programmable thermostats, a technology that can allow households to better respond to TOU pricing.

The higher the distances, the higher the difficulties for businesses, as managers' decision-making is based on their perception of those distances. This paper analyzes the perception of distances between China and Germany by surveying Chinese managers who invested in Germany in the renewable energy (RE) sector, using Child et al.'s (2009) measure of psychic distance (PD) as a guide. The RE sector is young and highly dynamic, and the dimensions of PD are constantly changing. Mismatches in the perception of PD ex ante and ex post the decision to engage in FDI may lead to possible FDI failure. We use a five-company multiple case study to analyze if Chinese managers perceive distances in various dimensions, particularly regulation-based, and if there is a mismatch of perceptions between the pre-market and post-market entry period to investigate if managers' perceptions change over time. Our findings lead to recommendations for practitioners and international business scholars, and policy making in the RE sector, by showing that operationalizing the PD construct should be complemented by dynamic analysis.

However, the real effect of technology advance on mitigation is worth further studying due to the existence of rebound effect (RE). A key issue is how to quantify the relationship between technology advance and carbon dioxide emission accurately. This paper figures out a comprehensive and modified framework involving around the RE of carbon emission from the macroeconomic perspective. Using this framework, this paper quantitatively evaluates the relationship between technical change and carbon emission based on the data of 30 provinces in China. It is founded that: (1) the carbon RE is about 10-60% in Chinese provinces; (2) the RE of carbon emission differs among the regions in China; (3) carbon reduction and environment issues should be solved step by step regionally in China. (4) According to our results, a reasonable control on total energy consumption and fossil energy pricing adjustment, should be taken as the supplementary policy in China; at the same time, carbon financing, carbon trading and other aspects of institutional innovation should be taken into account at the appropriate time.","[Yang, Lisha] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Fuzhou 350117, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhi] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Yang, Lisha; Li, Zhi] Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Fujian Normal University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Li, Z (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",Izivy@xmu.edu.cn,,"Yang, Lisha/0000-0003-0803-5876",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720151039]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573217],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The paper is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 20720151039), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71573217).",,60,164,177,33,209,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,150,161,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.020,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800014,0

International demand has come into conflict with country differences in supply. The choice of the procedure for knowledge assessing determines the whole system of the organization of the educational process. Two types of exam procedures are analyzed in the article. The first one is typical for United States universities, namely: the exam with the right to pass exams ones more only after re-training. The second is typical for Russia: student has the right to take the exam again twice in case of failure of the first attempt. The first kind leads to the appearance of number of re-learners, which makes it impossible to fix the number of years of study. Each student has his own number of years of study and an individual schedule. Such a subject-based training system differs from the time-limited system suitable for the examination procedure of the second type with the dismissal of students who failed the exam. The article compares the positive and negative aspects of these two systems and shows the possibility of constructing on their basis a more positive model that incorporates their advantages. The results of the socio-psychological research carried out by the authors show the preferences of the students of Russian universities to the second type of examination. Students prefer be expelled from the university, if failing three attempts to pass the exam to alternative to be re-trained. The reasons for this choice are two: significant loss of time for re-training and money for tuition and the suspicion that the university will specifically create conditions for failure to earn on re-training.","[Alpatov, Gennady E.; Bortnikova, Helena G.] St Petersburg State Univ, Tchaikovsky St 62,Off 310, St Petersburg 191123, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Bortnikova, HG (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Tchaikovsky St 62,Off 310, St Petersburg 191123, Russia.",g.alpatov@spbu.ru; bortnik_78@mail.ru,"alpatov, gennady/M-2379-2015",,,,,,18,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,21,28,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200004,0

Regional Studies. Northern Ireland has been characterized by an inability to narrow the persistent economic gap relative to Britain. Some commentators have suggested that regional corporation tax variation may be the game changer' in closing this gap. This paper draws on a range of studies that help one better understand the historical and institutional context. However, the analysis of tax variation is broader than this. Consideration is given as to which taxes might be the most suitable candidates for devolution. While greater tax variations could certainly complement an emphasis on increased competitiveness aimed at improving economic outcomes, they are no substitute for such a focus. As is often the case in institutional and economic development, issues of sequencing and policy capacity are salient.","[Birnie, Esmond] PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Brownlow, Graham] Queens Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",,"Brownlow, G (通讯作者)，Queens Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",esmond.birnie@strategyand.uk.pwc.com; graham.brownlow@qub.ac.uk,"Brownlow, Graham/ISV-1857-2023","Brownlow, Graham/0000-0001-5715-5431",,,,,28,9,9,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

It allows any airlines (on either side EU or the US) to fly between any points in the EU and in the US. Therefore, airlines are able to use narrow-body twin-engine aircraft and this cuts their overall operating costs. On top of that, they have started to operate services from smaller uncongested airports. This makes operations more efficient and economically viable. Some sources have even been predicting radical changes in airfares, such as very low air fares on long hauls. However, this paper deals with what happens if globalization cracks and what are the consequences of hard Brexit for UK aviation. It will also address the acute issue of Brexit, given existing agreements between companies that fly between the UK and the EU as well as between mainland European countries. These will need to be renegotiated before the UK formally exits the EU. The paper also reveals what could happen to airlines that are based in the UK and have only a UK air operator certificate. Another issue is the future role of the UK aviation representatives in the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA).","[Brezonakova, Andrea; Badanik, Benedikt] Univ Zilina, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Badánik, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Zilina, Slovakia.",ada.brezonak@gmail.com; benedikt.badanik@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Badanik, Benedikt/A-5620-2011; Davies Brezonakova, Andrea/IZE-7243-2023",,,,,,21,0,0,1,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,210,217,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200028,0

In today's global world, the continuous improvement of the decision-making system has been, in the past decades, one of the main concerns of public management. Romania is no exception. Prior to Romania's accession to the European Union, the Romanian public management underwent a process of transformation, a process which continued afterwards as well, as an efficient, transparent, and effective management is a priority objective for all governments. This paper aims to address this new concept for the Romanian public sector, the basic elements of controlling, starting from planning and budgeting, and ending with reporting. In this paper, we aim to emphasise the fact that the basic ideas of controlling can be transferred to the public sector, the 3E (effectiveness, efficiency, economy) model being an appropriate one. Apart from the hierarchisation of the impact-related goals and the efficiency of processes and costs, various interests (of the public administration, of the citizens, of representatives of interest groups) may be considered as well. The objective of the proposed scientific approach is to make a significant contribution in terms of improving the activities of public institutions in Romania, as introducing modern controlling methods and techniques (which were successfully applied in the private sector), could be beneficial for the public sector as well.","[Hlaciuc, Elena; Ailoaiei, Rodica; Maciuca, Geanina] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Ailoaiei, R (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",elenah@seap.usv.ro; ailoaiei_rodica@yahoo.com; geaninasth@yahoo.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,677,684,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201022,0

The aspect of globalization appears mainly in the possibility of the Slovak Republic to use resources from the European Union budget to support the innovation potential of small and medium-sized enterprises. Due to the impact of globalization, individual countries are becoming more and more connected and create associations and groups that take on the individual competences and responsibilities in the decision-making process about the redistribution of resources between its members and thus between the entrepreneurs themselves, citizens. The main disadvantage of SMEs is limited access to capital that greatly affects the use of their innovation potential, it is the role of the government to actively participate in creating such conditions for an entrepreneurial environment that will ensure a healthy competitive environment to strengthen innovation and research activities and to strengthen the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises in the domestic and foreign markets. SMEs can quickly and efficiently respond to customer demands and consequently respond to changes resulting from market changes. The current economy in the period of globalization requires, in particular, to support the innovative potential of SMEs and thereby increase the share of established research and innovation results not only in enterprises but also in economic practice.

Certainly, significant regional differences are very persistent in many countries EU and the spatial distribution of economic activity is far from uniform. There is not just one single theory of migration and economists have attempted various explanations for the existence of regional migration and for its effects on labour markets or on whole economy. Previous scholars have examined the migration flows in relation to a wide range of socio-economic factors.

The particle geometry is validated via comparing the simplified shape of natural rough rocks and the randomly generated ones. A 3D scanner was used to digitize the natural rocks.

Forming the accumulated (past) environmental damage is one of the problems which developed countries faced last century and worked out efficient tools to solve it. In Russia the consequences of forming the object of accumulated damage are connected with the depletion of resources in exploited fields and execution of negative environmental and social-economic processes on the areas with environmental deterioration, decrease in living standards of the population in surrounding communities, inability of involving these areas in secondary economic turnover. In Russia the solution of accumulated damage problem comes with insufficient regulatory support of legal succession of responsibility for the caused damage as most of the enterprises, being closed down today, were operating in the centralized economic system and they were state property. Thus, the authors have analyzed world practices in solving the accumulated damage problems, suggested the options of their adapting to Russian institutional legal framework.

While the existing literature mostly focuses on education-based human capital, this paper adopts a skills-based human capital approach and examines the associations between various types of labour market skills and high-technology entrepreneurship in US metropolitan regions. Spatial regression results show that cognitive, technical, problem-solving, social and managerial skills are positively associated with high-technology start-up activity. Additionally, these skills also play moderating roles in turning university research into entrepreneurial activity in knowledge-based regional economies.

In particular, this pressure affects enterprises operating in an open economy, such as the Czech Republic. It is the export of machinery and transport equipment that has the highest share in total export. For the firms operating in this sector it is vital to identify the value drivers, i.e. key performance indicators contributing to value creation. Based on the undertaken literature research, a value driver is each factor affecting the value of the business. Quantitative value drivers are mostly financial indicators; qualitative value drivers represent quality of company management. Effective performance management requires eliminating processes, which may jeopardise the business value growth. According the previous research, factors reducing the business value include the lack of capital, lack of strategic management systems and poor quality of production. In order to gain further insight into the topic, the paper presents the results of the research identifying factors adversely affecting the performance of mechanical engineering enterprises in the Czech Republic. The collection data took place through a questionnaire survey among company senior managers. The research results show that the factors representing the highest risk for the performance and value of businesses include the incompetence of management staff and the failure to respect customer requirements.","[Reznakova, Maria; Strnadova, Michala] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni 4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Reznakova, M (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni 4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",areznakova@fbm.vutbr.cz; bstrnadova@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Reznakova, Maria/AAQ-6282-2020","Reznakova, Maria/0000-0002-7261-607X",Internal Grant Agency of the Brno University of Technology [FP-S-17-4634],Internal Grant Agency of the Brno University of Technology,This paper is the output of the research project reg. num.

Also labelled as the sharing economy, this rising reality is redefining the key characteristics of the basic institutions of capitalism. Long-established categories of property rights are changing, disrupting the conventional varieties of economic systems. Increased ability of owners to share, rent, barter and swap property calls into question the conventional distinction between personal consumption property and commercial property. Traditional employment is being replaced with new forms of collaborative, on-demand occupations. Workers become independent contractors not covered by the social safety net and unaffected by minim wage laws. Barriers to entry into a large array of occupations have been drastically lowered. The power of trade unions is diminishing as habitual trade union membership declines. The state's capacity to impose regulation is also decreasing, as the new platforms are able to escape the customary regulation framework. These developments have raised questions related to the type of capitalism that the sharing economy is promoting. This paper investigates the relation between the sharing economy and capitalism. Based on the varieties-of-capitalism perspective developed by Peter A. Hall and David Soskice and the property-rights approach put forward by Svetozar Pejovich, our paper investigates the features of this novel type of economy arising from peer-to-peer relations in connection to the long-established institutions of capitalism. Latest developments of the Romanian case are analyzed in more detail to help form an in-depth image of the arising new form of capitalism.","[Simandan, Radu] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Simandan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest, Romania.",radu.simandan@upb.ro,"Simandan, Radu/AAC-6062-2021; Simandan, Radu/GRT-0057-2022","Simandan, Radu/0000-0001-6003-6695; Simandan, Radu/0000-0001-6003-6695",,,,,23,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2361,2368,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204035,0

Research methods cover the comparative analysis of scientific literature documents and reports as well as statistical data. The paper points out that bank consolidation in the Polish cooperative sector resulted in sharp reduction in the number of banks. The cooperative banks have been forced to reorganize their structures in order to respond effectively to challenges of the globalization trends in the modern banking sector and to adjust to the European regulatory framework. The Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) were implemented into the EU to comply with the global standards (i.e. the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision). Findings indicate that the quality of cooperative banks loans granted to SMEs has worsened and the deterioration of basic measures of effectiveness has been observed in the years 2012 through 2016. In the capital requirements of cooperative banks, the requirement for credit risk was predominant, while the average credit risk weights were higher than in commercial banks. The bankruptcy of SK bank (one of the largest cooperative banks) at the end of 2015 and over 2 billion zlotys payment of guaranteed deposits by the Bank Guarantee Fund, highlights the key importance of supervision approaches on banks' liquidity risk and a funding structure.","[Soloma, Andrzej] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ, Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Soloma, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ, Olsztyn, Poland.",soloma@uwm.edu.pl,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2432,2438,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204044,0

Nowadays the Slovak Republic is recording a skilled force labour market weakening, which would also be needed at home. Employers feel a lack of free labour force and are increasingly searching for workers abroad. The current demographic development shows that the Slovak labour market as well as the social security system are largely dependent on the inflow of human capital from abroad.

To understand this diversity, this paper explores the potential mediating role of social capital between LDC impacts in a host region and the well-being of its residents. Using detailed information on residents' social capital in a remote region, this paper confirms the negative relationship between LDC impacts and resident well-being, but it finds no evidence of social capital's mediating role.

Still, there is limited knowledge about the characteristics of potential investors, especially in community renewable energy projects. This study intends to address this gap and investigates the impact of socio-demographic and socio-psychological characteristics on individuals' willingness to invest in community renewable energy projects. Our investigation is based on two large-scale representative surveys of 2260 respondents in Austria and Switzerland. The majority of respondents would be willing to invest 1000 to 10,000 CHF/EUR in such a project, with higher amounts in the Swiss sample. Potential investors in Austria tend to be male homeowners with higher incomes, while Swiss investors are more educated. Generally, positive attitudes and beliefs related to renewable energy have a significant impact on investment intention. The largest group of potential investors in both countries can be described as 'urban wind energy enthusiasts', who show high acceptance of wind energy installations near their communities. Surprisingly, a significant segment of potential investors is skeptical of a nearby wind installation. Study results can be used by decision-makers to tailor appropriate policy measures and by project developers for communication of the project aims and benefits.","[Broughel, Anna Ebers] Inst Econ & Environm, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Hampl, Nina] Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Operat Energy & Environm Management, Univ Str 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria; [Hampl, Nina] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Strateg Management, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",University of Klagenfurt; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Broughel, AE (通讯作者)，Inst Econ & Environm, Tigerbergstr 2, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",anna.ebers@unisg.ch; nina.hampl@aau.at,,"Ebers Broughel, Anna/0000-0003-4984-3714; Hampl, Nina/0000-0001-6197-3699",Raiffeisen Switzerland; Corporate Social Responsibility team; Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) under the Swiss Competence Centers for Energy Research (SCCER CREST); Deloitte Austria; Wien Energie,Raiffeisen Switzerland; Corporate Social Responsibility team; Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) under the Swiss Competence Centers for Energy Research (SCCER CREST); Deloitte Austria; Wien Energie,"The authors would like to thank Rolf Wustenhagen for invaluable support during all stages of this research project.

Theory predicts that liberalisation promotes cost-efficient production and competition and hence leads to lower prices. The goal of this paper is to assess the impact of regulatory quality and non-compliance with the law on electricity prices in the context of electricity market reforms. We address problems of endogeneity by using the Blundell-Blond System GMM estimator and find that vertical integration and market concentration lower end-user prices, all else equal. Moreover, improving regulatory quality and reducing corruption, both have a negative impact on prices when holding other factors constant. The intensity of the reforms has limited impact on electricity prices when these reforms are introduced in an institutional environment characterised by high levels of corruption and low quality regulation.","[Kaller, Alexander; Bielen, Samantha; Marneffe, Wim] Hasselt Univ, Fac Business Econ, Hasselt, Belgium",Hasselt University,"Marneffe, W (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Fac Business Econ, Hasselt, Belgium.",wim.marneffe@uhasselt.be,,"MARNEFFE, Wim/0000-0001-9945-5731; Bielen, Samantha/0000-0002-4525-7446",,,,,60,25,26,4,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,514,524,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.09.008,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700051,0

We find that the parental influence on sons' earnings persists over the career and that the direct influence controlling for sons' education is large and grows during the working career. After twenty years of experience, our baseline specification indicates that an additional year of parental education is associated with a 2.0% increase in sons' wages, while an additional year of son's education is associated with a 4.8% increase. We use educational mobility between parents and sons to disentangle this influence into a glass ceiling effect - a premium for well-off children who have high educational attainments - and a parachute effect - a premium for well-off children who acquire less education than their parents. We find that both effects contribute to explain the steeper earnings profiles of the well-off sons, consistently with the idea that family ties play a crucial allocative role in the Italian labour market.","[Michele, Raitano] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Francesco, Vona] Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, OFCE SciencesPo, 60 Rue Dostoievski, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Francesco, Vona] Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, SKEMA Business Sch, 60 Rue Dostoievski, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France",Sapienza University Rome; Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School,"Michele, R (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",michele.raitano@uniroma1.it; francesco.vona@sciencespo.fr,"Raitano, Michele/AAH-2209-2021; Vona, Francesco/ABE-8328-2020","Vona, Francesco/0000-0002-2112-5537",,,,,42,12,12,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

This study contributes to the DEA literature by combining intermediate approach with group heterogeneity in a time horizon. This extended methodology has two important advantages, since it can separate inefficiency related to different production frontiers originated from heterogeneity issue and provide steady results of time effects across periods. Empirically, this method is used to examine unified efficiency of Chinese fossil fuel power plants at provincial levels from 2005 to 2015. All provinces are classified into two regional groups. Our main findings are as follows. First, there exists significant group heterogeneity between coastal and inland provinces, where coastal provinces outperform inland provinces. Second, there are considerable differences in unified efficiency measures across provinces. For most observations, best-practice gap ratio is the most important driving factor. Furthermore, the relative importance of three decomposed indicators varies sharply across provinces. Finally, the concept of managerial disposability should attract sufficient attention, when designing environmental policies. Thus, there should be more combined contributions from ecotechnology advancements along with managerial efficiency improvements by corporate leaders and policy makers. This can a new direction for China's environmental policy.","[Sun, Chuanwang] Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chuanwang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaohong; Li, Aijun] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Shandong Sch Dev, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Shandong University,"Li, AJ (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Shandong Sch Dev, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China.",cw_sun@foxmail.com; 2292923312@qq.com; liaijun@sdu.edu.cn,"刘, 晓红/IQT-7605-2023; Sun, Chuanwang/JOZ-8733-2023; 刘, 晓红/JXY-6925-2024","刘, 晓红/0000-0002-1585-2527; Sun, Chuanwang/0000-0002-1900-4699;","National Natural Foundation of China [71873078, 71673230, 71303199, 71403147]; Young Scholars Program of Shandong University [2016WLJH02]; Ministry of Education Research of Social Sciences Youth Funded Projects [13YJC790065]; Shandong Social Science Planning Fund Program [12DJJJ12]",National Natural Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young Scholars Program of Shandong University; Ministry of Education Research of Social Sciences Youth Funded Projects; Shandong Social Science Planning Fund Program,"The authors are grateful to the anonymous referees for their valuable suggestions.

This inequality goes far beyond the income of a family or the movement between social statements. This work attempts to appreciate this gap in the life quality of the people, precisely in the context of the indoor environmental quality. The methodology involves the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) for measuring thermal comfort, using the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) as dimensionless index; and the CO2 concentration as indicated by the ASHRAE-55 standard. The sample involves 20 households in the city of Santiago de Chile, distributed in 5 socioeconomically disparate communes. The National Monitoring Network (RENAM) was used as database, from which information of indoor environmental variables was obtained for 3 winter months. Based on the results, economic inequality is easily confirmed for thermal comfort aspects. A significant difference is shown for the cluster with lowest income, which presented the worst conditions. This difference is even more remarkable when the levels of CO2 are compared. Finally, government policies should consider economic aspects in reducing the iniquity gap, jointly with air quality, energy efficiency and thermal comfort of houses.","[Becerra, Miguel; Jerez, Alejandro; Valenzuela, Miguel; Demarco, Rodrigo] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Ind, Av Espana 1680,Casilla 110-V, Valparaiso, Chile; [Garces, Hugo O.] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Comp Sci Dept, Alonso Ribero 2850, Concepcion 4090541, Chile",Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria; Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion,"Jerez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Ind, Av Espana 1680,Casilla 110-V, Valparaiso, Chile.",alejandro.jerez@alumnos.usm.cl,"Jerez, Alejandro/AAQ-8989-2021; Garcés, Hugo Omar/B-4880-2017","Jerez, Alejandro/0000-0003-3174-9420; Garcés, Hugo Omar/0000-0002-7809-708X; Demarco, Rodrigo/0000-0002-2117-6422",Universidad Catoilea de la Santisima Concepcion [DINREG 10/2017],Universidad Catoilea de la Santisima Concepcion,Authors acknowledge to Fundacion Chile for granting academic access to RENAM database.

Although after partial lifting of the sanctions, substantial changes in the Iranian energy sector may present a new, favorable environment for international investments, the political economy of hydrocarbon management in Iran plays a significant role in the definition of current and prospective stakeholders, their aims and interests. This paper analyses existing policies and policy challenges of hydrocarbon management by contextualizing them with historical and political factors. Considering the recent prospects in the Iranian hydrocarbon sector, it is worth keeping only the lower expectations concerning the production boom of the Iranian hydrocarbon industry: due to external market trends (low oil price, oversupply in the market) and a long redistribution process, the most probable scenario proposes a slow and continuous transformation in the oil and gas sectors of the Islamic Republic. In practice, it means that both the extension of export capacity and the involvement of international companies will take place in a gradual, regulated way, in which all the interests of major Iranian political and economic stakeholders have to be considered.","[Dudlak, Tamas] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fac Social Sci, Int Relat Multidisciplinary Doctoral Sch, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Dudlák, T (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fac Social Sci, Int Relat Multidisciplinary Doctoral Sch, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",tamas.dudlak@stud.uni-corvinus.hu,"Dudlak, Tamas/IAQ-7500-2023; Dudlák, Tamás/AAW-6004-2021",,National Bank of Hungary Doctoral Research Excellence Award [EFET 01312T]; Hungarian Ministry of National Capacities - Hungarian National Talent Program [NTP-NFP3-16-0616],National Bank of Hungary Doctoral Research Excellence Award; Hungarian Ministry of National Capacities - Hungarian National Talent Program,This work was financially supported by the National Bank of Hungary Doctoral Research Excellence Award (Grant Number: EFET 01312T).

To closely adhere to the Environmental Kuznets curve narratives, we consider coal consumption which has been scarcely explored in the EKC debate, as a proxy of environmental pressure. We estimate the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method and confirm that the variables are cointegrated for long run linkage with the presence of structural breaks. The empirical evidence showed that economic growth, urbanization and trade openness increase coal consumption while decreasing share of secondary industry reduce it. We also verify the existence of environmental Kuznets curve. Having a vital role in the energy mix, Indonesia needs to restrain excessive coal consumption to enhance environmental quality. Our results also imply urbanization and trade openness are crucial factors on coal consumption. Consequently, it should be taken into consideration in energy policy-making process, such as energy conservation policies in the residential sector and prioritize foreign investment which brings cutting-edge coal technologies.","[Kurniawan, Robi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sn, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan; [Kurniawan, Robi] Minist Energy & Mineral Resource, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur 1a, Jakarta 10320, Indonesia; [Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Global Environm Engn Program, Dept Urban & Environm Engn,Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Level 8,Z Block,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Tohoku University; Kyushu University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Managi, S (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Global Environm Engn Program, Dept Urban & Environm Engn,Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",kurniawan.tohoku@gmail.com; managi.s@gmail.com,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013; Kurniawan, Robi/AAD-8768-2020","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427; kurniawan, robi/0000-0002-8825-8123",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26000001],"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This paper was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Specially Promoted Research (26000001) by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

Using a representative range of forward prices for natural gas and other generator costs, we model three potential pathways for federal policy: (1) the status quo, which assumes no new federal initiatives through 2031; (2) moderate and aggressive (national or regional) RPSs; and (3) carbon taxes that vary in timing and amount. The model assesses the impact of these policies on competition between electricity generators using a range of output variables, including the cost of electricity, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), retirement and construction trends for generation resources, and dispatch rates of generation technologies. We analyze conditions in four regional electricity markets with distinct starting generation portfolios, demand profiles (that differ seasonally and diurnally), wind and solar resources, and fuel costs. Our results provide new insights into the competitive barrier that low gas prices represent for renewables, the superior efficacy of carbon taxes (even at low rates) over RPSs, and the singular competitive advantage renewables enjoy by virtue of having near zero marginal costs.","[Adelman, David E.; Spence, David B.] Univ Texas Austin, B6000, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Spence, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, B6000, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",David.Spence@mccombs.utexas.edu,,,,,,,27,5,5,1,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,268,275,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.019,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300025,0

A much discussed question in this context is whether voluntary behaviour change initiatives can make a significant contribution to reaching this target. While providing individuals with general information on climate change or low carbon action is increasingly seen as ineffective, some studies argue that personalised information has greater potential to encourage behaviour change. This mixed methods study examines this claim through a longitudinal field experiment which tested the effectiveness of a carbon calculator interview. It finds that the intervention significantly raised awareness of ways in which participants could reduce their carbon footprint. However, this increased awareness did not translate into measurable behaviour changes in relation to home energy and travel. Qualitative analysis shows that participants refer to infrastructural, social and psychological barriers to change. This indicates that more ambitious government and corporate action is required to speed up carbon reduction.","[Buchs, Milena] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Bahaj, AbuBakr S.; Blunden, Luke; Bourikas, Leonidas; James, Patrick; Wu, Yue] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Sustainable Energy Res Grp, Energy & Climate Change Div, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Falkingham, Jane] Univ Southampton, Social Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Kamanda, Mamusu] INDEPTH Network, 38 & 40 Mensah Wood Scree, Accra, Ghana",University of Leeds; University of Southampton; University of Southampton; INDEPTH Network,"Büchs, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",m.m.buchs@leeds.ac.uk; A.S.Bahaj@soton.ac.uk; lsb1@soton.ac.uk; L.Bourikas@soton.ac.uk; J.C.Falkingham@soton.ac.uk; P.A.James@soton.ac.uk; mamusu.kamanda@indepth-network.org; Phil.Wu@soton.ac.uk,"li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Blunden, Luke S/F-9749-2011; wang, yixuan/JGM-3893-2023; Buchs, Milena/AAU-2581-2021; Bourikas, Leonidas/AAH-6565-2019; Bahaj, AbuBakr/B-9111-2015","Buchs, Milena/0000-0001-6304-3196; Bourikas, Leonidas/0000-0002-5289-2157; Wu, Yue/0000-0002-4112-7935; JAMES, PATRICK/0000-0002-2694-7054; Bahaj, AbuBakr/0000-0002-0043-6045; Falkingham, Jane/0000-0002-7135-5875; Blunden, Luke/0000-0002-0046-5508",UK Engineering and Physical Research Council [EP/J017698/1]; EPSRC [EP/J017698/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Engineering and Physical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This project was funded by UK Engineering and Physical Research Council grant Transforming the Engineering of Cities to Deliver Societal and Planetary Wellbeing, EP/J017698/1.",,54,34,36,6,68,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,284,293,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.030,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,"Green Accepted, hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300027,0

The global electricity sector, however, is still dominated by large incumbent utility companies, which have historically been slow to embrace change. Given this seeming contradiction, in this paper we investigate whether and how 25 of the biggest electric utilities worldwide have adapted their business portfolios during the energy transition from 2003 to 2015. We observe three developments in utilities' business portfolios, namely an increase in (1) de-carbonization, (2) decentralization and servitization, and (3) system integration and balancing. Our results indicate that utilities have been more proactive in embracing de-carbonization as the core goal of the energy transition than the two successive challenges of decentralization and system integration. The lag in system integration is surprising, given that utilities traditionally possess considerable knowledge and assets that they could leverage to integrate decentralized low-carbon generation. We conclude that utilities can play a major role in integrating and balancing the components of a low-carbon electricity system, but that regulatory changes or additional policy incentives may be necessary to spur system integration as a critical part of the energy transition.","[Frei, Fanny; Sinsel, Simon R.; Hanafy, Ahmed; Hoppmann, Joern] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Hoppmann, J (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",jhoppmann@ethz.ch,,"Sinsel, Simon/0000-0002-1881-4884",Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research (SCCER CREST); Swiss Innovation Agency [1155000154]; ewz (Elektrizitatswerk der Stadt Zurich),Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research (SCCER CREST); Swiss Innovation Agency; ewz (Elektrizitatswerk der Stadt Zurich),"The authors would like to thank Catharina Bening, Volker Hoffmann, Alejandro Nunez Jimenez, and Ann-Kristin Zobel for their valuable comments and input on earlier versions of this article.

Such information is vital to all levels of government and stakeholders. Using a national online survey sample (n = 1042), we examine what factors influence public support/opposition. Results of regression analysis indicate that supporters tend to be male, hold a bachelor's degree or higher, wealthier, politically conservative, and reference affective images of the economy, energy, and trade. In contrast, opponents tend to be women, politically liberal, and reference affective images related to keeping natural gas in the U.S., the environment, and hydraulic fracturing.

Two aspects will be analyzed: 1) the cost of procurement and the increase in social welfare thanks to cross-border procurement and 2) implications for the arrival of new entrants such as aggregators of distributed resources (Electric Vehicles fleet are considered in our survey). We conclude that joining the FCR Cooperation will have a negative impact on the participation of aggregators and might not play a useful role in lowering costs for the procurement of reserves. We propose new rules to solve these issues.","[Borne, Olivier; Petit, Marc] UPSud, CNRS, UMR 8507, GeePs,CentraleSupdlec, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Borne, Olivier; Petit, Marc] UPMC, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Perez, Yannick] Univ Paris Sud, RITM, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Perez, Yannick] CentraleSupelec, LGI, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Saclay,"Borne, O (通讯作者)，UPSud, CNRS, UMR 8507, GeePs,CentraleSupdlec, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;Borne, O (通讯作者)，UPMC, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",Olivier.borne@centralesupelec.fr; yannick.perez@u-psud.fr; marc.petit@centralesupelec.fr,"Perez, Yannick/JNF-0695-2023","Perez, Yannick/0000-0002-6382-9313","PSA Group: Hybrid technologies and Economy of Electromobility, Armand Peugeot Chair; Groupe PSA","PSA Group: Hybrid technologies and Economy of Electromobility, Armand Peugeot Chair; Groupe PSA","This research benefits from the support of the PSA Group: Hybrid technologies and Economy of Electromobility, so-called Armand Peugeot Chair led by the CentraleSupelec school of engineering and ESSEC business school and sponsored by the Groupe PSA.",,32,16,16,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,140,148,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.019,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200014,0

As the policy of reducing coal consumption is implemented, China's natural gas consumption is expected to commensurately rise. Such a trend may lead to the significant impacts on China's energy security and the global gas market. This paper empirically investigates the relationship between the natural gas consumption and influencing factors in a comprehensive LMDI-STIRPAT-PLSR framework. It is found that fossil energy structure and non-clean energy structure are the most important factors followed by urbanization, per capita GDP, industrialization, and industrial energy intensity. And then, these factors from LMDI decomposition are innovatively divided into economic development and cleaning indicators when using scenario analysis to forecast China's natural gas consumption. The prediction results suggest that economic development with high clean energy system would make a significant increase in gas consumption, a commensurate increase in demand even the system of economic-energy under scenario of low economic development and low clean. As China would depend on gas imports to meet this demand, there may be a serious supply shortage by 2020. Therefore, the government should consider the future energy security issue in making economic and environmental policies.","[Chai, Jian; Lai, Kin Keung] Xidian Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710126, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liang, Ting] Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Hong Kong 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chai, Jian; Zhang, Zhe George] Western Washington Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Xidian University; Hunan University; City University of Hong Kong; Western Washington University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS","Liang, T (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",liangting07031992@163.com,"liang, ting/JFB-4960-2023; Lai, Kin Keung/AEB-4278-2022; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023","Lai, Kin Keung/0000-0003-0014-2095; Wang, Shouyang/0000-0001-5773-998X","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71473155]; New Star of Youth Science and Technology Plan Project in Shaanxi Province, China [2016KJXX-14]; 2016 Annual Basic Scientific Research Project of Xidian University [JB160603]","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); New Star of Youth Science and Technology Plan Project in Shaanxi Province, China; 2016 Annual Basic Scientific Research Project of Xidian University","The paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under grant No. 71473155, the New Star of Youth Science and Technology Plan Project in Shaanxi Province, China No. 2016KJXX-14 and 2016 Annual Basic Scientific Research Project of Xidian University No. JB160603.

A case study in subtropical Hong Kong,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Green building certification scheme; Building energy code; Overall thermal transfer value; Photovoltaic system; Energy conservation in buildings,,"For promoting energy-efficient building design, various green building certification schemes such as BREEAM, LEED, DGNB, Green Mark, BEAM Plus, ASHRAE Standard 90.1, Code of Practice for OTTV, etc. have been developed around the world. In recent years, photovoltaic system is widely adopted in building application. This system can offer double benefits: (i) generating electricity by absorbing and transforming solar energy; (ii) reducing heat gain transmitted into a building through building envelope. Since the current building certification schemes were originally developed for buildings constructed with conventional building materials, the reduction in heat gain resulted from the application of photovoltaic systems cannot be properly reflected in these building certification schemes. This study investigates the effect of photovoltaic systems on the thermal performance of buildings. Three existing buildings located in subtropical Hong Kong were used as case study. It was found that the effect of photovoltaic glazing system on the reduction in heat gain was significant (ranging from -13.59% to -38.78%). Based on the findings from this study, it is recommended to incorporate the effect of photovoltaic glazing system into the OTTV regulation in Hong Kong. The methodology developed in this study can be applied to other building certification schemes and energy codes.","[Chan, Apple Lok Shun] City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Bldg Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Chan, ALS (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Bldg Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bsapplec@cityu.edu.hk,,"CHAN, Lok Shun Apple/0000-0002-6746-3494","Public Policy Research Funding Scheme, Central Policy Unit, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government [2014.A1.008.14E]","Public Policy Research Funding Scheme, Central Policy Unit, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government","This work was supported by a research grant from the Public Policy Research Funding Scheme, Central Policy Unit, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (research grant number: 2014.A1.008.14E).

Large variations in energy expenditure shares are identified, with the shares being significantly higher in New Member States than the EU15. First, these variations indicate that a single expenditure-based pan-EU fuel poverty metric is problematic; there is a trade-off between a metric identifying households in most need within individual Member States and one identifying households in a similar position across Member States. Second, household-level data from the UK, France and the Republic of Ireland are used to simulate the impact of 'policy interventions', involving energy expenditure reductions or income increases, on the recorded rate of fuel poverty. These simulations highlight that emphasising high-level fuel poverty metrics may distort policymakers' choices towards improving the 'picture' of fuel poverty rather than maximising welfare improvements. Robust impact assessments identifying the fuel poverty interventions which deliver the greatest welfare increases for a given cost offer a better means of policy evaluation.","[Deller, David] Univ East Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Deller, D (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",david.deller@uea.ac.uk,,"Deller, David/0000-0001-7398-6083","Microsoft; EDF Energy; Utility Regulator Northern Ireland; E-Control, Austrian energy regulator through Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE); EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Microsoft(Microsoft); EDF Energy; Utility Regulator Northern Ireland; E-Control, Austrian energy regulator through Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported by Microsoft, EDF Energy, the Utility Regulator Northern Ireland and E-Control, the Austrian energy regulator, through the Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE).",,33,29,29,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,168,182,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.033,0.0,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,"Green Accepted, Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200017,0

This study takes the finding of a recent simulation for 100%renewable Australian electricity supply, along with commonly quoted EROI values for the technologies involved, and derives a conclusion for total energy supply system EROI. The EROI values for individual renewable technologies do not provide a reliable guide to the system value because of the large amount of redundant plant that must be on hand to enable whole systems to meet demand reliably despite intermittency. The general finding is that 100% renewable supply systems probably have values that are too low to sustain energy intensive societies.","[Trainer, Ted] 5 Dryandra St, Wadalba 2259, Australia",,"Trainer, T (通讯作者)，5 Dryandra St, Wadalba 2259, Australia.",tedtrainertsw@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,15,16,2,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,648,653,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.045,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200059,0

Yet, some energy contracting markets grow slowly and some segments remain untapped. In order to assess whether the potential is underexploited and policy support is needed, the determinants of energy supply contracting adoption are analyzed using a dataset of 2003 accepted and rejected contracts offered in the Swiss market. The results show that the advantages of risk sharing and economies of scale brought by contracting, as well as trust in the supplier and the technology, are important determinants of the client's choice. A large number of decision-makers, inducing higher expected transaction costs, negatively impacts the likelihood of adoption. Less specific contracts involving residential or new buildings are more likely to be signed. Policy intervention is needed to reduce the entailed transaction costs, by clarifying the regulatory framework regarding tenants and subsidizing the costs of facilitators. Trust may be enhanced by the government's information campaigns on renewable technologies and certifications of the suppliers.

Consequently, much effort has been focused on how to integrate these different resources in larger and mature electricity systems such as the use of capacity markets in addition to energy-only markets. This paper argues that the effectiveness of competition is limited by the size of an electricity system and there is a threshold size (and associated characteristics such as tropical locations, lack of access, and the prevalence of remote communities of consumers) below which competition will not produce the expected outcomes. This paper contributes to the policy discourse by discussing the reform of small electricity systems to integrate renewable energy via the means of three case studies: Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Australia's Northern Territory. The paper concludes that electricity reforms and renewables can be complementary in small systems when supported by appropriate instruments and incentives. We draw policy lessons for other small systems that are pursuing a triad of objectives including electricity reform, large-scale renewables development and improving energy access.","[Nepal, Rabindra] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England; [Sen, Anupama] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England",Massey University; Durham University; University of Oxford,"Nepal, R (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Massey Business Sch, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",R.N.Nepal@Massey.AC.NZ,"Nepal, Rabindra/J-2027-2019","Nepal, Rabindra/0000-0001-9378-6206",,,,,46,13,13,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,19,29,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.013,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200003,0

Through an interview-based qualitative case study of the development and diffusion of high-voltage switchgear, it provides a supplier perspective on how the downstream capacity to recognize and assess the potential value of innovations has fared in the face of downsized utility organizations, seeking to cut costs through aggressive outsourcing of engineering, procurement and construction activities. Highlighting how relations between end-clients and upstream suppliers - following a strategic orientation towards activities considered to be core - increasingly have become mediated by consultants and project-based contractors, the narrative analysis first suggests that this has stolen the industry of important inter-organizational learning processes. This in ways that have reduced the 'absorptive capacity' of the utilities sector. Second, the analysis suggests that the contractual form that has come to dominate infrastructure projects further works to de-incentivize the adoption of new technology, by diluting the perceived utility of innovation across the array of actors populating the value chain. Thirdly, the paper calls for renewed policy measures to deal with this reinforced reluctance towards the new.","[Skold, David; Fornstedt, Helena; Lindahl, Marcus] Uppsala Univ, Div Ind Engn & Management, Box 534, SE-75121 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Sköld, D (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Div Ind Engn & Management, Box 534, SE-75121 Uppsala, Sweden.",david.skold@angstrom.uu.se; helena.fornstedt@angstrom.uu.se; rnarcus.lindahl@angstrom.uu.se,"Fornstedt, Helena SE/N-6101-2016",,Lars Erik Lundberg Foundation for Research and Education,Lars Erik Lundberg Foundation for Research and Education,This research project was supported by the Lars Erik Lundberg Foundation for Research and Education.,,63,5,5,0,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,220,231,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.057,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200023,0

An empirical application to the Smets and Wouters () model demonstrates the properties of the estimation method, and shows how the problem of multimodal posterior distributions caused by parameter redundancy is eliminated by identification constraints.

Different applications and processes exist, which can provide Demand Response (DR) potential by shifting or shedding their load. The availability of most applications depend on the ambient temperature and/or time of day. Furthermore, their commitment is limited by technical restrictions, e.g. shifting time. In this paper, the availability and the flexibility of DR is analysed to investigate its role for the system integration of RES in Germany. In a first step, DR potential on an hourly basis is calculated for today and for future years. In a second step, the use of DR in an electricity system with different RES shares is investigated with an electricity market model. Results show, DR reduces RES curtailment. However, due to its limited availability and flexibility, it cannot integrate high amount of RES surplus over a longer period. Instead, it balances shortterm fluctuation of the residual load curve. The exploited potential varies between DR applications because of their different characteristics. Therefore, focused (on selected applications) rather than broad development of DR potential is needed to shape the future energy system in a cost efficient way.","[Mueller, Theresa; Moest, Dominik] Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Energy Econ, Munchner Pl 3, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Müller, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Energy Econ, Munchner Pl 3, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",Theresa.Mueller@tu-dresden.de,,"Most, Dominik/0000-0001-7170-3596",,,,,54,101,104,0,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,181,198,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.025,0.0,,,18,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800019,0

Though increasing the share of RE is high on the policy agenda, the general public has been slow to adopt it. In Ethiopia, the dissemination of RE has been limited due to lack of institutional capacity, among others. The purpose of this article is to empirically test the impact of cooperatives (institutions taking an active role in the Ethiopian economy) on RE adoption in rural Tigray, Ethiopia. To this end, we use the treatment effects model in a bid to address the potential problem of selection bias in observational studies.

Several measures to avoid the carbon lock-in involve technology-specific measures, which in turn implies that those measures may result in an energy system locked-in to certain low carbon technologies. We consider that the Brazilian system needs policies to escape the carbon lock in, which are based on providing incentives to low carbon technologies. We develop an analytical framework to analyze the role of regulatory institutions in the possible lock-in to utility-scale photovoltaic, in the sense that they create barriers to the adoption of distributed-generation photovoltaic. We show that the definition of a process to adapt the institutional framework in a context of stress in the innovation system is crucial for the adoption of new technologies. Applying our framework to the Brazilian power sector, we observe that only when regulators consider the possibility that the system is locked-in to centralized production technologies (and not when they just consider the carbon lock-in) they manage to eliminate barriers to distributed generation based on solar PV.","[Vazquez, Miguel; Hallack, Michelle] Univ Fed Fluminense UFF, NIETI, Campus Gragoata Bloco F Sao Domingos, BR-24210350 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Vazquez, Miguel] Bocconi Univ, IEFE, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Vazquez, Miguel; Hallack, Michelle] European Univ Inst, RSCAS, Florence Sch Regulat, Via Fontanelle 19, I-50014 Florence, Italy",Universidade Federal Fluminense; Bocconi University; European University Institute,"Vazquez, M (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, IEFE, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",miguel.vazquez.martinez@gmail.com; michellecmhallack@gmail.com,,,CAPES/BRASIL through the Science without Borders post-doctoral program,CAPES/BRASIL through the Science without Borders post-doctoral program,"We thank Ronaldo Bicalho and Gustavo Andreao for fruitful discussions that helped shaping the ideas developed herein.

In a survey experiment with 3208 villagers from six major states of northern India, we examine the social acceptance of off-grid solar power as an alternative to grid extension. By randomly assigning different frames about this energy technology to the villagers, we study how concerns about the cost of sustainable energy, inequality of energy access, and the role of private business and the state shape individuals' acceptance of off-grid solar power. We find that concerns about the role of private business and possible increases in rural-urban inequality are salient among the rural population. The rural population is concerned about (i) exploitative businesses practices and (ii) the inequality that solar power in villages is more expensive than conventional grid power in urban areas. These findings show that the social acceptance of new, sustainable energy technologies cannot be taken for granted in rural development and offer insights into the salience of different varieties of concerns.","[Aklin, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh, 4600 Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Cheng, Chao-Yo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Urpelainen, Johannes] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Johns Hopkins University,"Aklin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, 4600 Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",aklin@pitt.edu,"Aklin, Michael/JEZ-7827-2023","Aklin, Michael/0000-0003-3912-082X",Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation; ClimateWorks,Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation; ClimateWorks,"l We thank the Council on Environment, Energy and Water for their participation in this research project and MORSEL India for excellent data collection.

Although the relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth has been extensively analysed in the empirical literature, this framework has, not been used to estimate the effect of electricity regulation on economic growth. Understanding this effect is essential for the assessment of regulatory policy. Specifically, we assess the effects of two major areas of regulation, renewable energy promotion costs and network costs, on electricity consumption and growth. A dataset for the period 2007-2013 and 22 European countries was compiled based on CEER reports and EUROSTAT databases. The results of the empirical analysis show that the two regulation instruments have a negative effect on electricity consumption and economic growth and provide estimates of their effects on growth in quantitative terms.","[Garcia-Quevedo, J.] Univ Barcelona, IEB, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain; Univ Barcelona, IEB, Chair Energy Sustainabil, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"García-Quevedo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, IEB, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain.",mtcosta@ub.edu; jgarciaq@ub.edu; elisatrujillo@ub.edu,"Garcia-Quevedo, Jose/AAG-9597-2019; Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/P-2285-2019","Garcia-Quevedo, Jose/0000-0001-8078-1203; Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/0000-0002-6328-3242","Chair of Energy Sustainability (IEB, University of Barcelona); MINECO / FEDER, EU [ECO2015-69107-R]; Government of Catalonia [2015-SGR-531]","Chair of Energy Sustainability (IEB, University of Barcelona); MINECO / FEDER, EU; Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya)","We are grateful to Odin Costa for providing excellent research assistance.

We construct a two-country trade model to explore the effects of trade liberalization in EGs on the local pollution, the global environment and welfare in the presence of such an environmental conundrum. We find that countries do not necessarily benefit from trade liberalization in EGs in the absence of an environmental policy. With the assistance of an upstream pollution tax, trade liberalization in EGs improves each country's welfare. This result holds independent of whether the upstream market is competitive or not, or whether we have upstream trade across countries. For asymmetric countries, trade liberalization in EGs improves the world welfare and the welfare for the country if it has a smaller demand for EGs; or experiences less damage from the production of dirty inputs; or values environment improvement more.

Its implementation rests on comparisons of two distributions' quantile functions, or of their multiple partial integrals, at fixed population proportions. This article develops a novel statistical inference model for inverse stochastic dominance that is based on the influence function approach. The proposed method allows model-free evaluations that are limitedly affected by contamination in the data. Asymptotic normality of the estimators allows to derive tests for the restrictions implied by various forms of inverse stochastic dominance. Monte Carlo experiments and an application promote the qualities of the influence function estimator when compared with alternative dominance criteria.","[Andreoli, Francesco] Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res LISER, Living Condit Dept, Esch Sur Alzette Belval Campus, L-4366 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Andreoli, F (通讯作者)，Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res LISER, Living Condit Dept, Esch Sur Alzette Belval Campus, L-4366 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",francesco.andreoli@liser.lu,,,"Fonds National de la Recherche, Luxembourg [AFR-5932132]","Fonds National de la Recherche, Luxembourg(Luxembourg National Research Fund)","The valuable suggestions by Eric Bonsang, Alessio Fusco, Arnaud Lefranc, Fabrizia Mealli, Federico Perali, Philippe Van Kerm, Claudio Zoli, and two referees substantially improved the presentation of results.

The need for cardinal changes in the pricing of construction is evident today for all participants of investment and construction activities. Article provides a brief analysis of the development dynamics of the construction industry in the context of economic crisis and identification of factors that have affected the decline in investment activity in recent years, as well as a review of the conceptual changes in pricing and estimated rationing. Most important and basic factors that affect Russian market of construction and real estate include world oil prices and, as a consequence, exchange rate volatility, inflation, supply demand, availability of mortgage loans. In the process of establishing the value of construction products, many variable factors are taken into account, starting from the forms of mutual relations of participants in the investment process, sources of financing and ending with regional features of determining the price for construction products. Influences on the price have determination methods and level of the estimated prices, stage of investment project, price of the contract. Article clarifies the list of legislative, regulatory and methodological documents regulating the transition to a new system of pricing in construction. The results of the activities carried out during the reform of the pricing system are summarized.","[Anna, Solovyeva; Olga, Antonyan; Olga, Maksimchuk] Volgograd State Tech Univ, Dept Management & Dev Municipal Econ & Construct, Volgograd, Russia",Volgograd State Technical University,"Anna, S (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Tech Univ, Dept Management & Dev Municipal Econ & Construct, Volgograd, Russia.",solovan@yandex.ru; antonyan.o@mail.ru; olga_maksimchuk@mail.ru,"Maksimchuk, Olga/ABH-1237-2021","Maksimchuk, Olga/0000-0003-4393-6231",,,,,19,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1341,1348,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300172,0

This initiative may be included in an ephemeral generation of foreign companies in charge of municipal lighting. Apparently, these foreign direct investments were unreasonable where urban markets were underdeveloped. Competition with electricity and the restrictions on coal consumption during World War I finished with these firms. Actually, the exclusive privilege of public lighting was a sentence as long as the town Hall became both the main user and the only source of market regulation. Without any intention of either raising taxes or paying for this public service, the councils anchored concessionaires companies to unprofitable businesses, in localities with a very low income average.","[Bartolome Rodriguez, Isabel] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Giron Sierra, Alvaro] Inst Mila & Fontanals CSIC, Barcelona, Spain",University of Sevilla; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institucion Mila y Fontanals (IMF),"Rodríguez, IB (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",,"GIRON, ALVARO/L-1606-2017","GIRON, ALVARO/0000-0001-8222-5577",,,,,50,0,0,0,1,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The basic idea is to conduct the standard GMM estimation combined with two penalty terms: the adaptively weighted lasso shrinkage and the quadratic regularization. It is a one-step procedure of valid moment condition selection, nonzero structural parameter selection (i.e., model selection), and consistent estimation of the nonzero parameters. The procedure achieves the standard GMM efficiency bound as if we know the valid moment conditions ex ante, for which the quadratic regularization is important. We also study the tuning parameter choice, with which we show that selection consistency still holds without assuming Gaussianity. We apply the new estimation procedure to dynamic panel data models, where both the time and cross-section dimensions are large. The new estimator is robust to possible serial correlations in the regression error terms.","[Caner, Mehmet] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43215 USA; [Caner, Mehmet] Ohio State Univ, Dept Translat Data Analyt, Columbus, OH 43215 USA; [Han, Xu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lee, Yoonseok] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Lee, Yoonseok] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; City University of Hong Kong; Syracuse University; Syracuse University,"Caner, M (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43215 USA.;Caner, M (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Translat Data Analyt, Columbus, OH 43215 USA.",caner.12@osu.edu; xuhan25@cityu.edu.hk; ylee41@maxwell.syr.edu,,"Lee, Yoonseok/0000-0002-8379-0700",,,,,26,13,14,1,12,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Global Big Data resources, with substantial variability and varied structure, contain much useful information. The aim of this paper is to present opportunities for using Big Data resources generated by health care stakeholders in management of patient relations.

The safety culture and accidents monitoring implementation are the responsibility of the national and European regulators. The most important indicators and trends related to the state of safety on European railways obtained based on the above-mentioned reports and available statistical data are presented in the paper.

Although the analysis results clearly show that consistent efforts in the area of safety lead to structural reduction in the number of incidents, there is still scope of the improvement in many areas. The comparative analysis of the safety indicators in the individual European countries was also included in this paper. It turned out that a small group of countries is responsible for a significant part of accidents. These countries need to pay more attention to the implementation of appropriate corrective actions.

In current globalized world, quality is assessed every day. It is reported, that the quality of the products derives the position of the company compared to other companies. This means that quality is a major factor in competitiveness and international success. In the global assessment of the hierarchy of importance of individual competitive factors, it has a winning position. The starting situation of the company in the conditions of globalization represents a large number of demands placed on it. These claims come not from customers but come from all parties involved. Each company should make an effort to meet these requirements. Based on the experience, it is tested, whether the provided products are of high quality. However, there may be considerable confrontations with this assessment, because the view of quality is characterized by subjectivity. To unify the company quality delivered, three basic concepts of quality management have been developed as a stage in the development of quality management in the world measurement. This is a concept of company or sectoral standards, ISO standards and TQM philosophy.

This aspect deals with rationality and the cause of its failure. The goal of the contribution is to assess, based on the evaluation of the information obtained from Slovak and Czech customers, whether they make their decisions impulsively or deliberately, and at the same time, what behavioural deviations are arising from the aspect of globalization. For the purpose of this finding, the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is used. CRT issues are not difficult in the sense that the right solution is easy to understand by explanation. However, to arrive at the right answer will require overcoming the initial, impulsive response. This simple three-point cognitive ability test is used to examine behavioural deviations that play a significant role in behavioural economics and finance and are close to cognitive abilities. From the questionnaire survey, we found that the principles of behavioural economics have their justification and their presence confirmed the answers of Slovak and Czech respondents from the aspect of globalization. The results of the behavioural analysis show that the impact of deviations from rationality has a significant role in economics to predict customer behaviour on a global scale. The contribution of behavioural analysis of consumer behaviour is significant as it helps to understand the basic processes that are taking place in the consumer's decision as well as the reasons that influence their decision.","[Gajanova, Lubica; Moravcikova, Dominika; Nadanyiova, Margareta] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1-8215, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Moravcikova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1-8215, Zilina, Slovakia.",lubica.gajanova@fpedas.uniza.sk; dominika.moravcikova@fpedas.uniza.sk; margareta.nadanyiova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Gajanova, Lubica/P-2726-2015; Moravcikova, Dominika/O-9468-2016; Nadanyiova, Margareta/O-5872-2015; Nadanyiova, Margareta/JAO-3402-2023","Gajanova, Lubica/0000-0001-9242-5898; Nadanyiova, Margareta/0000-0002-4379-6972;",VEGA [1/0718/18],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This contribution is an output of scientific project VEGA no. 1/0718/18: The impact of psychographic aspects of pricing on the marketing strategy of companies across products and markets.,,17,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,509,516,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300067,0

One of its advantages is that it enables to carry a huge volume of cargo for appropriate price for the customers. In maritime transport, there are international main trade routes that link the countries of Asia, Europe and America. During the transport some incidents, such as unpredictable weather conditions, accidents between seagoing vessels, the strikes of employees in maritime ports, local war conflicts or piracy, arise that may influence it negatively. In the world, there are some areas, like the areas of the Caribbean Sea, the Indian Ocean - the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, where the attacks of pirates on seagoing vessels can threat cargo transport. Nowadays, the pirates are very well organised, a small group of them can hijack a big container vessel or tanker. Their attacks influence the navigation of sea going vessels and transport of cargo very badly, therefore the countries have globalized and have implemented the different measures that could help to reduce them. The Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against ships in Asia (ReCAAP) is a multilateral agreement between 14 Asian countries, the USA, Australia and 4 European countries that promote and enhance cooperation against piracy and armed robbery against ships in Asia. The ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre (ReCAAP ISC) was established under the agreement and conducts timely and accurate information sharing on incidents of piracy and sea robbery in the Indian Ocean.","[Hansut, Lukas; David, Andrej] Univ Zilina, Dept Water Transport, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Hansut, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Dept Water Transport, Zilina, Slovakia.",lukas.hansut@fpedas.uniza.sk; andrej.david@fpedas.uniza.sk,,,VEGA [1/0791/18],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"The paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0791/18, The Assessment of Economic and Technological Aspects in the Provision of Competitive Public Transport Services in Integrated Transport Systems, that is solved at the Faculty of Operations and Economics of Transport and Communication, the University of Zilina.",,15,0,0,1,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,119,126,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300016,0

It focuses on the use of social networks in the globalisation process. Social networks are increasingly used as carriers of marketing information to the customer and the general public. They have an irreplaceable position in the process of globalisation. Their main benefit is that they are not geographically limited. Another benefit is that they are maintained up-to-date in real time. This allows the option to focus on selected regions and a specific group of customers, based on their cultural, social and ethnic preferences and status. For companies, social media also benefit from low cost, and the ability to measure their effect. All this is very beneficial for tourism. The use of this new marketing tool can make a significant contribution to hotels and travel agencies. Interestingly, many tourism companies know these benefits but do not use them to the extent that they could. This can have a negative impact due to the globalisation of this market. The article looks at the current situation on the tourism and hotel market in the Czech Republic, compared with the situation abroad. It monitors the current use of social networks in the communication of hotels and travel agencies and looks for connections with the use of digital media in other areas of the industry.

Constant urban population growth requires preparation of proper development plans and responsible management of these areas. There are also new cities which are built from scratch (so-called greenfield development), that are expected to guarantee residents a high quality of life. Intelligent urban development is based on the concept of a smart city as a modern city of the future, assuming sustainable urban development based on innovative technologies. The aim of intelligent technologies used in the cities is to improve their functionality and to support the residents and provide them with comfortable, economic and safe lives. The smart city concept is the subject of broad deliberations in the literature and there are many different definitions that emphasize technical, social, institutional and environmental aspects. Six essential components that make up a smart city are often listed: smart governance, smart economy, smart mobility, smart environment, smart people, smart living.

The empirical results show that a crowding-out effect is observed in rural areas for several industries that contribute to regional economic growth. This suggests that the allocation of public stimulus investment packages to stagnant regions in Japan might act as a regional growth constraint as well as an obstacle to the capital formation, and stagnant regions cannot evade the stagnation even if the central government plans economic stimuli toward such regions, including public investment.","[Miyazaki, Tomomi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Kobe University,"Miyazaki, T (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",miyazaki@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26380361, 16KK0057]; Financial Aid for Enhancement of International Research Collaboration by Kobe University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16KK0057, 26380361] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Financial Aid for Enhancement of International Research Collaboration by Kobe University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author would like to thank the Department of Economics at UC Irvine for giving him the opportunity of visiting research and also an anonymous referees, Takao Fujii, Toshiya Hatano, Kazuki Hiraga, Keigo Kameda, Masumi Kawade, Wataru Kobayashi, Haruo Kondoh, Hideki Konishi, Joongho Kook, Shigeki Kunieda, Isidoro Mazza, Tomoya Mori, Hiroshi Morita, Sei-lu Mun, Yukihiro Nishimura, Hikaru Ogawa, Abdoulaye Ouedraogo, Ryusuke Shinohara, Etsuro Shioji, Takashi Unayama, andMasatoYodo for their many useful comments.

As a consequence, authorities in different countries are facing the issue of state planning and usage of reliable macro-models for evaluation of innovation development in the building a cross-country mutually beneficial economic relations. During the research it is found that despite the presence of a great number of international estimates of innovation, the vast majority are based not only on objective indicators of the international economic and financial statistics, but also on subjective expert assessments. The aim of this study was to develop and approbate the methodology for calculating the innovative index of industrial development, which makes possible to exclude subjectivity determined by the expert's personal context, take into account the specifics of the country innovative systems and ensure the reproducibility of indexing results. This study performs an indicative analysis and extension of Global Innovation Index 2018.

Our proposed models draw on successful ideas from the literature on modeling high-dimensional covariance matrices and on recent work on models for general time-varying distributions. Our use of copula-based models enables the estimation of the joint model in stages, greatly reducing the computational burden. We use the proposed new models to study a collection of daily credit default swap (CDS) spreads on 100 U.S. firms over the period 2006 to 2012. We find that while the probability of distress for individual firms has greatly reduced since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the joint probability of distress (a measure of systemic risk) is substantially higher now than in the precrisis period.

In the present document, this concept will be analysed from the perspective of the price of food, focusing on the differential of food prices between producers and consumers. This communication aims to study these variables in 73 countries around the world, to identify common behaviour profiles, by means of the application of several statistical methodologies. It can be concluded that the margins have increased in the developed countries (Western Europe, the United States, Japan and Canada mainly) in the period under study, with some stability in the food security indicators. On the other hand, margins decrease in developing countries, with notable improvements in these indicators. An almost generalized improvement is observed in the different indicators of food security analysed in the countries that make up the sample, reducing the gap between developed and developing countries.

The circular economy must be regarded as a modern economic model that changes not only production methods, but also changes the lifestyle of the participants. At the stage of globalization, it has something to offer to improve the quality of life of the population of every country that works on this business philosophy and develops its potential. The evolution of the implementation of the circular economy is understood in relation to positive and negative aspects of globalization and its economic changes. Globalization brings impetus to new trends and efforts for sustainable development. The paper further defines some indicators of quality of life, especially those that the circular economy can influence.

In global world, everything is related to everything. Any decision of monetary or fiscal policy does not stay without response. So how can be the economic growth in small open economy supported? Which instruments should be used? The article shows the possibilities of economic growth support. One of these possibilities is exchange rate intervention. It is the monetary policy instrument so called as beggar thy neighbour. It rests in export supports thanks to devaluing the domestic currency rate. Weakened domestic currency increases competitiveness of domestic goods on foreign markets. It is generally assumed, that this will increase employment and GDP. This is a great and simple solution at first glance. It can also have negative effects on the domestic economy. At the moment, when we exhaust free labor (unemployment is at a very low level), is the problem of maintaining economic growth. Low unemployment leads to the wage growth. Wages grow faster than labor productivity. New workers come from abroad. Part of their wages is absorbed by labor agencies. Therefore, there is no wage decline. And, of course, it is not all. Other problems arise in the rental market, foreigners who have left their jobs or been made redundant do not return home etc. Thus, it is important not only to look for obvious benefits but also to look at potentially hidden threats.","[Tesarova, Vendula] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Tesarova, V (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",vendula.masatova@email.cz,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,413,420,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300055,0

According to Mises, this perception is unequal in different agents, as entrepreneurs are talented individuals that respond to encouragement. But some other Austrian economists defend cooperative arrangements, assuming that everybody has some entrepreneurial skill and could be the owner and manager of the firm. This article poses the question of whether or not it is necessary that the Austrian School of Economics defends an unequal psychology of agents that would preclude cooperative businesses from the market economy. It concludes that Mises' contact with the Spann circle in Vienna was determinant in the creation of his elitist vision of the entrepreneur.","[Trincado, Estrella] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Trincado, E (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",,"Trincado, Estrella/R-5899-2016",,,,,,96,1,1,0,5,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

A systematic content analysis of political debates, campaign speeches, and press statements reveals how Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz undertook in vote-seeking behaviour to create distinct stances on energy and climate issues. Results indicate not only partisan polarization, but also that stakeholder dynamics, control of communications and communication frequency are inter-dependent and reinforcing in generating differing climate positions. Institutional dynamics exacerbate these 'logic schisms' rather than providing a means of collective decision making. We test such climate discourse according to a typology of scientific, economic, national security, and moral frames. We also assess how particular frames morph over time, and are impacted by exogenous factors such as global climate change negotiations, national environmental crises (such as the Flint Water Crisis), and contestation over stranded assets and fossil fuel divestment. We find that political climate discourse must. communicate to collective, bipartisan interests whilst avoiding politically divisive climate frames.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Brown, George; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Sci Policy Res Unit, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Aarhus University; University of Sussex,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",BenjaminSo@hih.au.dk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",,,,,41,19,20,3,62,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,127,136,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.019,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700015,0

Through the investigation of eleven case studies, our research demonstrates the presence of these co-benefits where integration is observed. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is used to link observed input variables to identified co-benefits. This research suggests that integration is an effective means of generating co-benefits that contribute positively to project outcomes. The research further concludes that effective leadership support, either through public-private partnership and energy policy, is one means of achieving such explicit integration. Energy policy, in the form of voluntary instruments and incentives, is recommended to build necessary public-private partnerships and support leadership. Such policy recommendations have applications far beyond the energy sector and the lessons learned here can likely be applied to cases outside of it.","[Hennessey, Ryan] Govt Yukon, 206A Lowe St, Whitehorse, YT 2C6, Canada; [Pittman, Jeremy] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resources & Sustainabil, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Morand, Annette; Douglas, Allan] Laurentian Univ, MIRARCO, Ontario Ctr Climate Impacts & Adaptat Resources, 935 Ramsey Lake Rd, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada",University of Waterloo; Laurentian University,"Hennessey, R (通讯作者)，Govt Yukon, 206A Lowe St, Whitehorse, YT 2C6, Canada.",ryan.hennessey@gov.yk.ca,"Pittman, Jeremy/N-4355-2015",,"Energy Working Group of the Climate Impacts and Adaptation Division, Natural Resources Canada, Government of Canada","Energy Working Group of the Climate Impacts and Adaptation Division, Natural Resources Canada, Government of Canada","This work was supported by the Energy Working Group of the Climate Impacts and Adaptation Division, Natural Resources Canada, Government of Canada.

It was these catastrophic terrorist actions over fifteen years ago that saw the dawn of a new era with heightened security across many everyday areas of society that had not previously witnessed such scrutiny or control. Coupling this elevated risk of physical and technical aggression with the ever-increasing global per capita energy demand - there has been witnessed a continually growing reliance on nuclear energy for baseline power generation, a form of electricity production that requires both the necessary international safeguards and controls for its safe use. As more and more of the global energy budget is provided by low-carbon sources (over highly polluting fossil fuels), the volume of nuclear material in existence will grow substantially - requiring considerable attention and policy to ensure its long-term safety and security. This commentary describes the vast range of policy challenges faced by the nuclear industry resulting from the rapid technological advancements being made across society, and how these directly (and indirectly) affect global nuclear security, as well as providing a thorough discussion on how best these challenges may be overcome.","[Martin, P.

The main empirical result is that a country that initially subsidizes its fossil fuels, and then eliminates or reduces these subsidies, will as a result experience higher economic GDP per capita growth, and higher levels of employment and labor force participation, especially among the young. These effects are strongest in countries whose fuel subsidies are high at the outset, such as in the MENA region. Our model predicts that a 20 US$ cents average increase in the gasoline and diesel prices per liter, through removal of subsidies, increase the GDP per capita growth rate by about 0.48% and 0.30%, respectively. In the MENA countries, governments' savings from reduced subsidies seem to be earmarked mainly to health expenditures, education expenditures and public investment in infrastructure. These channels appear to be strong contributing factors to higher long -run growth when fuel subsidies are reduced.","[Mundaca, Gabriela] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Mundaca, Gabriela] Univ Lima, Lima, Peru",The World Bank; Universidad de Lima,"Mundaca, G (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Mundaca, G (通讯作者)，Univ Lima, Lima, Peru.",bgmundaca@gmail.com,,"Mundaca, Gabriela/0000-0003-3448-8406",,,,,49,21,23,2,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,693,709,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.049,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800069,0

A positive (negative) shock of electricity consumption is estimated to have increased (decreased) economic growth. Economic growth is positively affected by positive shock stems in capital. A positive (negative) shock in financial development declines (increases) economic growth. These findings reveal that (a) Portugal is still an energy-dependent economy; (b) energy is one of the major inputs for economic growth and development; (c) a conservation energy policy should not be implemented because energy is an important driver of growth; (d) economic growth enhances capital formation and not the opposite. Hence, it appears more relevant to boost economic growth before enhancing capital formation; (e) financial development does not appear to be an important catalyst for economic growth. Findings also highlight (0 the relevance of the recent energy policy implemented in Portugal and (g) the need to limit energy imports by means of producing electricity through renewable energy to reduce the external debt level in Portugal, especially after the 2008 crisis.","[Shahbaz, Muhammad; Lahiani, Amine] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Benkraiem, Ramzi] Audencia Business Sch, Inst Finance, Nantes, France; [Miloudi, Anthony] Univ Poitiers, La Rochelle Business Sch, Poitiers, France; [Miloudi, Anthony] Univ Poitiers, CRIEF, Poitiers, France; [Lahiani, Amine] Univ Orleans, LEO, Orleans, France",Montpellier Business School; Audencia; Universite de Poitiers; Universite de Poitiers; Universite de Orleans,"Lahiani, A (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, LEO, Orleans, France.",shahbazmohd@live.com; rbenkraiem@audencia.com; miloudia@esc-larochelle.fr; amine.lahiani@univ-orleans.fr,"Benkraiem, Ramzi/I-7865-2019; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021","Benkraiem, Ramzi/0000-0002-3931-0546; Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997; Miloudi, Anthony/0000-0003-0126-5783",,,,,82,36,37,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,588,599,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.056,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800059,0

Our study identifies causes underlying Australia's underachievement in its transformation towards a renewable-energy economy. We apply a combined mixed methods case-study and multi-criteria analysis to evaluate the greenhouse gas emissions and energy targets, policies and programs of four Australian Prime Ministers between 1996 and 2015. We identify four high-impact factors that contribute to Australia's underachievement. The Prime Minister's political stance on climate and energy is critical in setting the direction of government. The absence of target-driven policy frameworks results in less-effective policy outcomes. Orderly and cost-effective energy system transformation requires bipartisan, strategic long-term planning and substantial capital investment to provide policy certainty and stability that can induce new investment in renewable technologies and industries. Energy policy is primarily a political and ideological issue not one driven by underlying economic conditions. Going forward; Australia must achieve a bipartisan position on climate and energy policy at both federal and state levels. This will provide long-term certainty and stability to support investment in renewable energy and so doing achieve international emission reduction obligations.","[Cheung, Grace; Davies, Peter J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Davies, PJ (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",peter.davies@mq.edu.au,"Cheung, Grace M.Y./I-3673-2013","Davies, Peter/0000-0002-2711-891X",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",The authors acknowledge that the work conducted in the production of this research article was financially supported by the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

Consumers learn about the utility distribution by Bayesian updating their Dirichlet process prior beliefs. The model provides expressions for bounds on the search costs that can rationalize observed search and purchasing behavior. Using individual-specific data on web browsing and purchasing behavior for MP3 players sold online we show how to use these bounds to estimate search costs as well as the parameters of the utility distribution. Our estimates indicate that search costs are sizable.

However, the long-term viability of this practice also depends on its economic sustainability. Despite the potential increase in water use efficiency and yield, the system also needs to generate higher income to be popular among farmers. In view of this, we examine how the use of drip irrigation instead of traditional flood irrigation affects both the yield and gross margin of cotton production in arid northwestern China. Results from propensity score matching of production data from 228 cotton producers show that even though the use of drip irrigation increases farmers' yield, its impact on gross margin is statistically insignificant. We furthermore find through regression analysis that the effect of drip irrigation on gross margin is significantly positive only for the farmers with less water availability constraint, as measured by their water use. With water scarcity in the region expected to increase in the future, the adoption of drip irrigation is likely to become less profitable and hence less viable from farmers' perspective. Therefore, we conclude that especially in regions with water shortage, the promotion of drip irrigation technology inevitably needs to be supported by the simultaneous improvement of water infrastructure to ensure water access at all times. Only then the full potential of drip irrigation to support ecological sustainability of arid crop production can be tapped.","[Khor, Ling Yee] Univ Hohenheim 490A, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Rural Dev Theory & Policy, Wollgrasweg 43, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Feike, Til] Inst Strategies & Technol Assessment, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, JKI, Stahnsdorfer Damm 81, D-14532 Kleinmachnow, Germany; [Feike, Til] Univ Hohenheim 410C, Inst Farm Management Comp Applicat & Business Man, Schwerzstr 46, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim; University Hohenheim,"Khor, LY (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim 490A, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Rural Dev Theory & Policy, Wollgrasweg 43, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",lykhor@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Feike, Til/0000-0002-1978-9473",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the Sustainable Land Management Program,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the Sustainable Land Management Program(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research was embedded in the SuMaRiO-Project (Sustainable Management of River Oasis along the Tarim River) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the Sustainable Land Management Program.

With the transition; towards a sustainable energy system, the household load is changing, through the introduction of photovoltaics and electric vehicles. The tariff structures which are currently employed in the EU are either capacity and/or energy consumption based. In light of the changes in the household load the question whether these tariff structures are the most suitable merits renewed attention. In this work, the cost-reflectivity of various tariff structures has been computed based on a distribution network planning approach. Next to this, the predictability of a network tariff, i.e. how much change would a household experience in network charges in two consecutive years has also been computed to gain insight into how well users will be able to react to the tariff. The results show that a peak load based network tariffs score best on the reflectivity while having an acceptable level of predictability. The switch from an energy consumption based network tariff, which is now most often applied, towards a peak load based network tariff should therefore, be considered.","[Nijhuis, M.; Gibescu, M.; Cobben, J.

Yet few countries have seriously tested household potential to produce energy from PV panels. Propelled by mandatory EU targets for renewable energy, and constrained with limited territory, the Government of Malta launched a subsidy scheme with a view to encouraging PV installation by households. The scheme reached the desired adoption levels within a very short period of time. The study takes an entire-country dimension to assess the determinants of household investment in PV panels. A unique dataset is specifically constructed for this study. We find that the prevalence of younger households, higher incomes, dwelling ownership and unshared roof space results in higher rates of uptake. Neither higher educational levels nor the participation in other environmental schemes (recycling) contribute any explanatory power to uptake of PV panels. Pro-government sentiment (captured by voting outcomes) significantly and positively influences the take-up of the grant and installation of PV panels.

The installation of PV systems by households in Malta continued to rise annually, achieving an 11.7 per cent penetration rate by 2015 with a total of 17,900 systems installed. Capacity had exceeded 34,000 kWp from the residential sector alone, providing more than half of the total capacity generated by PV (Eurostat b., n.d.; REWS, 2016). The case of Malta has shown that, despite the insularity of the country, there is considerable scope to tap renewable energy generation potential - by engaging households. This offers hope to other countries challenged by small size and insularity (Erdinc et al., 2015).

Seventeen semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with respondents from academia, community groups, government, and the private sector. An analytical framework was employed and directed content analysis was utilized. A large majority of expert respondents (65%) classified the current state of WED in the province as 'unfavourable'. In total, 19 unique barriers were identified; the most significant barriers to WED were found to be political (71% of respondents), economic (65%), as well as related to lack of knowledge and agreement (53 and 41%, respectively).

In this situation a continuation of past policies will not suffice, and a dual-track incentive system that both establishes incentives for investing in wind power and integration infrastructure with integration between the electricity, heating and transportation sectors, is required. The current Danish taxation system discourages electricity use and works against this integration. Likewise, the current day-ahead electricity spot market is not appropriate for a high-wind future as wind reduces price levels, but integration across sectors can partly assist in increasing demand and prices. The European Emission Trading System does not suffice in providing a level playing field for wind power and thus needs a revision. Another barrier for on-shore and near-shore wind power expansion is a growing citizens' resistance due to an unequal distribution of benefits and burdens. Ownership should be open for more types of investors especially local investors in order to ensure public support and local acceptance of wind power projects.

These programs provide a venue for understanding how regulations governing multifamily housing can affect an owner's incentive to make energy efficient investments, and a tenant's desire to reduce their energy consumption levels. This paper empirically tests the impact of subsidized housing regulations on the energy efficiency of multi-family housing for low-income households. We begin by constructing a unique database that integrates actual energy use with physical, socioeconomic, and regulatory characteristics of all large multifamily properties in New York City, focusing on whether a property receives a federal rental subsidy. We employ multivariate regression models to examine the factors that influence energy consumption in multi-family buildings and compare subsidized housing to market-rate housing, controlling for a range of building and household characteristics. We find that subsidized properties are associated with higher energy consumption than similar market-rate properties and, of the subsidized housing programs, Public Housing tends to consume the most energy. Our results suggest that despite the potential for retrofitting multifamily properties, and associated cost, energy, and carbon emissions savings, regulatory factors constrain investment and consumption decisions in the case of subsidized properties. Reducing energy use in subsidized housing, therefore, rests on modifying existing regulations.","[Reina, Vincent J.] Univ Penn, Dept City & Reg Planning, 127 Meyerson Hall,210 South 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kontokosta, Constantine] NYU, Ctr Urban Sci & Progress, 1 MetroTech Ctr,19th Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Kontokosta, Constantine] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, 1 MetroTech Ctr,19th Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA",University of Pennsylvania; New York University; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Reina, VJ (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept City & Reg Planning, 127 Meyerson Hall,210 South 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",vreina@upenn.edu; ckontokosta@nyu.edu,,"Kontokosta, Constantine/0000-0003-4831-9996","Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy; MacArthur Foundation; National Science Foundation [1653772]; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering [1653772] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy; MacArthur Foundation; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","The authors would like to thank Sean Capperis, Ali Levine, and Daniel Marasco for their assistance organizing and cleaning these data.

Several other countries have subsequently followed the lead and restructured their electricity industry. A major outcome of the deregulation effort is the spate of takeovers, both domestic and global, by electric utility companies. With the entry of new players and increasing competition, the business environment of the electricity industry has changed dramatically. This study analyzes the economic impact of mergers and acquisitions (M &As) in the electric utility industry after deregulation. We have examined acquisitions that took place between 1998 and 2013 in the United States, Canada, the UK, Germany, and France. Although previous studies showed no evidence of a positive effect on acquiring firms through M & As, we find that acquisitions by electric utility companies increased the acquiring firms' share value and improved their operating performance, primarily through efficiency gains after the deregulation. These results are consistent with the empirical evidence and implications presented by Andrade et al. (2001) that M & A created value for the shareholders of the acquiring and target combined firms.","[Kishimoto, Jo] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Goto, Mika] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Environm Soc, Technol & Innovat Management, Dept Innovat Sci,Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; [Inoue, Kotaro] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Engn, Dept Ind Engn & Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology; Tokyo Institute of Technology; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Goto, M (通讯作者)，Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Environm Soc, Technol & Innovat Management, Dept Innovat Sci,Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528552, Japan.",goto.m.af@m.titech.ac.jp,"Goto, Mika/C-9980-2015","Goto, Mika/0000-0001-7214-2233","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15H03375, 25285099, 26285050, 16K01236]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H03375, 25285099, 26285050, 16K01236] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank Dr. Reinhard Madlener (RWTH Aachen University) and two anonymous reviewers whose comments have improved the quality of this study.

Considered as a large agricultural country, carbon emission in China's agriculture sector keeps on growing rapidly. It is, therefore, of great importance to investigate the driving forces of carbon dioxide emissions in this sector. The traditional regression estimation can only get average and global parameter estimates; it excludes the local parameter estimates which vary across space in some spatial systems. Geographically weighted regression embeds the latitude and longitude of the sample data into the regression parameters, and uses the local weighted least squares method to estimate the parameters point-by-point. To reveal the nonstationary spatial effects of driving forces, geographically weighted regression model is employed in this paper. The results show that economic growth is positively correlated with emissions, with the impact in the western region being less than that in the central and eastern regions. Urbanization is positively related to emissions but produces opposite effects pattern. Energy intensity is also correlated with emissions, with a decreasing trend from the eastern region to the central and western regions. Therefore, policymakers should take full account of the spatial nonstationarity of driving forces in designing emission reduction policies.","[Xu, Bin] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bin] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Res Ctr Appl Stat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn; bqlin2004@vip.sina.com,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010; Chekalin, Vyacheslav/S-6391-2017","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Xu, Bin/0000-0003-3581-7603","Xiamen University - Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund; Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15BTJ022, 16BTJ011]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71663024]; Jiangxi Soft Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20151BBA10037, 20161BBA10042, 20161BBA10071]",Xiamen University - Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund; Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangxi Soft Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province,"The paper is supported by Xiamen University - Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund, the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), and Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No: 1260-Y07200), National Social Science Foundation of China (No: 15BTJ022; 16BTJ011), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71663024), and Jiangxi Soft Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. 20151BBA10037; 20161BBA10042; 20161BBA10071).

We apply choice-specific, clustered fixed-effect response models. The results show that industry-specific immigration clustering indices have strong and negative effects on the location choices of the native born. When the scaled immigration measures are used, the results confirm the substitution' hypothesis: native-born workers who choose lower immigration in their destinations also move from the origins with higher immigration in their industry.

Se aplicaron modelos de respuesta de efectos fijos agrupados de opcion especifica. Los resultados muestran que los indices de aglomeracion de la inmigracion especificos para ciertos sectores tienen fuertes efectos negativos sobre las opciones de ubicacion de los trabajadores nativos.

Ideally, all of this new supply is carbon-neutral. The potentials for renewables in SSA suffice for any conceivable demand, but the wind power and photovoltaic resources are intermittent and difficult to integrate in the weak electricity grids. Here, we investigate the potential for supplying SSA demand centers with dispatchable electricity from concentrating solar power (CSP) stations equipped with thermal storage. We show that, given anticipated cost reductions from technological improvements, power from CSP could be competitive with coal power in Southern Africa by 2025; but in most SSA countries, power from CSP may not be competitive. We also show that variations in risk across countries influences the cost of power from CSP more than variations in solar resources. If policies to de-risk CSP investment to financing cost levels found in industrialized countries were successfully implemented, power from CSP could become cheaper than coal power by 2025 in all SSA countries. Policies to increase institutional capacity and cooperation among SSA countries could reduce costs further. With dedicated policy measures, therefore, CSP could become an economically attractive electricity option for all SSA countries.","[Labordena, Merce; Patt, Anthony; Lilliestam, Johan] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Climate Policy Grp, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bazilian, Morgan; Howells, Mark] KTH Royal Inst Technol, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Royal Institute of Technology,"Labordena, M (通讯作者)，ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Climate Policy Grp, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",merce.labordena@usys.ethz.ch,,"Patt, Anthony/0000-0001-8428-8707; Howells, Mark/0000-0001-6419-4957",European Research Council Consolidator Grant [StG 2012-313553],European Research Council Consolidator Grant(European Research Council (ERC)),Funding for this work was received from the European Research Council Consolidator Grant StG 2012-313553.

This research evaluated the economic, welfare and environmental impact of this policy on Iran's economy. Therefore, after developing an Economic-Energy Environmental (E3) type of Hybrid General Equilibrium model, the effect of FIT policy was examined under different scenarios in order to find an optimal condition in which 10% of electrical energy could be produced from renewable resources. The comparison between the results showed that the application of subsidies to RE and the way the government finances these subsidies can affect the results of kin policy.

Regional Studies. Based on the distribution patterns of rural credit cooperatives in about 2200 counties in 2009, this paper examines two aspects of financial exclusion in rural China after the restructuring of the banking industry. Despite the state's efforts to ensure financial inclusion in rural areas, poor farmers could be spatially included while still being denied loans due to their inability to provide collateral, and the lack of formal credit records. The mismatch between the supply and demand of credit has led to informal loans substituting for formal loans and thus contributed to the proliferation of informal banking in China.","[Yeung, Godfrey] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, Singapore; [He, Canfei] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Peng] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Hist & Econ, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England",National University of Singapore; Peking University; University of Cambridge,"Yeung, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, Singapore.",geoykyg@nus.edu.sg; hecanfei@urban.pku.edu.cn; zhangpeng.amy@gmail.com,"Zhang, Hui/HHN-8494-2022; Yeung, Godfrey/D-3122-2013",,National University of Singapore's Academic Research Fund [R-109-000-154-112]; National Natural Science of China [41425001],"National University of Singapore's Academic Research Fund(Ministry of Education, SingaporeNational University of Singapore); National Natural Science of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))",The National University of Singapore's Academic Research Fund [grant number R-109-000-154-112] financed parts of the first author's field survey.

Since 2014 Russian economy has been under the influence of sanctions. Although there are different views on the successfulness of this tool, this global challenge is obviously a serious test for Russian innovative enterprises. Russian innovation sector is developing poorly; the economy largely relies on the import of new technologies and hi-tech equipment. The aim of this research is to evaluate regions' innovative development under the influence of sanctions. For this purpose authors developed an equation of regional innovative development where four main factors were defined by means of decomposition; their influence was widely discussed and is scientifically proven: the effect of human assets, productivity effect of the sector generating knowledge, costs effect, productivity effect of the sector producing innovative products. Factor analysis performed in 51 regions shown that at least half of the regions reduced innovative activity. Leading regions were seriously affected. However, productivity effect of the sector generating knowledge shows that some regions have laid the groundworks allowing them to ensure sustainability of regional innovation system under conditions of global challenges. Following the analysis, authors came to conclusion that temps of innovation activity slump are not as significant as it was expected.Further innovative development requires significant state and private investments in human assets, system of knowledge generation. Otherwise, the effect of sanctions will grow.","[Anatolievna, Khmeleva Galina; Kyabirovna, Agaeva Liliya] Samara State Univ Econ, 141 Sovetskoi Armii Str, Samara 443090, Russia; [Anatolievna, Khmeleva Galina; Kyabirovna, Agaeva Liliya] Samara Natl Res Univ, 1 Acad Pavlova St, Samara 443010, Russia",Samara National Research University,"Anatolievna, KG (通讯作者)，Samara State Univ Econ, 141 Sovetskoi Armii Str, Samara 443090, Russia.;Anatolievna, KG (通讯作者)，Samara Natl Res Univ, 1 Acad Pavlova St, Samara 443010, Russia.",galina.a.khmeleva@yandex.ru; liliya.agaeva@yandex.ru,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research [17-02-00340],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"This paper is an output of the science project No. 17-02-00340 Innovative Development of Russian Regions in the Conditions of Sanctions: Impact Assessments, Differentiation and Opportunities for Advanced Development 2017-2018 of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research.",,19,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,906,913,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201051,0

The model assumes that risk exposures and idiosyncratic volatility follow a break-point latent process, allowing for changes at any point on time but not restricting them to change at all points. The empirical application to 40 years of U.S. data and 23 portfolios shows that the approach yields sensible results compared to previous two-step methods based on naive recursive estimation schemes, as well as a set of alternative model restrictions. A variance decomposition test shows that although most of the predictable variation comes from the market risk premium, a number of additional macroeconomic risks, including real output and inflation shocks, are significantly priced in the cross-section. A Bayes factor analysis massively favors the proposed change-point model.

Overall, this paper finds that the size of the informal sector has a statistically significant and negative association with economic outcomes that is much larger in magnitude than what is predicted by least squares estimates due to its exclusion of spillover effects, while corruption has no significant relationship. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the size of the informal sector is associated with a 26 % cumulative decrease in GDP per capita, compared to the maximum of a 17 % decline predicted by least squares.","[Bologna, Jamie] West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Bologna, J (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",jbologna@mix.wvu.edu,,,,,,,58,6,8,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Globalists highlight the benefits of this process, meanwhile anti-globalists emphasize the negative consequences. According to neutrals - globalization process can lead to both - positive and negative outcomes, depending on countries' globalization depth, economic development level and other factors. This study aims to determine i) whether the impact of globalization leads to the EU economic growth; ii) what impact on economic growth have separate dimensions of globalization; iii) whether this effect depends on a country's economic development level. To examine these questions, we used EU member states data over the period 1995 - 2014. To proxy globalization we utilized KOF globalization index. The research revealed that the overall level of globalization does not lead to economic growth in the EU member states. But, the hypothesis that the impact of globalization depends on countries' development level is partially confirmed. The economic integration has no statistically significant impact on relatively less developed EU countries and has positive effect in more developed countries. Social globalization has statistically significant impact on relatively less developed EU countries and has negative effect in the group of more developed ones. It was also found that considerable political engagements have negative effect on growth.","[Butkus, Mindaugas; Maciulyte-Sniukiene, Alma; Matuzeviciute, Kristina] Siauliai Univ, Social Innovat Res Ctr, Res Inst, P Visinskio Str 25, LT-77156 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Butkus, M (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, Social Innovat Res Ctr, Res Inst, P Visinskio Str 25, LT-77156 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",mindaugo.butkaus@gmail.com; alma.m@splius.lt; matuzeviciute@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,1,1,4,18,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,240,247,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200032,0

The simulation results suggest that at the regional level the existence of an EKC relationship depends on the source of regional growth and the how this relationship is specified.","[Cui, Cathy Xin; McGregor, Peter; Swales, Kim] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Fraser Allander Inst, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Hanley, Nick] Univ St Andrews, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, Irvine Bldg, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Turner, Karen] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Int Publ Policy Inst, Ctr Energy Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Yin, Ya Ping] Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Business, Dept Econ Social Sci & Tourism, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Strathclyde; University of Glasgow; University of St Andrews; University of Strathclyde; University of Hertfordshire,"Swales, K (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Fraser Allander Inst, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",cathy.x.cui@googlemail.com; ndh3@st-andrews.ac.uk; p.mcgregor@strath.ac.uk; j.k.swales@strath.ac.uk; karen.turner@strath.ac.uk; y.p.yin@herts.ac.uk,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012","McGregor, Peter/0000-0003-1221-7963; Yin, Ya-Ping/0000-0002-1389-9065; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-066-27-0029]; Scottish government; EPSRC [EP/M00760X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M00760X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Scottish government; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The research reported in this paper was supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [reference number RES-066-27-0029] and the Scottish government's ClimateXChange project.,,43,5,5,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Forward capacity markets are established in many liberalised markets to procure capacity, with a strong interest in procuring DR and EE. With case studies of ISO New England, PJM and Great Britain, this paper examines the process and trends of procuring DR and EE in forward capacity markets, and the design for integration mechanisms. It finds that the contribution of DR and EE varies wildly across these three capacity markets, due to a set of factors regarding mechanism design, market conditions and regulatory provisions, and the offering of EE is more heavily influenced by regulatory utility EE obligation. DR and EE are complementary in targeting end-uses and customers for capacity resources, thus highlighting the value of procuring them both. System needs and resources' market potential need to be considered in defining capacity products. Over the long-term, it is important to ensure the removal of barriers for these demand-side resources and the capability of providers in addressing risks of unstable funding and forward planning.

After meeting local demand for credit, the excess capital was transferred to the international market, making it possible to obtain higher returns.

Developed economies go through a massive transformation process that fundamentally changes the possibilities of redistribution functions of national governments. The liberalization of national economies and international integration at the economic, political and legislative level is causing an increase in interconnection and interdependence. The benefits of access to the global markets are realized at the cost of reduction of national sovereignty. State as an organization providing social stability through a wide range of protectionist and redistributive mechanisms finds itself in a growing environment of corporate capital often in a subordinate position. Taxing the corporate sector by the state is inefficient and sometimes impossible. In an effort to maintain a social stability, states are competing to attract foreign investors through tax holidays and subsidies. The only benefit of such a policy is the creation of jobs for the national economy. At present, the global economy finds itself in a state of secular stagnation, where long-term government funding by government deficits is unsustainable. On the one hand, there is a group of authors who think that this is a process of extinction of sovereign states that will integrate into larger blocks. On the other hand, due to the negative effects of globalization, such as income and property polarization or growing uncertainty in the labor market, strengthening nationalist moods can be observed. Political parties claiming the strengthening of the state power are gaining popularity.","[Michal, Butek; Erika, Spuchlakova] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Michal, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",michal.butek@fpedas.uniza.sk; erika.spuchlakova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Kovalova, Erika/O-8625-2015","Kovalova, Erika/0000-0002-3635-4332",,,,,30,2,2,1,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,234,239,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200031,0

Regional Studies. Entrepreneurship policies in support of new technology-based firms fall into two main categories of intervention: hard measures (financial-type support such as loans and grants) and soft measures (counselling and business advice services). This study investigates the association between hard and soft support measures delivered to entrepreneurs, and the performance of the subsequently constituted new technology-based firms. The empirical framework analyses the outcomes of the Spinner Programme -a regional policy measure implemented in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna during 2000-06. The analysis finds that soft measures are positively related to a higher probability of exiting the market and to higher sales growth. The results also show that the magnitude of the effect of soft measures on growth is greater than the effect of hard measures.","[Ramaciotti, Laura; Rizzo, Ugo] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Ferrara, Italy; [Muscio, Alessandro] Univ Foggia, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimenti & Ambiente SAFE, Foggia, Italy",University of Ferrara; University of Foggia,"Rizzo, U (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Ferrara, Italy.",laura.ramaciotti@unife.it; alessandro.muscio@unifg.it; ugo.rizzo@unife.it,"Muscio, Alessandro/P-5463-2019","Muscio, Alessandro/0000-0001-5186-2522; Rizzo, Ugo/0000-0002-4409-9693",,,,,81,12,13,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The size of the tax burden today is a significant factor in investor decision-making about the allocation of its investments. Companies can move their tax bases to countries with a more favorable tax policy. National efforts to attract as much investment as possible to their country have ultimately led to tax competition. National governments are faced with the choice of responding to tax competition.

In contrast, the number of children in foster care has increased by 2 and a half times since 2004. In 2016 40% more children lived in all forms of formal family substitute care compared to 2009.

Due to the air gap between the magnetic coupler, the magnetic field coupling decreases and the magnetic leakage increases significantly compared to traditional transformer, and this may lead to the magnetic flux density around the coupler more than the safety limit for human. So magnetic shielding should be adding to the winding made from litz wire to enhance the magnetic field coupling effect in the working area and reduce magnetic field strength in non-working area. Magnetic shielding can be achieved by adding high-permeability material or high-conductivity material. For high-permeability material its magnetic reluctance is much lower than the surrounding air medium so most of the magnetic line goes through the high-permeability material rather than surrounding air. For high-conductivity material the eddy current in the material can produce reverse magnetic field to achieve magnetic shielding. This paper studies the effect of the two types of shielding material on coupler for wireless EV charging and designs combination shielding made from high-permeability material and high-conductivity material.

Especially in China, where the demands for transportation are tremendous and ever-increasing, it is worthy to explore the provincial variations in energy efficiency in the transport sector, in order to enhance energy efficiency and to promote energy savings in this sector. By using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) approach, this paper calculates the provincial energy efficiency as well as energy saving potential in China's provincial transport sector over 2007-2016. Results suggest that China's national average energy input efficiency in the transport industry is 0.673 during the sample period, which implied that relatively large degree of non-efficiency exists in this sector. Besides, the increase of government support (GS), the improvement of road condition (RC) and public transport (PT) are influencing factors for the improvement of China's provincial energy efficiency in the transport industry. Additionally, energy saving potential in the transport sector is also estimated in this paper. It is shown that, although energy efficiency in the eastern China is the highest (much higher than the country-wide level), the estimated absolute amount of the energy saving potential in the eastern area is significantly larger than those in the central area and western area due to the fact that the eastern area contributes to the largest share of the total energy consumption in this sector.","[Xie, Chunping] Univ Birmingham, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham Ctr Energy Storage, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Bai, Mengqi] Univ Birmingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Nucl Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Wang, Xiaolei] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; China University of Mining & Technology,"Wang, XL (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiaoleiwang@cumt.edu.cn,"Xie, Chunping/G-8571-2016; wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; wang, xiao/HGB-7081-2022","Xie, Chunping/0000-0003-2100-6631; wang, xiao/0000-0002-4088-3341",Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20180664],Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province),The paper is supported by Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (no.

We sent out mail surveys to 4733 valid addresses and received 1376 completed surveys. Biofuels knowledge was assessed with five items related to energy content, production capacity, and potential benefits and harm of biofuels, assigning + 1 or + 2 points for correct, and - 1 or - 2 points for incorrect answers depending upon respondents' certainty about the answer, and 0 point for 'I don't know' responses. We constructed a summary index by summing the points scored on the five items. The mean score for the biofuels knowledge index was 2.25 +/- 3.33 on the scale of - 10 to + 10 points. The multiple regression results showed that socio-demographic attributes are significant predictors of biofuels knowledge: men scored 1.65 points higher than women; for one level increment in education, respondents scored 0.26 points higher; and Democrats scored 1.34 points lower than others. Possible reasons for these results and their implications for policy and management to make cellulosic biofuels successful are discussed.","[Baral, Nabin] Univ Washington, Coll Environm, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Baral, N (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Coll Environm, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",nbaral@gmail.com,,,Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2011-68005-30407],Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA),"This project is supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant # 2011-68005-30407 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).

We examine the potential asymmetry-reducing role of disclosure and its impact on setting environmental taxes. From a policy perspective, our findings show that disclosure with verifiable reports, is a valuable public good, provides greater transparency in the market, and is generally efficiency enhancing. Results suggest that access to publicly disclosed information enables the fine-tuning of the tax rules towards specific environmental circumstances and improves the ability of the regulator to levy firm-specific environmental taxes. Further, while we do not attempt to analyze the exchange of information process between players, our findings show that, despite its advantages, exogenously disclosed information can be double-edged sword since it may also produce anticompetitive effects by facilitating collusive behavior. Information sharing between firms may occur and thus lead to a superior outcome in terms of industry output and emissions, which undermines environmental policy performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this regard, we theoretically analyze auction formats that are potentially suitable for renewable energy auctions. We focus on the most discussed auction formats in practice: pay-as-bid and uniform price auctions.

Investors' perceptions that renewable energy investments do not deliver attractive returns compared with conventional alternatives can impede the flow of sufficient capital to finance these requirements. This paper examines whether publicly-traded financial products offer investors competitive risk-adjusted returns, or whether renewable energy investors face a penalty for choosing sustainable assets. We use a traditional portfolio approach to test whether adding renewable energy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to a standard portfolio provides diversification benefits over a period of study of two, six, and nine years. We also examine the benefits of investing in yieldcos, which hold operational renewable energy assets. We find that the renewable energy ETFs provide only minimal diversification benefits, and that a yieldco index fund provides none. However, given the superior performance demonstrated by yieldcos based outside the US, we repeat the optimization using a constructed index featuring non-US yieldcos, and find that it improves Sharpe ratio.

For the first time, we provide an assessment on the efficacy of power generation as such an indicator, using both conceptual and empirical analyses. We show that (i) conceptually, it is somewhat misleading to use power generation as coincident indicator to infer the growth rate of GDP, due to the change of power intensity; (ii) empirically, power generation beats railway cargo and bank loan, the two other variables in the Li Keqiang index, as the best predictor in forecasting the Chinese GDP over the full sample; however, this superiority holds mainly during period of sharp change, i.e., the financial crisis period, but not when the economy is relatively stable, especially the current New Normal period. These two findings place important caveats on the common trust we have in power generation as an influential variable for measuring the Chinese economy.","[Zhang, Jin; Li, Pujiang; Zhao, Guochang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jin] Survey & Res Ctr China Household Finance, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Survey & Res Ctr China Household Finance, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",jin.zhang@swufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,21,0,0,3,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,211,216,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.030,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800021,0

Nothing spectacular occurred with final demand this was a supply-side energy crisis driven by the exit of 18% of Australia's coal-fired generation fleet and the inadequate entry of new plant. Australia's NEM encountered an uncoordinated exit-driven episode of the Resource Adequacy problem. In the USA where 18% of coal plant has also exited, Resource Adequacy and low cost energy has been maintained by the entry of an enormous fleet of wind, solar and gas-fired generators. In Australia, an equivalent response did not occur; decades of climate change policy discontinuity meant the speed of coal plant exit was unpredictable, entry of renewables delayed through stop-start policy, and gas-fired plant was subject to critical hold-up due to excess LNG plant investment. Resolution requires a united and stable climate change policy architecture that works with, not against, the NEM's world-class institutional design, and greater transparency around planned plant exit.","[Simshauser, Paul] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Griffith University,"Simshauser, P (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",p.simshauser@griffith.edu.au,"Simshauser, Paul/H-1244-2015","Simshauser, Paul/0000-0003-1857-550X",,,,,66,15,19,1,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,697,713,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.068,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300065,0

This study explores the potential role of an LCFS in achieving deep, long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets in a region's transportation sector, when implemented with other climate policies such as fuel economy regulations, a zero emission vehicle mandate, and carbon pricing. We develop a dynamic vehicle adoption model coupled with a fuel supply optimization model, applied to the personal and freight vehicle sectors in British Columbia, Canada. Results demonstrate that a combination of the most stringent policies is required to achieve 2050 GHG targets, including an LCFS. Further, the LCFS appears to be complementary to the other modeled policies, resulting in incremental GHG reductions in all modeled policy scenarios. The LCFS has an additive but lower impact in the personal vehicle sector, where a zero emission vehicle mandate induces a substantial transition to low carbon fuels without the LCFS. LCFS impacts are larger in the freight sector, where a switch to zero emission vehicles does not necessarily cut GHGs. Overall, with careful policy design, the LCFS could play an important role in decarbonizing the transportation sector.","[Lepitzki, Justin; Axsen, Jonn] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Lepitzki, J (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",justin.lepitzki@gmail.com; jaxsen@sfu.ca,,,Government of British Columbia's Ministry of Environment [TP13CAS-016],Government of British Columbia's Ministry of Environment,"This research was funded by the Government of British Columbia's Ministry of Environment, Contract # TP13CAS-016.

The Italian system operator should pay compensation for both aspects, but recognizes only the former. Therefore, landowners often appeal to the law courts and claim compensation for the depreciation of the entire non-occupied area, often obliging the system operator to pay substantial amounts. This delays the provision of new power lines and increases their respective costs. In order to verify the correctness of the modus operandi by the system operator and landowners, a study was carried out into the impact of several characteristics of power lines on farmland value in northern Apulia, south Italy. The results highlighted that the area occupied by plinths and cabins, the height of towers and the type of intersection were the main sources of depreciation, which varies depending on the crop. Moreover, depreciation on the residual area exists, but only involves two narrow strips of land on either side of infrastructure. Finally, it is not constant, but tends to decrease rapidly as the distance from the infrastructure increases, and zeroes at 30-70 m from the power line.","[Sardaro, Ruggiero; Bozzo, Francesco; Fucilli, Vincenzo] Univ Bari, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Via Amendola 165-A, I-70126 Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Sardaro, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bari, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Via Amendola 165-A, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",ruggiero.sardaro1@uniba.it,"Sardaro, Ruggiero/K-5893-2017; Fucilli, Vincenzo/K-7726-2017; bozzo, francesco/AAE-5673-2022","Sardaro, Ruggiero/0000-0001-8250-1914; BOZZO, Francesco/0000-0001-5153-6882",,,,,64,13,13,1,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,449,457,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.005,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200041,0

This study proposes an environmental impact minimization model, which considers the FEW nexus under four climate change scenarios, to optimize the spatial distribution of three energy crops (rice, corn, and sugarcane). Life cycle assessment (LCA), linear programming, and a climate change simulation model are integrated to analyze appropriate bioenergy production rates while comparing the benefits of bioenergy with the current renewable energy policy in Taiwan. The major findings of LCA in this study indicate that electricity generation using bio-coal produced from rice straw is very beneficial to the environment. Considering the spatial characteristics of Taiwan, simulations from the spatial optimization model suggested that (a) the rice and corn cultivation areas should be increased in southern Taiwan for bio-coal and bioethanol production, in accordance with the food and feed priority policy; and (b) the rice cultivation area should be decreased across Taiwan, based on the water conservation policy. In addition, compared to solar power, the development of bioenergy can simultaneously enhance food and energy self-sufficiency.","[Yuan, Kuang-Yu; Lin, Ying-Chen; Chiueh, Pei-Te; Lo, Shang-Lien] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Environm Engn, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Lin, Ying-Chen] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Spatial Informat, 100 Wenhwa Rd, Taichung 40724, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; Feng Chia University,"Chiueh, PT (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Environm Engn, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",ptchueh@ntu.edu.tw,,"Yuan, Guang-Yu/0000-0002-0266-6071; Lin, Ying-Chen/0000-0002-0691-8520","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC [MOST-105-2627-M-002-038, MOST-106-2627-M-002-028]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC (MOST-105-2627-M-002-038 and MOST-106-2627-M-002-028).",,84,50,51,8,120,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,502,514,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.009,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200046,0

This article aims to evaluate South Korean peoples willingness to pay (WTP) for carrying out the ODA plan. To this end, a survey of 1000 households was conducted using the contingent valuation (CV) technique. The mean yearly WTP for the ODA plan implementation is calculated to be KRW 3551 (USD 3.03) per household. When the sample value is expanded to the whole country, it amounted to KRW 68.5 billion (USD 58.5 million) per annum, for the next ten years. The South Korean people's total WTP is more than the cost required, given that the yearly cost is estimated to be about USD 35.0 million.

This paper explores local public preferences for different forms of financial and procedural participation by means of choice experiments and focus groups. The results show that wind power projects are generally accepted by the local public if certain condition, i.e. shareholding and high levels of participation in the decision-making process are offered.

Pollination is necessary for the health of ecological and agricultural systems, since they guarantee the fecundation of 80% of flower-flora species. This service is valuated among 235 and 577 billion dollars each year. Land use change is among the potential cause of pollinator's reduction. In most southern Italian regions, as Apulia, there was a land use competition between agriculture and renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaic (PV) system, due to the European policy aiming to decarbonize the energy production. Lot of agriculture companies moved toward the PV development to retrieve certain revenue, thanks to legislative and fiscal policies encouraging PV development. Here we propose a methodology to harmonize energy production, agriculture and the enhancement of ecosystem services, looking for a synergy between different economic activities and stakeholders. Areas occupied by PV system can be used for other purposes, as grazing or cultivation or educational activities. Naturalization activities can give back these spaces to pollinator populations notwithstanding the presence of PV panels, enhancing the pollination ecosystem service without affecting other agricultural areas.","[Semeraro, Teodoro] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Ecotekne, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Pomes, Alessandro] Technital SpA, Via Carlo Cattaneo 20, I-37121 Verona, Italy; [Del Giudice, Cecilia; Negro, Danilo] Global Solar Fund Engn Italy Srl, Viale Regina Margherita 13, I-72100 Brindisi, Italy; [Aretano, Roberta] Apulian Reg Agcy Environm Prevent & Protect, Dept Foggia, Via G Rosati 139, I-71121 Foggia, Italy",University of Salento,"Aretano, R (通讯作者)，Apulian Reg Agcy Environm Prevent & Protect, Dept Foggia, Via G Rosati 139, I-71121 Foggia, Italy.",teodoro.semeraro@unisalento.it; ale.pomes@gmail.com; cecilia.delgiudice@globalsolarfund.com; danilo.negro@globalsolarfund.com; r.aretano@arpa.puglia.it,,"SEMERARO, Teodoro/0000-0001-9239-9060",,,,,71,56,59,14,96,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,218,227,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.050,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600022,0

This article examines the setting of electricity prices from a political economy perspective. Citizens differ in their willingness to pay for electricity, and the consumer surplus and electoral uncertainty seem to influence their choices while exercising their franchise. To win, political parties must receive a majority of votes, and a party in power may try to achieve this by choosing to ignore a consumer group, either by charging a price higher than their willingness to pay or by choosing to satisfy them by charging a lower price. Two theoretical models are proposed: the first model computes the possible prices when common (perfectly correlated) electoral shocks are anticipated, while the second model computes the possible prices for independent and identically distributed electoral shocks. We test these models with available data on willingness to pay and electricity price for Agricultural, Domestic, and Industrial consumers in an Indian State by generating prices that would be charged to each of these types of consumers to maximize the chances of re-election. Actual prices seem to confirm the second model more than the first.","[Krishnan, Muralee C.; Gupta, Santanu] XLRI Xavier Sch Management, Jamshedpur 831001, Jharkhand, India",XLRI -Xavier School of Management,"Krishnan, CM (通讯作者)，XLRI Xavier Sch Management, Jamshedpur 831001, Jharkhand, India.",muralee1@rediffmail.com; santanu@xlri.ac.in,,"Krishnan C, Muralee/0000-0002-3905-7923; GUPTA, SANTANU/0000-0001-9097-1457",,,,,33,0,1,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,373,381,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.009,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200039,0

To address this challenge, an analytical framework is proposed that incorporates technological learning curves in a technology optimization model. The framework is employed to evaluate the technology trajectories, resource utilization and economic impacts in the power sector of Tianjin in 2005-2050. Using multi-scenario analysis, this study reveals that CO2 emissions could be significantly reduced if relevant mitigation policies are introduced. The main technologies adopted are ultra-super-critical combustion, integrated gasification combined cycle, wind power, hydropower, biomass power, solar photovoltaic power and solar thermal power. Despite uncertainties, nuclear power and CO2 capture and storage technology could be cost competitive in the future. The CO2 emissions cap policy has the advantage of realizing an explicit goal in the target year, while the renewable energy policy contributes to more cumulative CO2 emissions reduction and coal savings. A carbon tax of 320 CNY/ton CO2 would contribute to early renewable energy development and more CO2 reduction in the short run. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the impacts on the power system of learning rates, technology cost reductions and energy fuel price trajectories.","[Liu, Xi; Du, Huibin; Rong, Qian] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Du, Huibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Inst Policy & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Brown, Marilyn A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Zuo, Jian] Univ Adelaide, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, ECIC, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Zhang, Ning] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510634, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mao, Guozhu] Tianjin Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Adelaide; Jinan University; Tianjin University,"Du, HB (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",duhuibin@tju.edu.cn,"Zuo, Jian/HPD-5969-2023","Zhang, Ning/0000-0002-5634-4203; Zuo, Jian/0000-0002-8279-9666","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673198, 71273185, 71431005, 41571522, 71561137003]; Clean Energy Systems training programme - China Scholarship Council (CSC) [5047]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17BGL072]; Tianjin 131 Innovative Talent Cultivation Program",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Clean Energy Systems training programme - China Scholarship Council (CSC); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Tianjin 131 Innovative Talent Cultivation Program,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number 71673198; 71273185; 71431005; 41571522; 71561137003), the Clean Energy Systems training programme supported by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) under Grant [2017, 5047] the National Social Science Foundation of China under Grant 17BGL072 and Tianjin 131 Innovative Talent Cultivation Program.",,74,20,20,7,102,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,344,356,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.001,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200037,0

We suggest that efforts to develop more holistic energy pathways, going beyond post hoc analysis of environmental and social implications, can usefully draw on environmental scenarios. A detailed content analysis of UK energy and environmental scenarios was therefore undertaken, with energy scenarios selected on the basis that they were recent, had a direct link to energy policy, and covered a range of scenario types. The energy scenarios rarely considered societal drivers beyond decarbonisation and focused on quantifiable parameters such as GDP, while the environmental scenarios provided a richer narrative on human behaviour and social change. As socio-economic issues remain fundamental to the success of energy policies, this is a key area which should be better addressed within energy scenarios. The environmental impacts of energy scenarios were rarely considered, but could have a significant bearing on the likelihood of pathway outcomes being realised. Fuller evaluation of the environmental interactions of energy systems is therefore required. Although the analysis focuses on the UK, some international scenarios show similar limitations, suggesting that the conclusions are more widely applicable.","[Hooper, Tara; Austen, Melanie C.; Beaumont, Nicola] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; [Hooper, Tara; Austen, Melanie C.; Beaumont, Nicola; Heptonstall, Philip; Holland, Robert A.; Ketsopoulou, Ioanna; Taylor, Gail; Watson, Jim; Winskel, Mark] UK Energy Res Ctr, 58 Princes Gate, London SW7 2PG, England; [Heptonstall, Philip] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Holland, Robert A.; Taylor, Gail] Univ Southampton, Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg B85,Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Winskel, Mark] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh EH1 1LZ, Midlothian, Scotland",Plymouth Marine Laboratory; Imperial College London; University of Southampton; University of Edinburgh,"Hooper, T (通讯作者)，Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.;Hooper, T (通讯作者)，UK Energy Res Ctr, 58 Princes Gate, London SW7 2PG, England.",tarh@pml.ac.uk,"Austen, Melanie C/GLU-1418-2022; Beaumont, Nicola/AAS-2780-2020; Holland, Robert/C-1928-2012; Taylor, Gail/C-6030-2013","Austen, Melanie C/0000-0001-8133-0498; Holland, Robert/0000-0002-3038-9227; Beaumont, Nicola/0000-0002-5976-9661; Watson, Jim/0000-0001-8464-1718; TAYLOR, GAIL/0000-0001-8470-6390; Heptonstall, Philip/0000-0001-8411-6673","Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1]; NERC [NE/M019640/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M013200/1, EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/M019640/1, NE/M019764/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1, EP/M013200/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/M019764/1, NE/M019640/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research formed part of the programme of the UK Energy Research Centre and was supported by the Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council award EP/L024756/1, with additional support from the NERC-funded ADdressing Valuation of Energy and Nature Together (ADVENT, NE/M019640/1).",,73,16,17,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,397,408,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.028,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800039,0

Where they face social challenges or uncertainties, firms may even voluntarily select deliberative processes in site planning thereby increasing stakeholder involvement. This article tests the potential for adoption of voluntary engagement practices to reduce the likelihood of citizen complaints. Using a dataset of complaints and practices from the state of Colorado, this article finds that adoption of engagement practices and further deliberation about sites is not associated with altered odds of observing a complaint at a wellsite once other variables are controlled. Where more voluntary management practices of any type are adopted, the odds of observing a complaint are higher. Inclusion of engagement and deliberation weaken this association. Finally, large companies, as defined by well counts, are more likely to adopt engagement and deliberation practices that can form the basis of collaboration than are small companies. This indicates that use of voluntary management practices is dependent on the resources available to individual firms, and thus, the environmental and social benefits of such policies are likely to accrue unevenly.","[Scott, Ryan P.] Colorado State Univ, Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Scott, Ryan P.] 1782 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Scott, RP (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Scott, RP (通讯作者)，1782 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",rpscott@colostate.edu,,"Scott, Ryan/0000-0001-7100-2968",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R24 HD042828],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"Partial support for this research came from a Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development research infrastructure Grant, R24 HD042828, to the Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology at the University of Washington.",,77,5,6,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,258,272,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.017,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800027,0

VLS-PV deployment is expected to pave the way to achieve these targets and assist the development of the local solar PV industry, which is associated with job creation potential and can bring considerable socio-economic benefits in the desert. This paper presents the opportunities and challenges of VLS-PV application in Saudi Arabia. SWOT analysis technique has been performed where the internal and the external factors associated with solar PV development are identified. Based on the analysis of the current situation and the expected socio-economic and environmental benefits that can be gained, a deployment scenario is developed to achieve 9 GW capacity of VLS-PV power plants in six different sites within fifteen years. In addition, more than 18,000 jobs will be created. VLS-PV deployment will strengthen the collaboration with the international companies and assists in transferring the know-how to the local companies and developers in the field of solar PV.","[Almarshoud, A.

One effective measure to boost its development is to increase the awareness of residents about sustainable development and to increase their willingness to pay (WTP). This study applies a contingent valuation method to investigate the WTP of residents in Tianjin, China for green electricity. It uses a logit model to test whether the respondents have WTP. In addition to the factors affecting the respondents' viewpoints frequently discussed in previous studies, this paper has also considered the influence of high prevalence of respiratory disease. Furthermore, it employs a multiple regression model to identify the factors that significantly affected the WTP. According to a sample of 468 respondents, most residents have positive WTP with an average value of CNY 32.63 per month. The main driving factors for a positive WTP are knowledge of renewable energy, belief towards the government, behavior, education, history of respiratory disease and others. The factors affecting the value of WTP include income, belief, disease, gender and age, and the first three factors often have positive influences while the last one has negative impact. Furthermore, males tend to have a higher WTP than females.","[Xie, Bai-Chen; Zhao, Wei] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Xie, Bai-Chen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Xie, Bai-Chen; Zhao, Wei] Tianjin Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Efficient Utilizat Low & Medium Grade Ene, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Tianjin University,"Xie, BC (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.;Xie, BC (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Xie, BC (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Efficient Utilizat Low & Medium Grade Ene, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",xiebaichen@tju.edu.cn,,"Xie, Bai-Chen/0000-0002-9588-830X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373172, 71431005]; Major Projects of the National Social Science Fund [17ZDA065]; Humanities and Social Science Planning Fund Project of Ministry of Education [15YJA790091]; Philosophy and Social Sciences Program of Tianjin [TJGL16-015]; Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China [11-R1-338]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Projects of the National Social Science Fund; Humanities and Social Science Planning Fund Project of Ministry of Education; Philosophy and Social Sciences Program of Tianjin; Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China,"This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 71373172, and 71431005; the support from Major Projects of the National Social Science Fund under Grant No. 17ZDA065, the Humanities and Social Science Planning Fund Project of Ministry of Education under grant No. 15YJA790091; the support from Philosophy and Social Sciences Program of Tianjin under Grant No. TJGL16-015, and the support from Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China under grant No.11-R1-338.

The asymptotic properties of the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Hannan-Quinn information criterion (HQC) are established, and consistency of BIC and HQC is proved. Notably, the consistency of BIC and HQC is robust to violations of weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables with respect to the co-integration parameters. More precisely, BIC and HQC recover the true co-integration rank from the partial system analysis also when the conditional model does not convey all information about the co-integration parameters. This result opens up interesting possibilities for practitioners who can now determine the co-integration rank in partial systems without being concerned about the weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables. A Monte Carlo experiment based on a large dimensional data generating process shows that BIC and HQC applied in partial systems performreasonably well in small samples and comparatively better than ` traditional'methods for co-integration rank determination. We further show the usefulness of our approach and the benefits of the conditional system analysis in two empirical illustrations, both based on the estimation of VAR systems on US quarterly data. Overall, our analysis shows the gains of combining information criteria with partial system analysis.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe; De Angelis, Luca; Fanelli, Luca] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40124 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Cavaliere, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40124 Bologna, Italy.",giuseppe.cavaliere@unibo.it; l.deangelis@unibo.it; luca.fanelli@unibo.it,"; CAVALIERE, GIUSEPPE/O-7592-2015","Fanelli, Luca/0000-0001-5351-2876; CAVALIERE, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-2856-0005","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR); RFO grants from the University of Bologna","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); RFO grants from the University of Bologna","We are grateful to the Editor, Anindya Banerjee, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments on the earlier version of this paper.

This paper aims to investigate the potential factors that influence the choices of rural residents regarding water heaters with a focus on the low-carbon transition to solar water heating systems. To this end, a face-to-face questionnaire survey is undertaken with 3404 rural households randomly selected among 12 representative provinces. A comprehensive set of discrete choice modelling approaches were used. The empirical results show that (1) sociodemographic variables have significant effects on residents' first-stage choice of a water heater (to buy or not to buy) but few effects on the second-stage decision to choose electric, LPG, or solar water heaters (which type to buy); (2) information spillover is important to facilitate the usage of water heaters, particularly of solar products; (3) the electricity price, which is regulated at a very low rate, has no apparent effect on the choice of solar water heaters; (4) government subsidy has a significant effect in the first stage but no differentiated effect on the decision choice in the second stage. Policy and managerial implications are presented to speed up the ongoing low-carbon transition of energy systems in China.","[Ma, Ben] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yihua] Renmin Univ China, Dept Energy Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Urban, Frauke] Univ London, SOAS, Ctr Dev Environm & Policy CeDEP, London WC1H 0XG, England",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Yu, YH (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Dept Energy Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",mbruc@163.com; yihua.yu@ruc.edu.cn; f.urban@soas.ac.uk,,,Social Science Fund of Beijing [17YJC032]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [13XNJ017]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006002/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006002/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Social Science Fund of Beijing; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Marcello Graziano (Central Michigan University), Xiaoyi Mu (University of Dundee) and anonymous reviewers for their very helpful and constructive comments.

The development of decentralized energy systems goes hand in hand with a trend towards community energy. Many of these communities claim energy autonomy as their main motivation for investing in local renewable energies. They define energy autonomy as generation exceeding demand on an annual basis and are therefore less autonomous than without these technologies. Communities that strive for this ideal utilize the electricity network infrastructure more than traditional end of the pipe consumers. At the same time, they make a much lower contribution to the costs of this infrastructure, currently charged per unit of energy used, and often benefit from subsidized renewable energy technologies. Hence this motivation is at best questionable and at worst misplaced. A continuation of the recent rapid reductions in battery prices expected by many experts, however, could make the economic case for truly energy-autonomous municipalities. This clearly raises important questions for researchers and policymakers alike. For example, in which sorts of municipalities could such solutions make sense and what are the consequences for the overarching, mainly centralized energy system?","[McKenna, Russell] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Chair Energy Econ, Bldg 06-33,Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"McKenna, R (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Chair Energy Econ, Bldg 06-33,Hertzstr 16, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany.",mckenna@kit.edu,,"McKenna, Russell/0000-0001-6758-482X",,,,,52,68,71,1,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,747,750,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.033,0.0,,,4,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500069,0

If residential PV self-consumption systems become economically competitive in the near future, end-users will be willing to switch to PV self-consumption instead of using power from the network. However, if this transition were to occur massively or suddenly, the national energy system would be faced with a radical change. Our study has shown that French residential PV systems combined with Li-ion batteries could become profitable for individual investors before 2030. The demand in the residential sector would thus be natural in the near future in France. However, massive PV integration raises new issues for electricity system stakeholders (e.g. profit losses for traditional power generators, grid management, and sub-optimisation of the power system). This study has shown that PV self-consumption with batteries has a smaller impact on the power system than full grid injection. It is also shown that rapid integration is more costly than the progressive option with regard to PV system integration. We thus recommend a regular and progressive policy when transitioning to PV self-consumption to allow enough time for stakeholders to adapt to the new market situation.","[Yu, Hyun Jin Julie] Paris Saclay Univ, Inst Technoecon Energy Syst I Tese, Strateg Analyses Dept DAS, French Alternat Energies & Atom Energy Commiss CE, Paris, France; [Yu, Hyun Jin Julie] Paris Dauphine Univ Paris, Lab Econ LEDa, Ctr Geopolit Energy & Raw Mat CGEMP, CEEM, Paris, France",CEA; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Yu, HJJ (通讯作者)，Paris Saclay Univ, Inst Technoecon Energy Syst I Tese, Strateg Analyses Dept DAS, French Alternat Energies & Atom Energy Commiss CE, Paris, France.",julie.yu@cea.fr,,,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Universite Paris-Dauphine under the aegis of the Foundation Paris-Dauphine; RTE; EDF; EPEX Spot; CELEST,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Universite Paris-Dauphine under the aegis of the Foundation Paris-Dauphine; RTE; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); EPEX Spot; CELEST(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"The author is grateful to Dr. Nathalie Popiolek (Senior Expert) at the CEA and Prof. Dr. Patrice Geoffron and Prof. Dr. Jan Horst Keppler at the Paris-Dauphine University for their valued discussions and support.

A circular economy offers certain practical solutions, which are focused on using natural resources, which are limited, streamlining production and decreasing the amount of the waste and its recycling. These attributes are becoming essential parts of the global market, while there is a change of orientation from the traditional perception of economy, connected with a one way linear process, to a circular economy. The goal of a circular economy is to make a stable economic growth of a country and a healthy environment. To reach trust in this system, the society and the individual need enough information about it and a change of their mind-set. Based on some practical examples, we can say that a circular economy has a huge ecological and economical potential for Europe, which will appear in sustainable profit, creating new job opportunities and of course a much higher quality of the environment.

Within a short time, the imported goods, virtually unseen before, including the production of the well-known global manufacturers, appeared on the Russian market.

The analysis is based on the globalization index, which combines in one number: actual economic flows, economic restrictions, data on information flows, data on personal contact and data on cultural proximity. Trend analysis and long and short period dependencies in globalization are based on the DTW algorithm and wavelet analysis. A discrete wavelet was used for wavelet analysis of the time series studied. In the process of discrete wavelet transformation, the received signal is divided into so-called approximation and detail. Approximation is then subjected to a subsequent division into further approximation and detail, while details are not subject to further divisions. In this way, the signal is presented as the sum of the approximation of the last level and the details from all levels. The study was conducted on a group of 146 countries. In the article, globalization is understood as: a process of interaction and integration among the people, companies, and governments of different nations, a process driven by international trade and investment and aided by information technology. This process has effects on the environment, on culture, on political systems, on economic development and prosperity, and on human physical well-being in societies around the world.","[Hadas-Dyduch, Monika] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat & Math Method Econ, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Hadas-Dyduch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat & Math Method Econ, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",monika.dyduch@ue.katowice.pl,"Hadas-Dyduch, Monika/G-7959-2015","Hadas-Dyduch, Monika/0000-0001-9281-7488",,,,,23,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,111,118,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300015,0

Unemployment causes the human capital and the human potential of the country citizens to be insufficiently used. Enterprises and the government can invest in human capital in addition to traditional forms of investment (such as education, job quality and workplace ergonomics, work safety and protection, health fitness) in a way that they are financing various active labour market policy programmes. Active labour market policy is focused on financing and implementing the instruments for preserving a job position or creating a new one. These programmes are more heavily funded by the government and then here is a justified question of the effectiveness of using these public funds. So far, there have not been any accepted, unified rules or methodology in Slovakia or abroad for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the active labour market policy instruments.

Over the last decade, we have seen a rapid increase in the usage of facility management on the American and European continents. Currently, many private, public, and nonprofit organizations use facility management to reduce operating costs and increase the efficiency of primary activities in organization. European Committee for Standardization (ECS) has developed specific standards for facility management because the European Union (EU) demonstrates facility management as an appropriate tool to reduce energy intensity to support competitiveness for many European organizations in global environment. The primary precondition for applying the facility management is to quantify and evaluate the organization performance to identify the strengths and weaknesses. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current theoretical and empirical knowledge of facility management in international context.

This paper focuses on the M&A analysis in the Czech Republic in relation to the development on the global scale, emphasising the M&A effectiveness. As for the economic theory, the M&A should provide the owners with an increase in the value of a new company. Previous research used calculations based on the net present value or various cost-effectiveness calculations to determine the merged company value. Our research is based on a sample of 50 transactions occurring from 2004 to 2011. Their effectiveness was judged by whether the merger resulted in an increase in the value of the newly established company compared to the sum of two separate companies. This required determining the value before and after the merger.

Second, it searches for these signifiers in the current key foreign-policy documents of the Czech Republic, for example in the policy statement of the Czech government, the concept of the Czech foreign policy, the Czech security strategy, etc. The method used in the paper is qualitative content and discourse analysis of the selected texts/documents.

The procedure and methods enable to answer for example the following questions: Is globalization reflected in the key foreign-policy documents of the Czech Republic? What are the main themes, which are reflected? Which dimensions of globalization (economic, security, cultural, institutional, etc.) are reflected most? Is globalization reflected as an opportunity or a threat?","[Rolenc, Jan Martin] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Rolenc, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",rolencj@vse.cz,"Rolenc, Jan M/M-5343-2018",,project IG VSE [F2/57/2018],project IG VSE,This paper is an output of the science project IG VSE F2/57/2018 Kriticka analyza soucasneho bezpecnostniho diskursu a praxe v Ceske republice.,,25,0,0,1,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,326,333,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300044,0

The present study attempts to respond to a growing need to understand, conceptualize and rationally justify a reality that cannot be overlooked statistically - the underground economy as an inevitable element of a state economy. The magnitude of the phenomenon brings to the present the need to know correctly the activities that make up the underground economy and the negative consequences that accompany them. Deciphering the nature of the underground economy and the underlying causes that it generates and develops can provide pertinent responses to methods to counteract its negative consequences.

They affect negatively the economic and social sphere because of poor regulations regarding financial markets and established in 1970s. Nowadays we can observe that incompatibility of the above-mentioned regulations within the EU may be one of the reasons for economic migration that aims at equalization of living standards inside, as well as outside the EU. The authors also indicate the complexity of globalization processes from historical point of view in the sense of integration and liberalization observed on particular markets, i.e. capital markets, labour markets and commodity markets. This complexity is especially apparent while observing global transformations. Thus, the paper is focused on critical analysis of the above-mentioned globalization features. The authors state that the domination of international corporations as well as too extensive institutionalization of many spheres, including economy, may cause numerous social problems that may be difficult to solve in a short or long term. This may cause intensification of development of many activities in EU, but also have a multiplied effect in the areas surrounding Europe, mainly in Africa. Indicating the reason for disappearance of the convergence phenomenon, especially convergence of prices of commodities and services, has a catastrophic character at this point. Therefore, the analysis showing the reasons of economic and social degradation in the specific aspect - the aspect of moral hazard in financial structures - is an additional subject of the paper consideration.","[Szkutnik, Wlodzimierz] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Labour Market Res & Forecasting, 1 Maj 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland; [Szkutnik, Weronika] UBS AG, Corp Ctr, Grp Ops, AMO Trade Proc CH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Szkutnik, W (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Labour Market Res & Forecasting, 1 Maj 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",szkutnik@ue.katowice.pl; weronika.szkutnik@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1871,1878,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300239,0

Regression analysis of principal component scores is applied to identify geographic and administrative status patterns in the sources of the growth. The analysis suggests that shifts in labor supply largely were responsible for the regional growth differences over the period, though shifts in labor demand were nearly equally as important.

Economic sanctions and instruments of sustainable development, direct the modern international institutional mechanism to ensure the stability of economic development and sustainable economic growth. In this regard, the application of both sanctions and mechanisms for sustainable development is getting more and more justified.

Financial analysis is combined with interviews to explore whether and how the cost of electricity affects competitiveness in one of North America's most important sectors: automobile manufacturing. The cost of electricity in top automobile manufacturing jurisdictions in Canada and the US is captured over a six year period starting in 2010. At between approximately US (sic)2.00 and (sic)11.00 per vehicle, the paper fmds that the per vehicle gap between electricity costs in the most expensive automobile making jurisdiction in North America (Ontario) and all others is quite small. How, then, to explain the preoccupation of industry actors with electricity costs in Ontario? Several reasons are suggested including media coverage, the relatively narrow inventory of issues under local management control and mechanics of the pricing system itself. The paper explains how the pricing system causes manufacturers to make decisions that depart from core mandates (making things) and generates the unintended effect of heightened scrutiny, a combination of factors that has the effect of aggravating tension around electricity pricing and damaging perceived competitiveness.","[Mordue, Greig] McMaster Univ, W Booth Sch Engn Practice & Technol, Fac Engn, Fac Social Sci,Dept Econ, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada",McMaster University,"Mordue, G (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, W Booth Sch Engn Practice & Technol, Fac Engn, Fac Social Sci,Dept Econ, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",mordueg@mcmaster.ca,,,Automotive Policy Research Centre under the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [886-2012-001],Automotive Policy Research Centre under the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was funded by the Automotive Policy Research Centre under a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (886-2012-001).,,68,4,4,0,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,32,40,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.008,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700005,0

One important aspect is to quantitatively evaluate the potential impact of wind power development on local economies.

We find that installed wind power capacity has a small and statistically significant positive effect on GDP but negatively affect local fiscal income. Based on our results, an additional 1 MW wind power installation (per capita) would bring 2246 RMB increase in GDP per capita over the year 2005 and 2011. The annual benefits is about 321 RMB ($45)increase in GDP per person, which is much lower than the estimates for U.S. case.

The case of Seine-et-Marne (France)",ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Wind power; Opposition; Landscape; Commons; Resources; France,PLANNING PROBLEM,"Our contribution aims at adding to the understanding of opposition to wind power. We follow the progressive emergence and structuring of a so-called opponent network to a highly conflictual wind power project (Seine et-Marne, Parisian basin, France), paying particular attention to the shared landscape resources engaged in the development of this project. The paper draws on various strands of literature interested in landscape as a socio-material assemblage, a commons as a collective management of shared resources, and issues such as a political articulation of matters of public concern. Our case study suggests that local opposition to wind power is symptomatic of the shortcomings of French institutions' treatment of the shared resources engaged in the development of wind power projects. So-called opponents to wind power are not opponents per se. Rather, opposition arises from the tension exerted by (French, privately developed) wind power with respect to shared (relational, landscape) resources. Thus opposition and landscape issues in relation to wind power can just as well be regarded as demands to recognize the necessary collective underpinnings of wind power projects.","[Nadai, Alain] CIRED CNRS Jardin Trop, 45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Labussiere, Olivier] Inst Geog Alpine, PACTE CNRS, 14bis,Ave Marie Reynoard, F-38100 Grenoble, France",Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Nadaï, A (通讯作者)，CIRED CNRS Jardin Trop, 45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",nadai@centre-cired.fr; olivier.labussiere@umrpacte.fr,,"alain, nadai/0000-0003-0383-2729","French National Research Agency (ANR, programme societes innovantes) [2011-SOIN-003-01]; French Ministry for the Environment (MEDDAD - Program PDD Paysage et Developpement Durable); Conseil Francais de l'Energie; French Agency for the Environment and the Energy (ADEME) [07 10C 0019]; Region Ile-de-France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS - Programme Interdisciplinaire pour l'Energie)","French National Research Agency (ANR, programme societes innovantes)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); French Ministry for the Environment (MEDDAD - Program PDD Paysage et Developpement Durable); Conseil Francais de l'Energie; French Agency for the Environment and the Energy (ADEME); Region Ile-de-France(Region Ile-de-France); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS - Programme Interdisciplinaire pour l'Energie)","This work was carried out with the financial support of the French National Research Agency (ANR, programme societes innovantes, convention 2011-SOIN-003-01, projet COLLENER), the French Ministry for the Environment (MEDDAD - Program PDD Paysage et Developpement Durable), the Conseil Francais de l'Energie, the French Agency for the Environment and the Energy (ADEME) (Convention 07 10C 0019), the Region Ile-de-France and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS - Programme Interdisciplinaire pour l'Energie).",,41,10,10,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,807,816,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.049,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400077,0

Our approach builds on the work of Perron and Yabu () and is based on a Feasible Generalized Least Squares procedure that uses a super-efficient estimator of the sum of the autoregressive coefficients when =1. The resulting Wald test statistic asymptotically follows a chi-square distribution in both the I(0) and I(1) cases. To improve the finite sample properties of the test, we use a bias-corrected version of the OLS estimator of proposed by Roy and Fuller ().

This study benchmarks the economic return of deepwater hydrocarbon field development projects located in the Perdido foldbelt at either Side of the maritime border between the United States and Mexico to assess the competitiveness of the respective fiscal frameworks. We use a nodal analysis production model to first history match real field performance in the US Perdido project and then forecast production of an analogous, undeveloped field in the Mexican extension of the Perdido foldbelt, Gulf of Mexico. The new Mexican profit sharing contract imposes basic royalties that appear equitable for both the contractor and the government, albeit slightly less attractive than the to the U.S. federal lease terms. The contracts for deepwater assets in Mexico open up commercially viable options, provided the oil price will recover to render such oil projects profitable. Our sensitivity analysis shows that profitable development of 300 MMbbls oil in place becomes possible when oil prices rise above $75/bbl. For larger reservoirs (similar to 900 MMbbls) the profit hurdle rate of 15% is already met for $60/bbl.

To explore the historic evolution of and the future trends in coal utilization, an optimized data analysis system (ODAS) based on research and environmental policies is proposed in this paper. Paradigm theory is adopted to explain the technological changes and the vital ecological coal utilization phases, and an imaginary no-coal-on-the ground integrated energy system is introduced as a future coal utilization development. The advantages of ecological coal utilization are examined to develop possible policies and directions to assist the coal industry move towards green, clean production. Examining coal utilization using the ecological paradigm allows for an accurate view of coal future, with integrated energy systems expected to be a significant new trend.","[Xu, Jiuping; Xie, Heping] Sichuan Univ, Inst New Energy & Low Carbon Technol, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jiuping; Dai, Jingqi; Lv, Chengwei] Sichuan Univ, Uncertainty Decis Making Lab, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China",Sichuan University; Sichuan University,"Xu, JP; Xie, HP (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Inst New Energy & Low Carbon Technol, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.",xujiuping@scu.edu.cn; xiehp@scu.edu.cn,,"Xie, Heping/0000-0002-1686-7827",State Key Development Program of (for) Basic Research of China (973 Program) [2011CB201200]; Funds for Creative Research Groups of China [50221402]; Youth Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501137],State Key Development Program of (for) Basic Research of China (973 Program); Funds for Creative Research Groups of China(Science Fund for Creative Research Groups); Youth Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China,"This work is supported by State Key Development Program of (for) Basic Research of China (973 Program, Grant No. 2011CB201200), the Funds for Creative Research Groups of China (Grant No. 50221402), the Youth Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71501137).",,68,17,18,3,57,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,370,381,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.029,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400034,0

Social acceptance is thereby studied from very different backgrounds and based on distinct conceptualizations. We argue that the reason for the great variety in the use of 'acceptance' is not mainly its interdisciplinary and multidimensionality, but a missing policy making perspective and its insights and knowledge about processes, actors and (in)formal decision-making. This contribution proposes a framework to refine the concept of social acceptance. Taking into account that the stage and specificity of the policy making process heavily influence the response towards RET and the process triggered, we identify three steps that need to be addressed when defining a research design that includes social acceptance: the object and context under scrutiny, the relevant actors, and the roles they play. Our proposed framework thereby adopts a political science point of view and the main research interest deals with political actors deciding upon and implementing future policies.","[Dermont, Clau; Ingold, Karin; Kammermann, Lorenz; Stadelmann-Steffen, Isabelle] Univ Bern, Inst Polit Sci, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Ingold, Karin; Kammermann, Lorenz] ETH Domain, Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Ingold, Karin] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Falkenpl 16, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); University of Bern,"Dermont, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Polit Sci, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",clau.dermont@ipw.unibe.ch; karin.ingold@eawag.ch; lorenz.kammermann@eawag.ch; isabelle.stadelmann@ipw.unibe.ch,"Kammermann, Lorenz/I-2969-2019; Stadelmann-Steffen, Isabelle/AAD-2429-2022; Ingold, Karin/H-5390-2012","Kammermann, Lorenz/0000-0003-4274-6719; Stadelmann-Steffen, Isabelle/0000-0003-3441-4757; Dermont, Clau/0000-0001-5456-8935",Swiss National Science Foundation within the National Research Programme Managing Energy Consumption [NRP 71]; Eawag discretionary fund,Swiss National Science Foundation within the National Research Programme Managing Energy Consumption; Eawag discretionary fund,"We thank Philippe Thalmann, Stefan Rieder, Maarten Wolsink and participants at the 2016 Annual Conference of the Swiss Political Science Association, in particular Katharina Michaelowa, for helpful comments on earlier versions, as well as two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to this contribution.

This paper discusses how firms are affected by, and respond to, energy price increases caused by subsidy reforms. It highlights that cost increases (both direct and indirect) do not necessarily reflect competitiveness losses, since firms have various ways to mitigate and pass on price shocks. This paper presents and discusses direct and indirect transmission channels for price shocks, and firms' response measures: absorbing cost shocks into profits, inter-fuel substitution, increasing energy and material efficiency, and passing on price increases. It argues that further micro-econometric studies using enterprise surveys are essential for quantifying the role of these mechanisms, and for designing policy measures that ensure that competitiveness losses due to subsidy reforms are minimised.","[Rentschler, Jun] UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Rentschler, Jun] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, 57 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6FA, England; [Kornejew, Martin] Stockholm Univ, 10 Univ Vagen, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kornejew, Martin] Univ Kiel, 4 Christian Albrechts Platz, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Bazilian, Morgan] Columbia Univ, Ctr Global Energy Policy, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Bazilian, Morgan] Royal Inst Technol, Brinellvagen 8, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden",University of London; University College London; University of Oxford; Stockholm University; University of Kiel; Columbia University; Royal Institute of Technology,"Rentschler, J (通讯作者)，UCL, Sch Environm Energy & Resources, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",jun.rentschler.10@ucl.ac.uk,,,Oxford Institute for Energy Studies,Oxford Institute for Energy Studies,"The research underlying this paper was kindly funded by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, and published in abridged form by Rentschler and Kornejew (2016).

The economic growth of developing countries with industrial infrastructure has a more significant association with electricity consumption than oil prices. We use oil prices and electricity consumption jointly to study highly predictive observations for economic growth. The data are categorized by income, OECD and regional levels. The panel cointegration, long-run parameter estimation, and Pool Mean Group tests are used to analyze the cointegration and short-run and long-run relationships between the variables. The empirical results indicate the presence of cointegration between the variables. The presence of feedback effects between electricity consumption and economic growth, oil prices and economic growth is valid. These findings confirm that in spite of the oil prices, developing countries rely heavily on electricity consumption for economic growth. In the short run, growth and feedback effects suggest that more vigorous electricity policies should be implemented to attain sustainable economic growth for the long-term.","[Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Energy & Sustainable Dev, Montpellier, France; [Sarwar, Suleman; Chen, Wei] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Malik, Muhammad Nasir] Univ Cent Punjab, Business Sch, Lahore, Pakistan",Montpellier Business School; Shandong University; University of Central Punjab,"Sarwar, S (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",shahbazmohd@live.com; ch.sulemansarwar@gmail.com; weichen@sdu.edu.cn; mnmalik@gmail.com,"Malik, Muhammad Nasir/IZE-5889-2023; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019; Sarwar, Suleman/AEZ-9049-2022; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021","Sarwar, Suleman/0000-0002-4791-0293; Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997",,,,,118,160,163,7,76,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,256,270,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.006,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,Green Submitted,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800026,0

We consider the latter could be improved by targeting specific household groups rather than looking to follow a single energy consumption level target. This article explores the scope of having a disaggregated energy consumption market to design policies aimed at curbing residential energy consumption or lowering its carbon intensity. Using a clustering method based on the CHAID (Chi Square Automatic Interaction Detection) methodology, we find that the different levels of energy consumption in the French residential sector are related to socio-economic, dwelling and regional characteristics. Then, we build a typology of energy-consuming households where targeted groups (fuel poor, high income and high consuming households) are clearly and separately identified through a simple and transparent set of characteristics. This classification represents an efficient tool for energy efficiency programs and energy poverty policies, but also for potential investors, which could provide specific and tailor made financial tools for the different consumer groups. Furthermore, our approach helps designing some energy efficiency score that could reduce the rebound effect uncertainty for each identified household group.","[Hache, Emmanuel; Leboullenger, Deborah] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Leboullenger, Deborah; Mignon, Valerie] Univ Paris Ouest, EconomiX CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Leboullenger, Deborah] BPCE SA, Paris, France; [Mignon, Valerie] CEPII, Paris, France",IFP Energies Nouvelles; Universite Paris Saclay,"Mignon, V (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest, EconomiX CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",valerie.mignon@u-paris10.fr,"DEV, Direction Economie/C-1705-2013","HACHE, Emmanuel/0000-0002-3875-628X",,,,,50,28,30,4,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,82,95,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.038,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200009,0

In the short rim, economic actors attempt to continue their business-as-usual and follow established trade patters as closely as possible. In the model this is modelled by minimizing the information gain between the original pattern of economic transactions and the situation in which natural gas flows are disrupted. We analyze four scenarios that simulate Russian export stops of natural gas by means of a model calibrated on an international input-output table with six sectors and six regions. The simulations show that at the lower levels of aggregation considerable effects are found. At the aggregate level of the whole economy, however, the impacts of the four scenarios are negligible for Europe and only a little less so for Russia itself. Interestingly, the effects on the size of the economy, as measured by its GDP, are predominantly positive for the various European regions, but negative for Russia. The effects on the welfare of the populations involved, however, as measured by the size of domestic final demand, have an opposite sign; with predominantly negligible but negative effects for European regions, and very small positive effects for the Russian population.","[Bouwmeester, Maaike C.] European Commiss, L-2920 Eurostat, Luxembourg; [Oosterhaven, J.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Oosterhaven, J (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",j.oosterhaven@rug.nl,"Oosterhaven, Jan/ABA-1136-2021",,Energy Delta Gas Research (EDGaR) program; Northern Netherlands Provinces; European Fund for Regional Development; Ministry of Economic Affairs; Province of Groningen,Energy Delta Gas Research (EDGaR) program; Northern Netherlands Provinces; European Fund for Regional Development(European Union (EU)); Ministry of Economic Affairs; Province of Groningen,"The paper was written when the first author was still affiliated to the University of Groningen.

Main aim of this paper is the provision of a comprehensive assessment of the existing risk elements of RE investments in relation to the respective policies and the evaluation of their impact on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in Greece. A consultation procedure with key national energy stakeholders took also place, including policy makers, project developers, investors, equity providers, bankers and energy analysts in the Greek RE market, in order to provide a validation of the respective results. It has been concluded that the policy design risk represents the risk element with the greatest impact on the cost of capital and, thus, the level of RE investments' deployment. Based on the cost of capital valuation process followed, the WACC was estimated to reach approximately 12% for onshore wind and little lower values for solar PV projects in Greece.","[Angelopoulos, Dimitrios; Doukas, Harts; Psarras, John; Stamtsis, Giorgos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, EPU NTUA, Decis Support Syst Lab, 9 Iroon Polytech Str, Athens 15773, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Angelopoulos, D (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, EPU NTUA, Decis Support Syst Lab, 9 Iroon Polytech Str, Athens 15773, Greece.",dangel@epu.ntua.gr; h_doukas@epu.ntua.gr; john@epu.ntua.gr; stamtsis@gmail.com,,,Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) Programme within the framework of the project DIA-CORE - Policy dialogue on the assessment and convergence of RES policies in EU Member States [IEE/12/833/SI2.645735]; European Commission [642260]; European Climate Foundation [EPONL17190],Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) Programme within the framework of the project DIA-CORE - Policy dialogue on the assessment and convergence of RES policies in EU Member States; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); European Climate Foundation,"This work was supported by the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) Programme within the framework of the project DIA-CORE - Policy dialogue on the assessment and convergence of RES policies in EU Member States (Project Number: IEE/12/833/SI2.645735), the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Commission in the context of the project TRANSrisk - Transitions pathways and risk analysis for climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies (Grant Agreement No. 642260) and the European Climate Foundation within the framework of the Pricetag project (Project Number: EPONL17190).

We show analytically that these costs consist of disutility caused by unnecessary anxiety - due to misperceived risks relating to existing reactors and where licenses for new nuclear reactors are not granted, delayed or totally lost energy production. Empirical evidence is derived from Finnish surveys eliciting explicitly the importance of risk perceptions on preferences regarding nuclear power and its environmental and economic impacts. We show that the estimated marginal impact of a high perceived risk of nuclear accident is statistically significant and that such a perception considerably decreases the probability of a person supporting nuclear power. This result holds across a number of robustness checks including an instrumental variable estimation and a model validation by observed voting behavior of the members of Parliament. The public's risk perceptions translate into a significant social cost, and are likely to affect the revenues, costs and financing conditions in the nuclear power sector in the future.","[Huhtala, Anni; Remes, Piia] VATT Inst Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland",VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Huhtala, A (通讯作者)，VATT Inst Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland.",anni.huhtala@vatt.fi,,"Huhtala, Anni/0000-0002-8613-3749",Academy of Finland [253608]; Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Academy of Finland (AKA) [253608] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"We are grateful for valuable feedback to the seminar and conference participants at the Helsinki Center of Economic Research, the Centre for Environmental and Resource Economics in Lima, the Utrecht School of Economics, the Environmental and Resource Economics seminar at UC Berkeley, the World Congress of Environmental and Resource Economists, the 29th Annual Congress of the European Economic Association and the USAEE/IAEE North American Conference in Pittsburgh.

Following the survey, 79%, of UK energy professionals believe their sector is not effectively communicating with the public. This suggests there is an urgent need to better understand how to use surveys in a more methodological way. Developed in conjunction with the EI, this paper presents the Energy Barometer survey methodology and results to achieve a better understanding of UK energy professionals' current perceptions and future priorities. The paper makes two contributions to enhance the UK's energy debate. First, it provides the first results in a longitudinal assessment of energy professionals' views of energy policy issues and discusses the implications for future policymaking. Second, it identifies opportunities for Energy Barometer findings to feed into scenarios development. A comparison with other studies was undertaken. It has been shown that the views of professionals working across the sector are aligned with decentralised approaches to decarbonisation. In particular, professionals expect action from policymakers to coordinate, engage with and encourage investment in energy efficiency.","[Parkes, Gareth] Energy Inst, London, England; [Spataru, Catalina] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Parkes, G (通讯作者)，Energy Inst, London, England.",gparkes@energyinst.org; c.spataru@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,155,170,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.019,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500016,0

As a result, a number of government programs aim to support retrofits by offering grants, upgrades, and energy audits to facilitate energy efficiency opportunities. This study reports on a state government program in Victoria, Australia, where the uptake of such offerings was lower than expected, prompting the program team to consider whether targeting facilities managers (FMs), rather than building owners, might be a better way of delivering the program. The influences and practices of FMs that impact on their ability to be advocates for energy efficiency were explored. The results revealed that complex building ownership arrangements, poor communication skills, isolation from key decision making processes, a lack of credible business cases and information, split incentives, and the prospect of business disruptions can all impact on FMs' ability to drive organizational change. Future program efforts should continue to interrogate the social context of retrofits in mid-tier buildings, including other influences and influencers beyond FMs, and adapt accordingly.","[Curtis, Jim] Monash Univ, BehaviourWorks Australia, Monash Sustainable Dev Inst, 8 Scen Blvd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Walton, Andrea] CSIRO, 41 Boggo Rd, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia; [Dodd, Michael] Dept Ind Innovat & Sci, 10 Binara St, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",Monash University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Curtis, J (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, BehaviourWorks Australia, Monash Sustainable Dev Inst, 8 Scen Blvd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",james.curtis@monash.edu,"Walton, Andrea/H-1985-2013","Walton, Andrea/0000-0001-5483-6397",Sustainability Victoria,Sustainability Victoria,The authors would like to thank the Facility Management Association of Australia for assisting with the research and providing feedback on drafts of this paper.

We show that the uniform distribution constitutes an equilibrium for a very general class of transport cost functions. Moreover, we establish that symmetric partial agglomeration arises as an equilibrium if and only if the transport cost function is linear and the number of locations is even. We also find that all rotationally symmetric distributions with continuous support are spatial equilibria if the transport costs are linear. This multiplicity of equilibria however disappears in the case of strictly concave transport costs: the uniform distribution is then the unique spatial equilibrium distribution with continuous support.

Se muestra que la distribucion uniforme constituye un equilibrio para una clase muy generica de funciones del costo de transporte.

Tambien se encontro que todas las distribuciones simetricas en cuanto a la rotacion y bajo apoyo continuo alcanzan equilibrios espaciales cuando los costos de transporte son lineales.

The optimal industry shifts assure integration of all regions by regional services and goods in which carbon emissions are embodied via energy consumption. Generally speaking, high-tech industries should concentrate in affluent regions to replace construction. Selected services should increase output shares across most of regions. Meanwhile, energy intensive manufacturing, rather than agriculture, should decrease their shares to achieve the national annual growth constrained by nation's carbon targets. Due to the need to decelerate energy use, carbon intensity goal puts particularly extreme pressure on less-developed regions to shutter heavy industries.

We focus on the economic impact of implementing Colorado's existing Renewable Portfolio Standard, updated in 2013. This requires that 25% of state generation come from qualifying renewable sources by 2020. We evaluate the policy under a variety of assumptions regarding wind integration costs and assumptions on the persistence of federal subsidies for wind. Specifically, we estimate the implied price of carbon as the carbon price at which a state-level policy would pass a state-level cost-benefit analysis, taking account of estimated greenhouse gas emission reductions and ancillary benefits from corresponding reductions in criteria pollutants. Our findings suggest that without the Production Tax Credit (federal aid), the state policy of mandating renewable power generation (RPS) is costly to state actors, with an implied cost of carbon of about $17 per ton of CO2 with a 3% discount rate. Federal aid makes the decision between natural gas and wind nearly cost neutral for Colorado.","[Hannum, Christopher] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Econ, Macka Campus, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey; [Cutler, Harvey; Iverson, Terrence] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Keyser, David] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Istanbul Technical University; Colorado State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Hannum, C (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Econ, Macka Campus, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",hannum@itu.edu.tr,"; Hannum, Christopher/H-5843-2018","Iverson, Terrence/0000-0003-1519-8358; Hannum, Christopher/0000-0001-8298-4725",U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC36-08GO28308]; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis; U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory; University of Colorado-Boulder; Colorado School of Mines; Colorado State University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Stanford University,U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Renewable Energy Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis; U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory; University of Colorado-Boulder; Colorado School of Mines; Colorado State University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Stanford University(Stanford University),"This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308 with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Increasingly China is turning its attention to the export market using its own designs, which it claiins emulate the safety standards of the latest designs of the established nuclear reactor vendors. Its export efforts would be greatly strengthened if it were to win an order from an established user of nuclear power and its best opportunity appears to be the UK where it is at the early stages of negotiating the construction of nuclear reactors. The financial collapse of the French nuclear company, Areva, gives it the opportunity to take a stake in the rescued companies giving it access to important fuel cycle technologies and perhaps the large French reactor service market. Its other export prospects in Europe are in Romania and Turkey. There are a number of issues European governments need to examine before committing to allow in Chinese nuclear companies.

National innovation systems theory provides the theoretical framework that guided a series of interviews in the two regions.

If we apply the algorithms to reconstruct the images from the projections measured in polychromatic mode then the reconstructed images will be corrupted by so-called cupping artifacts due to beam hardening. There are several approaches to take into account polichromaticity. One of them is to correct the sinograms before reconstruction.

We develop a behavioral welfare economics approach to conduct cost-benefit analysis of FDA tobacco regulations. We use a simple two-period model to develop expressions for the impact of tobacco control policies on social welfare. Our model includes: nudge and paternalistic regulations; an excise tax on cigarettes; internalities created by period 1 versus period 2 consumption; and externalities from cigarette consumption. Our analytical expressions show that in the presence of uncorrected internalities and externalities, a nudge or a tax to reduce cigarette consumption improves social welfare. In sharp contrast, a paternalistic regulation might either improve or worsen social welfare. Another important result is that the social welfare gains from new policies do not only depend on the size of the internalities and externalities, but also depend on the extent to which current policies already correct the problems. We link our analytical expressions to the graphical approach used in most previous studies and discuss the information needed to complete cost-benefit analysis of tobacco regulations. We use our model as a framework to reexamine the evidence base for strong conclusions about the size of the internalities, which is the key information needed.","[DeCicca, Philip] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Kenkel, Donald; Wang, Hua] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY USA; [Kenkel, Donald] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Liu, Feng] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Management & Econ, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","McMaster University; Cornell University; Cornell University; The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen","DeCicca, P (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,63,4,4,1,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0731-2199,,978-1-78635-465-5; 978-1-78635-466-2,ADV HEALTH ECON HEAL,,,2017,25.0,,,,,,143,179,,10.1108/S0731-219920170000025005,0.0,,,37,"Economics; Health Policy & Services; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ2HJ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419350900006,0

This paper conducts a study of energy-saving behavior and the influencing factors using correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis and other research methods; it focuses first on urban and rural residents in Jiangsu Province and then regionally on North Jiangsu, Middle Jiangsu and South Jiangsu. The results show that (1) urban residents in Jiangsu Province tend to engage in more energy-saving activities than rural residents; regionally, the energy-saving tendencies of residents from the area can be ranked as follows: Middle Jiangsu residents > North Jiangsu residents > South Jiangsu residents. (2) Urban-rural differences and regional differences also exist in Jiangsu Province in terms of both buying choice behavior and daily use behavior. With regard to regional differences in the factors influencing buying choice behavior and daily use behavior to support energy saving, North Jiangsu residents are most influenced by a sense of responsibility for the environment, Middle Jiangsu residents by policies and regulations and energy-saving knowledge, and South Jiangsu residents by low-carbon energy-saving willingness and energy-saving knowledge.

Checking receivables is critical to maintaining financial liquidity and business performance, and helps managers make sound decisions. The article presents the role and importance of receivables management of an enterprise and their importance to improving the efficiency of business entities. The research methods applied are based on the study of literature from the examined area and analysis of receivables management in the audited entity. These methods will be presented in the context of their usefulness in managing liquidity.

For the support of the best quality of service it would be reasonable to implement a handover to another radio access network cell in the same territory, a so-called vertical handover (VHO), by transferring the user connection and IP session from the current access network to a new network. In this paper, we analyze vertical handovers from an untrusted WLAN network to an LTE network. This type of handover from an untrusted WLAN network is the most difficult because of the many nodes of an LTE network related to authorization and resource allocation. The paper includes a synthesis of the basic procedures for the session setup and LTE resource allocation.

The new convex optimization formulation of the nonparametric (Kiefer-Wolfowitz) maximum likelihood estimator for mixture models is employed to construct nonparametric Bayes rules for compound decisions. The methods are first illustrated with some simulation examples and then with an application to models of income dynamics. Using panel data, we estimate a simple dynamic model of earnings that incorporates bivariate heterogeneity in intercept and variance of the innovation process. Profile likelihood is employed to estimate an AR(1) parameter controlling the persistence of the innovations. We find that persistence is relatively modest, (rho) over cap approximate to 0.48, when we permit heterogeneity in variances. Evidence of negative dependence between individual intercepts and variances is revealed by the nonparametric estimation of the mixing distribution, and has important consequences for forecasting future income trajectories.","[Gu, Jiaying] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Max Gluskin House,150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Koenker, Roger] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Toronto; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Gu, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Max Gluskin House,150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",jiaying.gu@toronto.ca,,,"NSF [SES-11-53548]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This research was partially supported by the NSF grant SES-11-53548.

The basis of this relationship should be the achievement of a functional balance between consumption patterns and quality of life conducive to the fulfillment not only of reproduction but above all the development needs and human values.

Finland is relatively big country in Scandinavia with a total area of 338145 km(2) and one of the lowest density in Europe 18 inhabitants per dry land km(2). This causes logistic and also sustainability challenges, which Finnish companies have to deal with in order to be competitive in the global markets - how to compensate the extra cost caused by the 2000 km transportation to the main markets at the central Europe? During the last 60 years the Finnish economy and industry have been strongly dependent on foreign trade surplus. Since 2008 the quantity and value of the Finnish exports has experienced a dramatic change and the sustainability challenges will definitely change the markets further in the ever-globalizing world trade. In the future the Finnish exports industry will be required to face ever tightening productivity and cost efficiency challenges because of automatization, digitalization and low cost production. As the external productivity and costs pressure increases will the Finnish national economics be in turmoil because of chronically deficit national budget. The high living costs do not allow lower salaries without social support financed by government or municipalities. These lower salaries will cut automatically down the tax incomes and the vicious circle is appearing.","[Imppola, Jorma Jaakko] Seinajoki Univ Appl Sci, Sch Business & Culture, Kampusranta 11, FI-60101 Seinajoki, Finland",Seinajoki University of Applied Sciences,"Imppola, JJ (通讯作者)，Seinajoki Univ Appl Sci, Sch Business & Culture, Kampusranta 11, FI-60101 Seinajoki, Finland.",jorma.imppola@seamk.fi,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,771,778,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201034,0

The result of such application leads to the author's conclusion, under which the full function criteria are not applicable to all joint ventures equally.

Thanks to the circulation of materials in the economy, resources in the production process can be kept as long as they can and get the maximum value during use. The circular economy and its basic principles are based on the idea that all product and material flows can be reintegrated into their cycle after their use, where they will again become sources for new products and services. Producing with less impact on the environment and assessing the impact of products throughout the life cycle of the product design phase is only the first step. Good product ecological design, innovation, and the return of materials back to production can bring great financial savings and long-term growth. The Cradle to Cradle principle also motivates companies not to produce only less harmful products, but also to improve the environment around us. In the current global era, there are a large number of positive examples of companies, whether in Slovakia or abroad, which are trying to recover, recycle and reuse existing materials or get waste back into production. In the paper we will discuss the theoretical background to the issue of the circulating economy, the cradle to cradle principle, and in practical examples we will show how these principles can work effectively in practice and provide international companies with a competitive advantage and growth potential.","[Jurisova, Vladimira] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Mass Media Commun, Nam J Herdu 2, Trnava 91700, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Jurisová, V (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Mass Media Commun, Nam J Herdu 2, Trnava 91700, Slovakia.",vladimira.jurisova@gmail.com,,"Jurisova, Vladimira/0000-0003-3021-2648",VEGA [1/0640/15],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"Tento prispevok je sucastou projektu VEGA 1/0640/15 s nazvom,Koncepcia Phygital a jej uplatnenie v udrzatelnom integrovanom environmentalnom manazmente podnikov.",,20,4,4,2,7,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,828,835,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201041,0

The main objective of the study was to identify promising directions of improving the economy regulations. The authors specifically developed criteria to evaluate the performance of direct and indirect forms of legal influence on economic relations. The results have been obtained on the basis of comparative data analysis. The assessment revealed that in recent years the legislation trend of the Russian Federation is to strengthen the direct forms of state control. Thus, according to the authors, these law methods lead to negative results in the economy. It should be noted, that ways of indirect legal regulations of the economy are developing in Russia too. It is an activity of licensing, registering, etc. They feature indirect legal regulation with the lower administrative coercion and they focus on the creation of conditions that legalize the activity of legal entities in the economic space. In order to develop these forms of impact in the Russian law, we should take into account all positive international experience. During the study, the authors concluded that currently the most effective forms of legal impact on the economy are indirect ones.

The analysis is based on a subsystem perspective that allows us to reveal the proportion of the activity of each industry that comes under the individual subsystems. We analyze several research questions. Have the European countries become more deindustrialized considering both direct and indirect effects? Does the magnitude of the changes (direct vs. direct and indirect) differ? How did market services integrated into the manufacturing help to mitigate the deindustrialization effects? Is manufacturing more integrated at the subsystem level? What was the role of international trade and 'tertimization' in this process? Based on the results, we conclude that the outsourcing process is presented in most developed counties, as well as in developing one. Such an outsourcing process confirms the premature deindustrialization hypothesis. Furthermore, there is a clear shift of value added activities that come from manufacturing subsystems from G7 countries and Developed countries to the rest of the world.","[Labaj, Martin; Stracova, Erika; Kalis, Richard] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Econ Policy, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Lábaj, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Econ Policy, Bratislava, Slovakia.",martin.labaj@euba.sk; erika.stracova@euba.sk; richard.kalis@euba.sk,"Lábaj, Martin/ADP-5704-2022; Stracová, Erika/AAO-9690-2020","Lábaj, Martin/0000-0003-0000-8048;",[I-17-104-00],,This paper is a part of research project I-17-104-00 Socialno-ekonomicke aspekty deindustrializacie,,10,0,0,0,0,UNIV SOCIAL & ADM AFFAIRS,HAVIROV,"VITEZSLAVA NEZVALA 801-1, HAVIROV, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87291-20-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,153,163,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations; Public Administration,BP4JR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000552892500013,0

One of the possible solutions to this problem is the utilization of the Licensed Shared Access (LSA) framework, which is developed with the assistance of ETSI. The LSA spectrum is shared between the owner (incumbent) and LSA licensee (e.g., mobile network operator). At any time, LSA spectrum could be used by incumbent or mobile network operator but not together at once. In this connection, if the incumbent needs its frequency, then LSA band becomes unavailable for mobile operator. This leads to service interruptions for mobile operator users. Service interruption has a significant impact both on quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). In this regard, we propose the model of the LTE network cell with LSA framework as a finite capacity queuing system with unreliable server. The important QoS parameters of the model are moments of queue and service sojourn time.

It is necessary to develop a methodology that is applicable in different countries and at the international level. Such a methodology is an evaluation of efficiency based on the value of an enterprise. Enterprise cost management is one of the key areas in modern management. This direction of management is based on the recognition of the fact that the growth of value is the best indicator, indicating the growth and development of the enterprise. Known cost-based management models (EVA, CVA, SVA and other models) do not always allow for correct decisions. This is due to the fact that simple models can not satisfy all management principles at different stages of the enterprise's life cycle. The authors of the article propose to use the adaptive control system of fundamental value. This system takes into account the stages of the enterprise's life cycle. It is built on the basis of a system-functional approach to valuation. The essence of the model is the formation of individual profiles of dynamic consistency of key cost indicators, which include indicators of the balance sheet, the operating investment component and the component of dynamic flexibility. At each stage of the life cycle, it is proposed to form its system of dynamic consistency of indicators, which consists in ordering the growth rates of indicators reflecting the growth of each component of the fundamental value.","[Pirogova, Oksana] St Petersburg State Polytech Univ, Grad Sch Commod & Serv, Ind Management Inst, Econ & Trade, 29 Politehnicheskaya Str, St Petersburg 195251, Russia; [Plotnikov, Vladimir] South West State Univ, Dept Reg Econ & Management, 94,50 Let Oktyabrya Str, Kursk 305040, Russia",Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University; Southwest State University - Russia,"Plotnikov, V (通讯作者)，South West State Univ, Dept Reg Econ & Management, 94,50 Let Oktyabrya Str, Kursk 305040, Russia.",kafedra17@rambler.ru; plotnikov_2000@mail.ru,"Plotnikov, Vladimir/A-4854-2014",,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1980,1988,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203052,0

We used hierarchical cluster analysis to model Russia's demographic space and segment regions with comparable problems related to forming demographic potential. Clustering was based on the indicators describing the demographic potential at the macro-level (regional) and meso-level (family level). The analysis identified the groups of regions that have the best and the worst conditions for the development of demographic potential. We proposed a set of measures that would be most relevant to the needs of specific groups of regions and could directly drive the development and actualisation of demographic potential. The analysis showed the need to use multi factor classification in the demographics of countries that have a high level of regional differentiation. Modelling the demographic space on the basis of cluster analysis can be seen as an element of the system of supporting administrative decision-making and the development of effective demographic policy.","[Shubat, Oksana; Bagirova, Anna; Shmarova, Irina] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Shubat, O (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",o.m.shubat@urfu.ru; a.p.bagirova@urfu.ru; i.v.shmarova@urfu.ru,"Shubat, Oksana/M-7443-2013; Bagirova, Anna/M-7440-2013","Shubat, Oksana/0000-0002-0929-8144; Bagirova, Anna/0000-0001-5653-4093",Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation [02.A03.21.0006],Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation,"The work was supported by Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation, contract No 02.A03.21.0006.",,15,3,3,0,5,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,53,59,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000009,0

Production planning in a typical manufacturing organization is a sequence of complex decisions which depends on a number of factors, such as number of products, complexity of products, number of production sites, and number of work centres in each production site. The main idea in hierarchical production planning is to break down larger problems into smaller, more manageable sub problems. Starting with aggregate production planning, the benefits of using master production scheduling for material requirements planning will be conveyed. The main benefit of master production scheduling is more detailed planning. The production groups are thereby disaggregated into final products and the production site disaggregated into work centres. In order to plan capacities, resource profiles are used. By working with resource profiles production lead time data are taken into account to provide time-phased projections of the capacity requirements for each work centre (Vollmann et al. 2005). The case study will show that more accurate planning and consideration of production lead time through master production scheduling results in a demand program that can be realized without shortages or delays.","[Vitzthum, Thorsten; Herrmann, Frank] Ostbayer Tech Hsch Regensburg, Innovat & Competence Ctr Prod Logist & Factory Pl, Prufeninger Str 58, D-93049 Regensburg, Germany; [Vitzthum, Thorsten] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Markt 23, D-02763 Zittau, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Vitzthum, T (通讯作者)，Ostbayer Tech Hsch Regensburg, Innovat & Competence Ctr Prod Logist & Factory Pl, Prufeninger Str 58, D-93049 Regensburg, Germany.;Vitzthum, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Markt 23, D-02763 Zittau, Germany.",thorsten.vitzthum@oth-regensburg.de; frank.herrmann@oth-regensburg.de,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,8,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,475,481,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000071,0

First, we calculate the volume of value added of exports in China and India from the aspect on total number, industrial number and bilateral number. Then comparing the quality of exports between China and India from three dimensions. Result shows that the proportion of exports in value added of China and India continue to decrease compared with the total exports, and the proportion of value added of exports in these two countries are equal almostly; By the view of industrial level, the proportion of China's exports in value added are relatively balanced among different industries, while India's exports in value added mainly concentrated on agricultural sector, nature resource industries and financial services, software information industries. Take on the comparasion of second dimension, China has slight advantages; From the third dimension of market distribution, China's export market tends to be decentralized and the dependence on a certain market decreased by time goes. Forming a striking contrast, Indian market of export turns to be more and more concentrated. So the overall quality of China's export is better than that of India.","[Wang Guangtong] Shanghai Univ, Ctr Global Studies, Appl Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Sun Guoqiang] Shanghai Univ, Global Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cao Wei] Guangzhou Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; Shanghai University; Guangzhou University,"Wang, GT (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Ctr Global Studies, Appl Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wgt821623952@126.com; 786506652@qq.com,"Wang, Guangtong/C-4347-2017",,,,,,15,1,1,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-452-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,179.0,,,,,,196,203,,,,,,8,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6MO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854700041,0

The purpose of these CMF is to suppress electromagnetic interference (EMI) between wireless communications systems (e.g. WIFI) and digital high-speed interfaces (e.g. USB 3). A designer of such an electronic device usually carries out a signal integrity (SI) analysis, using models of the system components. There are two alternative ways of modelling the CMF: One is based on matrices (called S-parameters) that describe the behaviour in the frequency domain and are either derived from measurements or simulation tools. The other is using a representation based on lumped circuit networks. In this work, a lumped network is generated manually based on expert knowledge. The advantage of this approach is the reduced number of only passive network components compared to traditional methods that produce much larger networks comprising of many active and passive devices. On the other hand, suitable component values of the lumped network need to be found so that the network exhibits the same frequency response as the physical device. Since there are many interacting parameters to be tuned, this cannot be achieved manually. Hence, a genetic algorithm is applied to this optimisation problem. Two sets of experiments were carried out and a sensitivity analysis has been conducted. It has been shown that the proposed method is capable of finding near optimal solutions within reasonable computation time.","[Werner, Jens; Nolle, Lars] Jade Univ Appl Sci Wilhelmshaven Oldenburg Elsfle, Friedrich Paffrath Str 101, D-26389 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Schuett, Jennifer] Nexperia Germany GmbH, Stresemannallee 101, D-22529 Hamburg, Germany",Jade University of Applied Sciences,"Werner, J (通讯作者)，Jade Univ Appl Sci Wilhelmshaven Oldenburg Elsfle, Friedrich Paffrath Str 101, D-26389 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",jens.werner@jade-hs.de; lars.nolle@jade-hs.de; jennifer.schuett@nexperia.com,,"Werner, Jens/0000-0002-9878-1639",,,,,22,0,0,0,0,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,262,269,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000040,0

Transitions in this literature include moving from attitudinal factors, and the infamous Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) explanation, toward place attachment, environmental justice, and how policy development might shape support for wind turbines in rural communities. While this research has advanced our understanding of some of the major questions in this area, the political arena has largely remained implicit or in the background, rather than a specific area of detailed inquiry. Addressing this gap in the literature, we detail findings from our mixed method study of interviews (n = 54) and surveys (n = 240) with local residents, developers, and other stakeholders in Ontario and Nova Scotia, Canada. We focus on the interplay of partisanship and geography, and how together they can powerfully influence attitudes toward wind energy. Specifically, we extend the existing literature and argue that when parties politicize the issue of wind energy - especially within the context of an urban/rural divide - it becomes intertwined with elements of ideology which can amplify responses and further entrench local conflict.","[Walker, Chad] Queens Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Stephenson, Laura] Western Univ, Dept Polit Sci, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Baxter, Jamie] Western Univ, Dept Geog, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",Queens University - Canada; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Walker, C (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",cw135@queensu.ca,"Walker, Chad/AAJ-5729-2020; Stephenson, Laura/C-5458-2019","Stephenson, Laura/0000-0003-3526-8624; Baxter, Jamie/0000-0003-3410-0969","George C.

The efficiencies of such measures vary across China, yet a comprehensive decision-supporting tool that guides the selection of measures according to geographical characteristics is lacking. This study aims to develop an efficiency evaluation framework using data envelopment analysis (DEA) to guide the selection of the most efficient ESCO measures in different parts of China. Data from 1304 ESCO projects in six parts of Mainland China were examined using DEA to determine the efficiency of 15 energy-saving measures in the manufacturing and building sectors. The results indicate that reconstruction of industrial boiler furnaces is the most energy-efficient measure in the manufacturing sector, while energy management systems are the most efficient measure in the building sector. The variation in the statuses of economic development and the climate conditions of the six areas of China are the major factors for the differences in efficiency. A decision-making tool for guiding the selection of the ESCO measures with the most efficient technologies for specific regions and end-uses is developed to provide comprehensive information to both investors and the ESCOs.","[Zheng, Saina; Lam, Chor-Man; Hsu, Shu-Chien] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jingzheng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind Syst & Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Hsu, SC (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mark.hsu@polyu.edu.hk,"Ren, Jingzheng/ABF-5240-2020","Ren, Jingzheng/0000-0002-9690-5183; Hsu, Shu-Chien/0000-0002-7232-9839",Hong Kong Research Grants Council [25220615],Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),The authors express their thanks for the grant supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Grant No. 25220615).,,79,28,28,2,63,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,580,591,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.011,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700054,0

The analysis exploits exogenous delay of treatment conditions and the unique availability of microdata that cover the universe of the departments. We estimate that the reform boosted first-year enrolments by 14.5-17.3 percentage points, compared to a counterfactual status of no reform. This enrolment shift was due to participation gains rather than substitution effects, and it is likely to have persisted in the longer term. Moreover, no trade-off between increased participation and deteriorated retention and on-time graduation emerged.","[Bondonio, Daniele] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Law & Polit Econ & Social Sci, Via Cavour 84, I-15121 Alessandria, Italy; [Berton, Fabio] Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Stat, Lungo Dora Siena 100, I-10153 Turin, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; University of Turin,"Bondonio, D (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Law & Polit Econ & Social Sci, Via Cavour 84, I-15121 Alessandria, Italy.",daniele.bondonio@uniupo.it; fabio.berton@unito.it,"Berton, Fabio/AAJ-5636-2020","Berton, Fabio/0000-0002-2894-1297",University of Piemonte orientale,University of Piemonte orientale,"The data used in the analysis have been provided by the former Italian National Committee for the Evaluation of the University System (MIUR-Ministry of Education, University and Research).

Existing studies focus on the role of regulation and energy markets to explaining the diffusion of green energy. This paper looks at the specific role of the firms' regional environment in this process. We use a unique database combining the Community Innovation Survey 2014 for Germany and district-level data on renewable energy plants, the attitudes of a region's population towards 'green issues' and other control variables. We find that geographical proximity to electricity production based on renewable energy sources and the orientation of a region towards 'green issues' are both correlated to such innovations. Therefore, not only hard regulation measures such as the renewable energy law are relevant for renewable energy innovations. Our results show that subsidies for eco-innovation, high energy costs and regional knowledge spill-overs are linked to a rapid adoption of renewable energy by firms.","[Horbach, Jens] Univ Appl Sci Augsburg, Fac Business, Friedberger Str 4, D-86161 Augsburg, Germany; [Rammer, Christian] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L 7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Horbach, J (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Augsburg, Fac Business, Friedberger Str 4, D-86161 Augsburg, Germany.",jens.horbach@hs-augsburg.de; christian.rammer@zew.de,"Rammer, Christian/ABA-8789-2021","Rammer, Christian/0000-0002-1173-9471",,,,,47,57,59,7,72,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,404,414,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.042,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800041,0

First, consumption has increased since 1995, as electric utilities substitute gas for coal. Since electricity use is summer peaking, this new consumption smooths demand over the year. Second, the shale gas revolution has increased production and storage since 2005. This decreased prices, encouraging the coal-to-gas substitution. Frictions between the gas and electricity industries have, however, decreased electric reliability. Just as locating generators at coal mines decreases the cost of transporting coal, locating gas generators at storage sites increases reliability by decreasing these frictions. But because the increased reliability is external, and thus ignored by generators and infrastructure providers, FERC must provide incentives to coordinate investment in generation and storage to realize these gains.","[Savitski, David W.; Nuryyev, Guych] I Shou Univ, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan",I Shou University,"Nuryyev, G (通讯作者)，I Shou Univ, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan.",DavidSavitski@isu.edu.tw; gnuriyev@isu.edu.tw,,,,,,,53,1,1,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,611,620,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.040,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800059,0

We use county level data from 2005 to 2013 for 13 states in the Northeast United States including the District of Columbia. In estimating the relationship between incentives and solar PV capacity, we control for insolation, market factors, and demographic characteristics. We also account for indicators of pro-environmental attitudes and preferences for solar technology. Results indicate that factors affecting financial returns from a solar PV installation like electricity price and insolation are highly significant. Among policy variables, rebates, solar renewable energy credit price, and sales tax waivers are significant, along with years of Renewable Portfolio Standard implementation. Indicators of environmental preferences and familiarity with solar technology are not as important, which is in contrast with findings in the residential solar market. This suggests that commercial installations are driven mostly by its promise of financial returns, and continued growth in this market segment is likely to depend on falling installation costs and availability of incentives.","[Crago, Christine L.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, 216 Stockbridge Hall,80 Campus Ctr Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Koegler, Eric] ISO New England, Holyoke, MA USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Crago, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, 216 Stockbridge Hall,80 Campus Ctr Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",ccrago@umass.edu,,,UMass Clean Energy; Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources Grant [S13250000000017],UMass Clean Energy; Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources Grant,This project was supported by a seed grant from the UMass Clean Energy.

These Enterprises produce vital services, using diesel vehicles for transportation of personnel, tools and materials to worksites, thus contributing to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Enterprises that have taken BE-LCVs into use report practical range challenges leading to a need to reorganize their transportation activities. The driving pattern of 7 C&S enterprises operating 115 vehicles, were logged over two weeks. The potential of using BE-LCVs can be evaluated by combining the real range of BE-LCVs in Norway, with these driving patterns. Although 42% of diesel LCVs (D-LCVs) could be replaceable by BE-LCVs with a range of 170 km. Many covered so short daily distances that the transport work would only be reduced by 13%. The replaceable vehicles and transport work can increase by redistributing vehicle assignments, daytime charging, or with longer range BE-LCVs. If all year range increases to 200 km, then almost all vehicles are potentially replaceable. Purchase incentives are required to unlock the potential, but may, not produce large effects until the range improves. BE-LCVs with 50% longer range enters the market in 2018, which should expand the market.","[Figenbaum, Erik] Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Figenbaum, E (通讯作者)，Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway.",efi@toi.no,,"Figenbaum, Erik/0000-0003-2092-369X","Research council of Norway [227068, 257653]; Norwegian Public Roads Administration; Municipality of Oslo and Renault of Norway",Research council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Norwegian Public Roads Administration; Municipality of Oslo and Renault of Norway,"This paper is based on data collected in the Crafttrans project carried out between 2012 and 2016 with financial support from the Research council of Norway (grant number 227068), the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, the Municipality of Oslo and Renault of Norway.

In this paper, I examine the consequences of this design feature by modeling a series of tradable performance standard policies. I analyze how fuel-based standard differentiation affects compliance incentives and the regulatory burden on coal stakeholders through three key outcomes: coal usage, coal plant profits, and electricity prices. Analysis of a simple analytic model shows that differentiation, compared to a policy with a uniform standard for all fuel types, always increases coal usage, but price and profit impacts are ambiguous. To quantify these outcomes, I construct and implement a detailed simulation model of the U.S. wholesale electricity market. Simulation results suggest that differentiation increases coal usage modestly, increases coal plant profits well beyond the no-regulation level, and increases electricity prices in almost every region of the country.

Promising options include biofuels; hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles; hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; maglev trains; and the Hyperloop. To varying degrees, widespread adoption of these technologies is complicated by the chicken-and-egg problem of infrastructure provision. Consumers are unlikely to adopt a technology in the absence of supporting infrastructure, but infrastructure provision is unprofitable without a critical mass of adopters. To derive policy recommendations for overcoming this problem, this study analyzes historical data on the diffusion dynamics of transport systems in the United States. The methodology systematically compares the relative timing of diffusion processes for infrastructure, vehicles, and travel. A striking regularity observed across transport systems is that the diffusion of infrastructure precedes the adoption of vehicles, which precedes the expansion of travel. On the chicken-and-egg conundrum, findings thus support the view that infrastructure comes first. The analysis leads to three salient policy recommendations: support adequate infrastructure provision early in the technology life cycle, target suitable niche markets to maximize the impact of infrastructure investment, and leverage distributed technologies to reduce overall infrastructure requirements.","[Leibowicz, Benjamin D.] Univ Texas Austin, Grad Program Operat Res & Ind Engn, ETC 5-128D,204 E Dean Keeton St,C2200, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Leibowicz, BD (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Grad Program Operat Res & Ind Engn, ETC 5-128D,204 E Dean Keeton St,C2200, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",bleibowicz@utexas.edu,"Leibowicz, Benjamin/AAR-3673-2021","Leibowicz, Benjamin/0000-0003-0796-8666",University of Texas at Austin,University of Texas at Austin,"This study was supported by The University of Texas at Austin through a start-up research grant for new faculty.

While numerous studies model such programs, we found few that evaluate SPRs' historical performance. Thus, we evaluate the U.S. SPR's performance by comparing actual real costs with estimated real benefits. From 1976 to 2014, the real U.S. SPR cost was about $219 billion real (2014$) dollars, whereas the real benefit was only $122 billion. Sensitivity testing suggests such negative net benefits are qualitatively robust. However, if world oil demand is extremely inelastic to oil price or GDP is elastic enough to oil price shocks, the estimated U.S. SPR net benefit is positive. Sensitivity testing around total real costs and benefits range from $380 billion to $80 billion. Limited testing of IRA coordinated drawdowns suggests that total U.S. benefits jump from $122 billion to more than $400 billion putting the SPR strongly in the black. Limited testing of private sector inventory changes was more disappointing and tentatively suggests private activities may at times have offset some of the government drawdowns. With 20-20 hindsight, initial experimentation found that better management could have significantly enhanced the value of the U.S. SPR, especially for the 1990-91 disruption.","[Bai, Yang] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dahl, Carol] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Mineral & Energy Econ Program, Golden, CO 80403 USA; [Dahl, Carol] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Payne Inst Earth Resources, Golden, CO 80403 USA; [Dahl, Carol] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden",Nanjing Normal University; Colorado School of Mines; Colorado School of Mines; Lulea University of Technology,"Bai, Y (通讯作者)，Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ybai@njnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71774087, 71403131, 71704080, 71503039]; major program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71690242]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); major program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71774087, 71403131, 71704080, 71503039).

These feed-in tariffs have been tremendously reduced and, consequently, households' behavioral motivations have changed: They have started to adopt various technologies to supply themselves with energy. In this study we investigate the underlying motivational factors that influence private households' intentions to purchase renewable energy system components with the purpose of partial energy self-supply. The study's data is comprised of qualitative interviews (N = 20) and a subsequent quantitative survey (N = 395) among homeowners of one-family houses and apartment houses from Germany. By studying their purchase intentions, we found perceived financial and autarky benefits are the most relevant attitudinal predictors, followed by environmental awareness and technology affinity. Besides attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control are important predictors of purchase intention. Policy makers and the industry could promote homeowners' purchasing behavior with tailored information strategies that address perceived autarky, financial benefits and subjective norms. We suggest support schemes for renewable energy systems to address perceived behavioral control factors. These schemes include necessary ongoing subsidies and a reliable regulatory and financial policy framework.

Social enterprises sit within the third sector of the economy, typically where market or governmental failures exist in the provision of social welfare, and have increasingly become a key driver of social progress. The autonomous nature of the social-economic model applied by such organisations can represent a viable means to reduce state social welfare dependence, and is a proven model for social change. The capability of social enterprises to create both social and economic value is considered a 'win-win'. Yet there are clear potentials for social enterprise models to be more extensively applied to address contemporary ecological challenges of neo-liberal market economies, moving towards 'win-win-win' outcomes across social, economic and ecological domains. This paper investigates the value of social enterprises as drivers of low-carbon transition at the community level, with an emphasis on the energy sector. Evidence from seven organisations in the UK is presented and a socio-technical transitions conceptual framework is applied to analyse these social enterprise operations as a form of social innovation.","[Hillman, Joanne; Axon, Stephen; Morrissey, John] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Axon, Stephen] Southern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Environm Geog & Marine Sci, New Haven, CT USA; [Morrissey, John] Univ Limerick, Mary Immaculate Coll, Dept Geog, South Circular Rd, Limerick V94 VN26, Ireland",Liverpool John Moores University; Connecticut State University System; Southern Connecticut State University; University of Limerick,"Morrissey, J (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Mary Immaculate Coll, Dept Geog, South Circular Rd, Limerick V94 VN26, Ireland.",J.s.Hillman@2012.ljmu.ac.uk; S.J.Axon@ljmu.ac.uk; john.morrissey@mic.ul.ie,,"Axon, Stephen/0000-0003-1166-6118",European Union [657998]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [657998] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"This paper has been developed from research conducted as part of the ENTRUST project, funded from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 657998.

This is a relatively understudied element of the fuel switching literature in both developed and emerging economies. This research adds to this literature by examining the adoption time-path of network gas as a heating fuel. We merge a unique dataset on gas network roll-out over time, with other geo-coded data and employ an instrumental variables technique in order to simultaneously model supply and demand. Results indicate a non-linear relationship between the proportion of households using gas as their primary means of central heating and the length of time the network has been in place in each area. Proximity to the gas network, peat bogs, and areas which have banned the consumption of bituminous coal also affect gas connections. Variations in socioeconomic and dwelling characteristics at area level can also help explain connections to the gas network. A better understanding of this variation is crucial in designing targeted policies and can aid network expansion decisions. (C) 2018 The Authors.

So far, decomposition analyses of the drivers of national CO2 emissions have typically considered the combined energy mix as an explanatory factor without an explicit consideration or separation of renewables. As the cost of renewables continues to decrease, it becomes increasingly relevant to track their role in CO2 emission trends. Index decomposition analysis, in particular, provides a simple approach for doing so using publicly available data. We look to the U.S. as a case study, highlighting differences with the more detailed but also more complex structural decomposition analysis. Between 2007 and 2013, U.S. CO2 emissions decreased by around 10% a decline not seen since the oil crisis of 1979. Prior analyses have identified the shale gas boom and the economic recession as the main explanatory factors. However, by decomposing the fuel mix effect, we conclude that renewables played an equally important role as natural gas in reducing CO2 emissions between 2007 and 2013: renewables decreased total emissions by 2.3-3.3%, roughly matching the 2.5-3.6% contribution from the shift to natural gas, compared with 0.6-1.5% for nuclear energy.","[Mohlin, Kristina; Camuzeaux, Jonathan R.] EDF, 257 Pk Ave South, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Muller, Adrian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich ETHZ, IED, Dept Environm Syst Sci, SOL F 7,Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schneider, Marius] South Pole, Technopk Str 1, CH-8005 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wagner, Gernot] Harvard Univ, Ctr Environm, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Harvard University,"Mohlin, K (通讯作者)，EDF, 257 Pk Ave South, New York, NY 10010 USA.",kmohlin@edf.org; jcamuzeaux@edf.org; amueller@env.ethz.ch; m.schneider@southpole.com; gwagner@fas.harvard.edu,,"Muller, Adrian/0000-0001-7232-9399",,,,,41,29,31,2,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,290,296,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.006,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200031,0

Incentives such as Feed-in Tariffs and Net Metering are seen as key policies to achieve this objective. While the Feed-in Tariff scheme has been widely applied in the past, it has now become less justified mainly due to the sharp decline of the PV system costs. Consequently, the Net Metering scheme is being adopted in several countries, such as Brazil, where it has is in force since 2012. In this context, this paper aims to estimate the minimum monthly residential demand for prosumers located in the different distribution concession areas in the interconnected Brazilian system that ensures the economic viability of the installation of PV systems. In addition, the potential penetration of PV based distributed generation (DG) in residential buildings is also estimated. This study was conducted for the entire Brazilian interconnected system and it demonstrates that the integration of distributed PV systems is technical-economic feasible in several regions of the country reinforcing the role of the distributed solar energy in the diversification of Brazilian electricity matrix.","[Vilaca Gomes, P.; Knak Neto, N.; Carvalho, L.; Sumaili, J.; Saraiva, J.

The impacts of drivers' operating behaviors, charger network coverage, BEV range, vehicle costs, and energy prices are taken into account. A two-stage optimization model is proposed, which describes the interplay between the government subsidy scheme and taxi drivers' acceptance of BEVs. To quantify drivers' acceptance, a data-driven microsimulation model is used to simulate driving and charging activities based on GPS trajectory data collected from conventional gasoline taxis in Changsha, China. The optimal government subsidy scheme is solved using the genetic algorithm. The key findings include: (1) detour for charging is inevitable for BEV taxis and would cause significant disruption in operational activities, especially for small-range BEVs (e.g. 150 km). (2) Subsidizing on vehicle purchase is necessary, and the subsidy intensity is expected to maintain at the current level to achieve an electrification goal of more than 50%. The government should provide financial support for public charging exclusive of vehicle purchase. (3) Different taxi drivers might prefer different BEV ranges, thereby they should be allowed to select from diversified BEV models, instead of deploying a single vehicle model for the entire taxi fleet.","[Yang, Jie] Southeast Univ, Dev Res Inst Transportat Governed Law, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dong, Jing; Hu, Liang] Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Southeast University - China; Iowa State University,"Yang, J (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Law, 2 Sipailou, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jieyang@seu.edu.cn,"Hu, Liang/AAB-5866-2019","Hu, Liang/0000-0001-6351-8542; Dong-O'Brien, Jing/0000-0002-7304-8430",Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China [14FXC001]; Oak Ridge National Lab,Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China; Oak Ridge National Lab,The first author is supported by the Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China under project NO. 14FXC001.

This, coupled with rapid economic and population growth, is believed to have contributed to the rapid growth in domestic energy demand and, recently, affected the government budget in the face of low international oil prices. In December 2015, Saudi Arabia announced increases in domestic energy prices. This paper therefore considers the impacts, focusing on gasoline, by estimating a demand function and using it to estimate the change in social welfare. Gasoline demand is found to be price inelastic suggesting that it may be difficult for the Saudi government to limit future growth in gasoline consumption using only increases in the administered price of gasoline. Thus, limiting future gasoline consumption in the KSA might require improved energy efficiency of passenger cars, increased energy awareness by drivers through education and marketing campaigns, and the provision of alternative transport modes within cities. Although the announced gasoline price increase is not expected to reduce demand considerably, it can deliver estimated welfare increases of up to 1.66 billion 2010 US$ (similar to 6.23 billion 2010 Saudi Arabian Riyals), which is around 0.26% of Saudi gross domestic product.","[Atalla, Tarek N.; Gasim, Anwar A.; Hunt, Lester C.] KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Hunt, Lester C.] Univ Portsmouth, Econ & Finance, Portsmouth, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"Gasim, AA (通讯作者)，KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Anwar.Gasim@kapsarc.org,,"Gasim, Anwar/0000-0003-3642-7287",,,,,72,34,36,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,123,133,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.047,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800013,0

Content-wise the study finds that German city regions are fairly monocentric, as all identified subcentres are of local relevance only.

While literature reviews are common in analysis of energy applications across many fields, systematic reviews are much rarer. Because research/policy interest in the application of renewable energy technologies and social Shousing appears to be growing, this review aims to bring together the disparate literature already available. This review set out to determine what are the common 1. Success Factors, 2. Barriers and 3. Motivations, evident in previous research surrounding the application of renewable energy technologies in social housing contexts? Common findings from 67 research cases were synthesised under 3 a priori themes of Motivations, Barriers and Success Factors. Many articles revolved around the user interface and potential barriers to integration of technology, particularly where user engagement is not carried out sufficiently. It is suggested that this emphasis reflects a broader trend in applying socio-technical approaches in the field of energy research.","[McCabe, Annie; Pojani, Dorina] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [van Groenou, Anthony Broese] Univ Tasmania, Coll Arts Law & Educ, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Tasmania,"McCabe, A (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",a.mccabe@uq.edu.au,"Pojani, Dorina/J-6690-2012; Pojani, Dorina/B-7888-2016","Pojani, Dorina/0000-0002-2018-6338",NSW Office of Environment and Heritage 'Growing Community Energy' program,NSW Office of Environment and Heritage 'Growing Community Energy' program,This research was supported by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage 'Growing Community Energy' program.

These developments suggest somewhat lower security costs may be associated with U.S. oil consumption. This analysis provides updated estimates of the security premiums for U.S. consumption of imported oil, U.S. consumption of domestically produced oil, and the substitution of imported oil for domestically produced oil. Estimates of the expected security costs of U.S. oil consumption are provided over the time horizon from 2015 to 2040, while taking into account projected world oil market conditions, the probabilities and sizes of world oil supply disruptions, the response of world oil prices to those supply disruptions, and the response of U.S. real GDP to those oil price shocks. The estimated oil security premiums suggest that U.S. oil security has become less of a policy concern.","[Brown, Stephen P.

Chinese dam developers allegedly dominate the global hydropower industry. Studies have been carried out on technology transfer in their undertakings in Africa and Asia. However, such work is lacking for Europe and Latin America. The aim of this paper is to identify the extent, drivers and inhibitors of technology transfer of Chinese dam developers' undertakings in Europe and Latin America. We find relatively few Chinese undertakings and thus limited evidence for technology transfer both in Europe and Latin America. Transfers identified are frequently mutual with the Chinese player transferring technology to the host country and vice versa. This transfer is driven by business considerations in Europe (costs, capacities) and Latin America (costs, lacking access to finance), but also geopolitical ones (Europe: creation of a trading area; Latin America: access to (natural) resources). It is impeded by Chinese dam developers' poor reputation regarding safeguards as well as (only in Latin America) protectionist policies and significant capacities of host country players. Our research provides transparency regarding the European and Latin American hydropower industry, while also highlighting that attempts to influence what kind of technology is transferred by Chinese dam developers may be worthwhile.","[Kirchherr, Julian] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kirchherr, Julian] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Matthews, Nathanial] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England",Utrecht University; University of Oxford; University of London; King's College London,"Kirchherr, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.kirchherr@uu.nl,"Dijkstra, Tim/Z-1876-2019",,"Department of Geography, King's College London","Department of Geography, King's College London","We would like to thank Mats-Philip Ahrenshop and Ralf van Santen for their contributions to this work as research assistants.

Three market designs are studied for this purpose: a competitive energy only market, a capacity market and a strategic reserve mechanism. A simulation model based on system dynamics is developed in order to represent investment decisions and analyse the behaviour of each market design. Risk aversion is modelled through the computation of Conditional Value at Risk. The results are discussed in terms of impact on the reliability (ability to limit shortages) and cost (total generation costs) of the studied market designs. When comparing the three market designs, the capacity market seems to be the least affected by the introduction of risk aversion, both in terms of cost and reliability. This result suggests that implementing a capacity market is preferable in order to deal with the adverse effects of risk aversion, given the simulations and parameters that were used.","[Abani, Ahmed Ousman; Hary, Nicolas] PSL Res Univ, CERNA Ctr Ind Econ, MINES ParisTech, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75006 Paris, France; [Abani, Ahmed Ousman; Hary, Nicolas] Deloitte France, 185 Ave Charles de Gaulle, F-92200 Neuilly Sur Seine, France; [Rious, Vincent; Saguan, Marcelo] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence Sch Regulat, Via Fontanelle 19, I-50014 Florence, Italy",Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited; European University Institute,"Abani, AO (通讯作者)，Deloitte France, 185 Ave Charles de Gaulle, F-92200 Neuilly Sur Seine, France.",ahmed.ousmanabani@mines-paristech.fr,,,Deloitte France,Deloitte France,"This research has benefited from the support of Microeconomix (now part of Deloitte France).

The requirements for optimization under such circumstances are often very strong, involving many design variables and constraints and a strict limitation of the number of function evaluations to a surprisingly small number (often around one thousand or less). Tuning optimization algorithms for such challenges has led to very good results obtained by variants of evolution strategies and of Bayesian optimization algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms are nowadays standard solvers for such applications. In the presentation, sample cases from industry are presented, and their challenges are discussed in more detail. Results of an experimental comparison of contemporary evolution strategies [1] on the black box optimization benchmark (BBOB) test function set for a small number of function evaluations are discussed, and further enhancements of contemporary evolution strategies are outlined. In addition, we will also briefly discuss the concept of Bayesian global optimization [2] and its connection with research in evolutionary strategies, motivated by a generalized infill criterion [3]. The corresponding algorithms typically combine so-called metamodels (i.e., datadriven nonlinear regression models using Gaussian process or random forests for regression) with state-of-the-art optimization algorithms for the identification of new sampling points, based on the above mentioned infill criterion. Essentially, the latter is also again a multimodal objective function defined over the metamodel, which in turn requires an optimizer to solve the optimization problem defined by the infill criterion. Our practical examples are motivated by industrial applications. A typical challenge is to find innovative solutions to a design optimization task. Based on a suitable optimization algorithm, which often also needs to deal with multiple, conflicting objectives, an application of this concept to an industrial design optimization task is discussed in the presentation. Discussing these applications and the variants of evolution strategies applied, the capabilities of these algorithms for optimization cases with a small number of function evaluations are illustrated.","[Back, Thomas] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Adv Comp Sci LIACS, Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Bäck, T (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Adv Comp Sci LIACS, Leiden, Netherlands.",t.h.w.baeck@liacs.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,5,7,,,,,,3,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000001,0

It begins by developing a new framework for place-based leadership around a vehicle metaphor. The emerging shift in leadership roles is explored through a comparison of three pairs of UK-based case studies. It concludes that in some partnerships local community representatives increasingly hold the more powerful leadership roles (driver, navigator) with public sector organizations relegated to the back-seat role of technical expert (mechanic), with a more subtle, yet still significant, influence on policy.","[Bowden, Alistair] Teesside Univ, Sch Business, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Bowden, Alistair] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Liddle, Joyce] Aix Marseilles Univ, CERGRAM, IMPGT, Aix En Provence, France",University of Teesside; Newcastle University - UK; Northumbria University; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Bowden, A (通讯作者)，Teesside Univ, Sch Business, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England.;Bowden, A (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",alistair.bowden@northumbria.ac.uk; joyce.liddle@univ-amu.fr,,"Bowden, Alistair/0000-0002-5464-3672",,,,,50,20,22,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We outline a suitable Bayesian inference procedure based on Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. We then apply the model to some major and Asian-Pacific cross rates against the U.S. dollar and find strong evidence supporting the existence of contagion effects and correlation drops during crises, closely in line with the stylized facts outlined in the contagion literature.

International wood and wood products market is constantly developing and traditional trade patterns are shaped by global megatrends such as demographic changes, social and economic development, climate change, and technological progress. A share of the EU industrial wood and wood products trade is nearly 50% of the global trade thus making the EU one of the world's strongest trading blocks. With such substantial volumes traded worldwide, the impact of global market development on the EU market is significant. The aim of this paper is to analyze the recent global wood and wood products market trends and to evaluate the contribution of the EU countries to the global trade in terms of traded volumes and values. In particular, the development of production, export, import and consumption of industrial wood, sawn wood, wood-based panels, pulp and paper and paperboard is analyzed. Based on these particular analyses, it is possible to identify the EU position from the global perspective. The results show that the EU as a key trading partner holds its long-term stable and important position in the global trade, however, the development of individual commodity markets shows significant differences thus making the region either net exporter or net importer of individual commodities.","[Dzian, Michal; Palus, Hubert; Supin, Mikulas; Parobek, Jan] Tech Univ Zvolen, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Dzian, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",michal.dzian@tuzvo.sk; palus@tuzvo.sk; supin@tuzvo.sk; parobek@tuzvo.sk,"Parobek, Jan/M-3686-2014; Paluš, Hubert/K-9135-2015","Parobek, Jan/0000-0002-3441-934X; Paluš, Hubert/0000-0002-1187-4286",,,,,18,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,484,491,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300064,0

The fuel of every ship floating on the Danube is some type of petroleum product. More attention needs to be paid to vessels due to the increased capacity of both the cargo area and the fuel tanks. Despite the risks that arise from the transport and handling of dangerous goods, dangerous things are an inherent part of everyday life. Natural and synthetic substances with specific properties may adversely affect human life and the environment. Therefore, the need to reduce the risks in the transport of dangerous goods is current. It is clear that the probability of occurrence of an emergency incident with ecologically negative consequences will never be zero. Creating recommendations to speed up rescue work at the scene can prevent further spread of the toxic substance and reduce the range of its dispersion in the flow of river.

The global movement of people leads to the fact that individual states become multicultural societies that are members of different cultures. Contacts in the context of international cooperation are constantly developing, which contributes to the continuous geographic growth of the labor market. It is therefore necessary to prepare human capital, in terms of its not only professional, linguistic, but also cultural aspects of individual people. Differences in cultural background and in the structure of values among different ethnic groups pose considerable risks of confrontations, which can be stimulated through global means of communication. It is, however, generally desirable for different cultures to get to know each other and to create the compliant and compromising relationships. The paper therefore presents the results of pilot research on intercultural communication at selected universities in the Czech Republic and presents the views of foreign and domestic students on the global environment of the Czech Republic and on interculturality at Czech universities. At the same time, there is a confrontation of the opinion spectrum of educators on intercultural relations between foreign and domestic students.","[Hes, Ales] Univ Finance & Adm Prague, Estonska 500, CZ-10100 Prague 10, Czech Republic",,"Hes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm Prague, Estonska 500, CZ-10100 Prague 10, Czech Republic.",ales.hes@mail.vsfs.cz,"Hes, Aleš/H-3788-2018",,University of Finance and Administration Prague [7427/2017/1],University of Finance and Administration Prague,This paper is an output of the science project student's specific research No. 7427/2017/1 University of Finance and Administration Prague under the title Development of Intercultural Communication at Selected Czech Universities.,,17,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,540,546,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300071,0

As a means of contributing some solutions to this puzzle, this paper examines a policy intervention that promotes regional development through a public-private-sector initiative that uses a network model to catalyze innovation-driven entrepreneurship. It focuses on a programme operated by the Alacrity Foundation in the region of Wales, UK. The paper argues that Alacrity's model offers a novel means of attempting to facilitate regional development through a programme that intertwines elements relating to entrepreneurship, innovation, and network policy and practice. It is novel in the sense that it seeks to de-risk the entrepreneurial and innovation process in a regional environment that is not traditionally strong in this respect. It is concluded that such programmes indicate that policy is beginning to embrace a number of ideas emerging from theoretical work on the drivers of regional innovation and growth.","[Huggins, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Ctr Econ Geog, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Waite, David] Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Policy Scotland & Urban Studies, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Munday, Max] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Welsh Econ Res Unit, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University; University of Glasgow; Cardiff University,"Huggins, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Ctr Econ Geog, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",HugginsR@cardiff.ac.uk; david.waite@glasgow.ac.uk; mundaymc@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,27,27,1,69,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Good governance can attract global activities. On the other hand, globalization can support an increase of the level of the governance. Good governance is a pre-condition for sustainable development at the regional, national, and global levels. Simultaneously, it is a component of the development of a society. Public administration authorities as governance bodies make many decisions. Most of the decisions are spatially oriented, i.e. they include a particular location. Thus, geographic information systems (GIS) are used as a tool for data processing. Web-based GIS systems are widely used as a tool offering an interactive presentation of spatial data to inhabitants. Some of the solutions can also allow citizens to take an active role, e. g. to submit some information like reporting faults in the city. These applications support several key attributes of good governance: participation, responsiveness, transparency, and accountability. The case study provides an overview of how Web-based GIS are used by municipalities to inform or include inhabitants into public activities and affairs. Two former districts in the Pardubicky region, the Czech Republic, are chosen for the case study. These two districts consist in total of 227 municipalities. The number of inhabitants varies from 52 to 90 335 so both very small and large municipalities are included. The covered municipalities use five different commercial Web-based GIS solutions. The solutions are compared from the point of view of available functionality and a level of inhabitant involvement. Possible links to the size of cities are discussed.

However, grid expansion projects often confront social acceptance issues. The public prefers high-voltage power lines (HVPLs) to be buried underground. Despite the perceived advantages of undergrounding, underground HVPLs can leave visible traces on the surface and are accompanied by electromagnetic field emissions. Given the importance of visual and health impacts on public acceptance of HVPLs, the present study investigates whether providing people with relevant information on these aspects of undergrounding influences people's perception. The results show that, after receiving this information, participants viewed underground HVPLs with lower acceptance, lower perceived benefits, higher perceived risks, and less positive feelings. Although public acceptance remained higher for underground HVPLs compared with overhead HVPLs, our study reveals that information provision reduces perceived differences between the two technologies. Furthermore, our results show that affective reactions to underground HVPLs have an indirect effect on public acceptance. We conclude that providing people with relevant information on possible drawbacks related to undergrounding is a necessary precondition for informed decision-making in the context of grid expansions.","[Lienert, Pascal; Sutterlin, Bernadette; Siegrist, Michael] ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Consumer Behav, Univ Str 22,CHN J 75-1, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Lienert, P (通讯作者)，ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Consumer Behav, Univ Str 22,CHN J 75-1, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",pascal.lienert@hest.ethz.ch,"Siegrist, Michael/A-1032-2008; Suetterlin, Bernadette/S-3265-2016","Lienert, Pascal/0000-0001-5283-9594; Suetterlin, Bernadette/0000-0001-9749-6660",Swiss Research Foundation for Electricity and Mobile Communication [B2013-05],Swiss Research Foundation for Electricity and Mobile Communication,Our research was funded by the Swiss Research Foundation for Electricity and Mobile Communication (Grant number: B2013-05).

The extremely dynamic social construction of capitalism is reproduced in the steady reconstitution of capital encompassing the organizational setup and disintegration of companies, their merger and crumbling in addition to their internal restructuring and dismissal. A particular aspect of capitalist underlying forces is the formulation of novel spatiality. The capacity of capital to move may allow it to establish gradually precarious types of work. In developed capitalist economies, the streamlining and transfer of manufacturing has taken dissimilar configurations and followed various rhythms. Individuals on provisional and casual contracts do not have divergent interests from people in permanent and unionized jobs. In periods of prosperity, temporary contracts are less precarious because bargaining capacity boosts and employment is more unproblematic to find.","[Negulescu, Iulian] Danubius Univ, Fac Commun & Int Relat, Galati Ave 3, Galati 800654, Romania; [Grecu, Iulia; Negurita, Octav] Spiru Haret Univ, Fac Law Sci & Econ Sci, Unirii St 32-34, Constanta 900532, Romania; [Sponte (Pistalu), Maria; Drugau-Constantin, Andreea] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Adm & Publ Management, Piata Romana 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Danubius University of Galati; Spiru Haret University; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Negurita, O (通讯作者)，Spiru Haret Univ, Fac Law Sci & Econ Sci, Unirii St 32-34, Constanta 900532, Romania.",iuliannegulescu@yahoo.com; iulia.grecu@spiruharet.ro; octav.negurita@spiruharet.ro; maria.sponte@yahoo.com; andreeadrugau@gmail.com,"Drugau-Constantin, Andreea Ligia/IQS-4413-2023; Grecu, Iulia/GYQ-9985-2022; Drugau-Constantin, Andreea Ligia/IQS-2020-2023",,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,263,268,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300035,0

Various definitions have been developed that are based on different approaches. Importantly, it is a topic in continuous evolution and the debate in the literature is now very open. It seems clear that the concept of audit quality has become, over the years, more and more important as a growing need was felt to ensure the truth and accuracy of the data contained in financial statements, ensuring the quality of financial information by transmitting confidence in this way to the markets and stakeholders who, in making decisions, legitimately rely on accounting records. In this paper, the definitions of quality that the literature has developed over the years will be presented and issues will be addressed related to the measurement of quality through proxies that researchers have used.

A conception of the 'Corporate Social Responsibility' motivates organizations and municipalities to contribute the sustainable development and urge better quality of life of their employees, local commonwealth and the society. Help of various tools does concrete realization of the recommended principles. There is, for example 'Agenda 21'with emphasis on planning the further development of the region in harmony with principles of the sustainable development and with emphasis on public involvement. Another method is 'CAF' for performing continuous self-assessment. Application of these principles at the level of municipalities' administration should contribute to the regional development and to the improvement of the quality of life of their citizens. Its own realization is done at bigger municipalities where specific workers exactly trained for it could do the agenda.

Already the development before the financial and economic crisis had shown slower economic and social convergence than expected. The financial and economic crisis has accelerated the process of divergence between EU member states, and this trend persists even today. One factor contributing to this process is the direction to the trade wars. We can conclude that, despite the visible improvement in a number of macroeconomic indicators, the differences between EU member states persist. The main objective of this paper is to verify the hypothesis that the process of divergence conditioned by trade wars tends to lead to the fragmentation of the EU integration group with a negative impact on socio-economic development. The partial objective of this paper will examine the causes of the tough customs policies of the EU integration group and other world economic players, while their emergence is an immediate reaction to the trade balance deficit. Enforcing tough customs policies is a return to protectionism as well as the prioritization of bilateral agreements before multilateral agreements. The development of selected indicators and their divergence will be examined by using the neoclassical concept of conditioned beta and sigma convergence.","[Stanek, Dusan; Polakova, Zdenka] Comenius Univ, Safarikovo C 6,POB 313, Bratislava 81000, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Polakova, Z (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Safarikovo C 6,POB 313, Bratislava 81000, Slovakia.",dusan.stanek@flaw.uniba.sk; zdenka.polakova@flaw.uniba.sk,,,"VEGA [2/0109/16, 1/0907/16]",VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science projects VEGA n. 2/0109/16 Institutional competitiveness in the light of changes in the external environment; VEGA n. 1/0907/16 Legal protection of participants in economic and legal relations with an emphasis on criminal law protection of creditors.,,15,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2821,2829,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300361,0

To maintain the ecological balance in class, human factors and environment factors should be paid special attention to. Secondly, both the teachers' and students' application ability of ICT should be improved, and students should learn to cooperate with classmates in learning.

From the point of view of sector differentiation, manufacturing and industrial enterprises were represented by 86 business entities and 121 were from the services sector. In terms of their business reach, there were 71 enterprises with a regional character, 76 national and 60 business entities were multinational. For the analysis a two-choice test and Fisher's exact test were used. The significance of the tested processes was determined based on their impact on the company profitability. For the medium-sized enterprises marketing and sales and services and supporting services were among the most significant processes of value-generating nature, followed by production, purchasing and output logistics. For the large companies the statistically significant processes included science and technology development, followed by marketing and sales, services and supporting services, input logistics and human resources management. Size differentiation has been proved as for the large enterprises significance of the business processes was more important than for the smaller size category.","[Vachal, Jan] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Dept Management, Okruzni 10, Czech Budejovice 37011, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Váchal, J (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Dept Management, Okruzni 10, Czech Budejovice 37011, Czech Republic.",vachal@mail.vste.cz,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,938,946,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300122,0

At present, with more than 650 participants, it has become the largest voluntary engagement initiative to disseminate core values of social responsibility through academic activity. Like most initiatives of this type, the platform draws on the voluntary commitment of the participating institutions to six UN Principles for Responsible Managerial Education (PRME), as well as their willingness to implement them within their educational programmes and communicate progress to stakeholders through the bi-annual Sharing Information on Progress (SIP) reports. This enables the recruitment of signatories all over the world. However, the participation is geographically uneven and there are huge differences in the intensity and outcomes of engagement between individual subscribing institutions. The paper explores the constraints to the implementation of PRME in the V4 region where the key values of business ethics and sustainability are not supported by a strong tradition. Firstly, it focuses on general participation numbers and patterns in V4 countries.

In order to address unobserved consumer heterogeneity, we employ a parametric adaptation of the maximum score methodology to model the household's choice of vehicles and driving decisions, allowing for disaggregated vehicle choices, vehicle-specific fixed effects, and interactions among the multiple vehicles in each household. We estimate average price elasticities of demand for gasoline at-0.74, with significant heterogeneity across space and demographics. We also find that rural and poor households bear the greater share of the burden from increasing taxes. Finally, we suggest a revenue recycling policy that helps mitigate the gasoline tax's resulting economic inequalities across household location and income. In addition, though a gasoline tax is an effective policy for reducing the externalities associated with driving, our policy also allows the government to retain some revenue from the tax even after the revenue recycling.

Our method differs from previous approaches to using satisfaction data for this purpose in that it can be used to directly fit and evaluate closed-form and non-parametric equivalence scales of any desired form. Its flexibility makes it easy to consider specific aspects such as income dependence or more specific information on household composition (such as whether household members live in a partner relationship). We estimate and evaluate a number of scales used in the literature. If the equivalence scale is assumed to be independent of income and to depend only on household size, we do not reject the validity of the widely used square-root scale at conventional significance levels. We also test GESE and GAESE restrictions (Donaldson and Pendakur, 2003, 2006) and investigate in detail to what extent household economies of scale depend on income. Our results suggest that the income dependence differs fundamentally across household types (rising economies of scale for family' households, falling economies of scale for multi-adult households without children and no income dependence for other households).","[Biewen, Martin] Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Juhasz, Andos] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Biewen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",martin.biewen@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,52,15,15,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

By applying a very unique panel data set on PM2.5 concentrations from 286 Chinese prefecture-level cities for 2004-2013, this study quantitatively assesses the impact of PM2.5 concentrations on real estate prices in China. The preferred empirical results demonstrate that: (1) PM2,5 pollutions have negatively significant effects on real estate prices in China. Specifically, 1 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2,5 concentrations is associated with a decrease of 46 RMB/m(2) in real estate prices on average. (2) The estimated effects differ widely across Chinese cities, with higher-ranking cities being more substantially impacted. Additionally, the negative effects become increasingly statistically significant and quantitatively large over time. (3) Finally, 1 mu g/m(3) increase in PM(2.)5 is responsible for about 5200 hundred million RMB losses in real estate valuations, approximately accounting for 0.9% GDP in 2013 of China.

Six factors are included in the analysis: gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (A), technology effect (TE), energy price (EP), industrial structure (IS), energy structure (ES) and foreign direct investment (FDI). The study period is divided into three stages: 1991-2002, 2003-2014 and 1991-2014. Improving T is the most significant way to decrease the emission intensity, followed by FDI. In each stage, the effects of A, EP, ES and FDI on the emission intensity mainly come from indirect contributions through TE and IS, and the effects of TE and IS arise primarily through direct contributions. Improving A promotes the development of TE in each stage and the adjustment of IS in 1991-2002 but increases the proportion of secondary industry in 2003-2014. A rising EP negatively affects TE in 2003-2014.

We used scenarios to investigate the relative influences of improving vehicle energy efficiency, promoting EV use, and increasing taxes for fossil fuels and CO2. We found that in the reference scenario, total transport energy consumption would increase to 636 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2050; that would result in 1602 million tons of CO2 emissions. In the comprehensive development scenario, transport energy consumption would peak at 497 Mtoe around 2045; the resulting CO2 emissions peak would be 1129 million tons of CO2 between 2040 and 2045. Both energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the transport sector would decline steadily after reaching their peak. We believe that the Chinese government should make greater efforts with vehicle fuel economy standards, in improving technological progress and market expansion of EVs, and in increasing taxes on traditional transport energy and CO2. This would contribute to reducing energy consumption and achieving a CO2 emissions peak in China's transport sector as soon as possible.","[Wang, Hailin; Ou, Xunmin; Zhang, Xiliang] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ 3E, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ou, Xunmin; Zhang, Xiliang] Tsinghua Univ, CAERC, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Zhang, XL (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, C306,Energy Sci Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhang_xl@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Ou, Xunmin/AFL-8427-2022; Zhang, Xi/HJH-1211-2023; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71690244, 71673165]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71690244 and 71673165).,,40,129,145,19,126,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,719,733,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.010,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400070,0

One of the principal reasons has been political resistance from incumbent fossil fuel industries. While numerous studies have demonstrated the influence of business actors across multiple policy domains, less work has examined the behaviour of business actors in individual energy-centric industries, namely the oil, gas, coal, utility and renewable industries. Accordingly, this paper examines the role of business actors in the US energy sector and asks what should policymakers do? Drawing on new empirical data, primarily semi-structured interviewers with business actors across the US energy sector, this paper argues that there are specific strategies policymakers can employ to help overcome the resistance from incumbent fossil fuel industries. Specifically these are to: entrench and build existing interests via targeted sector specific policies; exploit inter-industry and intra-industry divisions; and shift existing interests with policies that induce changes in industry investment and structure.","[Downie, Christian] Australian Natl Univ, RegNet, Sch Regulat & Global Governance, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Downie, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, RegNet, Sch Regulat & Global Governance, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",christian.downie@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,104,49,54,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,583,592,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.018,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800054,0

We find that this relationship varies with respect to areas with different compositions of educational attainment and race. While we find evidence of a premium in areas with higher share of college-educated individuals, we find no premium in low-educated areas. Based on the mechanisms above, these results suggest either that low-educated individuals and homosexuals diverge in their preferences for types of amenities, or that the open culture preference from buyers could be biased toward highly educated areas. Interestingly, the magnitude of the premium (or discount for areas with low shares of educated residents) is lower when the number of black residents increases. This suggests that the presence of blacks may help the 'openness' perception for areas with low levels of educational attainment, but also highlights differences in preferences for amenities between African-Americans and homosexuals.","[Leguizamon, J.

Most countries will in future have less freshwater available when inevitability the cost of thermal generation depends on water availability. A country's future energy costs will directly affect its future global competiveness. Many studies have identified that the solution to the UK's future energy policy's mismatch between thermal generation and freshwater availability is for the UK to make greater use of its seawater resource. The fact the UK with a long learning curve of successful nuclear coastal generation is not progressing coastal generation more enthusiastically raises fundamental policy questions. This paper considers the issues involved. A methodology is developed to assess how the UK's electricity generation portfolio will change in terms of the technologies adopted, and their cost, as access to seawater is varied under Q70 and Q95 freshwater conditions. It was found the emphasis UK energy policy gives to the competing demands of low cost electricity generation and environmental protection will have significant impacts on the cost and make-up of the UK's future electricity generation portfolio.","[Murrant, Daniel; Quinn, Andrew] Univ Birmingham, Sch Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Chapman, Lee] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Heaton, Chris] Inst Energy Technol, Loughborough LE11 3UZ, Leics, England",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham,"Murrant, D (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Sch Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",d.murrant@bham.ac.uk,"chapman, lee/AAE-8287-2020; Quinn, Andrew/B-7793-2008","chapman, lee/0000-0002-2837-8334; Quinn, Andrew/0000-0003-0254-4661",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Energy Technologies Institute; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1401259] Funding Source: researchfish,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Energy Technologies Institute; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Energy Technologies Institute.

Following the introduction of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive in 2012 the number of EEOs in Europe has grown from five schemes to now 16 EEGs in operation or planned across the EU. There is an emerging body of evidence on the costs and benefits of Energy Efficiency Obligations covering a wider range of EU countries, which offers an opportunity to improve our understanding of the economics of Energy Efficiency Obligations. In this paper, we draw on this new data and provide a) a comparative analysis of the costs and benefits of EEOs in a number of European countries, b) discuss the uncertainties and challenges around calculating the costs and benefits of Energy Efficiency Obligations, and c) provide a categorisation of the multiple benefits often overlooked in cost-benefit-analyses.","[Rosenow, Jan; Bayer, Edith] Regulatory Assistance Project, Rue Sci 23, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium; [Rosenow, Jan] Univ Sussex, Sussex Energy Grp, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Rosenow, Jan] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England",University of Sussex; University of Oxford,"Rosenow, J (通讯作者)，Regulatory Assistance Project, Rue Sci 23, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",jrosenow@raponline.org,"Rosenow, Jan/GOJ-9750-2022",,European Commission [ENER/C3/2015-632/S12.716302]; UK EPSRC through Centre for Innovation and Energy Demand (CIED) [EP/KO11790/1]; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); UK EPSRC through Centre for Innovation and Energy Demand (CIED)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),Parts of this paper are based on a report funded by the European Commission (contract number ENER/C3/2015-632/S12.716302).

To be effective alerts have to change behavior, but evidence that they do that is sparse. Indeed the majority of published studies fail to find a significant impact of alerts on the outcome behavior that they study. Alerts particularly seek to influence energetic cardiovascular outdoor pursuits. This study is the first to use administrative data to show that they are effective in reducing participation in such a pursuit (namely cycle use in Sydney, Australia), and to our knowledge the first to show that they are effective in changing any behavior in a non-US setting. We are careful to disentangle possible reactions to realised air quality from the 'pure', causal effect of the issuance of an alert. Our results suggest that when an air quality alert is issued, the amount of cycling is reduced by 14-35%, which is a substantial behavioral response. The results are robust to the inclusion of a battery of controls in various combinations, alternative estimation methods and non-linear specifications. We develop various sub-sample results, and also find evidence of alert fatigue. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, BEMD is used to decompose the European carbon and electricity prices into several pairs of simple modes with different timescales. Secondly, causality tests are performed at each pair of modes with a similar timescale. Significant but asymmetric causalities can be found that: the bidirectional linear causality turns to a unidirectional one running from the electricity price to the carbon price from phase I to phase III, whereas the nonlinear interaction enhances from insignificance to significance during the three phases. The causality at short-timescale is consistent with that of the original data, while the causalities at mid- and long-timescales are more diversified. The findings obtained show that the effect of carbon market on the electricity market is weakening, which indicates that it is needed to increase its efficiency by raising the carbon price. Moreover, a dynamic adjusting mechanism of emission allowances will be called for as well as the guidance aimed at different timescales in the future.","[Zhu, Bangzhu; Han, Dong] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Chevallier, Julien] Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Ave Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France; [Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Jinan University; IPAG Business School; Universite Paris-VIII; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Chevallier, J (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.;Zhu, BZ (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wpzbz@126.com; julien.chevallier@ipag.fr,"Chevallier, Julien/AAY-9567-2020","Chevallier, Julien/0000-0002-4423-9502; Chevallier, Julien/0000-0001-9109-0205","National Natural Science Foundation of China(NSFC) [71473180, 71201010, 71303174, 71303076, 71673083]; National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China [14AZD068, 15ZDA054, 16ZZD049]; Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar [[2016]95]; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guang dong [2014A030306031]; Soft Science Foundation of Guangdong [2014A070703062]; Social Science Foundation of Guangdong [GD14XYJ21]; Distinguished Young Teachers of Guangdong [[2014]145]; High-level Personnel Project of Guangdong [[2013]246]; Guangdong Key Base of Humanities and Social Science-Enterprise Development Research Institute; Institute of Resource, Environment and Sustainable Development Research; Guangzhou Key Base of Humanities and Social Science-Centre for Low Carbon Economic Research","National Natural Science Foundation of China(NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China; Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guang dong; Soft Science Foundation of Guangdong; Social Science Foundation of Guangdong; Distinguished Young Teachers of Guangdong; High-level Personnel Project of Guangdong; Guangdong Key Base of Humanities and Social Science-Enterprise Development Research Institute; Institute of Resource, Environment and Sustainable Development Research; Guangzhou Key Base of Humanities and Social Science-Centre for Low Carbon Economic Research","We thank the editor's and two reviewers' comments, which help us improve this study.

In a country in which hydropower historically accounts for more than 80% of power generation, the lack of water in the reservoirs leads to such crisis. The hypothesis of the present study is that the significant depletion of the reservoirs in Brazil from 2011 to 2015 was the result of a combination of factors: the divergence between the planning and execution of the expansion of power generation and transmission, the weakness of the NEWAVE dispatch software used by the government (a stochastic dual dynamic programming, which calculates how much thermal and hydroelectric energy should be generated to meet the current demand), and the below-average hydrology in 2014 and 2015. To avoid the issue of project planning in the projections made in this paper, the authors analyzed the projects that are under construction, study, or development and made some schedule adjustments. The NEWAVE software was also adjusted by reducing the producibility factor of dispatchable hydropower plants. As a result, in the scenario with Newave adjustments, the thermoelectric dispatch and thus the natural gas consumption were on average 65% higher.","[Rego, Erik Eduardo; Ribeiro, Celma de Oliveira; do Valle Costa, Oswaldo Luiz; Ho, Linda Lee] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Politecn, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Rego, EE (通讯作者)，Ave Prof Almeida Prado,Travessa 2,128, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",erikrego@usp.br; celma@usp.br; oswaldo@lac.usp.br; lindalee@usp.br,"Lee Ho, Linda/F-7881-2012; Ho, Linda Lee/AAI-9297-2021; Ribeiro, Celma Oliveira/N-7055-2016; COSTA, OSVALDO LUIZ DA/U-1398-2018; do Valle Costa, Oswaldo Luiz/G-3181-2010; Rego, Erik/J-7584-2012","Lee Ho, Linda/0000-0001-9984-8711; do Valle Costa, Oswaldo Luiz/0000-0002-0875-8698; Rego, Erik/0000-0002-3860-3005","FAPESP; CNPq; BG Brasil through the Research Centre for Gas Innovation, FAPESP Grant [2014/50279-4]; FAPESP/RCUK-NERC Grant [2015/50684-9]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [14/50279-4] Funding Source: FAPESP","FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); BG Brasil through the Research Centre for Gas Innovation, FAPESP Grant; FAPESP/RCUK-NERC Grant; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC))","The authors would like to acknowledge the sponsorship of FAPESP, CNPq and BG Brasil through the Research Centre for Gas Innovation, FAPESP Grant Proc. 2014/50279-4; as well as FAPESP/RCUK-NERC Grant Proc. 2015/50684-9.",,9,11,12,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,266,277,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.065,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600027,0

In particular, we quantify two approaches to diversify a country's supplier portfolio: by lowering the dependency on each supplier (portfolio diversification) and by having embodied energy suppliers that are different from its direct energy suppliers (portfolio differentiation). We examine possibilities for strategic utilization of embodied energy trade to compensate for low diversity of direct energy trade for three types of fossil resources: coal, oil, and gas. We find that the diversity of embodied energy import is much greater than that of direct energy import. Of the three energy resources, coal enables countries to adopt portfolio diversification and portfolio differentiation more than gas and oil. Our results suggest embodied energy can be considered as a transfer of energy resources across national borders that can directly benefit from the diversity of the world energy production by skipping the limited diversity of the world energy export.","[Sato, Masahiro] Govt Japan, Cabinet Off, Tokyo, Japan; [Kharrazi, Ali; Nakayama, Hirofumi; Yarime, Masaru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy GraSPP, Tokyo, Japan; [Kharrazi, Ali] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Adv Syst Anal Program, Laxenburg, Austria; [Nakayama, Hirofumi] InterGreen Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Kraines, Steven] Tokyo City Univ, Fac Liberal Arts & Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Yarime, Masaru] UCL, Dept Sci Technol Engn & Publ Policy STEaPP, London, England; [Yarime, Masaru] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Tokyo; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Tokyo City University; University of London; University College London; City University of Hong Kong,"Sato, M (通讯作者)，Govt Japan, Cabinet Off, Tokyo, Japan.",contact@intergreen.jp; ali@pp.u-tokyo.ac.jp; hirofumi.nakayama@intergreen.jp; kraines@tcu.ac.jp; myarime@cityu.edu.hk,"Sato, Masahiro/U-2422-2019; Yarime, Masaru/E-7628-2010; Kharrazi, Ali/M-4097-2018; Kraines, Steven/GQH-3201-2022","Yarime, Masaru/0000-0001-8048-7354; Kharrazi, Ali/0000-0002-5881-2568; Sato, Masahiro/0000-0001-9679-5212; Kraines, Steven/0000-0002-4406-9099","Ministry of the Environment, Japan; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H02015] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors are grateful to the Ministry of the Environment, Japan for providing Environment Research and Technology Development Fund to conduct this research in S-11 Project.",,57,15,16,4,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,41,52,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.024,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900005,0

However, a unified framework for estimating their costs and potentials is still needed due to the wide technology choices, especially considering their economic feasibility under fuel and carbon price uncertainties. Therefore, this study has employed a bottom-up approach to analyze the costs and potentials of 32 key technologies' new promotions during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), which combines the conservation supply curve (CSC) approach and break-even analysis. Findings show that (1) these 32 technologies have a total coal conservation potential of 275.77 Mt with a cost of 238.82 billion yuan, and their break-even coal price is 866 yuan/ton. (2) steam-water circulation system has the largest energy conservation potential in the coal-fired power industry. (3) considering the co-benefits will facilitate these technologies' promotions, because their break-even coal prices will decrease by 2.35 yuan/ton when the carbon prices increase by 1 yuan/ton. (4) discount rates have the largest impacts on the technologies' cost-effectiveness, while the future generation level affect their energy conservation potentials most.","[Chen, Hao; Kang, Jia-Ning; Liao, Hua; Tang, Bao-Jun; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hao; Kang, Jia-Ning; Liao, Hua; Tang, Bao-Jun; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hao; Kang, Jia-Ning; Liao, Hua; Tang, Bao-Jun; Wei, Yi-Ming] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hao] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, EPRG, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; University of Cambridge,"Wei, YM (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",chenhao9133@126.com; jennykang1118@gmail.com; liaohua55@163.com; tbj@bit.edu.cn; wei@bit.edu.cn,"Liao, Hua/C-4931-2012","Liao, Hua/0000-0002-4835-927X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71521002, 71273031, 71573013]; China's National Key R D Program [2016YFA0602603]; China Scholarship Council (CSC)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China's National Key R D Program; China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71521002, 71273031 and 71573013], China's National Key R & D Program (2016YFA0602603) and China Scholarship Council (CSC).

We use this major historical event to study the persistence of population shocks at the city level. We find that the Reconquest had an average significant negative effect on the relative and log-scale population of the main Iberian cities even after controlling for a large set of country- and city-specific geographical and economic indicators, as well as city-specific time trends. Nevertheless, our results show that this negative shock was relatively short-lived, vanishing on average within the first one hundred years after the onset of the Reconquest. These results suggest that the locational fundamentals that determined the size of Iberian cities before the Reconquest were more important determinants of the fate of these cities than the direct negative impact that the Reconquest may have had on their population. Our findings can also be interpreted as weak evidence on the negative effect that war and conflict can have on urban population.","[Cuberes, David] Clark Univ, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Gonzalez-Val, Rafael] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Gonzalez-Val, Rafael] Univ Barcelona, IEB, Fac Econ & Empresa, C John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Clark University; University of Zaragoza; University of Barcelona,"González-Val, R (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.;González-Val, R (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, IEB, Fac Econ & Empresa, C John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",dcuberes@clarku.edu; rafaelg@unizar.es,"Gonzalez Val, Rafael/B-8992-2015","Gonzalez Val, Rafael/0000-0002-2023-5726","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2013-45969-P, ECO2016-75941-R]; DGA (ADETRE research group); FEDER; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2013-45969-P, ECO2016-75941-R]; DGA (ADETRE research group); FEDER",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); DGA (ADETRE research group); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); DGA (ADETRE research group); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"Rafael Gonzalez-Val acknowledges financial support from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (ECO2013-45969-P and ECO2016-75941-R projects), the DGA (ADETRE research group) and FEDER.

This study examines social overhead capital and population agglomeration as drivers of total factor productivity (TFP) growth in Japan. The use of stochastic frontier analysis demonstrates that social overhead capital contributes to TFP growth and, especially, influences productive efficiency. Furthermore, the findings reveal that population agglomeration underpins TFP growth in regional economies. Empirical results also indicate that productive efficiency is high in regions where manufacturing is concentrated and that productive efficiency improves when internationally competitive manufacturers concentrate in regional economies. This study endorses the development of social overhead capital to spur Japan's regional TFP growth. As such, it indicates that providing social infrastructure and enhancing regional productivity are important strategies for the government to consider in its efforts to achieve sustainable regional growth.","[Otsuka, Akihiro] Yokohama City Univ, Assoc Int Arts & Sci, 22-2 Seto, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360027, Japan",Yokohama City University,"Otsuka, A (通讯作者)，Yokohama City Univ, Assoc Int Arts & Sci, 22-2 Seto, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360027, Japan.",otsuka@yokohama-cu.ac.jp,"Otsuka, Akihiro/I-2976-2014","Otsuka, Akihiro/0000-0001-7852-4590",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K17067]; Yokohama City University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K17067] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Yokohama City University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was funded by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant no. 15K17067).

The output from major Zambezi hydropower plants could decline by 10-20% under a drying climate, while wetting of the basin produces only a marginal increase. At a regional level, the increases in electricity generation costs are relatively small (less than 1% over the long term), but could reach 20-30% in the near term for hydro-dependent countries (e.g. Mozambique and Zambia). Because some hydropower could be displaced by coal, regional greenhouse gas emissions could increase by the equivalent of a large coal-fired power station. The risks to regional electricity systems highlight the need for strong cooperative governance arrangements to manage shared water resources in the region, which could be bolstered by recent political initiatives. Beyond the level of individual investments, a policy shift is needed to integrate climate change and upstream development considerations into national and regional electricity planning, supported by relevant tools. In addition, the potential for increased carbon emissions has implications for the commitments of southern African countries under the Paris Agreement to the UNFCCC.","[Spalding-Fecher, Randall] Carbon Limits AS, Ovre Vollgate 6, N-0158 Oslo, Norway; [Joyce, Brian] Stockholm Environm Inst US Ctr, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA USA; [Winkle, Harald] Univ Cape Town, Energy Res Ctr, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Spalding-Fecher, R (通讯作者)，Carbon Limits AS, Ovre Vollgate 6, N-0158 Oslo, Norway.",randall.spalding-fecher@gmail.com; brian.joyce@sei-us.org; harald.winkler@uct.ac.za,"Winkler, Harald/AAF-6226-2020","Winkler, Harald/0000-0002-5826-4071",World Bank [7170118],World Bank(The World Bank India),"Funding from the World Bank (7170118) for this research is gratefully acknowledged.

In contrast, we argue that information frictions between firms and regulators can reduce the efficiency of firms' compliance efforts when the interpretation of regulatory standards is uncertain. We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in distance between firms and their regulators to demonstrate this for a panel of community banks in the US. We find that banks located at greater distance from regulatory field offices face significantly higher administrative costs, at a rate of 20% of administrative costs per hour of travel time. These differences do not come with reduced compliance, are not driven by endogenous regulator choice, and are stable over time. Further, the costs borne by distant firms are negatively related to the scale of the jurisdiction in which they operate, suggesting that information spillovers between firms limit uncertainty about regulatory expectations.","[Wilson, Kristin] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Campus Box 3490,McColl 4612, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Veuger, Stan] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Econ Policy Studies, 1150 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Wilson, K (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Campus Box 3490,McColl 4612, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",kristin_wilson@unc.edu; stan.veuger@aei.org,,"Veuger, Stan/0000-0003-0775-2232",,,,,54,7,9,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

The main sources of differentials are attributed to workers' characteristics (people' effects), particularly academic and vocational qualifications, followed by occupational and industrial affiliations. On the other hand, differences in the attributes of local area labour markets (place' effects) explain only a small part of individual earnings differentials. The most relevant spatial attribute is local area human capital.

Starting from a Cobb-Douglas matching function with constant returns to scale (CRS) in each frictional micro market shows that on the aggregate level, a measure of mismatch is a crucial ingredient of the matching function and hence should not be ignored for forecasting hiring figures. Consequently, we allow the matching process to depend on the level of regional, qualificatory and occupational mismatch between unemployed and vacancies. In pseudo out-of-sample tests that account for the nested model environment, we find that forecasting models enhanced by a measure of mismatch significantly outperform their benchmark counterparts for all forecast horizons ranging between one month and a year. This is especially pronounced during and in the aftermath of the Great Recession where a low level of mismatch improved the possibility of unemployed to find a job again. The results show that imposing CRS helps improve forecast accuracy compared to unrestricted models.","[Hutter, Christian; Weber, Enzo] Inst Employment Res, Weddigenstr 20-22, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Weber, Enzo] Univ Regensburg, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Hutter, C (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Weddigenstr 20-22, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",christian.hutter@iab.de; enzo.weber@iab.de,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

It focuses on how Chinese investments are perceived compared to investments from other countries, and how the energy sector is perceived compared to other sectors. Media analysis, interviews with experts, and semi structured questionnaires were used as data sources. It was discovered that these three countries dislike foreign control over strategic assets and Chinese energy investments are seen as falling into this category. The discourse frames on the general level fluctuate between beneficial and threatening at both the political and economic levels, yet the benefits are seen as greater than any potential threats in all three countries. Energy security frames are only just beginning to be discussed within national discourses about Chinese energy investments. In Poland, the Chinese presence in the energy sector is framed as an issue of availability, affordability, and efficiency, and is related to Polish plans for maximizing efficient use of local coal resources. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, China is often perceived ideologically and only the energy frame of environmental stewardship is present in a minor way. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The hypothesis of Therborn about globalization waves predicts capital migration related to the globalization of information and new communication and information technologies. The virtual movement of financial resources and the monetization of the Internet are becoming increasingly important in connection with the financing of radical Islamist terror. While it is virtually impossible to separate the effects of globalization from other influences (religion, belief, history, dislocation, etc.), since information technology and globalization are tied to all human activities that are often conditioned, it can be hypothesized that the sixth wave of globalization Sense of Therborn hypothesis has a direct connection with the financing of Islamic extremism and ISIS. Particularly in the context of ISIS, it has gradually shifted from the initial forms of quasi-state funding focused on mineral resources mainly on an Iraqi and Syrian territory to forms of monetization of information. In this context, media propagation is being used, not only in ISIS, but also in its near vicinity (Turkey), but globally, especially because of the possible use of infrastructure in a more distant foreign country. The paper analyses and compares the possibilities of monetization of the global information environment in order to prove the connection with radical extremism. Based on the description and classification of forms of monetization of the information environment in a globalized environment, scenarios of financing extremism are modelled. This paper focuses on both direct and indirect forms of monetization that can be used on locally distributed web servers and maps on the basis of simulations of the possibility of capital migration.","[Botlik, Josef] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Comp & Math, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic; [Botlikova, Milena] OSVC, Detmarovice 1422, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Botlík, J (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Comp & Math, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",botlik@opf.slu.cz; botlikova.m@volny.cz,,,SGS project [19/2016],SGS project,This research is supported by the SGS project 19/2016 called Advanced Mining Methods and Simulation Techniques in Business Process Domain.,,26,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,194,201,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200026,0

The authors investigate eco-innovative activities of exporters according to their size, and determine the relationship between eco-innovations and export of enterprises of different sizes (small, medium, large) in the case of Ukraine. Two hypotheses are tested: the first one suggests that exporters are more environmentally innovative; the second one argues that size is positively correlated with the environmental technologies implementation. The results of econometric analysis using logit and probit models demonstrate that both hypotheses may be accepted in most cases, and the size of the company and its export activities really do influence the spread of environment-friendly technologies. The larger firm size has the more significantly foreign trade (especially export performance) impacts on their eco-innovations. Instead, export performance of small businesses has a little effect on eco-innovations, moreover, the size showed a negative effect on the eco-innovations. It might be explained by the fact that small businesses generally do not have the financial resources for the eco-innovations and choose to enter foreign markets less commonly.","[Hrabynskyi, Ihor; Horin, Nataliya; Ukrayinets, Liliya] Ivan Franko Natl Univ Lviv, 1 Univ Str, UA-79000 Lvov, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Ivan Franko National University Lviv,"Hrabynskyi, I (通讯作者)，Ivan Franko Natl Univ Lviv, 1 Univ Str, UA-79000 Lvov, Ukraine.",ihor.hrabynskyi@lnu.edu.ua; talya_gorin@yahoo.com; lilia.ukrainets@gmail.com,"Ukrainets, Lilia/ABA-2593-2021; Horin, Nataliya/AER-6333-2022; Ukrainets, Lilia/L-4763-2017","Ukrainets, Lilia/0000-0002-3436-5556; Horin, Nataliya/0000-0002-0036-6120;",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,709,716,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201026,0

CC infrastructures must be elastic and scalable for being accessible by huge population of users in different geographical locations. It means also that CC energy utilization systems must be modern and dynamic in order to reduce the cost of using the cloud services and resources. In this paper, we develop the novel energy saving strategies for resource allocation and task scheduling in computational clouds. We present the new energy aware scheduling policies and methods of scaling the virtual resources. The idea of the proposed models is based on Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) techniques of modulation of the power of microprocessors. Additionally, the proposed model enables the monitoring of the energy consumption, which is necessary for providing the scheduling under the security criterion. The efficiency of the proposed models has been justified in the simple empirical analysis. The obtained results show the need to maintain a balance between energy consumption and task schedule execution.","[Jakobik, Agnieszka; Grzonka, Daniel] Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Comp Sci, Warszawska St 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland; [Kolodziej, Joanna] Res & Acad Comp Network NASK, Kolska St 12, PL-01045 Warsaw, Poland",Cracow University of Technology; Research & Academic Computer Network (NASK),"Jakóbik, A (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Comp Sci, Warszawska St 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland.",agneskrok@gmail.com; grzonka.daniel@gmail.com; joanna.kolodziej68@gmail.com,"Fernández-Montes, Alejandro/E-6988-2010; Grzonka, Daniel/P-1494-2015; Jakobik, Agnieszka Krok/R-3435-2018","Fernández-Montes, Alejandro/0000-0002-2998-4950; Grzonka, Daniel/0000-0002-5905-0403; Jakobik, Agnieszka Krok/0000-0003-4568-3944",COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology),COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"This article is based upon work from COST Action IC1406 High-Performance Modelling and Simulation for Big Data Applications (cHiPSet), supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)",,31,9,9,0,3,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,583,590,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000087,0

The regions that were birthplaces of clusters became leaders of economic development. In the past years, we have witnessed boom in cluster development in all industrial, technological or service-oriented fields. In addition to fostering the competitiveness of regions, clusters lead to an improved quality of products and services and to a higher rate of innovations. This study identifies conditions necessary for the successful creation of clusters and the methods through which clusters are formed. We characterize the position of clusters within the national economy, state the advantages and disadvantages of such a cooperation, describe clusters' activities, and touch upon the cooperation of clusters within the EU.

The paper has two primary research aims: (i) to investigate the recent transformation of the Prato industrial district through the foundings and failure flows of its firms' populations, and (ii) to examine the co-evolution and reciprocal influences between the populations of the district's Italian and Chinese firms. Through an in-depth study of the foundings and failures that have occurred in Chinese and Italian textile and clothing firms over the last two decades, this study develops analysis of demographic and organisational ecology, and investigates the processes of legitimation and competition. The results of the study indicate that the district's Italian and Chinese firms experienced two distinct evolutionary phases during the research period: while the former declined, the latter saw development in spite of recent economic crises. The analyses also demonstrate how the evolution of Italian and Chinese populations moved in opposite directions: as the first failed, the second saw increases in the number of its foundings. This indicates the presence of a substitution effect between each firms' population at the district level.","[Lazzeretti, Luciana; Capone, Francesco] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Capone, F (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",francesco.capone@unifi.it,"Capone, Francesco/CAA-3109-2022","Lazzeretti, Luciana/0000-0002-9759-2289; Capone, Francesco/0000-0003-2000-3033",,,,,55,15,15,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Even though the focus of these auctions is the long term, there are short term issues involved which actual auction designs fail to include, resulting in an energy allocation that is not necessarily optimal for the system, a condition which becomes more evident in the presence of intermittent renewable technologies. A novel mechanism is formulated to obtain the optimal allocation in long term energy auctions, considering short term generation profiles from both intermittent and conventional base load technologies, and also their risk aversions. The proposed mechanism is developed and simulations are made for some scenarios in the Chilean power market, with different levels of renewable penetration. Significant cost savings are achieved for the final consumers in relation to energy purchases, in comparison with a mechanism that follows the demand profile. As more renewable intermittent capacity enters the power system it is evident the need for changes in the energy auctions allocation mechanisms, including elements to exploit the synergies among participants in the short term.","[Marambio, Rodrigo; Rudnick, Hugh] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Casilla 306,Correo 22, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Rudnick, H (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Casilla 306,Correo 22, Santiago, Chile.",rmarambi@uc.cl; hrudnick@ing.puc.cl,"Rudnick, Hugh/F-8281-2013",,,,,,18,4,6,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,29,40,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.09.053,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900004,0

The main prediction is that the strength of this relation is different for organizations with low versus high levels of geographical proximity. Proposed hypotheses are tested by using data collected within a community of hospital organizations serving more than 5 million residents in one of the largest Italian geographical regions. After controlling for internal resource complementarities and differences in organizational forms, behavioural orientations and institutional constraints among hospitals, this paper finds strong empirical support to the research hypotheses.","[Mascia, Daniele] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Publ Hlth, Rome, Italy; [Mascia, Daniele] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, ALTEMS Grad Sch Hlth Econ & Management, Rome, Italy; [Pallotti, Francesca] Univ Greenwich, Ctr Business Network Anal, Dept Int Business & Econ, London, England; [Angeli, Federica] Maastricht Univ, CAPHRI Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Maastricht, Netherlands",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; University of Greenwich; Maastricht University,"Mascia, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Publ Hlth, Rome, Italy.;Mascia, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, ALTEMS Grad Sch Hlth Econ & Management, Rome, Italy.",daniele.mascia@unicatt.it; f.pallotti@gre.ac.uk; federica.angeli@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Mascia, Daniele/AAB-9384-2022","Mascia, Daniele/0000-0002-9255-3520; Angeli, Federica/0000-0003-4010-3103; Pallotti, Francesca/0000-0002-1045-4722",,,,,88,18,20,4,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, simultaneously with the reduction of tariffs and in order to protect their national interests in the changing global environment, member states adjusted their trade policies toward a more frequent application of trade remedies. In this paper, the authors empirically examined the actual imposition cases of trade remedies by Japan. The study results demonstrate that anti-dumping duties are the most frequently applied trade remedies administrated on intermediate products, primarily from developing countries (China, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Pakistan). However, the number of these measures actually imposed by Japan is not comparable with the frequency of similar measures initiated against Japanese exporters abroad. Actual imposition cases of countervailing duties and safeguards remain low, nevertheless Japan shows concerns regarding the upward rising trend of safeguards in the world. The study conducted envisages a more frequent application of trade remedies by Japan due to the gradual increase in imports of manufactured goods from developing countries. The imports from the respective countries is expected to further expand in the context of a new strategic approach to emerging economies aiming at building new extensive networks of regional trade agreements as stipulated by the Strategy of the Global Outreach drafted by the Japanese government.","[Podoba, Zoia] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Gorshkov, Victor] Kaichi Int Univ, Fac Int Liberal Arts, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan",Saint Petersburg State University,"Podoba, Z (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.",z.podoba@spbu.ru; victor.gorshkov@kaichi.ac.jp,"Gorshkov, Victor/Y-6573-2018; Podoba, Zoia/M-8123-2015","Podoba, Zoia/0000-0003-1729-903X",,,,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2018,2025,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203057,0

The current research is based on the Othman-Pukka methodology (measurement of the university social performance), adapting it to the specific research needs. The research sample consists of annual reports of five same-year Business Administration study directions. The aim of the current paper is to analyse annual reports to establish how these reports reflect social engagement of the universities and enhance their competitiveness. The research method employed was qualitative deductive content analysis of the annual reports the university. It was concluded that the university employed a strategy of using social responsibility platform as a part of its response to the ever-changing demands and pressures, although there was some lack of public on-line reporting accessible to students to be. The current project consists of three stages. The first stage - identification and listing the statements of social responsibility activities in the annual reports. These activities then were coded according to J. Puukka's classification of social performance indicators in following way: activities for promotion of well-being (WEL), know-how (KNH), ownership of staff and students (OWN), or community involvement (COM). The second stage - a qualitative content analysis of annual reports.

The aim of this paper is to assess the status of Swedish public bus fleets towards decarbonization, and explore factors affecting regional performance variations and fuel choices. Environmental performance indicators such as renewable fuel shares, CO2 emissions, and energy efficiency are analyzed nationally and regionally. Fuel preferences and best practices are investigated through a survey and interviews with experts working with strategic planning at Public Transport Authorities. Almost 60% of the bus transport volume ran on renewables in 2014 compared to 8% in 2007, but regional variations are significant, partly due to factors such as driving conditions, bus and fuel types, typical trip lengths, and climatic conditions. However, there is no strong correlation between population densities or bus transport volume and the share of renewables achieved. This places political will, strategic planning and policies to promote public transport as key factors affecting renewable fuel deployment. Environmental factors are a priority when choosing fuels, while barriers to renewable fuels are mainly economic and political. Meanwhile, despite the overall progress, achievements in energy efficiency improvement are falling short in comparison to emissions reduction and adoption of renewable fuels, thus requiring further attention.

These methods are applied in the study of phenomena in which the shaping influences localization and spatial interactions. These include among others demographic processes. Population aging is a global phenomenon today, affecting all regions and almost all countries in the world. However, this process goes on very uneven. Deepest in Europe, where the lowest birth rate has been observed since almost the beginning of the last century. The aging process is a multifaceted phenomenon affected by, inter alia, the demographic and spatial nature of individuals. The application of spatial analysis to investigate this process will allow to establish existing relationships between the studied regions with respect to this phenomenon. It will allow not only general but also individual characteristics of similarities and differences of regions. The main objective of this paper is to attempt to model the phenomenon of spatial aging of European Union society. In the analyses two spatial models were taken into consideration: the spatial error model and spatial lag model. The first part of the paper presents a theoretical description of the tools included in the spatial analysis, while in the second one the results of the research and the conclusions are presented.

However, the long-term impacts of these event on citizens' opinions is unclear. This question assumes relevance especially in the context of rising citizen involvement in development and decision making. This study compiles and examines seven years of public opinion survey data to investigate whether there was a long-term change in support for nuclear energy in the US following the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. The analysis uses a logistic regression model to estimate the long-term trends in opinion on nuclear power among the US public and its major drivers. Results show that public support for nuclear energy has not rebounded to its pre-accident levels. While it isn't clear whether the accident in Fukushima was the only driving factor, there has been a gradual decline in support following the incident, suggesting that short-term negative changes in public support for nuclear power have long-term consequences for energy policy. These findings have implications for policymakers since short-term impacts can be mitigated but long-term opposition is more difficult to address, especially in the context of developing countries that are investing in nuclear energy to meet growing demand.","[Soni, Anmol] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Soni, Anmol] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Soni, A (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Publ Management & Policy, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, 3rd Floor,14 Marietta St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",asoni4@student.gsu.edu,,"Soni, Anmol/0000-0001-9193-5220",,,,,53,16,17,3,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,169,175,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.024,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700016,0

In light of the new stringent standards, this paper conducts a techno-economic policy evaluation of SO2 abatement options by building a system-wide marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) for India. An abatement cost model is developed, to estimate retrofit costs for three end-of-process (EOP) SO2 abatement technologies. A system-wide SO2 MACC is derived based on cost optimal allocation of EOP abatement technology to each boiler. Compliance with the new stricter emission standards is evaluated at 75% pollution reduction ( approximate to 4600 kt-SO2 reductions per year). Compliance with the new standard corresponds to a marginal abatement cost of INR 23,500 per ton of SO2 ( approximate to USD 368.50 per ton of SO2) and total system-wide abatement cost of INR 75 billion ( approximate to USD 1.2 billion) per year. Reduction in pollution is estimated to save 46,000 lives per year at the cost of about INR 1.63 million per life per year. Sensitivity analysis of the MAC curve shows that plant capacity utilization has the most significant impact on total lifetime compliance costs followed by equipment fixed cost, sorbent cost, and water cost in that order.","[Sugathan, Anish] Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Business Policy Area, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India; [Bhangale, Ritesh; Kansal, Vishal; Hulke, Unmil] Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Sugathan, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Ahmedabad, Business Policy Area, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India.",anishs@iima.ac.in,"Sugathan, Anish/AAW-2667-2021","Sugathan, Anish/0000-0003-0723-7679","SAP Labs India; Italy's Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea","SAP Labs India; Italy's Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea","The corresponding author is thankful to Harvard's Sustainability Science Program for hosting the India Initiative and acknowledges funding support from SAP Labs India, and from Italy's Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea.

A new system dynamics model has been created. The World Energy Model (WEM) is based on the World3 model (The Limits to Growth, Meadows et al., 2004) with climate change and energy production replacing generic pollution and resources factors. WEM also tracks global population, food production and industrial output out to the year 2100. This paper presents a series of WEM's projections; each of which represent broad sweeps of what the future may bring. All scenarios project that global industrial output will continue growing until 2100. Scenarios based on current energy trends lead to a 50% increase in the average cost of energy production and 2.4-2.7 degrees C of global warming by 2100. WEM projects that limiting global warming to 2 degrees C will reduce the industrial output growth rate by 0.1-0.2%. However, WEM also plots industrial decline by 2150 for cases of uncontrolled climate change or increased population growth. The general behaviour of WEM is far more stable than World3 but its results still support the call for a managed decline in society's ecological footprint.","[Ansell, Thomas; Cayzer, Steve] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Ansell, T (通讯作者)，Pinhead House,Old Barnstaple Rd, Bideford EX39 4NF, Devon, England.",tomansell1@hotmail.com,"Cayzer, Steve/GLU-8192-2022","Cayzer, Steve/0000-0002-9854-289X",University of Bath,University of Bath,This work was supported by the University of Bath,,57,33,34,3,48,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,514,525,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.053,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300048,0

Increasing investment in basic research may promote innovative energy technologies that improve energy efficiency. In this paper, the authors employ a stochastic frontier analysis to evaluate the impact of government funded research programs on improving national energy efficiency using estimates of energy efficiency based on the Shepherd energy distance function. The analysis used panel data from 30 provinces in China over the 2006-2015 period. Using the number of research programs funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) as a proxy, the results show that research funding has a significantly negative effect on energy inefficiency. The average energy efficiency continually increased from 2006 to 2015 in China, while the energy efficiency in the eastern region was higher than that in the central and western regions in most years. Moreover, a robustness test further validates and supports these findings.

The econometric analysis relies on a sector-based panel dataset for 15 EU countries over the time span 1995-2009. The empirical analysis shows that after accounting for the role played by sectoral output growth, investment and innovation activities, sectoral energy efficiency gains display a negative effect on employment growth, in particular in energy intensive industries. On the contrary, we find that public actions towards energy efficiency may produce positive effects on employment dynamics. In particular, the higher incidence of taxation on energy costs, the effort towards energy efficiency gains realized in the public sector industries and the implementation of a comprehensive policy mix for energy efficiency at the country level, are factors positively influencing employment growth. This evidence highlights the complexity of the nexus between energy efficiency and employment dynamics, suggesting that superior employment performances can be achieved when complementarity effects between productivity enhancing activities and energy efficiency actions are realized.","[Costantini, Valeria; Crespi, Francesco; Paglialunga, Elena] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy; [Costantini, Valeria; Crespi, Francesco] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, Nice, France; [Costantini, Valeria] Italian Interuniv Res Ctr Sustainabil Environm Ec, SEEDS, Turin, Italy; [Crespi, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Turin, Italy",Roma Tre University; Universite Cote d'Azur; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Costantini, V (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy.;Costantini, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG, Nice, France.;Costantini, V (通讯作者)，Italian Interuniv Res Ctr Sustainabil Environm Ec, SEEDS, Turin, Italy.",valeria.costantini@uniroma3.it,"Paglialunga, Elena/ABD-4495-2020; Paglialunga, Elena/ISB-5979-2023; Costantini, Valeria/I-8461-2016","Paglialunga, Elena/0000-0002-3874-0712; Costantini, Valeria/0000-0001-6249-3099; Crespi, Francesco/0000-0001-7657-7824",ENEA,"ENEA(ENEA, Italy)","The authors would like to thank Chiara Martini for her precious suggestions on a first version of this paper and Alessandro Palma for his work on dataset collection.

These states represents over 40% of U.S. emissions, making them the 4th or 5th largest emitter. Subnational compliance would give the Agreement a major boost particularly if they seek observer status and are exempted from sanction. Even without such rewards, the states have strong reasons to follow this path. As non-fossil fuel producing states, they have clear interests in developing local resources as the basis for their electricity sector.

The program treats single family and mobile homes, and multifamily buildings in all climate zones. The impact evaluations focused on Program Years (PYs) 2008 and 2010. The latter fell during the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) period. The program supported the weatherization of 98,000 units in PY 2008 and 332,000 units in PY 2010. It is estimated that the program saved 2.3 trillion Btus in PY 2008 and 7.6 trillion Btus in PY 2010. These savings achieve $420 million in energy cost savings with respect to PY 2008 and $1.2 billion in savings in PY 2010.

Two models are used for analysis, an aggregate input-output model covering all productive sectors and a detailed process model focusing on corn. On average, similar to 50% of agricultural, mining, and manufacturing goods traveled across state boundaries (10-50% for corn specifically). Neglecting the inter-state commodity flows can lead to large errors in state-level life cycle inventory results (up to 200-400%). It can also affect national average inventory results: depending on where corn is sourced from, an average unit of corn used as feed and feedstock in the US could have substantially different amounts of embodied water. Results further suggest that the more spatially variable of an environmental stressor, water use the more important it is to account for commodity flows. A better understanding of interregional commodity flows at subnational levels improves the predictive capability of life cycle models for better policy support.","[Yang, Yi] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Yang, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",yang1385@umn.edu,,,,,,,50,1,1,1,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,312,316,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.024,0.0,,,5,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000029,0

In this study, the production function method and panel variable coefficient model are used to estimate the boundary production function and coal capacities of 25 coal-producing provinces. The results predict that China's coal overcapacity will reach more than 0.803 billion tons by 2020. Then, a quota allocation model of coal overcapacity reduction among the provinces is proposed based on nonlinear programming, with the aim of minimizing the total cost of national overcapacity reduction. The results show that the total cost of national overcapacity reduction based on the optimal allocation scheme is 56.6695 billion yuan less than that based on the government allocation scheme. The Gini coefficient of the optimal allocation scheme is smaller than 0.3, indicating that this plan considers effectiveness and fairness. Furthermore, we calculate the optimal proportions for the provinces to reduce coal overcapacity based on different capacity utilizations and different national coal production control targets. The results show that the optimal proportions for most provinces are approximately the same under different conditions, which means the optimal allocation scheme is robust and efficient.","[Wang, Delu; Wan, Kaidi] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Song, Xuefeng] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Ind Engn, Nanjing 210003, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology; Nanjing University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, DL (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dlwang@cumt.edu.cn,"wang, jiajun/JRW-6032-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573252]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017XKQY085],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71573252) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2017XKQY085).,,28,27,28,4,54,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,170,181,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.003,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200018,0

However, energy efficiency investments may not yield the expected energy-savings due to the rebound effect concept, which leads to lower savings than expected when energy-efficiency increases. Using the standard OLS regression and auto regressive distributed lag cointegration (ARDL) approach, this paper provides estimates of the magnitude of the rebound effect for residential gas consumption in France. Using 1983-2015 annual time-series data, the methodology is based on estimates of the gas demand elasticity with respect to service price. The empirical findings indicate that the variables used in the model are cointegrated and suggest the presence of an obvious rebound effect in residential gas use. More specifically, estimates of the direct rebound effect in residential gas demand are approximately 53% in the short-run and approximately 60% in the long-run. Our findings reject the hypothesis of a backfire effect regarding residential gas use in France and hence suggest incorporating carbon taxation, energy efficiency and alternative energy in the formulation of an energy-saving policy to facilitate the transition towards a low-carbon economy in France.","[Belaid, Fateh] Paris Est Univ, Paris, France; [Belaid, Fateh; Bakaloglou, Salome] Sci & Tech Ctr Bldg, Montpellier, France; [Bakaloglou, Salome] Montpellier Univ, Montpellier, France; [Roubaud, David] MBS, Montpellier, France; [Roubaud, David] MRM, Montpellier, France",Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier,"Roubaud, D (通讯作者)，MBS, Montpellier, France.;Roubaud, D (通讯作者)，MRM, Montpellier, France.",fateh.belaid@cstb.fr; Salome.bakaloglou@cstb.fr; d.roubaud@montpellier-bs.com,"ROUBAUD, DAVID/ABA-8123-2020; BELAID, Fateh/AAO-6406-2020","ROUBAUD, DAVID/0000-0003-3827-6187; BELAID, Fateh/0000-0002-1077-2798",,,,,27,53,55,1,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,23,31,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.040,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800003,0

Companies, especially those with high energy consumption, are considered as key elements to improve energy efficiency. Although the Chinese government has made many related policies, there are still a substantial number of companies that have not adopted proactive energy-saving activities. Thus, it is important to study factors influencing firms' energy-saving behavior. Drawing on institutional theory, we build a model to explore the relationship between external pressures and firms' energy-saving behavior. Importantly, we investigated the role of top management support in linking external pressures to firms' energy-saving behavior and the moderating role of financial slack. The model was empirically examined using survey data collected from firms in China. Results show that top management support positively influences firms' energy-saving behavior. Command-and-control instruments, mimetic pressure and financial slack influence firms' energy-saving behavior through top management support, whereas incentive pressure and normative pressure have direct effects on firms' energy-saving behavior. Furthermore, financial slack positively moderates the effect of top management support on firms' energy-saving behavior. Based on the empirical results, policy implications on how to promote firms' energy-saving behavior are discussed.","[Zhang, Yixiang; Wei, Yimin] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yixiang] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yixiang] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yixiang] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Guanghui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhang, YX (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",isyxzhang@hotmail.com,"Zhang, Yixiang/ABC-4381-2020","Zhou, Guanghui/0000-0002-1145-5268; Zhang, Yixiang/0000-0003-2638-1668","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673025, 71203007, 71521002, 71402176, 91538113]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602504]; Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education,"This study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Reference Nos. 71673025, 71203007, 71521002, 71402176, and 91538113), National Key Research and Development Program of China (Reference No. 2016YFA0602504), and Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.",,66,82,86,9,114,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,230,238,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.003,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800024,0

The associated industrial process requires thermal energy typically produced using subsidized diesel or LPG. This analysis shows that 37.7% of the fuel costs of the analyzed industries are covered by the government in the form of subsidies. Hence, a major risk could be induced into this sector under a subsidy removal scenario. On this regard, the residual biomass generated during quinoa and lupin threshing represents an opportunity for the combined production of biochar for soil amendment and heat as an alternative to replace fossil fuels in the agro-industry sector. This analysis shows that the heat produced during the carbonization of the residual biomass from threshing exceeds the thermal energy required for saponins removal. A positive cash flow was verified in all the considered scenarios. However, the economic performance of the energy system is strongly related to the biochar price rather than the income in result of CO2 emissions trading and fuel costs savings. Furthermore, the current tax incentive represents a subsidy of 39.2% of the initial investment costs to implement a valorization infrastructure.","[Heredia Salgado, Mario A.; Tarelho, Luis A.

In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of the programme from the perspective of land transfer of energy-intensive industry, by using a difference-in-differences method. We also analyze the role of the local secretary, the de facto first-in-command official of local government. The results suggest that the pilot programme has come into play to a certain extent (a reduction of 26.271-29.158 ha' land transfer of energy-intensive industry), but the effect attenuates quickly over time. After considering the moderating role of the secretary, the greater promotion potential (younger than 54 years old, more than the third year of time in office, and working experience in the upper level) is found to have worsened the pilot programmes effect. Therefore, the key to performing the pilot programme's function lies in enhancing the weight of the environment-related indicators in the promotion assessment system.","[Tang, Pengcheng; Yang, Shuwang; Shen, Jun] China Univ Geosci, Econ & Management Coll, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Tang, Pengcheng; Yang, Shuwang; Shen, Jun] China Univ Geosci, Econ & Environm Res Ctr, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Tang, Pengcheng; Yang, Shuwang] Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Strateg Studies, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fu, Shuke] Wuhan Inst Technol, Sch Law & Business, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Wuhan; China University of Geosciences - Wuhan; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Wuhan Institute of Technology,"Yang, SW (通讯作者)，388 Lumo Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",15827032346@163.com,,,Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research in Ministry of Education [12JZD034]; Open Fund of Hubei Ecological Civilization Research Centre [SWSZK2015Z11]; China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201706410031],Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research in Ministry of Education; Open Fund of Hubei Ecological Civilization Research Centre; China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),We want to give our sincere gratitude to the editor and the anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions.

Thus, coal workers' livelihood have become an important social issue worthy of investigation. This study use the rough set-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution-rank-sum ratio (RS-TOPSIS-RSR) methodology and construct a composite coal miners' livelihood vulnerability index (CMLVI) to assess coal workers' livelihood vulnerability in 33 coal-mining cities. The results show that, from the time dimension perspective, the livelihood vulnerability of cities varies with time and even the same cities have different degrees in each of the three years. From the horizontal perspective, the coal miners' livelihood vulnerability level in comparatively developed mid-eastern region is significantly lower than that in the underdeveloped western and northeast regions of China. In addition, cities with the same level of livelihood vulnerability may have different vulnerability patterns and even low vulnerability cities may have high vulnerability in some dimensions. Based on the findings, we propose policy measures that aim to reduce the sensitivity of habitat conditions, improve the resilience of society, and enhance the stability of individuals in order to address livelihood problems.","[Wang, Delu; Wan, Kaidi] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Song, Xuefeng] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Ind Engn, Nanjing 210003, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology; Nanjing University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, DL (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dlwang@cumt.edu.cn,"wang, jiajun/JRW-6032-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573252]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017XKQY085],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71573252) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2017XKQY085).,,53,17,18,3,48,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,301,314,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.017,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800028,0

There is no standard approach to tackle this problem. The most common approach, which is known as the primary energy equivalent (PEE) approach, estimates emission reductions by computing the amount of CO2 emissions that would have been emitted from fossil fuels had renewables or nuclear energy not been used. Another approach, the Equal Share (ES) approach, estimates emission reductions based on the change in the share of non-fossil based energy. As the two approaches have some limitations, a more comprehensive approach based on index decomposition analysis (IDA) is proposed as an alternative, together with an extension to quantify substitution amongst non-fossil based sources. A comparison of the assumptions and features of all three approaches is presented. The study finds that IDA is favoured for its ability to identify policy intervention areas beyond a switch to cleaner energy and is well-suited for tracking of progress towards emission reduction targets and analysing future scenarios.","[Goh, Tian; Ang, B.

This claim is valid also for the stock markets. Especially the development on the smaller, less important stock markets is often affected by the events that occur on the bigger ones. The relations between the individual stock markets tend to grow in strength over time. The stock markets of the V4 countries (Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary) are small and relatively young and their direction is usually set by the bigger and more developed foreign stock markets. One of such markets is the German one. Germany is in a close geographical proximity to the V4 countries, it has the biggest economy and also one of the biggest stock markets in whole Europe. It is also one of the most important business partners of the V4 countries. This is why there are strong connections between the V4 and German economies as well as financial markets. This article focuses on the investigation of relations between the Slovak, Czech, Polish and Hungarian benchmark stock market indices (SAX, PX, WIG 20, BUX) and the German stock market index (DAX). The results show that the Czech, Hungarian and Polish stock market returns are Granger-caused by the German stock market returns.

The effective VAT collection is a very important part of the implementation of state budget in term of revenue structure for each state. The importance of tax collection is also confirmed by the European Union. A substantial part of the revenue structure in the Slovak state budget includes VAT. From the point of view of public finances, VAT contributes to the state budget more than all direct taxes; it means that this tax is extremely important. VAT is also a dominant tax for households for two reasons. Firstly, if VAT is the main source of public revenue, it means that it most contributes to the tax burden on households by reducing disposable income. Secondly, VAT is characterized by generality; it means that VAT is applied without exception to all households. The tax system of the Slovak Republic and the European Union is not perfect. Many tax fraudsters abuse and rob the state in the form of excessive VAT deductions. In the past, the Slovak Republic was one of the worst countries in the European Union in terms of tax collection efficiency, but we have seen some progress in recent years.","[Bielikova, Alzbeta; Bartkova, Hana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Bartková, H (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",alzbeta.bielikova@vsb.cz; hana.bartkova@vsb.cz,"Bartková, Hana/G-9794-2018",,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,994,1000,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300129,0

It seems that the most vulnerable social group in terms of digital exclusion are the seniors. This study shows selected aspects of the problem of digital inequality in Poland. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the scale of the digital divide of households of elderly people in recent years and to identify the socioeconomic factors that are conducive of digital exclusion. In order to extract the qualitative factors conducive to digital divide, logistic regression was carried out. The scale of digital exclusion of older people in Poland was compared with other European Union countries.

The performance of a public investment strategy is assessed in terms of how it integrates the economic, social and environmental priorities at local, regional, national and international levels with the interests and needs of community members. The impact generated by public investment programs can be analyzed from at least two perspectives. Thus, on the one hand, they analyze the way in which they contributed to the development of the field of activity and on the other hand, if they had positive or negative effects, difficult to anticipate, on the beneficiaries of the programs, respectively the community involved. Impact assessment has become an essential concern in theoretical and applied global research, with emphasis being placed on the social component of an investment project. These research directions are motivated by the fact that the public services must be oriented towards the satisfaction of the community members. This research is dedicated to the analysis of alternatives assessment of the social impact on the public investment, in order to increase their level of performance and align with international standards.

Understanding the value outdoor recreation communities place on access to open space is critical for informing policy decisions on land use including zoning and other restrictions, government open space purchases, and open space access points such as trailheads. In this article, we analyze the impact of trail access on property values in Ogden, Utah, using spatial hedonic pricing models. We consistently find substantial premiums for properties located closer to trailheads. Using a spatial Durbin error model, we find a 0.6% direct effect premium for each minute closer in driving time to the nearest trailhead, and a 1.4% premium when accounting for the total impact. We also find direct premiums between 0.4 and 1.9% for each minute closer in driving time to individual trailheads in this region. Additionally, homes adjacent to trailheads do not experience negative spillovers that homeowners may experience from increased traffic and congestion.","[Gnagey, Matthew; Grijalva, Therese] Weber State Univ, Goddard Sch Business & Econ, 1337 Edvalson St, Ogden, UT 84403 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University,"Gnagey, M (通讯作者)，Weber State Univ, Goddard Sch Business & Econ, 1337 Edvalson St, Ogden, UT 84403 USA.",mattgnagey@weber.edu,,"Grijalva, Therese/0000-0003-0618-3496; Gnagey, Matthew/0000-0001-9258-5680",,,,,54,2,3,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The proper motivation for learning, the environment in which a child grows, and the heredity factor also play an important role. Synchronizing individual motives of students with factors that affect the entire society leads educators to their better knowledge and to an adequate stimulation that can fulfill their personal ambitions and social goals.

At present, tourism is referred to as tourism with all the features, including the impact of globalization. Its production and consumption takes place in an international context and is often linked to the movement of people, goods, ideas, concepts and information across borders. As a result, many tourist aspects of consumers are transferred to other countries. It is heavily influenced by global trends in leisure and consumption of tourism products. Under this pressure, the tourist offer is globalized. The consequences of globalization lead to the prioritization of regional supply, but with significant elements of the globalization of consumption. The article deals with the trends in the area of tourism supply, gastronomy, accommodation facilities and their comparison with customer preferences on the basis of a survey of the project Tourism Trends in the Moravian-Silesian Region. A comparison is made with the development trends of tourism in the Czech Republic. In conclusion, an analysis of tourism trends in the Moravian-Silesian Region is presented on the supply side and there are recommendations for entrepreneurial subjects for creation and innovation of the offer.","[Kostkova, Miroslava] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Kostková, M (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Opava, Czech Republic.",kostkova@opf.slu.cz,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1171,1178,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300151,0

Weighted average costs of capital are particularly appropriate to select a sound investment project, either national or international, that takes into account a capital planning. The proportion of equity and debt available for the enterprise to finance the projects may vary depending on the type of project (property-oriented projects may require more debt to finance) and costs of capital are based on the specificity of the investment. However, the critical point is that the relative weights of equity and debt or other components of capital are based on the market value of each component, not on the accounting one. The essence is to calculate or estimate the weight of each component of the capital structure. Thus, the main aim of the paper is the comparison of the calculation of weighted average costs of capital in business environment in the context of the international market. It was found out that there is a diametrical difference between the calculations of weighted average costs of capital for publicly- traded companies and for private companies, which is proved by a realized case study accepting the principles of globalized business environment.","[Kubala, Pavol] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Kubala, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",p-kubala@hotmail.com,,,[VEGA 1/0428/17],,The contribution is an output of the scientific project VEGA 1/0428/17 Creation of new paradigms of financial management at the threshold of the 21st century in the conditions of the Slovak Republic.,,15,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1691,1698,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300216,0

Informal conflict management strategies used in exchange relationships are identified and analysed. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 22 small and medium-sized enterprise managers in an industrial district in the south-east of France are analysed. Results point to managers adopting accommodating behaviours in conflicts with clients and compromising and collaborative strategies with local partners. This research reveals the mobilization of local norms in the management of conflicts and also contributes to research concerning coopetition and the possibility that managers of small firms may both separate and integrate coopetition activities.","[Mathews, Martin] Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, Dept Strategy & Mkt, London, England",University of Westminster,"Mathews, M (通讯作者)，Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, Dept Strategy & Mkt, London, England.",m.mathews1@westminster.ac.uk,,,,,,,62,1,1,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.
