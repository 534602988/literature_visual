Our analysis, unlike previous studies, was able to obtain a representative sample of the population at the state level, which allowed us to estimate the cross-sectional effects of occupational licensing for each state. The state-level analysis demonstrates considerable variation in percentage of the workforce that has attained a license, and unlike minimum wages or unionization, licensing shows no regional patterns in the distribution of occupational licensing. The analysis also shows considerable variation in the influence of licensing on earnings across the states. The national estimates suggest that occupational licensing raises wages by about 11% after controlling for human capital and other observable characteristics. Finally, our analysis shows the influence of occupational regulation on wage inequality across the income distribution.","[Kleiner, Morris M.] Univ Minnesota, NBER, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kleiner, Morris M.] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA; [Vorotnikov, Evgeny] Fannie Mae, Washington, DC USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae),"Kleiner, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, NBER, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Kleiner, MM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA.",kleiner@umn.edu,,,,,,,24,35,42,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The most financially developed country takes greater risks because its financial intermediaries deal with funding problems better. In good times, the more financially developed country consumes more and runs a trade deficit financed by the higher financial income that it earns as compensation for taking greater risk.

First, we calculate Moran's Is for different market definitions and then we use a spatial Durbin model to determine the effect of price changes on quantity sold of own and competing products. As expected, the results show that competition is strongest between close substitutes; however, the relevant product markets for Swedish pharmaceuticals extend beyond close substitutes down to products included in the same class on the four-digit level of the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical system as defined by the World Health Organization. The spatial regression model further indicates that increases in the price of a product significantly lower quantity sold of that product and in the same time increase the quantity sold of competing products. For close substitutes (products belonging to the same class on the seven-digit level of the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical system), as well as for products that, without being close substitutes, belong to the same therapeutic/pharmacological/chemical subgroup (the same class on the five-digit level of the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical system), increased competition is also visible after 1 July 2009 when the latest policy changes with regards to pharmaceuticals have been implemented in Sweden.","[Mihaescu, Oana; Rudholm, Niklas] HUI Res, SE-10329 Stockholm, Sweden; [Mihaescu, Oana; Rudholm, Niklas] Dalarna Univ, Falun, Sweden",Dalarna University,"Mihaescu, O (通讯作者)，HUI Res, SE-10329 Stockholm, Sweden.",oana.mihaescu@huiresearch.se,,"Mihaescu, Oana/0000-0003-3362-5755",Swedish Competition Authority,Swedish Competition Authority,"We would also like to thank participants at the 12th International Workshop on Spatial Econometrics and Statistics in Orleans, France, for valuable comments and suggestions.

I use a regression discontinuity research design and find that 10 years after entry, less educated men entering the labor market at the beginning of the Great Depression earned 8.6 % less than those entering just one year prior. I find that the effect is larger (14.7 %) for those born in states more negatively affected by the Great Depression and close to zero for those born in states relatively less affected. The results indicate that the Great Depression had a persistent, negative impact on less-educated entrants that is not significantly different from that experienced by unlucky entrants of modern recessions.","[Moulton, Jeremy Grant] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Abernethy Hall,CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Moulton, JG (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Abernethy Hall,CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",moulton@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,57,2,2,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Moreover, a decomposition analysis of the equilibrium employment rate shows that the differences in the job finding rates explain 85 percent of the disabled employment gap. To explain these facts, we construct a labor market model with search intensity and matching frictions to identify the incentives and disincentives to work in Spain from the point of view of both disabled workers and employers. According to the model, the high employment rate gap observed between nondisabled and disabled individuals can be partly explained by the presence of a lower level of productivity among disabled individuals that discourages them from looking for jobs. In terms of policy interventions, sensitivity analysis shows that, since the disability condition is permanent, one-off subsidies in new hired positions have a much lower impact on the employment rate and welfare of disabled individuals than long-term policies.","[Silva, Jose I.] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain; [Silva, Jose I.] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Vall-Castello, Judit] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Res Econ & Hlth, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de Girona; University of Kent; Pompeu Fabra University,"Silva, JI (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, Campus Montilivi, Girona 17071, Spain.",jose.silva@udg.edu; judit.vall@upf.edu,"Silva, Jose I/G-3365-2015","Silva, Jose I/0000-0002-0425-6199; Vall castello, Judit/0000-0002-1925-1657",Upjohn Institute for Employment Research; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014SGR239]; Generalitat de Valencia [AICO/2016/38]; Recercaixa project,Upjohn Institute for Employment Research; Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Generalitat de Valencia; Recercaixa project,"We acknowledge financial support from the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.

Starting with a set of ninety terms used in the energy sector, the study uses a multistage filtering process to create combinations of keywords that best predict the volatility of crude oil (Brent and West Texas Intermediate), conventional gasoline (New York Harbor and US Gulf Coast), heating oil (New York Harbor), and natural gas prices. For each commodity, combinations that enhance GARCH most effectively are established as proxies of attention.

The results show some evidence of a moderate negative relationship between government spending and income inequality, which is strongest for social welfare and other social spending, and when using the Gini coefficient or the top income share as the measure of inequality. However, both the size and direction of the estimated relationship between government spending and income inequality is affected by a range of other factors, including the control variables and estimation method used.

However, improvements to building quality, public-service provision, and socio-economic characteristics are mostly outpacing those seen in the formal sector. Measures such as child health and school attendance have caught up or are on pace to catch up in the near future with the formal sector, while improvements in building quality and service provision are advancing more slowly. We find significant heterogeneity across the city, and in particular that central slums look to be 'stuck' with low-quality buildings and poor service provision, though not with low socio-economic indicators. We explore potential explanations for why slums located on highly prized land near the centre may be stuck with poor infrastructure.","[Bird, Julia] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Montebruno, Piero; Regan, Tanner] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bird, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",julia.bird@economics.ox.ac.uk; p.montebruno-bondi@lse.ac.uk; t.regan1@lse.ac.uk,"Montebruno, Piero/M-9796-2018","Montebruno, Piero/0000-0001-8010-7446; Bird, Julia/0000-0001-8547-9337",Africa Research Programme on Spatial Development of Cities at the LSE and Oxford - Multi Donor Trust Fund on Sustainable Urbanization of the World Bank; UK Department for International Development; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Africa Research Programme on Spatial Development of Cities at the LSE and Oxford - Multi Donor Trust Fund on Sustainable Urbanization of the World Bank; UK Department for International Development; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We gratefully acknowledge the support of an Africa Research Programme on Spatial Development of Cities at the LSE and Oxford, funded by the Multi Donor Trust Fund on Sustainable Urbanization of the World Bank and supported by the UK Department for International Development.",,21,34,39,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We use a sample of 52 countries for the period 1980-2011, and our main finding is that, at moderate levels of financial depth, further deepening increases the ratio of average growth to volatility; however, as financial depth increases, this relation reverts, and the rise in volatility overcomes that of economic growth. This result is obtained both in the medium and long run; however, the peak of the relation seems to be lower in the medium run (around 40%-55% of domestic credit/GDP) than in the long run (around 75%-99%). This suggests that increasing the level of domestic credit may intensify relative volatility in the medium term, but still raise relative long-term growth before the long-run threshold is achieved.","[da Silva, Sergio H.

In the former case, high wholesale prices may make fixed price retail customers unattractive, while in the latter, too little revenue is earned to justify the option's expense. Increased volatility can, under some circumstances, lower the value of the option, contrary to conventional real options theory.

The law also established compensation in case of divorce where one spouse sacrifices professional development or advancement for the good of the household. Using birth histories constructed from the Chilean Social Security Survey (Encuesta de Prevision Social-EPS) Panel 2002-2009, we investigate the effect of the divorce law on a woman's decision of when to have a first child. We find that the divorce law increases the hazard rate of having the first child by 61 % for more educated women, controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, length of marriage and the negative trend in fertility rates observed in Chile since the mid-1960s. We also find that a given percentage increase in a woman's potential income will increase the hazard rate by a greater percentage increase after the passage of the law.","[Gallegos, Jose V.] Univ Piura, Lima, Peru; [Ondrich, Jan I.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Universidad de Piura; Syracuse University,"Gallegos, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Piura, Lima, Peru.",jvgalleg@maxwell.syr.edu; jondrich@maxwell.syr.edu,,,,,,,34,2,2,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Even-and perhaps especially-when consumers are well-informed decision makers and insurance markets are highly competitive and offer choice, such markets may function inefficiently due to risk selection. Selection can cause markets to unravel with skyrocketing premiums and can cause consumers to be under- or overinsured. In its simplest form, adverse selection arises due to the tendency of those who expect to incur high health care costs in the future to be the most motivated purchasers. The costlier enrollees are more likely to become insured rather than to remain uninsured, and conditional on having health insurance, the costlier enrollees sort themselves to the more generous plans in the choice set. These dual problems represent the primary concerns for policymakers designing regulations for health insurance markets. In this essay, we review the theory and evidence concerning selection in competitive health insurance markets and discuss the common policy tools used to address the problems it creates. We emphasize the two markets that seem especially likely to be targets of reform in the short and medium term: Medicare Advantage (the private plan option available under Medicare) and the state-level individual insurance markets.","[Geruso, Michael] Univ Texas Austin, Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Layton, Timothy J.] Harvard Med Sch, Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA USA; [Geruso, Michael; Layton, Timothy J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Geruso, M (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Geruso, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mike.geruso@austin.utexas.edu; layton@hcp.med.harvard.edu,,,National Institute of Mental Health [R01-MH094290]; National Institute on Aging [P01-AG032952]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P2CHD042849]; Laura and John Arnold Foundation,National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Laura and John Arnold Foundation,"We thank Keith Ericson, Jon Gruber, Tom McGuire, Joe Newhouse, Dean Spears, and Steve Trejo for reviewing an earlier draft of this essay.

Waves of optimism and pessimism influence the decisions of investors and consumers, and they might therefore be interpreted as a driving force for the performance of the economy in the short term. In this context, two questions regarding the formation and evolution of psychological moods in an economic setting gain relevance: First, how can we model the process of transmission of sentiments across economic agents? Second, is this process capable of generating endogenous and persistent fluctuations? This paper answers these two questions by proposing a simple and intuitive continuous-time dynamic sentiment spreading model based on the rumor propagation literature. As agents contact with one another, endogenous fluctuations are likely to emerge, with trajectories of sentiment shares potentially exhibiting periodic cycles and chaotic behavior.","[Gomes, Orlando] ISCAL, Lisbon Accounting & Business Sch ISCAL IPL, Ave Miguel Bombarda 20, P-1069035 Lisbon, Portugal; [Gomes, Orlando] ISCAL, Business Res Unit BRU IUL, Ave Miguel Bombarda 20, P-1069035 Lisbon, Portugal; [Sprott, J.

In this regard, an import demand function is derived under the assuMption of non-separability, and is estimated using quarterly time series data from Turkey. The empirical results show that the assumption of non-separability cannot be rejected in the case of Turkey and the relative prices of non-tradable and tradable goods must be among the determinants of import demand in addition to the relative price of imports and real GDP. This result accordingly implies that recent increases in import expenditure are, to some extent, due to changes in the relative price structure in favour of non-tradable goods.","[Guncavdi, Oner; Ulengin, Burc] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Econ & Social Res Ctr, Suleyman Seba Cd 2, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Günçavdi, O (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Econ & Social Res Ctr, Suleyman Seba Cd 2, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",guncavdi@itu.edu.tr,"ULENGIN, BURC/ABD-2845-2020","ULENGIN, BURC/0000-0001-5276-8861",,,,,27,1,1,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

It shows both theoretically and empirically that whenever the technological frontier is at the top or bottom of the world distribution of a cultural value, there exists an observational equivalence between absolute cultural distances and cultural distances relative to the frontier, preventing the identification of its direct and barrier effects. Since the technological frontier usually has the right cultural values for development, it tends to be in the extremes of the distribution of cultural traits, generating observational equivalence and confounding the analysis. These results highlight the difficulty of disentangling the direct and barrier effects of culture. The empirical analysis finds suggestive evidence for direct effects of individualism and conformity with hierarchy, and barrier effects of hedonism. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper yields a new perspective on this question by quantifying the qualitative statements of economic analysts in the business press and at the Federal Reserve Board. We compare the statements of economic analysts about current and future conditions to what actually happened to the American economy in the Great Depression. While Depression-era economic forecasters were able to accurately assess what was happening contemporaneously in the economy, forecasters were persistently optimistic that the corner had been turned and that a strong recovery was imminent even as the economy continued to decline. This optimism was based on the use of analogies and forecasting rules-of-thumb of how an economy should behave, which were derived from the experience of previous recessions (Haney, 1931).

A real turn of events was caused by the Global Financial Crisis. Since then, as a consequence of the huge taxpayers' burden and the mutual reinforcing effect of sovereign and banking crises, the main course of bank regulation has become the elaboration and implementation of regulation with a macroprudential perspective. This article reviews the history of the international evolution of macroprudential regulation from the perspective of both the regulation's motivations and its conceptual and practical developments. Its main focus is the development of the ideas of a macroprudential perspective on prudential policy and the way these ideas eventually led to concrete experiences with macroprudential regulatory tools. As a conclusion, the author raises the question of whether the financial system has become more stable by implementing the current form of macroprudential regulation.","[Mero, Katalin] Budapest Business Sch, Dept Finance, Budapest, Hungary",Budapest Business University,"Méro, K (通讯作者)，Budapest Business Sch, Dept Finance, Budapest, Hungary.",mero.katalin@uni-bge.hu,"Mérő, Katalin/AAP-5820-2021","Mérő, Katalin/0000-0002-8180-4371",,,,,44,4,4,2,31,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Israel's population increased by 20% in the 1990s due to immigration from the former Soviet Union. These immigrants did not bring social capital that eroded the quality of Israel's institutional environment. We find that economic institutions' improved substantially over the decade. Our synthetic control methodology indicates that it is likely that the institutions improvement would not have occurred to the same degree without the mass migration.

This growth in the literature has not only added an enormous number of dimensions to the SaW debate, but the sheer scale of the expansion has challenged researchers to be able to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the available SaW indicators. In this work, we have proposed a hybrid method comprised of sophisticated scientometric analysis to summarise scientific developments in the massive text corpus of the SaW literature in conjunction with a more traditional literature review to categorise the fuzzy' details that remain. Scientometric analysis highlights that the developed OECD countries play a vital role in the development and applications of SaW indicators and we describe key developments in this regard via a range of graphical approaches. Using an extensive collection of existing SaW indicators, the analysis is then summarised in a matrix of ranked indicators which serve as a powerful tool to compare, contrast, filter and select indicators for SaW assessment with minimum redundancies between indicators. The approach undertaken in this study is intended to be flexible and can be extended and applied to other fields of research.","[Qasim, Mubashir] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Waikato,"Qasim, M (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand.",mubashir@iuj.ac.jp,,,New Zealand Marsden Fund,New Zealand Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)),I would like to thank my supervisors Professor Les Oxley and Dr Arthur Grimes for invaluable comments and support to improve this work.

This study adopts a discrete-time survival model in our empirical investigation and further executes several extensions and robustness checks to the baseline results. The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows: First, an exchange rate appreciation increases the likelihood of export market exit and decreases the probability of export market entry. Second, high productivity firms are less likely to exit from export markets and more likely to enter export markets in the period of exchange rate appreciation. Third, exchange rate appreciation decreases the likelihood of export market entering and increases the likelihood of export market exiting more for private-owned firms, young firms and non-eastern firms. Finally, other sources of heterogeneity, such as extensive margins, import demand elasticity, different destinations, U.S. dollar peg, and the liberalization of trading rights is also important to the effects of exchange rate changes.","[Huang, Xiaobing] Gannan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Gannan Normal University,"Huang, XB (通讯作者)，Gannan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",huangxiaobing1234@126.com,,,National Nature Science Foundation of China [71663003],National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The author thanks the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant NO: 71663003) for financial support.,,47,5,5,1,13,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,AUG 22,2017,11.0,,,,,,1,27,201723.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-23,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FF9SR,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000409358000001,0

The parametric analysis reveals that the upper-tail of CO2 emissions is characterized by Zipfs law. The power law in the upper-tail implies that large countries emit much of the CO2. When controlling for population, Zipfs law no longer holds, but per capita CO2 emissions still exhibit a strong Pareto upper tail. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In order to deal with this problem, the state-owned national supplier of natural gas (Pemex) implemented a system that restricts the amount of natural gas used by the manufacturing sector. With this information, we have constructed a shortage index that represents the percentage of natural gas restricted per month in each region. We quantify the effect of natural gas shortages on the manufacturing sector and GDP using a panel data model with state and time fixed effects. We estimate that the natural gas shortage reduced Mexican GDP annual growth rate by 0.28 percentage points in the second quarter of 2013. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose an extension that exploits information from the cross-sectional dimension. More specifically, we suggest jointly estimating multiple Chow and Lin (1971) equations, one for each cross-sectional unit (e.g. country), restricting the coefficients to be the same across units in order to interpolate unit-specific data. Using actual data on real GDP and industrial production for euro area countries we provide evidence that this approach can result in more accurate estimates of the high frequency time series for individual countries. The results suggest that the inclusion of time fixed effects, which is not feasible in standard single equation models, can be helpful in increasing accuracy of the resulting series.

Variations in Artists' Labor Supply,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMICS,"This paper assesses the relative impact of work for money or work for passion on Norwegian artists by examining artists' labor supply. Our contribution is twofold. The first is to test the work-preference model and the second is to investigate the impact of arts grants on artists' labor supply. The empirical specification draws two distinctions: between arts and non-arts income and between labor and non-labor income. Non-labor income is divided into three different sources: (1) spouse's income, (2) income from financial assets and social benefits, and (3) arts grants and subsidies. Our contribution adds to the literature by estimating the significance of these various income sources on the time allocated to arts work, non-arts work, and leisure. The results provide convincing evidence for the work-preference model, and ad hoc evidence shows that art grants have a significant positive effect on the supply of arts hours. This finding supports arts policy and shows the impact of art grants on artists' motivation to work on their arts. The causality of wages on supply is demonstrated by estimating the effects of wage shocks (grants) on arts labor supply using fixed-effect and difference-in-difference methods.","[Bille, Trine] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Loyland, Knut] Telemark Res Inst, Bo, Norway; [Holm, Anders] Western Univ, Dept Sociol, London, ON, Canada",Copenhagen Business School; Telemarksforsking; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Bille, T (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Copenhagen, Denmark.",tbi.mpp@cbs.dk,"Holm, Anders/JBS-7378-2023",,,,,,37,15,16,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2017,70.0,3,,,,,347,380,,10.1111/kykl.12141,0.0,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ8QN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404992000001,0

J,"Nguyen, HQ",,,,Huong Quynh Nguyen,,,Business reforms and total factor productivity in Vietnamese manufacturing,JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Vietnam; Total factor productivity dispersion; Doing business reforms,UNOBSERVABLES; INDUSTRY,"Vietnam implemented reforms in the 2000s to ease start-up of new businesses with dramatic effect on firm entry and market competition. This study examines firm level data for the period 2000-2010 to analyze total factor productivity (TFP) in connection with the reforms, adopting a semi-parametric technique developed by Wooldridge (2009) and Petrin and Levinsohn (2012) to measure TFP. Intensified competition is hypothesized to have driven convergence of TFP within industrial sectors as technologies best suited to Vietnamese market conditions became more widely implemented. The evidence strongly supports this hypothesis with convergence found for 16 of the 17 sectors analyzed. Further, comparison of TFP growth rates between the first and second half of the decade shows mixed results by sector and region. More often than not, TFP growth is seen to have slowed over time. This suggests that competition acted not only to push low TFP firms to exit the market or raise productivity, it also discouraged use of technologies that may have been overly advanced and not cost efficient for Vietnam.

For example, macro panel studies frequently are concerned with estimating the long-run impacts of fiscal policy, international aid, or foreign investment. Our analysis points out the hazards of this practice. We use Monte Carlo experiments to demonstrate that estimating long-run impacts from dynamic, models produces unreliable results. Biases can be substantial, sample ranges very wide, and hypothesis tests can be rendered useless in realistic data environments. There are three reasons for this poor performance. First, OLS estimates of the coefficient of a lagged dependent variable are downwardly biased in finite samples. Second, small biases in the estimate of the lagged, dependent variable coefficient are magnified in the calculation of long-run effects. And third, and perhaps most importantly, the statistical distribution associated with estimates of the LRP is complicated, heavy-tailed, and difficult to use for hypothesis testing. While many of the underlying problems have been long known in the literature, the continued widespread use of the associated empirical procedures suggests that researchers are unaware of the extent and severity of the estimation problems. This study aims to illustrate their practical importance for applied research.","[Reed, W.

J,"Simshauser, P",,,,"Simshauser, Paul",,,"Monopoly regulation, discontinuity & stranded assets",ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity utilities; Stranded assets,COSTS; DEPRECIATION; COMPETITION; RECOVERY,"For regulated electricity utilities, if trend-load growth enters a state of terminal decline through disruptive competition and costs are unable to contract at a similar rate, the regulatory outcomes that follow produce strikingly different results to an equivalent episode in a competitive market, where profits fall and assets are written-off. Under economic regulation, prices rise to offset volumetric losses and in the presence of disruptive competition, a destructive price spiral can ensue. In these circumstances, some component of the regulated utility's assets meet the definition of 'stranded'. Failure to deal with stranded assets will eventually, and needlessly, damage shareholders, consumers and welfare. However, the 'regulatory compact' makes this an especially complex area of economics. Zero recovery of stranded monopoly assets is not credible policy. A normative analysis of economics and law suggests full recovery is not credible either. In this article, asset stranding experience from the US is reviewed and a series of policy principles are established; viz. asset stranding is a case-by-case proposition involving recovery via non-bypassable pricing mechanisms, quantified and packaged as a partial Return of Capital, possibly financed by Transition Bonds on a time-limited basis. Financial risk tolerances of the utility and the stability of post-stranding consumer tariffs are important parameters that should guide the policy approach to asset stranding. But ultimately, asset stranding is a policy choice, not an analytical determination. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our empirical analyses reach the following conclusions. First, the static return and volatility spillovers analyses show that the Food is the only net receiver among all the commodity price indices. Second, the dynamic total return and volatility spillover accelerated growth in term of the index by roughly between 15 and 25% for four regional groups during the initiation of the QE1 and subsequently remained across the first two rounds of the U.S. QE. Nevertheless, both the total return and volatility spillover declined in the midst of the QE3 as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled the QE tapering due to the anticipated U.S. economic recovery. Third, the Energy and Metals components were the largest net transmitters of return and volatility spillovers during the U.S. QEs. A possible interpretation is that demand for energy and metals increase associated with an increase in economic activity that is triggered by the U.S. QEs. Last, almost all the sample commodity currencies acted as net receivers of return and volatility spillovers during the U.S. QEs, supporting the pass-through of commodities to commodity currencies.

I also show that non-majoritarian run-off rules may facilitate entry deterrence by established parties in settings where a plurality rule cannot. My results provide a striking counterpoint to a conventional wisdom embodied, most notably, in Duverger's Hypothesis that associates run-off rules with multi-party systems.

The revealed patterns of over- and undervaluation demonstrate how well suited the northern member states, in contrast to the southern states, were for the monetary union. Moreover, a relative persistent overvaluation for Greece and Portugal suggests that their ambition to join the euro reduced their competitiveness. The constructed EERs of the euro suggest the European Commission was able to set the initial value of the euro with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the EERs indicate a successive strengthening of the fundamental value of the euro versus the U.S. dollar from 1999 to 2015. The analysis shows a close correlation between the deviations from equilibrium and the events of Greece's sovereign debt crisis. In addition, the presented graphs show strong support for the PPP hypothesis.

This article explores the use of exclusive dealing arrangements by a monopoly retailer when purchasing a differentiated product from competing manufacturers. Interactions among the firms are modeled as a bargaining game. When consumers' brand preferences are weak and/or when one brand is preferred by a significant majority of consumers, it is more profitable for the retailer to negotiate an exclusive dealing arrangement with one of the manufacturers than to distribute both products. Also, it is more profitable for the retailer to induce exclusive dealing if the manufacturer of the excluded brand has a lot of bargaining power when negotiating with the retailer. If buyer-induced exclusive dealing reduces the retail price of the exclusive brand in order to encourage brand switching by consumers who favor the excluded brand, the practice may increase consumer welfare and even total welfare.","[Mills, David E.] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Mills, DE (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",mills@virginia.edu,"Mills, David/GXF-1821-2022",,Bankard Fund for Political Economy,Bankard Fund for Political Economy,"The author thanks the Bankard Fund for Political Economy for providing financial support for this research.

Using longitudinal data from seven waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) spanning 1991-2009, this study examines trends by birth cohort for persons born during 1912-54 on several dimensions of elderly health chronic diseases, physical function limitations, and excess weight. A fixed effects specification was used to distinguish trends in health, physical function, and weight common to all adult age groups and differential trends in these measures according to the person's birth year. The empirical results show that while there was a decline in physical function limitations over time, persons born in later years were more likely to experience a stroke and physical function limitations at older ages than were persons born earlier. A similar pattern occurred for stroke, but not for the other heath indicators. These findings are robust after accounting for sample attrition. The secular changes in health and function could have occurred for several reasons, Among the underlying mechanisms the data allow us to analyze, improved access to medical care and expanded health insurance coverage only had minor effects on observed changes in health and physical function.","[Yu, Yangyang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, 210 Room,Fenghuang Bldg,111 Wuchuan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Sloan, Frank A.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Duke University,"Sloan, FA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",yu.yangyang@mail.shufe.edu.cn; fsloan@duke.edu,,,National Science Foundation of China [71303150]; Ministry of Education of China [13YJC790188]; Shanghai Foundation of Philosophy Social Science [2014EJB002]; Shanghai Bureau of Education [ZZCD13003]; China Scholarship Council [201406485004],"National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Shanghai Foundation of Philosophy Social Science; Shanghai Bureau of Education; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","We thank Chee-Ruey Hsieh, Yiqun Chen, Jin Feng, Xinping Zhao, Dong Yu, Weiwei Ren for helpful comments.

Such contribution ceilings create a concave kink point in the budget set of workers and hence should generate a dip in the distribution of earnings around the ceiling through labour supply responses (the reverse of bunching expected at convex kink points) but such a dip is not observed empirically. This paper sets out a new approach to infer the incidence of SSCs that exploits the absence of this dip and the fact that (mechanically) the distributions of labour cost (earnings inclusive of all payroll taxes), gross earnings (net of employer payroll taxes) and net earnings (net of both employer and employee payroll taxes) cannot all be smooth around a kink. The other papers in this special issue apply the method to data for Germany, France, the Netherlands and the UK and all find that distribution of gross earnings is smooth around kinks (implying that the distributions of labour costs and net-of-tax earnings are not) even though the concept of gross earnings is irrelevant in the standard static model of labour supply and demand that dominates the public economics literature. This suggests that other features of the labour market, such as wage bargaining based on the gross earnings concept, are relevant for determining the incidence of SSCs.","[Alvaredo, Facundo; Breda, Thomas] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Alvaredo, Facundo] INET Oxford, Oxford, England; [Alvaredo, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Roantree, Barra] Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E 7AE, England; [Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, 530 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Paris School of Economics; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Roantree, B (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E 7AE, England.",alvaredo@pse.ens.fr; thomas.breda@ens.fr; barra_r@ifs.org.uk; saez@econ.berkeley.edu,,"Roantree, Barra/0000-0002-8738-8225","European Research Council [ERC-2010-AdG-269440-WSCWTBDS]; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy based at the Institute for Fiscal Studies [ES/M010147/1]; ESRC [ES/K006185/1]; NSF [SES-0134946]; Foundation Gould; French national agency for research (ANR); ESRC [ES/K006185/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006185/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish",European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy based at the Institute for Fiscal Studies(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Foundation Gould; French national agency for research (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Casper van Ewijk, Stuart Adam, Nicole Bosch, Antoine Bozio, David Card, Raj Chetty, Julien Grenet, Peter Haan, Luke Haywood, Michael Neumann and David Phillips, for helpful comments and discussions.

Partnering with the Salvation Army at Christmastime, we conducted a randomized field experiment placing bell ringers at one or both main entrances to a supermarket, making it easy or difficult to avoid the ask. Additionally, bell ringers either were silent or said please give. Making avoidance difficult increased both the rate of giving and donations. Paradoxically, the verbal ask dramatically increased giving but also led to dramatic avoidance. We argue that this illustrates sophisticated awareness of the empathy-altruism link: people avoid empathic stimulation to regulate their giving and guilt.","[Andreoni, James] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Andreoni, James] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rao, Justin M.] HomeAway Inc, Austin, TX USA; [Trachtman, Hannah] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; Yale University,"Andreoni, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;Andreoni, J (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Andreoni, James/ABD-4433-2021","Andreoni, James/0000-0003-0679-2371","National Science Foundation [SES-1427355]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1427355] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","A version of this paper constituted Trachtman's senior thesis at Harvard College, for which it was awarded the best thesis prize and summa cum laude honors.

Quantitatively, our estimates suggest that the historical rise in mineral prices (commodity super-cycle) might explain up to one-fourth of the average level of violence across African countries over the period. We then document how a fighting group's control of a mining area contributes to escalation from local to global violence.

My strategy involves comparing international marriage premiums received by two groups of Mexican immigrants who arrived before and after the cutoff date of eligibility. Both groups face similar language and culture related obstacles and have to adapt themselves to the new environment, except that unauthorized Mexican workers who arrived before 1982 could obtain legal status through the amnesty while those who arrived after the cutoff date obtained legal status through marriage to a US citizen. Instrumental variables estimates show a significantly larger intermarriage premium for Mexican immigrants who migrated after the cutoff date and no statistically significant intermarriage premium is found in the pre-1982 group. The 35 % premium gap indicates a large effect of intermarriage on immigrant labor market outcomes, operating primarily through an improvement of legal status.","[Chi, Miao] Drew Univ, Dept Econ & Business, 36 Madison Ave, Madison, NJ 07940 USA",Drew University,"Chi, M (通讯作者)，Drew Univ, Dept Econ & Business, 36 Madison Ave, Madison, NJ 07940 USA.",mchi@drew.edu,,,,,,,24,6,7,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We also find that both cost inefficiency and the number of private enterprises affect the profitability and welfare consequences. We then investigate the rationing policy on the production of social enterprise and show that output rationing is superior to market share rationing not only for the social concerns of the underprivileged but also for total social welfare, even though it is less attractive than subsidy policy.

Furthermore, the investigation seeks to observe any divergence in market efficiency between industry sectors that demonstrate differing economic performance across the period. Spanning a time period of 2000-2015, the data are split into three periods of distinct economic conditions: a pre-crisis period of relatively high growth, the GFC period of disruption and contraction, and a post-GFC period of relatively low growth. Five sector indices listed on the Australian Securities Exchange are analysed to search for evidence of market efficiency (Real Estate, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Materials, and Metals and Mining). A range of non-linear tests are applied in order to systematically investigate the structure of the market in each sector. The results highlight the cointegrated nature of non-linearity across related sectors, and also demonstrate that different industries within the same economy can reveal highly diverse patterns of non-linearity and market efficiency in response to financial crisis.","[Deo, Neha; Varua, Maria Estela] Western Sydney Univ, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Spong, Heath] Western Sydney Univ, Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW, Australia",Western Sydney University; Western Sydney University,"Spong, H (通讯作者)，Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Penrith, NSW, Australia.",h.spong@westernsydney.edu.au,,"Deo, Neha/0000-0003-2052-0364",,,,,40,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

The key dynamic element that drives the new results is that public goods are modeled as public capital; this changes the incentives to unify or divide countries.

We compare health care cost reductions with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) using a rich life cycle general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents. We evaluate a wide range of cot reductions ranging from 0.64% (realistic and feasible) to 29:5% (equivalence with OECD). Our results show that the ACA is more effective in reducing uninsured population than all cost reductions considered. This result holds throughout the life cycle and for the most fragile part of the population: the poorest, the less educated, and those with bad health. Realistic and feasible cost reductions are less welfare improving than the ACA. The increase of welfare induced by the reform is around 7.8 times higher than the increase provided by cost reductions. Besides, the poorer are more benefited than the richer after the reform, while the opposite occurs after cost reductions. Finally, to obtain the same welfare increase of the ACA, medical costs have to decrease by 5.21%, a very hard task. These results provide support for the ACA against opponents who might present cost reductions as alternatives.

Panel data are used to estimate the determinants of government bond spreads in three different time periods: before the crisis, during the global financial crisis, and during the European debt crisis. The econometric model includes interactions between the explanatory variables and the crisis dummies. This specification enables the coefficients to change during the crises. The empirical analysis confirms a statistically significant relationship between sovereign risk and macroeconomic fundamental variables. Additionally, the results suggest an increase in the importance of macroeconomic fundamentals during the financial crisis. The analysis also supports that sovereign credit ratings and exchange rate risk have a significant impact on government bond spreads.","[Gyodi, Kristof] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Gyódi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",kgyodi@coin.wne.uw.edu.pl,"Kristóf, Gyódi/ABG-1752-2021","Gyodi, Kristof/0000-0003-2999-8444",,,,,37,1,1,0,8,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

This paper offers a solution to this puzzle by developing a New Keynesian model with such a small but time-varying probability of disaster. We show that price stickiness, combined with an EIS smaller than unity, restores procyclical consumption and wages, while preserving countercyclical risk premia, in response to disaster risk shocks. The mechanism then provides a rationale for discount factor first- and second-moment (uncertainty) shocks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find that charitable donations are positively related to financial performance and firm value, which is consistent with the value-enhancement hypothesis. This positive effect on firm value is stronger for cash than in-kind donations. In contrast, political donations do not appear to enhance shareholder value, but rather tend to reflect agency problems, as they are higher for firms with poor internal corporate governance and strong managerial entrenchment.

We use a simple model to examine the impact of this change on information acquisition with two alternative assumptions: (1) Investors have symmetric awareness about the underlying uncertainties, or (2) this awareness is asymmetric among them. Under the first assumption, the change reduces information asymmetry among investors and induces acquisition of high-quality information. Under the second assumption, however, the reduction of information asymmetry may be limited, and information acquisition is either reduced or less efficient. Specifically, investors with high awareness may either acquire high-quality information at a higher cost or not acquire it; investors with low awareness only acquire low-quality information. The loss in overall information quality is greater when awareness asymmetry is moderate than when it is high or low; this causes information asymmetry between the insiders and outside investors as a whole. These results offer explanations for intriguing empirical findings regarding the effect of a recent accounting regulation (Regulation Fair Disclosure).","[Liu, Zhen] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, 415 Fronczak Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Liu, Z (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, 415 Fronczak Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",900910@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,2,2,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Accordingly, much research has been conducted on Latin business cycles, as well as the impact of the US on such fluctuations. Some research seeks to find how integrated cycles are in the US and Latin America, yielding conflicting results. We apply a new method to the question of business cycle synchronization between the US and nine Latin nations. We find that in the majority of cases integration has been rising in recent years. We also find, contrary to some previous studies, that integration does not appear to be affected by either the level of trade or of capital account openness. Finally, we find that the two countries that are dollarized - Ecuador and El Salvador - appear least integrated with the US. This last finding has potentially troubling implications in terms of the ability of these nations to adjust to asymmetric shocks vis-a-vis the US.","[Miles, William] Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, 1845 Fairmount, Wichita, KS 67260 USA",Wichita State University,"Miles, W (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, 1845 Fairmount, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",william.miles@wichita.edu,,"Miles, William/0000-0002-7788-3011",,,,,26,2,2,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

This paper seeks to assess information quality of online reviews using the TripAdvisor data for Korean hotels. We first estimate the review model developed by Dai, Jin, Lee, and Luca (2012) and show that high-quality reviews contain most of the information for the quality of hotels. Second, we assess the degree of distortions caused by fake reviews through numerical experiments and show that the distortions of fake reviews are serious. Third, we compare the simple average and weighted average aggregation methods. Weighted average method is better than simple average in finding the quality of hotels but it is more vulnerable to fake reviews. Fourth, we suggest excluding low-quality reviews to deal with fake reviews and show that the benefit of avoiding serious distortions from potentially fake reviews is greater than the cost of losing information from low-quality reviews.","[Song, Wonho] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Park, Sangkon] Korea Culture & Tourism Inst, Tourism Policy Res Off, 154 Geumnanghwa Ro, Seoul 07511, South Korea; [Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",whsong@cau.ac.kr; sgpark@kcti.re.kr; sharpjin@skku.edu,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887",,,,,37,7,7,1,33,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

To this end, the study applies conventional panel unit root tests and Sequential Panel Selection Model (SPSM) procedure based on the Panel KSS unit root with a Fourier function for robustness analysis. The results from conventional unit root test results indicate that per capita energy usage and electricity consumption are converging for all APEC countries, in line with improving living standards in APEC The findings also provide some support for policies to promote energy integration among APEC countries. According to SPSM analysis, evidence of energy convergence is found for 15 out of 19 APEC countries and evidence of electricity convergence is found for 17 out of 19 APEC countries. Pursuit of policies to achieve energy supply stability can move divergent countries toward convergence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Compared with the case in the absence of social networks, we first show in an economy where networks are equal in size that unemployment rate is lower. In terms of social welfare, social planner prefers workers becoming more selective than the decentralized equilibrium. When social networks differ in size, increasing the size difference is beneficial for unemployed workers with large networks but detrimental to those with small networks; in addition, the unemployment rate decreases with the size difference. However, because of the dilution effect, as the proportion of unemployed workers with large networks increases, it eventually results in losses for all unemployed workers, and the unemployment rate may follow a non-monotonic pattern.","[Zhang, Rui] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business,"Zhang, R (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.",ruizhangecon@163.com,,", Rui/0000-0003-2803-8820",Research and Innovation Centre of Metropolis Economic and Social Development (Capital University of Economics and Business); NSFC [71601131],Research and Innovation Centre of Metropolis Economic and Social Development (Capital University of Economics and Business); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Finally I would like to thank Research and Innovation Centre of Metropolis Economic and Social Development (Capital University of Economics and Business) and NSFC No. 71601131 for their financial supports.,,23,0,0,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6124,1935-1704,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This research presents an approach to quantify the economic value of variable renewable capacity and demonstrates its dependence on renewable deployment levels, regional resource endowments, fleet flexibility, and trade assumptions. It assesses economic and technical impacts of large-scale renewable penetration by linking two models, representing electric-sector investments and detailed operations. Model results for California and Texas suggest that operational constraints and costs of dispatchable generators (e.g., minimum load levels, ramping limits, startup costs) can impact renewable integration costs, but the temporal and spatial variability of solar and wind are larger determinants of their value. Restrictions on transmission and regional coordination in capacity planning and dispatch decrease the economic value of variable renewable energy, highlighting the potential roles of market design and trade. Energy storage is shown to be a valuable balancing asset at higher solar and wind penetration levels, but potential revenues diminish with increased storage deployment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A typical example is the exclusion of VoIP applications by telecom companies offering internet and voice services. A monopoly ISP may want to exclude a competing internet app if it is of inferior quality and the ISP cannot ask for a surcharge for its use. Competition between ISPs never leads to full app exclusion but it may lead to a fragmented internet where only one ISP offers the application. We show that, both in monopoly and duopoly, prohibiting the exclusion of the app and surcharges for its use does not always improve welfare. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, I analyze whether PLT dominates IT if the ability of the central bank to influence expectations is limited by model uncertainty. Specifically, I analyze how the characterization and performance of PLT and IT rules are impacted if private agents form expectations according to a model that deviates from the policy-maker's reference model. Using robust control to derive robust rules in such a situation, I find that the performance of PLT rules deteriorate faster than that of IT rules as the degree of misspecification increases. Nevertheless, the absolute decline in performance of the PLT rules is relatively small across alternative models that are statistically plausible.","[Cateau, Gino] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Cateau, G (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",gcateau@bank-banque-canada.ca,,"Cateau, Gino/0000-0001-8204-4557",,,,,22,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The results show that the extent of variation in VFIs across 898 municipalities can be explained by the level of per capita income, fiscal capacity, and demographic characteristics, as well as the central government's fiscal behavior that reflects fiscal constraints and policy preferences at the national level. Political affiliation does not appear to be a significant factor, but the results show lower VFIs when the mayor of a municipality belongs to the same party ruling the central government.

This letter explores and illustrates this issue by comparing the inflationary consequences of the same base expansion in the US following the collapse of Lehman Brothers with Germany's hyperinflation experience after WWI. A key factor explaining the vastly different inflation experiences between those two episodes is how the monetary expansion translated into demand. The Fed's base expansion did not translate into demand for goods and services since most of it was absorbed by a huge increase in demand for liquidity by financial institutions. By contrast, the German monetary expansion was immediately translated into demand for goods and services since it was motivated by government's hunger for seigniorage revenues. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The main focus of the paper lies in the analysis of the costs of delegation, primarily agency costs, versus their benefits, primarily the flexibility of the action choice in two different environments, one with risk and one with ambiguity. We first determine and characterize the properties of the optimal flexible contract. We then show that the higher the agent's degree of risk aversion, the higher is the agency costs of delegation and the less profitable a flexible contract relative to a rigid one. When the parties have imprecise probabilistic beliefs, the agent's degree of imprecision aversion introduces another agency cost, which again reduces the relative profitability of flexible contracts.

Knowing that a consumer is naive increases a monopolistic or competitive firm's willingness to generate inefficiency to exploit the consumer's mistakes, so naivete-based discrimination is not Pareto-improving, can be Pareto-damaging, and often lowers total welfare when classical preference-based discrimination does not. Moreover, the effect on total welfare depends on a hitherto unemphasized market feature: the extent to which the exploitation of naive consumers distorts trade with different types of consumers. If the distortion is homogeneous across naive and sophisticated consumers, then under an arguably weak and empirically testable condition, naivete-based discrimination lowers total welfare. In contrast, if the distortion arises only for trades with sophisticated consumers, then perfect naivete-based discrimination maximizes social welfare, although imperfect discrimination often lowers welfare. If the distortion arises only for trades with naive consumers, then naivete-based discrimination has no effect on welfare. We identify applications for each of these cases. In our primary example, a credit market with present-biased borrowers, firms lend more than is socially optimal to increase the amount of interest naive borrowers unexpectedly pay, creating a homogeneous distortion. The condition for naivete-based discrimination to lower welfare is then weaker than prudence.","[Heidhues, Paul] Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Dusseldorf, Germany; Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Central European University,"Heidhues, P (通讯作者)，Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Dusseldorf, Germany.",,,,European Research Council [313341]; European Research Council (ERC) [313341] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Dan Benjamin, Michael Grubb, Fabian Herweg, Takeshi Murooka, Christopher Snyder, Rani Spiegler, the editor, anonymous referees, and numerous seminar and conference audiences for helpful comments.

This is in sharp contrast with abundant evidence that the distribution of resources within households predicts household spending and savings patterns. To fill' this gap, the collective model of household decision-making is extended to the family. The model is particularly appealing in this context because it places few restrictions on preferences of individual family members who may or may not be coresident and does not specify a specific bargaining mechanism that underlies negotiations. The model yields empirical tests of whether the behavior of family members is (Pareto) efficient. Evidence is presented on the relationship between three distinct measures of health-and education-related human capital of children and the distribution of wealth among extended family members using rich longitudinal survey data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS). The data are ideally suited for this research because the survey follows family members when they leave the family home and detailed information about individual-specific wealth is collected. We find that child human capital outcomes are affected by wealth of non coresident family members indicating that extended families do share resources. While the special case of the model in which all members are completely altruistic is rejected, the restrictions of the efficient model are not rejected, indicating that non co-resident family members are able to co-ordinate allocation decisions in such a way as to make no family member better off without another member being worse off.","[LaFave, Daniel] Colby Coll, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Thomas, Duncan] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [LaFave, Daniel] Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Thomas, Duncan] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Colby College; Duke University; Colby College; Duke University,"LaFave, D (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.;LaFave, D (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",daniel.lafave@colby.edu; dthomas@econ.duke.edu,,,,,,,70,27,31,2,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

However, these studies have ignored the cross-country asset pricing implications of the disaster risk model. This paper shows that standard U.S.-based disaster risk model assumptions found in the literature lead to counterfactual international asset pricing implications. Given consumption pricing moments, disaster risk from this literature cannot explain the range of equity premia and government bill rates. Furthermore, the independence of disasters presumed in some studies generates counterfactually low cross-country correlations in equity markets. Alternatively, if disasters are all shared, the model generates correlations that are excessively high. We show that common and idiosyncratic components of disaster risk are needed to explain the pattern in consumption and equity co-movements. 2017 The Authors.

According to the results of unit root (or stationary) tests and cointegration tests, a vector autoregression model (VAR) was constructed to reveal the short-term interaction between gold prices and precious metals, and a vector error correction model (VECM) was employed to reveal relationship between gold prices and energy prices. The results of the VAR analysis indicated that gold prices have a short-term correlation with silver prices; platinum prices have a short-term correlation with gold and silver prices; and there is a short-term correlation between silver prices and palladium prices.

This study aims to analyse the impact of the financial crisis on the audit reports issued by auditors. We focus especially on those reports that contain questions relating to going concern situations. The sample analysed is formed by 2935 audit reports of unlisted Spanish firms for the years 2007-2010. From the results obtained we can affirm that the crisis being suffered by Spanish firms has not gone unnoticed by audit professionals. Our research reveals that as the crisis in Spain has worsened, the proportion of reports that include references to going concern situations has increased in comparison with 2007, when the financial crisis had not become manifest in Spain. The sectors of the Spanish economy most affected by the crisis are real estate and construction. Taking into account whether the audit firm issuing the report is Big-4 or Non-Big-4, no significant differences can be appreciated in the percentage of reports issued with going concern qualifications before the start of the crisis (2007) and during the crisis (2008-2010).","[Mareque, Mercedes] Univ Vigo, Fac Business & Tourism, Campus Univ, Orense, Spain; [Lopez-Corrales, Francisco] Univ Vigo, Fac Social Sci & Commun, Pontevedra, Spain; [Pedrosa, Aurea] Univ Vigo, Fac Social Sci & Educ, Pontevedra, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo,"Mareque, M (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Fac Business & Tourism, Campus Univ, Orense, Spain.",chedesmareque@uvigo.es,"Mareque, Mercedes/ABE-7635-2022","Mareque, Mercedes/0000-0001-8927-5323",,,,,90,9,10,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We analyse this phenomenon in the framework of a duopoly that faces a carbon price, considering both Cournot and Stackelberg competition. We identify the different sources of scarcity rents, which we classify in 'output' and 'grandfathering' scarcity rents. The former depend on the elasticity of the rivals' output to the carbon price, while the latter is exogenous. We also determine under which conditions these rents can be large enough to increase firms' profits and, as a policy implication, to what extent the existence of scarcity rents can make the firms agree on a tougher policy. This event is more likely to happen under Cournot than under Stackelberg competition, and the chances increase if the firms are allowed to pollute a large amount without paying a price.","[Andre, Francisco J.; de Castro, Luis M.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"André, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",andre@ccee.ucm.es,"Andre, Francisco J./H-4613-2015","Andre, Francisco J./0000-0002-6406-3305; de Castro, Luis Miguel/0000-0003-4200-6059","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and Development Fund, ERDF [ECO2012-39553-C04-01, ECO2015-70349-P]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and Development Fund, ERDF","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and Development Fund, ERDF [grants ECO2012-39553-C04-01, ECO2015-70349-P].",,27,5,5,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This paper examines the empirical evidence from income tax data concerning top incomes in the UK, contrasting the dramatic changes that took place in the twentieth century, after 1918, with the much more modest changes in the preceding nineteenth century. Probing beneath the surface, the paper identifies a number of features of the evolution of the UK income inequality that warrant closer attention. These include the changing shape of the upper tail, where there is a link with Pareto's theory of elites, the need for a richer functional form to describe top incomes, and the limited evidence at the top of the distribution for a Kuznets curve in nineteenth century Britain.","[Atkinson, A.

While sanctions can be expected to hinder international transactions, thereby putting political and economic pressure on a target country, we study the patterns of adjustment in bilateral financial relationships after the imposition of sanctions along various dimensions. Our analysis is based on highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics for the period from 2005 through 2014. During this time, Germany imposed financial sanctions on 20 countries; two of these sanctions have been lifted. Applying a differences-in-differences approach, we find two key results. First, financial sanctions have a strong and immediate negative effect on direct financial flows with the sanctioned country, with cross-border flows reduced in either direction. Second, sanctions imposed by the European Union alone, and therefore only enforced by their member countries instead of the United Nations, are evaded as flows with major trading partners of sanctioned countries increase. We conclude that financial sanctions do matter for capital flows.","[Besedes, Tibor] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; CESifo, Munich, Germany",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Deutsche Bank; Technical University of Darmstadt; Ifo Institut,"Besedes, T (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",,"Besedes, Tibor/D-4944-2012","Besedes, Tibor/0000-0002-8457-0240",,,,,24,29,29,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

We use rich longitudinal data from a large, representative cohort of young US Americans and exploit the differences across siblings to control for the confounding influences of shared environmental and genetic factors. We find that maltreatment experiences are significantly and robustly associated with neuroticism, conscientiousness, and openness to experience, but not with agreeableness and extraversion. High levels of neuroticism are linked to sexual abuse and neglect; low levels of conscientiousness and openness to experience are linked to parental neglect. The estimated associations are significantly reduced in magnitude when controlling for physical or mental health, suggesting that adolescent health could be one important pathway via which maltreatment affects adulthood personality. Maltreatment experiences, in combination with their health effects, explain a significant fraction of the relationship between adulthood conscientiousness and earnings or human capital.

First, when jurisdictions compete in two independent strategic variables, the decision to coordinate on one variable (a tax rate) induces a carry-over effect on the unconstrained instrument (infrastructure expenditures). Consequently, classical results of the tax coordination literature may be qualified. A second message is that the relative flexibility of the strategic instruments, which may depend on the time horizon of the decision making, does matter. In particular, tax coordination is more likely to be detrimental (in terms of revenue and/or welfare) when countries can compete simultaneously in taxes and infrastructure, rather than sequentially. The reason is that simultaneity eliminates strategic effects between tax and nontax instruments.

Put more generally, it aims to clarify how the supply-side constraints (in the shape of the wage and price dynamics) imposed on the demand side depend on the nature of the error-correction terms and on the dynamic-homogeneity properties.","[Harck, Soren] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Harck, S (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Aarhus, Denmark.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The highest growth rate is achievable only if financiers coexist with entrepreneurs, given a certain extent of financial market imperfections. However, if financiers coexist with entrepreneurs, the economy is highly likely to face a financial crisis at certain parameter values. These two-sided implications of the coexistence of entrepreneurs and financiers explain why both instability and high growth are frequently observed in modern economies. Furthermore, our model can obtain countercyclical movements in total factor productivity growth that cannot be explained by the standard real business cycle theory but were observed in the Great Recession of 2007-2008.","[Kunieda, Takuma] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan; [Shibata, Akihisa] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University; Kyoto University,"Kunieda, T (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, 1-155 Uegahara Ichiban Cho, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan.",tkunieda@kwansei.ac.jp,"Kunieda, Takuma/R-9259-2019; Shibata, Akihisa/F-1214-2010; Kunieda, Takuma/AAU-9001-2021; Shibata, Akihisa/AEV-7703-2022","Kunieda, Takuma/0000-0002-3205-3284; Shibata, Akihisa/0000-0002-2284-1332; Shibata, Akihisa/0000-0002-2284-1332","City University of Hong Kong [23000001, 7004283]; Joint Research Program of KIER, Kyoto University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23000001] Funding Source: KAKEN","City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong); Joint Research Program of KIER, Kyoto University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to express special thanks to an anonymous referee and an associate editor for their invaluable comments and suggestions.

Our discussion implies that while in a number of areas individuals benefit from well-designed insurance provided by their government, ill-designed public policies (for example existing pay-as-you-go pension systems) force individuals to insure against their government. It is further discussed how governments could improve their risk managing role in many areas by using income contingent loans, provided the country has high-quality institutions and governance. Such loans to artists, sportspeople, flood victims or collapsing financial institutions would replace the existing nonrepayable transfers, grants, subsidies and bailouts. Using a simple efficiency-equity-sustainability framework for comparing income contingent schemes with conventional public and private insurance policies, we document that this would enable governments to extend their insurance assistance to a greater number of people and institutions - in a way that is not only equitable but also efficient and fiscally sustainable.","[Libich, Jan] La Trobe Univ, Bundoora, Vic, Australia; [Libich, Jan; Machacek, Martin] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic",La Trobe University; Technical University of Ostrava,"Libich, J (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Bundoora, Vic, Australia.;Libich, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",j.libich@latrobe.edu.au,"Macháček, Martin/AGD-4688-2022; Libich, Jan/ABD-4410-2020; Libich, Jan/JWO-5802-2024; Machacek, Martin/C-6095-2018","Libich, Jan/0000-0002-2991-2228; Machacek, Martin/0000-0002-1517-6709",Czech Science Foundation [GA402/10/1046]; European Social Fund [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296]; Neuron Foundation,Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Neuron Foundation,"We would like to thank Bruce Chapman, the designer of the pioneering Australian system of tertiary education income contingent loans, for his contribution in writing Section 6.

It is established that a bias in gross external liabilities towards debt, especially short-term, may rise vulnerability to financial crises. Greater share of equity capital, mainly direct investment is not found to bear such financial risk. The results of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) show that influence of variables inherent in macroeconomic and portfolio approaches varies depending on the type of capital inflow and the group of countries. We also find some arguments that equity investment is a more desirable form of foreign capital because debt inflows are more responsive to global factors and therefore more volatile. As a word of caution, we highlight the need for diversification and careful monitoring of external financing sources and forms.","[Tchorek, Grzegorz] Univ Warsaw, Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland; [Brzozowski, Micha] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland; [Sliwinski, Pawel] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; University of Warsaw; University of Warsaw; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Tchorek, G (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland.",Grzegorz.Tchorek@nbp.pl,"Brzozowski, Michał/ABE-4932-2020; Śliwiński, Paweł/O-4999-2016","Brzozowski, Michał/0000-0003-3963-9162; Sliwinski, Pawel/0000-0001-8479-3252",,,,,75,7,8,0,22,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

The estimates of the model indicate that firm size was a key factor in the investment decision. Firm size and investment intensity were also key determinants in increasing, respectively, the probability of producing technological and non-technological innovation outputs and labour productivity across services and manufacturing sectors. By contrast, public financial support seemed to have a stronger effect in terms of investment inducement than in terms of investment intensity in services and low-tech manufacturing firms. These results suggest that horizontal science, technology and innovation (STI) policies that encourage firms to increase STI investment intensity may well produce some gains in firms' labour productivity.","[Tello, Mario D.] Catholic Univ Peru, Dept Econ, Lima, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Tello, MD (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Peru, Dept Econ, Lima, Peru.",mtello@pucp.edu.pe,"tello, mario/GWU-9430-2022",,,,,,58,8,10,1,20,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2017,,121,,,,,69,86,,,,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FE9AI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408496200004,0

Although caring for grandchildren has taken a central role for older persons due to unprecedented overlap between grandparents' and their grandchildren's lives, whether the relationship between grandparental childcare and social activities is characterised by cumulation or competition remains under-explored. Grandparental childcare may increase the purpose in life for grandparents, stimulating their social participation, or it may impose time and energy constraints on it. This study aims to assess the effect of providing grandchild care on participation in social activities for people aged 50-85 in Europe. Using an instrumental variable approach on data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, we find no significant negative effects of grandchild care on engagement in at least one social activity. However, regular provision of grandchild care has a significant negative effect on the number of activities in which grandmothers participate. When considering the activities separately by type we also find, for grandmothers only, a negative effect on volunteering, engagement in educational or training courses and participation in political or community-related organisation.","[Arpino, Bruno] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Carrer Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Arpino, Bruno] Univ Pompeu Fabra, RECSM, Carrer Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Arpino, Bruno; Bordone, Valeria] Univ Southampton, Ctr Res Ageing, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University; University of Southampton,"Arpino, B (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Carrer Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.;Arpino, B (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, RECSM, Carrer Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",bruno.arpino@upf.edu; v.bordone@soton.ac.uk,"arpino, bruno/G-2775-2013","arpino, bruno/0000-0002-8374-3066; Bordone, Valeria/0000-0002-2987-3978",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSO2015-62707-ERC],Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,Bruno Arpino acknowledges funding from the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Project: Grandparenting and successful ageing''; Grant No. CSO2015-62707-ERC).,,69,36,38,7,72,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

It is based on a monetary analysis of the economy, as well as on the works of Hyman Minsky and Jan Toporowski in particular. The key aspects of such an approach are the following. First, in a monetary economy, capital flows need to be understood as flows of funds that pertain to the realm of financial choices, as opposed to the traditional understanding of capital flows as based on real variables, such as saving and investment. A consequence of this is the need to focus on gross flows rather than capital flows. Second, liquidity preference considerations also apply at the international level, particularly in relation to the liquidity of emerging-market currencies that, in turn, depends on context-specific Keynesian fundamentals. Third, the rise of institutional investors is the key historical development in the financial system, shaping the current reality of cross-border capital flows, including to emerging markets. I argue that institutional investors' liabilities, in light of the theories of Minsky and Toporowski, are one of the most important variables in determining these investors' portfolio choices.

Inspired by previous field and experimental evidence, we analyze a type of behavior called priority-driven: students have a common ranking over the schools and then give a bonus in their submitted preferences to those schools for which they have high priority. We first prove that under this behavior, there is a unique stable and efficient matching, which is the outcome of the Boston mechanism. Second, we show that the three most prominent mechanisms on school choice (Boston, deferred acceptance, and top trading cycles) coincide when students' submitted preferences are priority-driven. Finally, we run some computational simulations to show that the assumption of priority-driven preferences can be relaxed by introducing an idiosyncratic preference component, and our qualitative results carry over to a more general model of preferences.","[Cantala, David] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Pereyra, Juan Sebastian] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Pereyra, Juan Sebastian] FRS FNRS, Brussels, Belgium",Colegio de Mexico; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,"Pereyra, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium.;Pereyra, JS (通讯作者)，FRS FNRS, Brussels, Belgium.",dcantala@colmex.mx; jpereyra@ulb.ac.be,,,ERC [208535]; European Research Council (ERC) [208535] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We are grateful to Federico Echenique for suggesting us the computational simulations.

In the first model, monetary sovereignty is owned by private banks and is potentially in competition with political sovereignty. In the second model, money can be viewed as an agent of political sovereignty, which shares some similarities with the law as an institution of sovereignty in the modern state.","[Dutraive, Veronique] Univ Lyon, CNRS, Econ, Lyon, France; [Theret, Bruno] Univ Paris 09, CNRS, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Dutraive, V (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, CNRS, Econ, Lyon, France.",,,"Dutraive, Veronique/0009-0008-3912-1607",,,,,29,3,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

To obtain sharp results in comparative statics, we ask under what kind of probability shifts on discount factors, it is possible to say that one agent always exhibits a more impatient choice than the other even when both agents have flexibility concern.

Trust fosters cooperation in many economic and social interactions and is important to the success of traditional agricultural cooperatives. Little is known about how trust affects farmers' willingness to cooperate to provide an ecosystem service, what types of trust are most important, and under what conditions trust may matter. In this study, we present results of a survey of Missouri crop farmers exploring the role trust plays in farmers' stated willingness to cooperate to control pests. We find that most farmers say they are willing to cooperate, and most farmers are willing to trust others. However, we find little evidence that trust positively influences farmers' willingness to cooperate to control pests. Instead, we find that trust may only matter under certain conditions, such as when participants' farms are dissimilar, and that other determinants, such as the perceived benefit of cooperation and environmental concern, are more important than trust to farmers who are contemplating cooperation to control pests.","[Stallman, Heidi R.; James, Harvey S., Jr.] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Stallman, HR (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",hrs220@mail.missouri.edu; hjames@missouri.edu,"James, Harvey/V-4021-2019","James, Harvey/0000-0003-0189-271X; Nedanov, Aleksandar/0000-0002-4238-9275",,,,,58,19,22,4,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Also, its exports have positive and significant relationship with countries which have large imports to Japan. Its exports have the negative relationship with the GDP per capita of its export partner countries.

In line with prospect theory, the consumers' perceived utility losses from price increases are weighted more heavily than the perceived utility gains from price decreases of equal magnitude. Price changes are evaluated relative to an endogenous reference price, which depends on the consumers' rational price expectations from the recent past. By implication, demand responses are more elastic for price increases than for price decreases and thus firms face a downward-sloping demand curve that is kinked at the consumers' reference price. Firms adjust their prices flexibly in response to variations in this demand curve, in the context of an otherwise standard dynamic neoclassical model of monopolistic competition. The resulting theory of price adjustment is starkly at variance with past theories. We find that- in line with the empirical evidence- prices are more sluggish upwards than downwards in response to temporary demand shocks, while they are more sluggish downwards than upwards in response to permanent demand shocks. The degree of these asymmetries, in turn, depends on the size of the shock. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We model an OLG economy populated by two types of household that care about how their consumption compares to that of their peers. In this framework individual debt-to-income ratios decrease with income, increases in consumption of rich households lead to increases in consumption of the rest, and aggregate borrowing increases with income inequality. We calibrate our model to evaluate the welfare implications of the process of financial liberalization that began in the 1980s. Our analysis suggests that some of the financial developments that lead to the recent expansion of credit may have decreased, rather than increased, welfare. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A social planner chooses levels of provision in both a dominant and minority language which are financed by a linear tax on labor income. Minority language speakers make a costly investment to increase their proficiency in the dominant language. In doing so they increase their wage and, possibly, gain access to higher levels of public services provided in the dominant language. The planner faces a trade-off between compensating minority language speakers for their lower wages and encouraging their integration by rewarding higher levels of dominant language proficiency. Under majority voting, it is possible that the level of public services is increasing in the relative size of the minority language community. This result contrasts with what is typically assumed in the literature on fractionalization and public good provisionthat cultural heterogeneity decreases the level of public goods.","[Armstrong, Alex] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Armstrong, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",aarmstr6@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

However, time delay significantly reduces helping rates. In line with lab experiments, delay seems to override prosocial intuitions. There is no evidence that time delay affects rates of punishment.

We find that the wage inequality problem is more severe in upstream industries than in downstream ones, and among firms with greater exposure to trade (i.e., larger export share of sales). Our findings support both classic and new new trade theories on wage inequality. In downstream industries where Chinese firms are typically engaged in processing and assembly work with intensive use of unskilled labor, trade leads to less wage inequality within firms. However, trade also introduces procompetitive effects which usually benefit exporters and their skilled labor. The results hold after various checks and controls for robustness.

The theoretical framework consists of a property rights model featuring suppliers that are either vertically integrated or sell to the multinational at arm's length, which in turn affects the availability of different sources of credit. Integrated suppliers are predicted to cover a relatively larger share of their costs using internal sources, consisting of initial wealth plus funds from the multinational parent. In addition, due to the diminished dependence on external funds (local bank credit), integrated suppliers' funding shares are less responsive to changes in their home country's level of financial development.

Against this backdrop, the objective of this paper is to use a Qualitative Vector Autoregressive (Qual VAR) to forecast (West Texas Intermediate) oil and (S&P500) stock returns over a monthly period of 1884:09 to 2015:08, using an in-sample period of 1859:10-1884:08. Given that there is no data on economic activity at monthly frequency dating as far back as 1859:09, we measure the same using the NBER recession dummies, which in turn, can be easily accommodated in a Qual VAR as an endogenous variable. In addition, the Qual VAR is inherently a nonlinear model as it allows the oil and stock returns to behave as nonlinear functions of their own past values around business cycle turning points. Our results show that, for both oil and stock returns, the Qual VAR model outperforms the random walk model (in a statistically significant way) at all the forecasting horizons considered, i.e., one- to twelve-months-ahead. In addition, the Qual VAR model, also outperforms the AR and VAR models (in a statistically significant manner) at long-run horizons for oil returns, and short- to medium-run horizons for stock returns.

We explore the conditions under which a cross-border merger between a partially privatized foreign public firm and a profit-maximizing domestic firm occurs and is approved by the domestic government. We show that a welfare-maximizing domestic government approves the merger if the share owned by the foreign government is sufficiently low and the merger is relatively efficient; a government only caring about political contributions always approves such a merger; we also consider the case where the government cares about both social welfare and political contributions.,"[Li, Jie] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Jing] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Mobing] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang Sci-Tech University,"Jiang, MB (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Econ, 5 Second Ave, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",mercyjmb@qq.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333007]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15BJL087, 15ZDB156]; Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation [2014A030313395]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [15JNYH001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"Jie Li would like to thank financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71333007), the National Social Science Foundation of China (15BJL087), the Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2014A030313395), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (15JNYH001).

We use the elimination of small-scale industry (SSI) promotion in India to address this question. For 60 years, SSI promotion in India focused on reserving certain products for manufacture by small and medium enterprises. We identify the consequences for employment growth, investment, output, productivity, and wages of dismantling India's SSI reservations. We exploit variation in the timing of de-reservation across products and also measure the long-run impact of national SSI policy changes using variation in pretreatment exposure at the district level. Districts more exposed to de-reservation experienced higher employment and output growth. Entrants into the de-reserved product spaces and incumbents that were previously constrained by the size restrictions drove the increase in growth. The results suggest that dismantling India's SSI policies encouraged overall employment growth.","[Martin, Leslie A.] Univ Melbourne, 111 Barry St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Nataraj, Shanthi] RAND Corp, 1776 Main St, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA; [Harrison, Ann E.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Harrison, Ann E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Melbourne; RAND Corporation; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Martin, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, 111 Barry St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",leslie.martin@unimelb.edu.au; snataraj@rand.org; annh@wharton.upenn.edu,"; Martin, Leslie/N-9525-2015","Harrison, Ann/0000-0002-1873-2432; Martin, Leslie/0000-0002-0955-6836",National Science Foundation [SES-0922332]; World Bank; UK Department for International Development,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); World Bank(The World Bank India); UK Department for International Development,"We thank Mr. M.

To do this, the paper develops what appear to be the first indexes of utility model patent regime strength (divided into strictness and appropriability indexes), which it tabulates for mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan per every year from the time of inception of their laws governing utility models (the first of which was in 1905) till 2016. It then analyzes these indexes via fixed effects regressions and case studies. The results show that East Asian latecomers instituted utility model patent regimes that were less strict and offered less appropriability during earlier stages of economic catch-up, likely in order to facilitate technological learning. Subsequently, the strictness of the regimes was increased as knowledge accumulation and, to some extent, technological capabilities increased and, in mainland China's case especially, as patent quality problems were experienced. It is also found that increasing the strictness of utility model patent regimes may reduce patenting in the short-term, but not the long-term. Six propositions are formulated, including the overall conclusion that successful latecomers seem to have pursued a dynamic catch-up strategy of transitioning from imitative to more sophisticated technological development by increasing both the strictness and appropriability-strength of their utility model patent regimes in conjunction with increasing knowledge accumulation and, to some extent, technological capabilities. It is suggested that mainland China might benefit from further increasing the strictness of its utility model patent regime in the future. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Further, traders' profits are affected by the accuracy of insiders' private information, and the number of days that insiders have obtained the information in advance.

We find that the heads of migrant households with school-age children earn significantly less than those who left them at their place of hukou registration. This result holds when we control for personal characteristics, migration duration, origin location, and family structure. Households migrating with school-age children have a higher probability of doing so within the prefecture/province of their hukou registration and are less likely to target coastal regions. After controlling for migration scope and destination location, the presence of children does not influence wages of migrant household heads. We also find that presence of children below age 6 has no impact on the income of migrant household heads.

Indeed, eliminating redundant assets allows to replace the initial financial structure by an equivalent one, i.e., one that has the same consumption equilibria. Moreover, at the end of the process, absence of redundant assets guarantees that the set of admissible portfolio allocations is bounded, a fundamental property for the existence of equilibria. In the presence of institutional (exogenous) portfolio constraints, eliminating redundant assets is not innocuous anymore since bounded arbitrage may persist at equilibrium, the law of one price does not hold, and some zero-income portfolios may not be free. The goal of the paper is to replace the elimination of redundant assets by the elimination of useless portfolios, a process that eliminates in particular Werner useless portfolios, but needs to go beyond to obtain the boundedness of the set of admissible portfolio allocations at the end of the purification process. Moreover, the elimination process is carried out without affecting the set of consumption equilibria, hence replacing at each step the financial structure by an equivalent one.","[Aouani, Zaier] Nazarbayev Univ, Dept Econ, Astana, Kazakhstan; [Cornet, Bernard] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Cornet, Bernard] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Nazarbayev University; University of Kansas; Paris School of Economics,,zaier.aouani@nu.edu.kz; cornet@ku.edu,"Cornet, Bernard/GRJ-5991-2022",,Nazarbayev University Social Policy Grant,Nazarbayev University Social Policy Grant,Z.

Being an agro-based economy, agriculture exports play pivotal role not only in economic growth but also in socioeconomic uplifting. This study aims at evaluating main determinants of agricultural exports of Pakistan by applying stochastic frontier gravity model over the period of 1995-2014 for a sample of 63 countries. In addition, the study also analyzes whether there is any untapped export potential between Pakistan and the trading partners in agriculture sector. The results confirm the consistency of gravity model for agriculture exports of Pakistan. Likewise, the estimates also point out that bilateral exchange as well as tariff rates also effect agriculture exports. The study has also incorporated the effect of common border, common culture, colonial history and preferential trading agreements by including their respective dummies. The study confirms the significance of each factor, except common language, with their respective magnitude. Moreover, technical efficiency estimates reveal that Pakistan has great export potential with neighboring, Middle Eastern and European countries.","[Atif, Rao Muhammad; Haiyun, Liu] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Mahmood, Haider] Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Finance, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University,"Atif, RM (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",atifhust@outlook.com,"Mahmood, Haider/AAN-3156-2020","Mahmood, Haider/0000-0002-6474-4338",,,,,40,36,38,5,98,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This text analyses the ways in which monies can be linked by drawing upon the variety of so-called contemporary community and complementary currencies (CCCs). It considers four basic binary relations between monetary assets: commensurability, convertibility, co-use and coincidence of spheres of uses. Through their combinations, four means of linking monies are identified: substitutability, simultaneity, supplementarity and autonomy. On this basis, unpacked competition and complementarity do not oppose each other but appear to be related. The less forms of money are built on specific social values, the more complementarity may be pervaded by competition. This paper illustrates how this framework can be used with cases of the Argentine trueque ('barter') and the French experimental SOL. Both experienced difficulties that show the complexity of the links, possible shifts and their effects on the sustainability of the schemes.","[Blanc, Jerome] Sci Po Lyon, Lyon, France",,"Blanc, J (通讯作者)，Inst Sci Homme, UMR Triangle, 14 Ave Berthelot, F-69007 Lyon, France.",Jerome.blanc@cnrs.fr,,"Blanc, Jerome/0000-0003-4761-7086",,,,,46,15,16,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The analysis was made in two stages: in 2003 and 2016. Since 2003, the date of the previous research study on facilities management, many changes have occurred in the economy of Lithuania, due to its accession to the European Union on May 1, 2004. In particular, the facilities management sector changed from a non tradable to an internationally tradable sector, accompanied by the entrance of firms working at the European Union level. This means that traditional firms would have a price level problem, solved either by assuming the fidelity of existing clients or by lowering the quality of their services. The Ameliorated Nominal Group Technique was applied in this study. In addition to comparisons, a multi-objective optimization method helped to obtain a ranking of effectiveness of the firms offering facilities management. Therefore, the MULTIMOORA method is preferred, given its superiority to other methods. The final ranking of preference for the facilities sector in Lithuania is presented in this article.

This paper explores whether similar European factors also need to be considered when studying the behaviour of cross-border bank flows. Using a longer time series and broader country sample than previous studies, we confirm that flows vary with uncertainty (VIX), US monetary policy (real interest rate and term spread), and US exchange rate. In contrast to the existing literature, we find that US bank conditions are insignificant in explaining flows outside the global financial crisis. European bank conditions (euro-area and UK large bank leverage, or TED spread, the three-month interbank rate minus three-month government bond yield) are, however, important throughout the 2000s, even outside the crisis and when controlling for commonality in global conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that global financial conditions are best captured by US monetary conditions and exchange rate dynamics and European bank conditions. This finding is consistent with the important role of European banks in intermediating cross-border credit, including dollar-denominated credit.","[Cerutti, Eugenio] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Amsterdam,"Cerutti, E (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,36,55,57,2,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Distortions are due to a potential neglect of the administrative duty to report the residence by migrating part of the population. An important aspect of migration movements is the stability of the area of residence. At present, it is a serious problem to move beyond greater security, usually connected with a higher standard of living and crossed by the geopolitical movements of large religious groups. Far beyond reach may be World War III or pestilence-type epidemics. Larger or smaller, deliberate or unintentional computational errors may occur. Due to the sensitivity of population number estimation to variety of manifestations affecting demographic stability when presenting population number estimation, the authors recommend increased caution when presenting the results of estimations.","[Chajdiak, Jozef; Misota, Branislav] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Inst Management, Vazovova 5, Bratislava 81243, Slovakia",Slovak University of Technology Bratislava,"Chajdiak, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Inst Management, Vazovova 5, Bratislava 81243, Slovakia.",jozef.chajdiak@stuba.sk; branislav.misota@stuba.sk,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,557,566,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300055,0

We show that the incentives for cross-border mergers rise with vertical integration in an industry when the premerger concentration in that industry is sufficiently high relative to the concentration in the same industry in a foreign country. We also show that the incentives for a merger between a foreign firm and a vertically integrated home firm will be higher than that for a merger between a foreign firm and a disintegrated home firm, when the premerger concentration at home is low relative to the premerger concentration in the foreign country. We then analyze a firm-level panel of 90,614 M&A observations, between 1990 and 2012, from 86 countries. Logistic regressions confirm that market concentration is an important determinant of cross-border M&A.

I find that such policies, though increasingly popular, lead not just to changes in the welfare of optimizers or default-takers in the population-the payoff effect-but also to the membership of those groups-the composition effect. This can lead to costly and potentially counterintuitive effects: improving defaults may actually lower welfare, unlike decision simplification, which is unambiguously positive.

The model also reproduces the evidence of low inflation during stock market booms and shows how it can lead to overinvestment and destabilize the system.

In particular, GARCH-M and asymmetric T-GARCH, E-GARCH, GJR-GARCH and APARCH models with generalized error distribution are estimated and discussed. If the currents finding are consistent with some of the previous papers, there are still also some outcomes inconsistent with other researches. Herein, also stability tests are performed a problem not often found in reports from GARCH analysis of CEE. The results show that GARCH-M, T-GARCH and E-GARCH are the best models with respect to passing diagnostic tests. Moreover, current findings strongly support the hypothesis of the presence of leverage effect or negative risk-return trade-off in certain CEE countries.

This paper characterizes a family of nonlinear ex post equilibria in a divisible double auction with only two traders, who have interdependent values and submit demand schedules. The equilibrium trading volume is positive but less than the first best. Closed-form solutions are obtained in special cases. Moreover, no nonlinear ex post equilibria exist if: (i) there are n >= 4 symmetric traders or (ii) there are 3 symmetric traders with pure private values. Overall, our nonlinear equilibria fill the n = 2 gap in the divisible-auction literature and could be a building block for analyzing strategic bilateral trading in decentralized markets.

We conclude that the effects in Spain strongly depend on the type of shock: the consumer price index (CPI) has mainly been influenced by oil demand shocks; output has only reacted to oil supply shocks; and monetary policy has mainly reacted after precautionary shocks. Second-round effects caused by the behaviour of nominal wages have not been found.

This study examines the predictive capacity of the yield spread for the United States metropolitan economies situated along the border with Mexico. Because of the location of these urban economies and various economic ties linking them with twin cities across the border, the Mexico yield spread, and the real dollar/ peso exchange rate are also employed as potential recession predictors. Results suggest that a flattening of the yield curve for either country tends to increase the probability of recessions in border economies. Furthermore, declines in the real value of the peso, which are typically associated with greater cross-border manufacturing activity, are found to reduce recession likelihoods in the metropolitan economies examined on the north side of the international boundary.","[Fullerton, Thomas M.; Saenz-Rojo, Elias D.; Walke, Adam G.] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Econ & Finance, El Paso, TX 79968 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Fullerton, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Econ & Finance, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",tomf@utep.edu,"Fullerton, Thomas/AAF-9255-2020; Fullerton, Thomas M./R-4946-2019","Fullerton, Thomas/0000-0002-5820-0713; Walke, Adam/0000-0001-6782-8425","El Paso Water Utilities, City of El Paso Office of Management Budget; UTEP Center for the Study of Western Hemispheric Trade; Hunt Institute for Global Competitiveness at UTEP","El Paso Water Utilities, City of El Paso Office of Management Budget; UTEP Center for the Study of Western Hemispheric Trade; Hunt Institute for Global Competitiveness at UTEP","This work was supported by the El Paso Water Utilities, City of El Paso Office of Management & Budget; UTEP Center for the Study of Western Hemispheric Trade; Hunt Institute for Global Competitiveness at UTEP.",,40,3,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The barriers and drivers associated with this procurement route were identified by investigating the available body of literature. Next, an empirical study investigating the use of ORA was conducted within Czech and Slovak construction industry using a carefully designed online survey. The results show that there is a difference between the adoption levels of ORA between the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Decrease in bid prices and increased transparency are perceived as the most important drivers for ORA users while unwillingness of suppliers to participate, followed by high acquisition costs are perceived as the most important barriers. The identified importance of drivers and barriers of the ORA use provides the starting point for the implementation of this procurement route in construction industry, which will lead to increased competitiveness of the sector in the next step. The obtained results confirm that this procurement route has a significant potential within the construction industry.","[Hanak, Tomas; Chadima, Tomas] Brno Univ Technol, Veveri 95, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Selih, Jana] Univ Ljubljana, Jamova Cesta 2,P 3422, Ljubljana 1001, Slovenia",Brno University of Technology; University of Ljubljana,"Hanak, T (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Veveri 95, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",hanak.t@fce.vutbr.cz; chadimat@study.fce.vutbr.cz; jana.selih@fgg.uni-lj.si,"Hanak, Tomas/E-3948-2019","Hanak, Tomas/0000-0002-7820-6848",Brno University of Technology [CIIBG-0022]; University of Ljubljana through CEEPUS programme [CIIBG-0022]; Ministry of Education and Science of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and university [FAST-S-15-2944],Brno University of Technology; University of Ljubljana through CEEPUS programme; Ministry of Education and Science of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and university,"Financial support enabling the collaboration between Brno University of Technology and University of Ljubljana, received through CEEPUS programme, network no.

IMT has no matrix, and it is an ideological declaration rather than a theory. It is a set of assertions and assumptions that are adopted without evidence, and then hypostatized to be Russian and Western socioeconomic systems. IMT literature claims to utilize the reciprocity, redistribution, and exchange model of Karl Polanyi (1944, 1957). However, IMT suffers from a number of assumptive and methodological problems in its application, the first of which consists of the complete exclusion of reciprocity from consideration. The first section of the article is an explanation of problems with IMT, and the second section demonstrates some particulars of the IMT problems with a real-world social fabric matrix from a Western nation.","[Hayden, F.

There is good information regarding how inequality has been defended over the millennia, but no answer as to why, from an egalitarian ideological foundation, some began to assert a superior position, while others - the vast majority, in fact - accepted this. In this historic process that leads to the current period, it appears that those asserting a superior position are of an honorable nature. That is, they tend to be mass murderers, fundamentally dishonest, hypocrites, and generally anti-social. Just why is this? Why are these honorable men of the Brutus type at the top of the social hierarchy? While Thorstein Veblen and Karl Marx have developed cogent analyses of inequality itself, neither has explained the origins of inequality in its break and separation from the original state of equality. I propose that this is a task for institutionalists, basing their argument on Veblen's understanding of institutions.","[Henry, John F.] Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA",,"Henry, JF (通讯作者)，Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA.",,,,,,,,23,5,5,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The question asked in this paper is: To which commercialization activities should funding programs focus in order to maximize entrepreneurial outcomes? Based on sunk cost effect from psychology of human action we hypothize that funding targeting demo and prototype-building activities are more effective than funding for outsourced initial business case analyses and novelty searches. We introduce data from a regional early-stage funding program Draft, which had a change of funding principles after a few years of operation. We show that teams with university-born business ideas who joined the program with emphasis in demo and prototype building were 5 times more likely to found a company than teams that took part in the earlier version of the program with emphasis on initial business case analysis and novelty searches.","[Immonen, Heikki] Karelia Univ Appl Sci, Sch Business, Karjalankatu 3, Joensuu 80130, Finland",Karelia University of Applied Sciences,"Immonen, H (通讯作者)，Karelia Univ Appl Sci, Sch Business, Karjalankatu 3, Joensuu 80130, Finland.",Heikki.immonen@karelia.fi,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,196,204,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500022,0

The simultaneous ascending auction may fail in this respect, as it provides bidders with an opportunity to engage in strategic demand reduction. This paper asks whether the combinatorial clock auction (CCA) fares better in this respect. We show that the answer to this question depends on the objectives bidders have. If bidders have only the slightest preference to raise rivals' cost, they will use the opportunities the CCA provides them to engage in strategic demand expansion.

The size and growth of remittances in the countries of the recipients brought the issue under the scrutiny of researchers and policymakers. In this paper we investigate the main factors behind the growing volume of remittances in the post-Soviet space. By applying panel data techniques we found that a reduction in transaction costs and a depreciation of the currency in the host country were the main factors that influenced the growth of recorded remittances. The size of transaction costs remains a significant predictor of the volume of formal remittances, even after correcting for endogeneity using an instrumental variable estimator. The inverse relationship between transaction costs and recorded remittances suggests that migrants switch from informal channels to formal channels to send remittances when costs are low. Thus lower transaction costs may help curb the proportion of informal flows and lead to increased use of remittances in the formal economy.","[Kakhkharov, Jakhongir] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Akimov, Alexandr; Rohde, Nicholas] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Kakhkharov, J (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",j.kakhkharov@griffith.edu.au; a.akimov@griffith.edu.au; n.rohde@griffith.edu.au,"Kakhkharov, Jakhongir/ABD-6859-2020; Akimov, Alexandr/GWZ-5497-2022","Kakhkharov, Jakhongir/0000-0002-4004-3043; Rohde, Nicholas/0000-0002-4606-2624",,,,,41,21,23,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In late imperial Russia, many socialist thinkers imagined socialism primarily in terms of workplace democracy, worker ownership, local governance, and economic decentralization. Their vision was destroyed, first, by Bolshevik policies and then by Stalin's tyrannical command economy. Thereafter, vested interests reemerged in the Soviet Union as an underground economy, rife with theft of public resources, and then, with the beginning of transition, capitalism in its most neoliberal form was restored.","[Klimina, Anna] Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Dept Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Klimina, A (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Dept Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The results show that an unanticipated oil price decline has a negative effect on government expenditure, and consequently non-oil GDP. Foreign monetary policy shocks also affect the economy through their impact on the interest rate, prices, and the real exchange rate. The procyclical fiscal stance, which exacerbates the business cycle, is an important source of macroeconomic fluctuations. Government expenditure smoothing should be accorded high importance in the conduct of fiscal policy. This could be achieved by using oil reserve funds to finance budget deficits to delink government spending from volatile oil revenue.","[Koh, Wee Chian] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Coll Asia & Pacific, CAMA, Acton, Australia; [Koh, Wee Chian] CSPS, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei",Australian National University,"Koh, WC (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Coll Asia & Pacific, CAMA, Acton, Australia.;Koh, WC (通讯作者)，CSPS, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei.",wc.koh@anu.edu.au,,"Koh, Wee Chian/0000-0001-8710-5427","Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, Brunei Darussalam","Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, Brunei Darussalam","This work was supported by the Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, Brunei Darussalam.",,34,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Anticipated monetary policy and inflationary shocks that turn out to be wrong can also lead to subsequent macroeconomic recessions. Credit frictions also play an important role in generating boom-bust cycle dynamics in the housing market. In particular, favorable credit conditions that are expected to be reversed in the near future generate an housing boom. The active use of the loan-to-value ratio as a policy tool aimed at dampening the severity of expectations-driven cycles effectively reduces the volatility of household debt, aggregate consumption and GDP.","[Lambertini, Luisa] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Mendicino, Caterina] European Cent Bank, Directorate Gen Res, Monetary Policy Res, Frankfurt, Germany; [Punzi, Maria Teresa] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; European Central Bank; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Punzi, MT (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",luisa.lambertini@epfl.ch; caterina.mendicino1@ecb.int; Maria.Teresa.Punzi@wu.ac.at,"; Lambertini, Luisa/H-4528-2012","Punzi, Maria Teresa/0000-0002-6665-5734; Lambertini, Luisa/0000-0001-6425-4606",Banco de Portugal,Banco de Portugal,"We are grateful to seminar participants at the Banco de Espana, the Banco de Portugal, the Bank of Finland, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Catholic University of Louvain, LUISS, the University of Surrey, the meeting of the Society of Economic Dynamics, the 2010 meeting of the 16th International Conference on Computing in Economics and Finance, the European Economic Association 2010 Congress, the Fundacao Joao Pinheiro and the Bank of International Settlements for useful feedbacks on this project.

Interestingly, prices in the secondary market react strongly to those fundamentals than to prices in the primary market. Especially, the reaction to the real interest rate is more than twice as high. The most likely buyers on the secondary market are first-time buyers with little own capital, and need a large mortgage. On the other hand, those who buy housing in the primary market quite often sell their old flat, so they only need to acquire the difference.

The motives for investment activity are subject to changes just as much as the economic basic conditions of the country are under constant change. This is based on the obvious trend of shifting the production based economy to the service based economy. The correlation between the rising production costs and M&A activity in China is examined by a linear regression. Steady modifications of the local legal basis which pursue incentive-supporting goals and which cannot be standardized. Investment risks specific to China find not much room within the sphere of the appropriate literature. The paper demonstrates possibilities to inbound investments into the People's Republic of China before a risk-aversive background. Additionally, potentially appearing risks which can find room ex ante in the assessment consideration for future investment decisions are named. Even if within the scope of the present paper not quantifiable, the excursion does point to a higher risk for share deals. Inspite of the comparatively higher risks, the People's Republic of China is for foreign investors of a not to be underestimated value. To this result comes the linear regression if merely the last four years of the investigated period flows into the analysis. This is to be judged as a clue for a change in M&A activities in the People's Republic of China with western investor's participation which is based on the changing conditions and can also be classified as approval of politics.","[Ludwig, Sven; Markovic, Peter] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Management, Dept Corp Finance, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-B, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Ludwig, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Management, Dept Corp Finance, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-B, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",svenludwig84@gmail.com; peter.markovic@euba.sk,"Markovič, Peter/GRF-5474-2022",,,,,,17,0,0,1,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,513,521,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500058,0

Education systems should be judged in terms of this multidimensional character of education, and the available information indicates that countries differ in the degree to which their students are able to acquire cognitive and non-cognitive competences. Therefore, it should be of interest to improve our comprehension of the development of both types of outcomes, a complex process that depends on personal, family, school and contextual factors. While most empirical studies that try to explain educational quality have only considered cognitive results, this study focuses on the non-cognitive ones. Methods: We estimate a multivariate multilevel regression model that simultaneously analyzes the determinants of two outcomes attained by Argentine students in the Program for International Student Assessment (PIsA) 2012 study: a cognitive result the achievement level in Mathematics and a non-cognitive one the openness to problem-solving-. Results: Both types of outcomes seem to differ in their explanatory factors: schools appear to play a greater role in the determination of cognitive achievements than non-cognitive competencies. However, attributes such as gender or home socioeconomic status have a significant influence in both cases. Furthermore, although school characteristics seem to be less relevant than individual ones in the determination of both types of results, there is also room to improve their development at school. Conclusions: The heterogeneity regarding the variables which explain both types of school outcomes suggests that the policies designed to improve each one of them should be different. Nonetheless, the development of these competencies mainly requires an improvement in socioeconomic and educational conditions at home.","[Marta Formichella, Maria; Kruger, Natalia] UNS, Dept Econ, CONICET, Inst Invest Econ & Sociales Sur, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of the South,"Formichella, MM (通讯作者)，UNS, Dept Econ, CONICET, Inst Invest Econ & Sociales Sur, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",mformichella@iiess-conicet.gob.ar; natalia.kruger@uns.edu.ar,,"Formichella, Maria Marta/0000-0002-2057-0938; Kruger, Natalia/0000-0001-8401-2639",,,,,49,2,2,1,13,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

If products exhibit systematic price trends at different points in their life cycle then matched sample methods may introduce bias if the life cycle movement in the sample does not adequately reflect that in the population. This article explores the extent of these life cycle pricing effects and then examines the bias it can introduce in measured inflation. A large US supermarket scanner data set for six cities and six products over 12years is used. Using hedonic methods we find that the life cycle component of price change is important across a range of products and cities. To explore the bias introduced by these movements, we use simulations that construct indexes with different sample update frequency. For indexes that are never completely resampled, we find an annual absolute bias of 0.88 and 0.59 percentage points depending upon whether we use the actual prices or prices imputed from our hedonic model. This compares with absolute biases of 0.34 and 0.10 percentage points for the corresponding cases for samples, which are re-selected annually. Thus our results provide strong support for more frequently updating index samples.","[Melser, Daniel] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Syed, Iqbal A.] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of New South Wales Sydney,"Melser, D (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",daniel.melser@rmit.edu.au,,"Melser, Daniel/0000-0003-0452-818X; Syed, Iqbal/0000-0002-6521-7759",,,,,22,2,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The calibrated model indicates that the 2005 reform reduces bankruptcies, as seen in the data, and improves welfare, as lower default premia allows better consumption smoothing. A counterfactual reform of changing income garnishment rate is also investigated. Interesting contrasting welfare effects between two types of agents emerge. Agents with temptation prefer a lower garnishment rate as tighter borrowing constraint prevents them from over-borrowing, while those without prefer better consumption smoothing enabled by a higher garnishment rate.

The ISRM method can examine various policy scenarios that are associated with economic penalties under uncertainties presented as probability distributions and interval values. An ISRM model is then formulated to identify the optimal power mix for the Beijing's energy system. Tradeoffs between risk and cost are evaluated, indicating any change in targeted cost and risk level would yield different expected costs. Results reveal that the inherent uncertainty of system components and risk attitude of decision makers have significant effects on the city's energy-supply and electricity-generation schemes as well as system cost and probabilistic penalty. Results also disclose that import electricity as a recourse action to compensate the local shortage would be enforced. The import electricity would increase with a reduced risk level; under every risk level, more electricity would be imported with an increased demand. The findings can facilitate the local authority in identifying desired strategies for the city's energy planning and management in association with financial-cost minimization and environmental-impact mitigation.

On the one hand, the conducted econometric research confirms the process of convergence among the EU countries in the analyzed period. However, the analysis does not confirms influence of the sustainable growth expenditure on the convergence process.

Moreover, it presents a summary of current research in this area, covering the conclusions of the endogenous growth models, issues on volatility and the relationship between financial liberalization, institutions, governance and economic growth. To study data of 54 countries from 1985 to 2010 and because the nexus between financial liberalization and economic growth is nonlinear and depends on specific national factors especially institutions quality and governance, the Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) model is used. The main result of this study shows that a better contribution of financial liberalization to economic growth requires the interrelationship and the complementarity between financial liberalization and governance. Overall, regardless of the level of liberalization, output income is always higher with better governance and institutions.","[Saidi, Hichem] Univ Manouba, ESC Business Sch Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia; [Rachdi, Houssem] Univ Carthage, HEC Carthage Business Sch, Tunis, Tunisia; [Mgadmi, Nidhal] Univ Jendouba, Fac Law Econ & Management Jendouba, Jendouba, Tunisia",Universite de la Manouba; Universite de Carthage; Universite de Jendouba,"Rachdi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Carthage, HEC Carthage Business Sch, Tunis, Tunisia.",hichem.saiidi@gmail.com; rachdih@uvic.ca; nidhalmgadmi@gmail.com,,,,,,,56,9,9,0,5,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2017,64.0,3,,,,,315,336,,10.2298/PAN141016013S,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FA0PL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405137700004,0

However, the empirical literature recognizes that assessing the true effect of private school attendance requires addressing selection and sorting issues on both observabland unobservables. The existing empirical evidence on the private school effect mostly covers OECD and Latin American countries, with little evidence on other parts of the world. There is recent emerging country-specific evidence doubting the existence of a private school advantage. I use PISA 2012 data for Mathematics and two different methodologies to derive baseline and bias-corrected estimates of the private-dependent and independent school effect for 40 countries. A robust private school advantage is found only in a handful of countries. Public schools generally perform as well as private subsidized schools and outperform independent schools. Accounting for both peer effects and selection is necessary when evaluating school effectiveness, especially in the case of independent schools.","[Sakellariou, Chris] Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Econ Humanities & Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Sakellariou, C (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",acsake@ntu.edu.sg,,"Sakellariou, Chris/0000-0003-3299-4348",,,,,30,16,20,5,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this paper, we continue with our previous work that examined possibilities of the companies clustering in order to identify homogeneous clusters regarding to their financial distress by using micropanel data. Financial distress can be described as a situation when a company cannot pay or has a difficulty to pay off its financial obligations. In our analysis we consider three criteria to define this situation: the equity, the earnings after taxes and the current ratio value. These financial indicators data were collected over a few consecutive years and thus create a longitudinal data set. We compare a model based partitioning and k-means partitioning to cluster the time trajectories of these three criteria.

The question why one region is more vulnerable to economic shock than other, impelled to analyse resilience and identify their strengths and weaknesses in terms of resilience and flexibility. Several methods of evaluating territorial economies exist, most of methods have their own limitations, especially in selection of relevant indicators and weighting scheme. Despite the limitations, several approaches in the form of composite indices has been proposed by the European Union (EU) and the other institutions, in the field of cohesion, competitiveness, regional development and potential, resilience, social progress, etc. The aim of the paper is to review the relevant approaches to evaluation of all resilience aspects (especially the EU case) based on composite indices and obtain overview of the appropriate indicators for constructing the EU regional resilience index.

By applying to US data over the 1948Q1-2016Q4 period, we have three major findings. First, a single threshold is detected for both multiple and individual quantiles cases. However, the effect of threshold nonlinearity is only present in the middle to upper quantiles of the conditional unemployment distribution in the individual quantiles case. Second, the first-order autoregressive coefficients of unemployment are significantly larger in the lower-growth regime, indicating that shocks to unemployment appear to be more persistent during recessions. Finally, the Okun's coefficients are all negative across the recessionary and expansionary regimes, confirming the validity of Okun's law. Moreover, the Okun's coefficients are smaller (more negative) in the lower-growth regime, suggesting that the effect of differenced output on differenced unemployment is asymmetric, and is more pronounced in recessions.","[Wang, Xiuhua] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ho-Chuan] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan",Hunan University; Tamkang University,"Huang, HC (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan.",river@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,20,7,7,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Empirical results revealed that when facing lawsuits from market challengers, the market leader faces fewer risks when handling patent infringement litigations. In addition, the risk reactions of competitors during patent wars may widely differ.

They are the agent of change in shifting behaviors, especially on the credit market. For them are important not only profits from the investment and the price of credit, but above all the transparency and credibility of the participants of financial transactions, the availability and quality of financial services and products. Therefore, it seems that crowdfunding is a form of financing that generation Y will choose in the future. The purpose of empirical research was to check whether Polish generation Y has knowledge of alternative forms of financing, and whether it intends to use crowdfunding to achieve its social objectives or business. Conducted quantitative research (a survey of 310 students) were designed to test knowledge of the forms of financing and knowledge of the development of innovative funding methods. The main findings demonstrated gap education for innovative methods of funding but also indicated recommendations for potential changes in the education of the Y generation.","[Waszkiewicz, Aneta Ewa] Warsaw Sch Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-00001 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Waszkiewicz, AE (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-00001 Warsaw, Poland.",awaszkie@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,3,NEWTON COLL AS,PRAHA 1,"POLITICKYCH VEZNU 10, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87325-10-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,165,173,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ1AP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417344900018,0

Co-opted directors are those appointed after the incumbent CEO assumes office and are found by prior research to represent a weakened governance mechanism. Our evidence reveals that co-opted directors lead to less powerful CEOs, consistent with the substitution effect. Because co-opted directors impose less stringent oversight, the CEO is able to exercise a great deal of latitude in running the firm. Therefore, it is less necessary for the CEO to command so much power where more directors are co-opted, hence leading to less powerful CEOs. In other words, co-opted directors substitute for strong CEO power. Crucially, we find that board co-option exhibits much more explanatory power than does board independence, which has been the primary measure of board effectiveness in the literature.","[Withisuphakorn, Pradit] NIDA, Bangkok, Thailand; [Jiraporn, Pornsit] Penn State Univ, SGPS, Malvern, PA USA",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Jiraporn, P (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, SGPS, Malvern, PA USA.",pxj11@psu.edu,,,,,,,6,13,15,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

As a result, we determine that regulatory distance and political geography had negative effects on EID, while political geography weakens regulatory distance's function. After considering an enterprise's administrative rank, we determined that when the rank is higher, regulatory distance has negative effects on EID; when the rank is lower, the effects are the opposite. Regarding political geography, it always weakened the regulatory distance's function. Moreover, the effects are significant only when the enterprises had low governmental regulation. The study shows the effects that firm location and political geography have made on EID.

Such a regulatory intervention is likely to have impact on the price formation process and information transmission between markets. We find that the long-run cointegrating relation between the high- and low-risk country groups in Europe broke down as the crisis emerged and the regulatory remedy failed to correct this. Furthermore, we find the information transmission between markets has reversed from the high-risk to low-risk markets in the period following the Lehman demise and imposition of the ban. Further, we notice a similar reversal in the spillover of both return and volatility processes between the different risk-level country groups. We, therefore, conclude that, overall, the 2008 short-selling ban had an adverse impact on information transmission between the identified country portfolios in both the long and short run. Notably, the ban did not restore the pre-crisis transmission channels.","[Chen, Jing] Cardiff Univ, Sch Math, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [McMillan, David G.] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Accounting & Finance Div, Stirling, Scotland; [Buckle, Mike] Univ Liverpool, Management Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Cardiff University; University of Stirling; University of Liverpool,"Chen, J (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Math, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",,"McMillan, David/H-5211-2019","McMillan, David/0000-0002-5891-4193; Chen, Jing/0000-0001-7135-2116; Buckle, Mike/0000-0002-5767-2217",,,,,44,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Selection into marriage makes it difficult to assess whether these correlations represent a causal effect of marriage. One instrument for marriage proposed in past research is the gender of a woman's first child. We find that women who have a boy first are about 0.33 percentage points more likely to be married at any point in time. This effect operates through both increasing the probability that unmarried mothers marry the child's father and reducing the probability of divorce. We also find that women whose first child is a boy experience higher levels of family income and are less likely to receive welfare income, be below the poverty line, and receive food stamps. Estimates using child gender as an instrumental variable for marriage suggest that marriage plays a large causal role in improving the economic well-being of women with children and that these effects are largest among women at the lower end of the income distribution.","[Depew, Briggs] Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 3565 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Price, Joseph] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 162 FOB, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Brigham Young University,"Price, J (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 162 FOB, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",briggs.depew@usu.edu; joe_price@byu.edu,,,,,,,22,8,10,0,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

In the theory, knowledge is a costly input for firms that they can acquire at their headquarters or their production plants. Communication costs impede the access of the plants to headquarter knowledge. The model shows that multinational firms systematically acquire more knowledge at both their foreign and domestic plants than non-multinationals if their foreign plants face higher communication costs with headquarters than their domestic plants. This theoretical prediction helps understand why multinational firms pay higher wages to workers than non-multinational firms, and why their sales decrease across space. The empirical analyses show that higher communication costs indeed decrease multinational firms' foreign sales. Consistent with model-specific comparative statics, the decrease is stronger in sectors with less predictable production processes. Data on corporate transferees allow shedding light on one tool of multinational firms' organization of knowledge.","[Gumpert, Anna] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Gumpert, A (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany.",anna.gumpert@econ.lmu.de,,,"CESifo Network; German Science Foundation (DFG) [CRC TRR 190, GRK 801]; German National Academic Foundation under the ERP Fellowship Programme",CESifo Network; German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German National Academic Foundation under the ERP Fellowship Programme,"I am grateful to Pol Antras and Esteban Rossi-Hansberg for helpful discussions and suggestions, and to Monika Schnitzer for her constant encouragement and support.

We explore collectivism as an intergenerationally transmitted cultural value and analyze its explanatory power for the economic outcome of 21,000 male homogamous second generation immigrants in the US. Our collectivism proxy is derived from the country of ancestry's historical disease environment because collectivistic values have been particularly advantageous in countries with a greater prevalence of disease-causing pathogens. Employing this new collectivism proxy that identifies collectivism more precisely than previously used cultural proxies, we find that higher scores of collectivism are associated with higher labor force participation and income earned in the US. The results on income are channeled through the number of hours worked and self-selection into jobs that require collectivistic traits. By analyzing the labor market performance of second generation immigrants, we are the first to show an occupational selection along cultural skills implying that second generation immigrants sort into occupations that demand skills on which they have a cultural comparative advantage.","[Hoeckel, Lisa Sofie] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Hoeckel, Lisa Sofie] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ruhr University Bochum,"Höckel, LS (通讯作者)，RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.;Höckel, LS (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany.",lisa.hoeckel@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,62,4,5,0,8,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

But, how and through what means does the state coordinate firms to follow the changing directions of its economic objectives? This paper focuses on the case of a government-controlled business association, namely the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), and shows that the ACFIC may be serving, at least partially, as a means of avoiding the kind of coordination failures that are often associated with policy reform programs in authoritarian regimes like China when the government deems it necessary to radically and suddenly change its policy objectives. It does so by comparing the activities of firms that are members of ACFIC with non-members before and after the world financial crisis of 2008-09 which induced a significant change in government objectives. Before that crisis when priority in government objectives was outward (to stave off balance of payments crises that had befallen many other developing countries), ACFIC member firms were able to engage in exports and foreign investment to a greater extent than non-member firms, and even than those whose owners are members of the Congresses or Chinese Communist Party. After viewing the crises in international markets, and government objectives had turned more inward, ACFIC members were more likely to focus on domestic sales and investments.","[Lei, Zhenhuan] NYU, Dept Polit, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Nugent, Jeffrey B.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Econ, Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",New York University; University of Southern California,"Lei, ZH (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Polit, New York, NY 10003 USA.",Zhenhuan.lei@nyu.edu; nugent@usc.edu,"Lei, Zhenhuan/ABC-4980-2020",,,,,,48,23,26,3,25,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

Both surveys include price, data caps, and download and upload bandwidth, but only one includes latency. Together, these surveys allow us to measure tradeoffs between bandwidth and other connectivity features such as price and data caps, and perhaps most notably, provide the only empirical evidence to date of tradeoffs between bandwidth and latency. We find that households' valuation of bandwidth is highly concave, with relatively little added value beyond 100Mbps. For example, households are willing to pay about $2.34 per Mbps ($14 total) monthly to increase bandwidth from 4Mbps to 10Mbps, $1.57 per Mbps ($24) to increase from 10 to 25Mbps, and only $0.02 per Mbps ($19) for an increase from 100 Mbps to 1000 Mbps. We also find households willing to pay about $8.66 per month to reduce latency from levels obtained with satellite Internet service to levels more common to wired service. Household valuation of increased data caps is also concave as caps increase from 300 GB to 1000 GB, although consumers place a significant premium on unlimited service. Our findings provide the first relative valuation of bandwidth and latency and suggest that current U.S. policy may be over-penalizing latency relative to reductions in bandwidth and data caps. For example, we find that in its CAF Phase II Auction, the FCC is imposing a bidding penalty for latency that is about five times higher than what our WTP estimates suggest it should be relative to bandwidth offered.

We predict that languages that grammatically mark the future affect speakers' intertemporal preferences and thereby reduce their willingness to address environmental problems. We first show that speakers of languages with future tense marking are less likely to adopt environmentally responsible behaviours and to support policies to prevent environmental damage. We then document that this effect holds across countries: future tense marking is an important determinant of climate change policies and global environmental cooperation.

Despite economic improvements in the second decade of transition, research has documented that happiness lagged behind. We test whether past unemployment experience can explain this transition happiness gap in the context of Ukraine, a country with a painful delayed transition from planned to market economy. We analyze unique longitudinal data for the period 2003-2012. Current unemployment substantially reduces subjective wellbeing, and the effect is roughly 50% larger for men than for women. The effect of past unemployment is significant, but small in magnitude compared to the effect of current unemployment. However, it does correspond to around 8% of the transition happiness gap found by Guriev and Melnikov (2017), suggesting that past unemployment experience can be considered as a partial explanation.","[Norton, Edward C.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Norton, Edward C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nizalova, Olena] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Nizalova, Olena] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Nizalova, Olena] GLO, Rostock, Germany; [Murtazashvili, Irina] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Kent; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Drexel University,"Norton, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Norton, EC (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ecnorton@umich.edu,", Edward/AAQ-1719-2021",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631; Nizalova, Olena/0000-0002-1704-2632",European Union [649496]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649496] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),This project has been partially supported with funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 649496.,,20,0,0,1,9,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

We evidenced that the average impact of the company-related characteristics is three times stronger than the impact of personal characteristics. We also found that working full-time considerably decreases this risk of low wages, but company-related and personal characteristics (except for the kind of company's economic activity) have not provided a rent (benefit) from working full-time. The underlying conclusion is that reforms decreasing the size of the low-wage sector in the former transition countries should be focused on targeted employment programmes enhancing transitions to more profitable economic activities instead of possibly maintaining the unprofitable industries at all costs. Additionally, the reforms should be concentrated on introducing employment regulations to harmonise the rules of employment among all contract types, which would put the part-timers and the underemployed on a more equal footing with full-time workers especially in terms of pension schemes and access to training.","[Ryczkowski, Maciej] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland; [Ryczkowski, Maciej] Stat Off, Labour Market Methodol Sect, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Maksim, Monika] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Human Resource Management, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Ryczkowski, M (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland.;Ryczkowski, M (通讯作者)，Stat Off, Labour Market Methodol Sect, Bydgoszcz, Poland.",m_ryczkowski@umk.pl; mouso@umk.pl,"Ryczkowski, Maciej/AAF-1544-2019; Maksim, Monika/AAL-8397-2021","Ryczkowski, Maciej/0000-0003-2156-6823;",,,,,76,5,5,0,5,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

In particular, we test whether the characteristics of large defence companies are related to both the production of different types of patents (civilian, military and mixed), and the generation of dual-use technologies. To explore these links, we rely on economic data for the top 100 defence companies from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database, and patent information from the Worldwide Patent Statistical Database. Our results show that the relationship between the production of civilian patents and the size of the company is positive and significant. However, this relationship does not hold for the production of military patents. Furthermore, the military commercial profile is unrelated to the generation of military patents. Regarding the involvement in dual-use technologies, firms engaged in dual-use are those with higher military sales, a greater number of employees and a larger number of patents (civilian, military and mixed) than those not engaged in dual-use. Furthermore, we found a skill effect (more involvement in dual-use per employee) in European firms compared to US firms. These findings help to identify which firms should be targeted by government policies if increasing dual-use technologies becomes a political objective.","[Acosta, Manuel; Coronado, Daniel; Ferrandiz, Esther; Rosario Marin, M.; Moreno, Pedro J.] Univ Cadiz, Dept Econ Gen, Cadiz, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz,"Acosta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cadiz, Dept Econ Gen, Cadiz, Spain.",manuel.acosta@uca.es,"Rodríguez, Pedro J Moreno/F-9818-2016; Acosta, Manuel/D-3803-2012; Seró, Manuel Acosta/AAU-6718-2021; Ferrándiz, Esther/AAE-2637-2021; Ferrandiz, Esther/G-4661-2011","Seró, Manuel Acosta/0000-0002-8052-7181; Ferrandiz, Esther/0000-0001-5607-8040; Coronado Guerrero, Daniel/0000-0003-0716-9135","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [ECO2016-79436-R]","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [grant number ECO2016-79436-R], [AEI/FEDER/UE].",,57,15,15,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The DSGE-VAR model is estimated on Czech data covering the period from 1996 to 2011 at quarterly frequency. The government consumption multiplier attains a value close to 0.4 at the horizon of four years. The public investment multiplier is about 0.4 higher, which confirms findings in the literature.

Given their ability to manage upper-level and size-related business practices, medium-sized firms emerge as local players best able to exploit their embeddedness in the districtual system and leverage districtual assets. However, these effects are only present in firms belonging to the industrial specialization of the district. An additional result of the empirical analysis shows that the leading role of medium-sized firms is critical in younger districts, where medium-sized firms lead the renewal of the ID and its adaptation to the changes of the competitive environment. As most Italian IDs are specialized in traditional sectors, this evidence contributes to understanding the mechanisms connecting the competitiveness of the traditional industry and its localised organizational structure. The paper also provides a discussion of the future of IDs-including the relevance of the evolutionary stage of the district on the performance of affiliated firms-and their reproducibility over time.","[Cucculelli, Marco; Storai, Dimitri] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60100 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Cucculelli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60100 Ancona, Italy.",m.cucculelli@univpm.it,"STORAI, DIMITRI/JNT-6214-2023; Cucculelli, Marco/J-2479-2019","STORAI, DIMITRI/0000-0001-9514-0564; Cucculelli, Marco/0000-0003-0035-9454",,,,,79,7,8,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In Brazil, wage inequality has steadily declined since the early 1990s. Counterfactual exercises show that the evolutions of the schooling and experience premiums are key determinants of the decline in inequality. The 2000s witnessed a rapid decline in the schooling and experience premiums, at the same time as the working population was aging and becoming more educated. To understand these changes, the paper develops a model of imperfect substitution across experience and education groups and estimates the relevant elasticities of substitution. Changes in labor supply contributed significantly to the decline of the experience and education premiums, but are not enough to account fully for the observed changes. The demand for experience shifted in favor of younger workers, while the relative demand for college graduates declined during the 2000s.","[Fernandez, Manuel] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Messina, Julian] Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Messina, Julian] IZA, POB 7240, D-53072 Bonn, Germany",University of Essex; Inter-American Development Bank; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Messina, J (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",m.fernandersierra@essex.ac.uk; julianm@IADB.ORG,"Messina, Julian/ABE-9287-2021","Messina, Julian/0000-0002-3635-499X; Fernandez Sierra, Manuel/0000-0002-6447-6337",,,,,44,11,14,3,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

This large-scale European experience provides a unique case study of a new type of industrial policy particularly oriented towards the modernisation of industrial sectors. In this paper, we briefly review the fundamentals of the S3 approach. We identify and discuss the main properties of S3 that make it particularly suited to the problem of sectoral modernisation in the context of a mature economy. In the final part, we describe the designing of this policy, which represents a crucial point: whilst the objective of modernising traditional sectors is not in itself anything new, the way of proceeding within the S3 framework is relatively new and innovative.","[Foray, Dominique] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Chair Econ & Management Innovat, ITPP, CDM,ODYSSEA,Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Foray, D (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Chair Econ & Management Innovat, ITPP, CDM,ODYSSEA,Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",dominique.foray@epfl.ch,,,,,,,38,42,44,4,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The authors argue that the material legacy of deindustrialisation conditions the opportunities for survivor firms and creates specific, sub-sectoral industrial ecologies. Literature from economics, business studies, development and ecological studies is used to outline a framework that allows different possible relations between firm capability and local habitat. Two subsectors, carpets and apparel, are used to explore the notion of interaction between firm capability and ecology: though the context of deindustrialisation is similar in some respects, the specific conditions provide quite distinctive opportunities for renewal. In carpets, relatively larger firms have more successfully co-evolved with retailers through various kinds of mutuality; in apparel, a workshop sector of mainly small and micro firms frequently struggles with predatory behaviour by much larger retailers. The implication of this analysis is that industrial policy needs to be grounded in analysis of the capabilities-habitat interplay, focusing on areas where conditions are favourable or can be improved through supporting firm capabilities and modifying supply chain behaviours. The concepts and analysis are relevant for considering other industries and contexts where industrial renewal depends on producer firms and the ecology in which they operate.","[Froud, Julie; Wei, Hua; Williams, Karel] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Hayes, Steven] Univ Manchester, Sch Mat, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of Manchester,"Froud, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",julie.froud@manchester.ac.uk,"Hayes, Steven/N-3607-2019; Wei, Hua/GPS-7682-2022","Hayes, Steven/0000-0002-6830-5818; Wei, Hua/0000-0003-2617-7632",,,,,80,6,7,3,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

While that effect varies by country, there are likely to be commonalities. Thus, research on a relatively small advanced open economy like New Zealand can provide insight into the general effect. In this study monthly data from 1991 to 2017 is used to examine how aging population in New Zealand affects its stock market considering key demographic and non-demographic macroeconomic variables and a new focus on fast-and-slow-moving institutional change. The results suggest that the net effect of an aging population on stock markets is insignificant. However, real GDP and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) show a positive relationship with the stock market. The findings reveal that FPI can mitigate possible negative effects from aging in an open economy. Moreover, the policy implications of the study suggest that international-factor mobility, skilled-migration policies, and technology-based productivity growth can boost stock markets.","[Hettihewa, Samanthala] Federat Univ Australia, Fac Business, POB 663, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia; [Saha, Shrabani; Zhang, Hanxiong] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Int Business Sch, Lincoln, England",Federation University Australia; University of Lincoln,"Saha, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Int Business Sch, Lincoln, England.",s.hettihewa@federation.edu.au; SSaha@lincoln.ac.uk; hzhang@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,1,1,1,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Firms have to consider not only the level at which a decision is made (authority location) but also how many people are involved (authority diffusion), and the type of communication. Utilizing a unique data set, we estimate a latent-class model to identify frequently adopted combinations of decision-making rights and communication across different hierarchical levels relating to the implementation of a significant change. We identify four typical authority/communication structures that can be loosely categorized as: authoritarian centralization; team decision making; consultative centralization; and decentralization. We then explore the relationships between these four authority/communication structures and other characteristics of the firm, such as the size of the organization, worker skills, long-term employer-employee relationships, individual and group incentives and how close the firm is to the productivity frontier.

The payments were compensation for the sudden removal of hefty energy subsidies. The program has been heavily criticized for its disincentive for work, especially for the poor. We use panel data to study the causal effect of the transfers on labor supply using exogenous variation in the time households first started receiving transfers and in the intensity of treatment, which we define as the share of net transfers from the program in total per capita household expenditures. We find no evidence that cash transfers reduced labor supply, in terms of hours worked or labor force participation.

By exploiting unique information on whether children have ever given up schooling for financial reasons and, if they have, which level of schooling they have forgone, it assesses the role of borrowing constraints in determining intergenerational educational mobility in a more direct manner than previous attempts. Despite a steady increase in the level of educational attainment, the regression results indicate the absence of an increase in intergenerational educational mobility in postwar Japan. Moreover, while borrowing constraints used to play a significant role in lowering intergenerational educational mobility, they no longer seem to matter for the youngest cohort examined in this paper. Instead, our analysis shows that the relative importance of adolescent academic ability for children's educational attainment has increased in recent years, thereby underlining the increasing importance of earlier investments in children's human capital for their subsequent academic advancement.","[Niimi, Yoko] Asian Growth Res Inst, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan; [Niimi, Yoko] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan",Kyushu University,"Niimi, Y (通讯作者)，Asian Growth Res Inst, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan.;Niimi, Y (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan.",niimi@agi.or.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [15H01950, 18H00870]; Asian Growth Research Institute; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science and Technology (MEXT) Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18H00870] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Asian Growth Research Institute; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science and Technology (MEXT) Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was financially supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI (Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research) Grant Numbers 15H01950 and 18H00870, a project grant from the Asian Growth Research Institute, and a grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science and Technology (MEXT) Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University.",,37,4,4,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

But what is the link between the two? And what is the driving factor of asset prices volatility? To answer these questions, we have introduced a specific credit friction, limited commitment, in a general equilibrium model with production and investment in productive capital, where agents can trade bonds. The model always displays a stationary equilibrium where bonds are traded. More importantly, limited commitment may generate stochastic endogenous fluctuations driven by self-fulfilling volatile expectations (sunspots), yielding credit and investment cycles and bond price volatility consistent with data.","[Carli, Francesco] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Modesto, Leonor] UCP Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Deakin University; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Carli, F (通讯作者)，Deakin Business Sch, 270 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",fcarli@deakin.edu.au,"Modesto, Leonor/AAI-7663-2020; Carli, Francesco/AAQ-4465-2021","Carli, Francesco/0000-0001-9594-4706; Modesto, Leonor/0000-0002-8302-2613",FCT-Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology [PTDC/IIM-ECO/4831/2014]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/IIM-ECO/4831/2014] Funding Source: FCT,FCT-Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We are grateful to two anonymous referees for extensive feedback and to Rui Albuquerque, Teresa Lloyd-Braga, Xavier Raurich, Catarina Reis, Pedro Teles, and Alain Venditti for helpful discussions, as well as seminar participants at Catolica-Lisbon, the V IIBEO Workshop, the 2014 PET Conference, the 3rd LuBraMacro Meeting, the 2014 ASSET Annual Meeting, the 2015 Conference on Financial and Real Interdependencies, and the Second International Workshop on Financial Markets and Nonlinear Dynamics.

To address this problem, we develop a framework to model the evolution of development indicators as a political economy game on a network. Our approach accounts for the-recently documented-network of interactions between policy issues, as well as the well-known political economy problem arising from budget assignment. This allows us to infer not only policy priorities, but also the effective use of resources in each policy issue. Using development indicators data from more than 100 countries over 11 years, we show that the country-specific context is a central determinant of the effectiveness of policy priorities. In addition, our model explains well-known aggregate facts about the relationship between corruption and development. Finally, this framework provides a new analytic tool to generate bespoke advice on development strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find that intangible capital, which cannot be used by financially constrained entrepreneurs as collateral, is key to generate labor market volatility in response to financial shocks. When hit by an adverse financial shock, entrepreneurs prioritize investment in pledgeable assets to offset the tightening of financial conditions. This results in a strong cutback in intangible investment, which in turn leads to a decline in the marginal product of labor, vacancies and employment. In an alternative specification-one without intangible capital-when hit by an adverse financial shock, entrepreneurs instead fund tangible investments by reducing their consumption. As a result, capital and the marginal product of labor fall less than in the model with intangible assets, resulting in a smaller decline of employment and output. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To capture confidence, we use a psychological measurement known as Achievement Motivation, which is dually comprised of 'hope for success' and 'fear of failure'. This personality dimension is examined in addition to the Big Five personality traits and Locus of Control (LOC). Using 2013 wage data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, our Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition model reveals that men's stronger hope for success, lower fear of failure and lower agreeableness contribute to the gender wage gap, while women's higher level of conscientiousness is the only trait that serves to narrow it.","[Risse, Leonora; Farrell, Lisa; Fry, Tim R.

We conduct a heuristic comparison of the new stochastic seasonal variation model with three established empirical temperature and pricing models: the model of Alaton etal., the continuous autoregressive model and the spline model. The test criteria are residual normality, the Akaike information criterion, relative errors, and stability of price behaviour. The objective of the paper is to find the most suitable model for the application of temperature-based derivatives in China. Therefore, 30years of daily average temperature data from 12cities in mainland China are applied. The results show that the stochastic seasonal variation model dominates the other three models by providing a more precise fitting of the temperature process. Furthermore, the spline model displays inconsistencies when it is applied to Chinese temperature data. This model has the smallest relative errors, but the worst results for normality of residuals.","[Zong, Lu] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Ender, Manuela] Int Univ Appl Sci, Bad Reichenhall, Germany",Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; International University of Applied Sciences - Germany,"Ender, M (通讯作者)，Int Univ Appl Sci IUBH, Int Hsch Bad Honnef Bonn, Zenostr 6, D-83435 Bad Reichenhall, Germany.",m.ender@iubh-fernstudium.de,,,,,,,25,1,1,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Simple examples show that even if the planner's goal (expressed by a social choice correspondence (SCC)) depends only on ordinal information, eliciting cardinal information may help with incentives. However, if agents may be uncertain about their own cardinal preferences, then a strong robustness requirement can justify the focus on ordinal mechanisms. Specifically, when agents' preferences over pure outcomes are strict, if a planner is able to implement an SCC (in ex post equilibrium) using a mechanism that is robust to interdependence of arbitrary form in cardinal preferences, then there must exist such a mechanism that elicits only ordinal preferences. The strictness assumption can be dropped if we further allow the possibility of non-expected-utility preferences.","[Carroll, Gabriel] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Carroll, G (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",gdc@stanford.edu,,,,,,,52,4,4,0,2,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

For this purpose, we model the competition and trade-offs between the consumption of fuelwood for heat (FW-H) and the consumption of fuelwood for electricity (FW-E). To do so, we couple a forest sector model with an electricity simulation model, and we test different scenarios combining FW-H and FW-E that account for contrasting potential increases in the carbon price and the potential reduction in the number of nuclear plants. We assess the implications of these scenarios on (1) the budgetary costs for the government, (2) industrial wood producers' profits, (3) cost savings in the power sector for the different scenarios tested, and (4) the carbon balance. We show that the scenario with the highest carbon price and the lowest number of nuclear plants is the least expensive from a budgetary perspective. Indeed, when associated with a high carbon price, co-firing may increase FW-E demand with a lower subsidy level, which makes it possible to reduce the cost of reaching the target. However, in this case, FW-E crowds out part of FW-H, which may cause political and economic issues. From a carbon balance perspective, an FW-H-only scenario performs better than any other scenario that combines FW-H and FW-E due to the relatively low emissions factors of alternative technologies for electricity generation and, in particular, nuclear energy.

In each such equilibrium, the firms that are relatively more cost or quality efficient limit their prices to induce the exit of their rival(s). When n >= 3, this game does not need to satisfy supermodularity, the single-crossing property, or log-supermodularity. Moreover, the best responses might have negative slopes.

This paper develops a simple macrodynamic model that synthesises some key perspectives of their analytical frameworks. The model incorporates Godley's financial balances approach and postulates that private sector's propensity to spend is driven by a stock-flow norm (the target net private debt-to-income ratio) that changes endogenously via a Minsky mechanism. It also includes two fiscal rules: a Maastricht-type fiscal rule, according to which the fiscal authorities adjust the government expenditures based on a target net government debt ratio; and a Godley-Minsky fiscal rule, which links government expenditures with private indebtedness following a counter-cyclical logic. The analysis shows that (i) the interaction between the propensity to spend and net private indebtedness can generate cycles and instability; (ii) instability is more likely when the propensity to spend responds strongly to deviations from the stock-flow norm and when the expectations that determine the stock-flow norm are highly sensitive to the economic cycle; (iii) the Maastricht-type fiscal rule is destabilising while the Godley-Minsky fiscal rule is stabilising; and (iv) the paradox of debt can apply both to the private sector and the government sector.","[Dafermos, Yannis] Univ West England, Frenchay Campus, Bristol, Avon, England",University of West England,"Dafermos, Y (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",Yannis.Dafermos@uwe.ac.uk,,"Dafermos, Yannis/0000-0002-8127-6249",,,,,54,15,17,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The overall income loss can be attributed to wage cuts and to rising illegal employment that is generally poorly paid.

The variation between rural and urban areas in SSA and between SSA and the United States of America reveals a negative relationship, and potentially, a trade-off between accumulation and consumption insurance.","[De Magalhaes, Leandro] Univ Bristol, Priory Rd Complex, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [Santaeulalia-Llopis, Raul] Fundacio Markets Org & Votes Econ MOVE, Campus Bellaterra UAB,Edifici B S-N, Barcelona 08193, Spain",University of Bristol,"Santaeulàlia-Llopis, R (通讯作者)，Fundacio Markets Org & Votes Econ MOVE, Campus Bellaterra UAB,Edifici B S-N, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",leandro.demagalhaes@bristol.ac.uk; rauls@movebarcelona.eu,,"De Magalhaes, Leandro/0000-0002-1860-9899",ERC Asset Prices and Macro Policy when Agents Learn (APMPAL) [AdG-GA324048]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centers of Excellence in RD [SEV-2015-0563],ERC Asset Prices and Macro Policy when Agents Learn (APMPAL); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centers of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government),"We thank Kathleen Beegle, Taryn Dinkelman, Pascaline Dupas, Francisco Ferreira, Doug Gollin, John Kaboski, Talip Kilic, Kurt Mitman and Jon Temple for their comments and suggestions at different stages of this project.

We characterize all solvable priority structures satisfying the following two restrictions: Either there are no ties or there is at least one four-way tie.For any two agents i and j, if there is an object that assigns higher priority to i than to j, there is also an object that assigns higher priority to j than to i.(A)(B) We show that there are at most three types of solvable priority structures: The strict type, the house allocation with existing tenants (HET) type, where, for each object, there is at most one agent who has strictly higher priority than another agent, and the task allocation with unqualified agents (TAU) type, where, for each object, there is at most one agent who has strictly lower priority than another agent.

The significantly growing infeed from renewable energy sources puts more and more pressure on the grid and emphasizes the need for improved congestion management. Thus, a new delimitation of price zones is frequently considered in current discussions and research. The present paper applies a novel hierarchical cluster algorithm that clusters locational marginal prices and weights nodes depending on their demand- and supply situation to identify possible new price zone configurations (PZCs). The algorithm is applied in a scenario analysis of six scenarios reflecting main drivers that influence the future development of European Electricity markets in line with the trilemma of energy policy targets. Robustness of the new configuration is an important criterion for price zone configurations according to the European Guideline on Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management (CACM). Therefore, a robust price zone configuration is computed taking into account all the six individual scenarios. Results show that shape, size and price variations of price zones on the one hand strongly depend on the individual scenario. On the other hand, the identified robust configuration is shown to outperform other configurations, particularly also the current price zone configuration in CWE. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A factor structured covariance offers a range of alternatives between these two assumptions. However, because these models are more difficult to estimate they are not frequently used to model preference heterogeneity. This paper develops a simple expectation-maximization algorithm for estimating mixed logit models when preferences are generated from a factor structured covariance. The algorithm is easy to implement for both exploratory and confirmatory factor models. The estimator is applied to stated-preference survey data from residential energy customers (Train, 2007). Comparing the fit across five different models, which differed in their assumptions on the covariance of preferences, the results show that all three factor specifications produced a better fit of the data than the fully correlated model measured by BIC and two out of three performed better in terms of AIC.","[James, Jonathan] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"James, J (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",jjames04@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,22,4,4,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

The paper uses rolling-window estimation to examine the possibility of change in the ERPT over time. In addition, it investigates the asymmetric behaviour of the ERPT over the business cycle. The results indicate that the ERPT for South Africa is complete in the first stage but incomplete in the second stage. It implies that retailers do not pass all the cost to consumers. The first-stage ERPT has declined slightly since the Global Financial Crisis. Weak domestic demand and possibly the concentration of firms in the manufacturing sector are the main forces behind this low PT. Moreover, there is evidence of asymmetry in the first-stage ERPT in that it tends to rise in the upturn phase of the economy compared to the downturn. The second-stage ERPT shows a considerable decline since the adoption of the inflation-targeting regime. Similar to the first-stage case, the PT is muted in the downturn but rises in the expansionary phase by about 10%.","[Kabundi, Alain] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Mbelu, Asi] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Kabundi, Alain] South African Reserve Bank, Pretoria, South Africa",The World Bank; Trinity College Dublin,"Kabundi, A (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",akabundi@worldbank.org,"Mbelu, Asi/P-7579-2019",,,,,,31,8,8,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

It compares the status of working adults born between the years 1945 and 1960 and their adult children born between 1975 and 1985, using non-linear transition matrix techniques. On average, the majority of adult children have better educational attainment and occupational skills level compared with their parents. Income mobility, in absolute and relative terms, is highest among children born to parents in the lowest income quintile. The results of a logistic regression model show that education, assets ownership, gender, and location matter for upward mobility. Moving forward, there will be difficulties for the children from poor families to move up the socioeconomic ladder because of changes in policies.

Based on a sample of more than 2000 German electricity consumers, we conduct a Discrete Choice Experiment to estimate willingness to pay for co-determination rights, transparent pricing policies, and an electricity utility's profit distribution. We find large additional willingness to pay for all of these attributes, which, in total, amount to more than a quarter of the overall electricity price per kilowatt hour. Women have a higher willingness to pay of up to one Eurocent per kilowatt hour. We discuss the implications of our findings for Germany's and the European Union's energy policy.

In this paper, I employ nowcast data and the forecast error variance decomposition method to empirically assess the role of investment specific technology surprise shocks, news shocks and sentiment shocks separately. The surprise shock represents unanticipated innovations to the technology; the news shock captures the (correct) expectation of future technological changes; the sentiment shock is orthogonal to the identified surprise and news shocks, which maximizes the short run forecast error variance of nowcast of investment. The results suggest that the sentiment shock accounts for a substantial portion of fluctuations in output and investment in the short run. In the medium run, the news shock is increasingly important. The surprise innovation plays a very small role in the explanation of economic dynamics.

We examine the alternative assumptions made in the literature in this regard and quantify and motivate the resulting discrepancies. Focusing (mostly) on US data, we show that different measures can have very distinct properties in terms of the observed stochastic trends, shares of short-, medium-, and long-run variation and volatilities, persistence and mean-reversion properties, and susceptibility to structural breaks. For instance, while short-run properties of the surveyed labor share measures are relatively consistent across all definitions (and countercyclical), their medium- and long-run trends may diverge substantially (and are procyclical). To substantiate our analysis, we document the implications of discrepancies in the empirical labor share definition for growth accounting, analyzing the effect of technology shocks, and for estimating inflation dynamics.","[Muck, Jakub; Growiec, Jakub] SGH Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Muck, Jakub; Growiec, Jakub] Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland; [McAdam, Peter] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",Warsaw School of Economics; Narodowy Bank Polski; European Central Bank,"McAdam, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",peter.mcadam@ecb.europa.eu,"Growiec, Jakub/AAB-8623-2019; Mućk, Jakub/J-5749-2019","Growiec, Jakub/0000-0003-2222-1691; Mućk, Jakub/0000-0002-6345-3133",Polish National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki) [2012/05/B/HS4/02236],Polish National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki),"We thank the editor Les Oxley and two insightful journal referees.

However, until now, issues of data availability have restricted a broader and cross national perspective on the topic. Based on rich sets of harmonized household survey data, we contribute to filling this gap by computing time series for several indexes of relative and absolute intergenerational education mobility for 18 Latin American countries over 50 years and making them publicly available. We find that inter-generational mobility is, on average, rising in Latin America. This pattern seems to be driven by the high upward mobility of children from low-educated families; at the same time, there is substantial immobility at the top of the distribution. Significant cross-country differences are observed and are associated with income inequality, poverty, economic growth, public educational expenditures, and assortative mating.","[Neidhoefer, Guido] DIW Berlin, Dept Educ & Family, Berlin, Germany; [Neidhoefer, Guido] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Serrano, Joaquin; Gasparini, Leonardo] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Econ, CEDLAS Ctr Estudios Distribut Laborales & Sociale, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Serrano, Joaquin; Gasparini, Leonardo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin; National University of La Plata; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Neidhöfer, G (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Berlin, Germany.",guido.neidhoefer@fu-berlin.de; serranojqn@gmail.com; leonardo@depeco.econo.unlp.edu.ar,,"Neidhofer, Guido/0000-0002-4473-495X",Jacobs Foundation; Hans Bockler Foundation,Jacobs Foundation; Hans Bockler Foundation,"We thank Christian Ambrosius, Fabrizio Bernardi, Shahe Emran, Stephan Klasen, Martin Nybom, Heike Solga, Viktor Steiner, and Oliver Winkler for their fruitful remarks, as well as participants of conferences and seminars in Bariloche, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Florence, Gottingen, La Plata, Kiel, New York, Oxford, and Santa Fe.

Two alternative approaches with differing interpretations are employed. The first method projects all facets of welfare onto a single variable which is then analyzed using standard univariate techniques. The second approach establishes equivalent-income distributions that would lead to an equalization of welfare, such that the difference between this counterfactual and the true income distribution can be measured. This difference is then interpreted as the degree of income redistribution required to offset welfare inequality. Using data on permanent incomes, health scores, years of education, and leisure times, we observe much higher levels of inequality in the U.S. than in Germany or Australia.

This article describes the advantages of the deprivation approach and shows that while the income and deprivation approaches can produce similar overall results, the circumstances of some sub-groups vary greatly according to which measure is used.

In this paper we analyse the effects of such losses from two perspectives: from that of consumption and from that of generation. Given that end-user consumption varies across the day, consumption has direct implications for electricity losses. Indeed, demand-side management policies seek to encourage consumers to use less energy during peak hours and to reduce network congestion. At the same time, from the perspective of generation, the recent growth in distributed generation has modified the traditional, unidirectional, downward flows in electricity systems. This affects losses as energy is produced in the lower voltage network, which is closer to points of consumption. In this paper we evaluate the impact of consumption patterns and different generation technologies on the energy losses and the cost of losses. To do so, we draw on data from a real electricity system with a high level of renewable penetration, namely, that of Spain between 2011 and 2013. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to analyse the real impact of consumption and the effect of each generation technology on energy losses, offering an opportunity to evaluate the potential benefits of demand-side management policies and distributed generation. Losses are divided between transmission and distribution levels, which is also a novelty that allows us to better define our regulatory recommendations aimed at exploiting to the full these potential benefits. Our results should serve as a baseline for countries at the early stages of implementing these policies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There are a growing number of studies that have explained FDI inflows into Vietnam both at the macro and the provincial levels. This study builds on this line of research by investigating the role of relative wages and relative productivity of Vietnam vis a vis other countries in the region, which hold similar locational advantages like Vietnam. The underlying premise is that a multinational corporation (MNC) has a choice between investing in two similar countries and chooses one country (Vietnam) rather than the other based on relative costs and benefits. Using a panel dataset spanning from 2000 to 2015, the study finds that during the recent years of transition, high level of FDI inflows into Vietnam could be explained mainly by the relatively skilled workforce, combined with low wages as compared to her neighboring countries in the region.

It is an important issue of common concern for economists and policymakers to explore the drivers of the growth of air pollution emissions and the deteriorating environmental quality in China. From the perspective of supply-side structures, this paper adopts Ghosh input-output model to decompose the factors affecting the changes of air pollutant emissions into economic activities, economic structures, allocation structures and emission intensity. Using this model, we conduct a structural decomposition analysis of air pollutant emissions in China, India, USA, and Japan for 1995-2009. The results reveal that China's economic structure initially promoted air pollutant emissions, but later played a role in reducing them. Further, whereas in Japan and particularly, China, allocation structures were found to be a key factor in increasing air pollutant emissions, in America and India, it played a critical role in reducing emissions.

In contrast, we find no evidence that increased audit risk affected the quality of publicly provided preventive and primary health care services - measured through user satisfaction surveys - or compliance with eligibility requirements for the conditional cash transfer program - measured through household inspections. The observed impact heterogeneity across activities is consistent with differences in potential sanctions and in the probability that a sanction is applied, conditional on detection.","[Zamboni, Yves] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Fundacao Getulio Vargas Sao Paulo, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Litschig, Stephan] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Getulio Vargas Foundation; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Litschig, S (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",s-litschig@grips.ac.jp,"Litschig, Stephan/D-5338-2013",,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD","We are grateful for comments from Emmanuelle Auriol, Martina Bjorkman, Antonio Ciccone, Denis Cogneau, Gabrielle Fack, Patricia Funk, Scott Desposato, Miguel de Figueiredo, Albrecht Glitz, Jorge Hage, James Hines, Yinghua He, Maksym Ivanyna, Yuya Kudo, George Musser Jr., Sylvie Lambert, Gianmarco Leon, Karthik Muralidharan, Hannes Muller, Luiz Navarro, Rosella Nicolini, Per Pettersson-Lidbom, Giacomo Ponzetto and Anh Tran.

Yet Sinn (2017) argues that excessive electrical storage requirements limit the further expansion of variable wind and solar energy. We question, and alter, strong implicit assumptions of Sinn's approach and find that storage needs are considerably lower, up to two orders of magnitude. First, we move away from corner solutions by allowing for combinations of storage and renewable curtailment. Second, we specify a parsimonious optimization model that explicitly considers an economic efficiency perspective. We conclude that electrical storage is unlikely to limit the transition to renewable energy. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

The original FTPL rests on a fundamental compounded fallacy: confusing the intertemporal budget constraint (IBC) of the State, holding with equality and with sovereign bonds priced at their contractual values, with a misspecified equilibrium nominal bond pricing equation, and the 'double use' of this IBC. This generates a number of internal inconsistencies and anomalies. The FTPL is not about endogenous money issuance guaranteeing solvency of the State when public spending and taxes are exogenous. The problem is not about empirical content or the realism of the assumptions, but about flawed internal logic. The issue is not just of academic interest. If fiscal authorities were to take the FTPL seriously, costly policy accidents, including sovereign default and hyperinflation, could result. Interpreting the FTPL as an equilibrium selection mechanism in models with multiple equilibria does not help. Attempts by Sims to extend the FTPL to models with nominal price rigidities fail. The attempted resurrection of the FTPL fails.","[Buiter, Willem H.] Citigrp Global Markets Inc, New York, NY 10013 USA; [Sibert, Anne C.] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Econ, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Buiter, WH (通讯作者)，Citigrp Global Markets Inc, New York, NY 10013 USA.",willem.buiter@citi.com,,,,,,,57,6,6,0,2,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,AUG 2,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201848.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-48,0.0,,,56,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GQ0PM,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441321700001,0

We do this by forecasting the aforementioned macroeconomic variables based on the information contained in the three alternative FCIs using a Bayesian VAR (BVAR), nonlinear logistic vector smooth transition autoregression (VSTAR) and nonparametric (NP) and semi-parametric (SP) regressions, and compare the results with the standard benchmarks of random-walk, univariate autoregressive and classical VAR models. The three FCIs are constructed using rolling-window principal component analysis (PCA), dynamic model averaging (DMA) in the context of a time-varying parameter factor-augmented vector autoregressive (TVP-FAVAR) model, and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model with constant factor loadings. Our results suggest that the VSTAR model performs best in the case of forecasting output and inflation, while a SP specification proves to be the best for forecasting the interest rate. More importantly, statistical testing for significant differences in forecast errors across models corroborates the finding of superior predictive ability of the nonlinear models.

First, in a simple model of parental investment in child outcomes, we demonstrate that the misalignment between household monetary resources and parental education causes a mismatch. Indeed, a match between poverty and deprivation occurs whenever household consumption expenditure and parental education are correlated. Second, using micro-level data from Tanzania, we find that parental education has a negative effect on the probability that a monetarily non-poor child suffers some basic deprivations, and a positive effect on the likelihood that a monetarily poor child suffers no basic deprivations.","[Ballon, Paola] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Cockburn, John] PEP, Duduville Campus,POB 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Dessy, Sylvain] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Pavillon Seve, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Dessy, Sylvain] Univ Laval, CRREP, Pavillon Seve, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Diarra, Setou] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ,Social Sci Bldg, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Oxford; Laval University; Laval University; University of Ottawa,"Cockburn, J (通讯作者)，PEP, Duduville Campus,POB 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",john.cockburn@pep-net.org,"Ballon, Paola/I-4851-2015",,Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP) from the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom; Government of Canada through the International Development Research Center (IDRC); UK Aid,Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP) from the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom; Government of Canada through the International Development Research Center (IDRC); UK Aid(CGIAR),"We thank the Editor of this Journal, and two anonymous referees for valuable comments that helped improve the quality of this paper.

Using a Krupka-Weber social norm elicitation task, we find participants perceive it to be more socially inappropriate to discriminate on the basis of nationality than on the basis of social identities artificially induced using a trivial minimal group technique. Correspondingly, we find that participants discriminate more in the artificial identity setting.

We use data spanning 2005-2013 of Spanish firms from PITEC, a panel database carried out by the INE (The National Statistics Institute). We focus on patenting firms and consider that firms' decisions to apply for patents in foreign patent offices may be driven by two kinds of motivations: first, to exploit the patent in international markets where there is potential demand for the invention and, second, to protect the invention abroad when the quality of the invention is high enough. In the first case we refer to market-driven determinants and, in the second case, to innovation type-driven determinants. We empirically analyse these factors using information on firms' sales in different geographic international markets, and also indicators of the quality and scope of the innovations. We distinguish among EPO, USPTO and PTC patents, and estimate, first, a multivariate probit model to determine the factors underlying the decision to apply for patents in these foreign offices. Second, we estimate a multivariate model to explain the shares of patent applications in each one of the offices.","[Beneito, Pilar] Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Beneito, Pilar; Engracia Rochina-Barrachina, Maria; Sanchis, Amparo] ERICES, Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Engracia Rochina-Barrachina, Maria; Sanchis, Amparo] Univ Valencia, Dept Estruct Econ, Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Beneito, P (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.;Beneito, P (通讯作者)，ERICES, Avda Naranjos S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",Pilar.Beneito@uv.es,"Beneito, Pilar/AAD-9619-2022; Llopis, Amparo Sanchis/ABE-8264-2021; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/K-8929-2014","Beneito, Pilar/0000-0001-5767-7010; Llopis, Amparo Sanchis/0000-0002-0872-7859; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/0000-0002-9263-1023","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-55745-R, ECO2017-86793-R]; Fundacion-BBVA, Programa de Ayudas a Proyectos de Investigacion en Socioeconomia, 2014; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/2014/054]","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Fundacion-BBVA, Programa de Ayudas a Proyectos de Investigacion en Socioeconomia, 2014(BBVA Foundation); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF))","We are grateful for the constructive comments from two anonymous reviewers and from the Journal invited editors.

This is an important question for many developing countries that are currently prioritizing infrastructure investments. Using cross-sectional and panel regressions with national-level decadal data, we find some evidence that electricity availability has a significant effect on subsequent economic growth. However, much of the effect disappears once suitable controls are included. We examine various dimensions of electricity availability, including electricity consumption quantity, generation capacity, residential access rate, and quality of electricity supply. It appears that electricity availability is best viewed as something that can be scaled up as economies grow rather than something that imposes binding constraints on subsequent economic growth.

Evidence from Medicare Advantage,AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RISK-ADJUSTMENT; PASS-THROUGH; SELECTION; MARKETS; RESPOND; WELFARE,"A central question in the debate over privatized Medicare is whether increased government payments to private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans generate lower premiums for consumers or higher profits for producers. Using difference-in-differences variation brought about by a sharp legislative change, we find that MA insurers pass through 45 percent of increased payments in lower premiums and an additional 9 percent in more generous benefits. We show that advantageous selection into MA cannot explain this incomplete pass-through. Instead, our evidence suggests that market power is important, with premium pass-through rates of 13 percent in the least competitive markets and 74 percent in the most competitive.","[Cabral, Marika; Geruso, Michael] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Stn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Mahoney, Neale] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Chicago,"Cabral, M (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Stn, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",marikacabral@gmail.com; mike.geruso@gmail.com; neale.mahoney@gmail.com,,,George J.

Our empirical strategy exploits the fact that the cost of providing ADSL-based broadband services in a given municipality depends on its relative position in the pre-existing voice telecommunications infrastructure. We first show that broadband Internet had a substantial negative effect on turnout in parliamentary elections up until 2008. It was, however, positively associated with other forms of political participation, both online and offline, such as the emergence of local online grassroots protest movements. The negative effect of the Internet on turnout in parliamentary elections essentially reversed after 2008, when local grassroots movements coalesced into the Five-Star Movement electoral list. Our findings support the view that: (i) the effect of the Internet varies across different forms of political participation; (ii) it changes over time, as new political actors emerge that are able to take advantage of the new technology to attract disenchanted or demobilized voters; and (iii) these new forms of mobilization eventually feed back into the mainstream electoral process, converting exit back into voice.

This paper considers endogenous cultural amenities as a location factor for high-skilled workers. To overcome selection in the provision of cultural amenities, we exploit variation in contemporaneous cultural amenities that is explained by the path-dependence of historical agglomerations of the cultural activities. To assess spillovers from high-skilled workers attracted by cultural amenities, we use a 1% sample drawn from the population of all West German workers under social security during the period 1975-2010. This panel of individual observations allows us to compare wages of similar individuals who work in locations with different levels of high-skilled workers who are attracted by cultural amenities. To account for non-random selection of workers among cities, we use individual-location fixed effects. Our results show that cultural amenities are an important factor in the location decision of high-skilled workers. The positive effect of the local share of high-skilled workers on unskilled, skilled and high-skilled wages indicates strong and productive spillovers.","[Falck, Oliver] Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Falck, Oliver] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich LMU, Munich, Germany; [Falck, Oliver; Heblich, Stephan] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Fritsch, Michael] Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Fritsch, Michael] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Heblich, Stephan] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd Complex,Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [Heblich, Stephan] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Heblich, Stephan] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Otto, Anne] IAB Rheinland Pfalz Saarland, Eschberger Weg 68, D-66121 Saarbrucken, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Munich; Ifo Institut; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); University of Bristol; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Heblich, S (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Heblich, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd Complex,Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.;Heblich, S (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Heblich, S (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",falck@ifo.de; m.fritsch@uni-jena.de; stephan.heblich@bristol.ac.uk; anne.otto@iab.de,"Fritsch, Michael/ABB-7526-2021; Fritsch, Michael/E-9321-2011","Fritsch, Michael/0000-0003-0337-4182; Heblich, Stephan/0000-0001-6486-3727",ESRC [ES/H005331/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,13,14,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Based on considerations about wage costs and replacement costs, we discuss steep seniority wage profiles as incentives for firms to dismiss older workers before retirement. Conditional on individual retirement incentives, e.g., social security wealth accrual rates or health status, the steepness of the wage profile will have different incentives for workers as compared to firms to maintain the employment relationship. Using an instrumental variable approach to account for selection of workers in our firms and for reverse causality, we find that firms with higher labor costs for older workers have on average a lower job exit age and a higher incidence of golden handshakes.

We also investigate whether the presence of a price floor has an effect on farmers' investment behavior. Our results suggest that the Real Options Approach more accurately predicts the decision-making behavior of farmers than the Net Present Value Approach. However, the results also show that neither of the approaches entirely explains the observed investment behavior. Specifically, the presence of a price floor does not significantly affect the investment behavior. The latter is, however, significantly determined by the order in which treatments with and without price floor are introduced, alongside various demographic and socio-economic characteristics.","[Ihli, Hanna Julia; Gassner, Anja] World Agroforestry Ctr, United Nations Ave,POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); University of Gottingen,"Ihli, HJ (通讯作者)，World Agroforestry Ctr, United Nations Ave,POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",h.ihli@cgiar.org; a.gassner@cgiar.org; oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Ihli, Hanna/0000-0003-2785-0964",German Research Foundation (DFG) [GRK 1666 / IH 128/1-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Thanks are extended to three anonymous reviewers and the editor for helpful comments and suggestions.

We provide an analysis of the historical trends of the metabolic pattern of European economies over a period of 18 years focusing on the changes in energy throughput and financial assets. The results show that energy consumption per hour of labor has remained constant, suggesting that no significant changes in production processes or technology have taken place in the productive sectors of the economy. The contribution of this paper is to establish a bridge between the economic analysis of financialization and the societal metabolism analysis of the economic process from a biophysical point of view. We argue that this bridge is crucial to draw attention to the biophysical consequences of financialization (a relative decoupling) and critically assess the pertinence of policies aimed at encouraging the decoupling in the context of increasing inequality.","[Kovacic, Zora; Lo Piano, Samuele; Sorman, Alevgul H.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Edifici Z,Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain; [Kovacic, Zora; Lo Piano, Samuele] European Ctr Governance Complex, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain; [Spano, Marcello] Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Sorman, Alevgul H.] Univ Basque Country, BC3, Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Insubria; University of Basque Country,"Kovacic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Edifici Z,Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain.;Kovacic, Z (通讯作者)，European Ctr Governance Complex, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain.",zora.kovacic@uab.cat,"Spanò, Marcello/AFN-7655-2022; Kovacic, Zora/J-1788-2016; Piano, Samuele Lo/AGC-5657-2022","Kovacic, Zora/0000-0002-0911-9273; Piano, Samuele Lo/0000-0002-2625-483X",,,,,79,11,11,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

For this purpose two main approaches have been proposed in the literature: the deterministic and the stochastic. Although an inappropriate modelling of systematic components could have important consequences on the prediction of loads and prices, in the literature it has not yet been assessed, which approach is more appropriate for electricity markets time series. This work aims at filling this gap by comparing the deterministic and the stochastic approach in a systematic way and in a homogeneous framework, both for loads and prices. In the deterministic case, components are represented by smoothing splines and dummy variables, while in the stochastic case they are described by stochastic processes common to the unobserved component modelling literature. As systematic components are not observable, the comparison is based on the prediction implications of the two procedures. This allows us to account for possible compensations among estimated components on the final result. Predictive performance is mainly assessed with respect to the one-day-ahead horizon, but also seven-day ahead predictions are considered. The two approaches are evaluated on loads and prices of four important wholesale electricity markets: the Italian IPEX, the Scandinavian Nord Pool, the British EPEX SPOT UK and North American PJM.

Across these structures the DCFTA indicates relatively large gains for Ukraine of more than 3 percent. We show, however, that the gains for Ukraine are lower when we consider monopolistic competition in manufacturing. This is attributed to a movement of resources into Ukraine's traditional export sectors to the EU, which produce under constant returns. While there is little danger of deindustrialization dominating the overall welfare gains, we do observe substantially lower gains when we consider monopolistic competition. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical confirmation of the theoretic predication that the relative gains from trade in monopolistic competition models might be lower than under perfect competition in the context of a numeric simulation of economic integration. Under the popular heterogeneous-firms monopolistic competition theory we find significant firm selection effects indicating welfare impacts for Ukraine that are less than under the Armington structure but above those found under symmetric firms and monopolistic competition. These results are important considerations for Ukraine's overall development strategy.","[Olekseyuk, Zoryana] German Dev Inst DIE, Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, Dept World Econ & Dev Financing, Bonn, Germany; [Balistreri, Edward J.] Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Colorado School of Mines,"Olekseyuk, Z (通讯作者)，German Dev Inst DIE, Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, Dept World Econ & Dev Financing, Bonn, Germany.",zoryana.olekseyuk@die-gdi.de,"Balistreri, Edward J/A-6686-2013","Balistreri, Edward/0000-0001-6740-0066; Olekseyuk, Zoryana/0000-0001-9403-8234",,,,,42,6,6,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2018,45.0,3,,,,,507,542,,10.1007/s10663-017-9371-9,0.0,,,36,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GM8BV,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438433600004,0

Yet an alternative explanation for many such findings has been almost wholly ignored. Instead of, or in addition to, being motivated by maintaining others' good opinion of me, I may be motivated to maintain others' good feelings about how they have been treated. For example, I may give more to a stranger when we meet face to face because they will feel worse being denied in that context than if I denied them anonymously. In an experiment, I find that a substantial fraction of the population does believe that others have beliefs-based utility, and that these beliefs are additionally strongly linked to actual choices in an setting designed to identify BBA by forcing a trade-off between standard outcome-based altruism and beliefs-based altruism. This link establishes the importance of BBA for a large fraction of the population whose actions may be partially misattributed to social signaling.

Why do donors delegate sizable shares of their aid to large non-specialized agencies for implementation? This paper develops a game theoretic model to explain this puzzle. Donors delegate aid implementation to strengthen aid selectivity, incentivizing policy improvements in recipient countries, which in turn improves the development effectiveness of aid. Aid delegation is optimal for donors who disagree on the optimal distribution of aid precisely when an agency represents the average donor.

It is shown theoretically that if enforcement is effective in deterring and constraining cartels then there will be fewer cartels with low overcharges and fewer with high overcharges. This prediction provides an indirect method for testing whether the enforcement of competition law is effective. Using historical data on legal cartels to generate the counterfactual, we find significantly less mass in the tails of the overcharge distribution, compared to illegal cartels. This result is robust to controlling for confounding factors, and we interpret this as the first tentative confirmation of effective deterrence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides a first step toward addressing that question by measuring the benefits and costs that are capitalized into housing values. We exploit the time-series and cross-sectional variations in the adoption of Colorado's municipality retail marijuana laws (RMLs) and examine the effect on housing values with a difference-in-differences strategy. Our estimates show that the legalization leads to an average 6% increase in housing values, indicating that the capitalized benefits outweigh the costs.

Six axioms characterize an (essentially unique) expected-utility rationalization of preferences, in which utilities and probabilities are revised according to three revision rules when awareness changes: (R1) utilities of unaffected outcomes are transformed affinely; (R2) probabilities of unaffected events are transformed proportionally; (R3) enough probabilities 'objectively' never change (they represent revealed objective risk). Savage's Theorem is a special case of the theorem, namely the special case of fixed awareness, in which our axioms reduce to Savage's axioms while R1 and R2 hold trivially and R3 reduces to Savage's requirement of atomless probabilities. Rule R2 parallels Karni and Viero's (2013) 'reverse Bayesianism' and Ahn and Ergin's (2010) 'partition-dependence'.

We provide a simple theoretical framework that links the heterogeneity in investment-cash flow sensitivity, a common indicator of financing constraint, to the dispersion of marginal revenue product of capital, a direct measure of allocative inefficiency. Our model shows that the existence of both constrained and unconstrained firms is a sufficient though not necessary condition for capital misallocation. Empirically, we run an error-correction investment model for U.S. Compustat and Chinese manufacturing firms, and for various sub-samples of the Chinese firms. Our estimates on investment-cash flow sensitivities imply a 5% and 15% total factor productivity loss respectively for the balanced and unbalanced panels of Chinese firms. Our identification strategy does not require any monotonic relationship between investment-cash flow sensitivities and severity of financial frictions, thus is not subject to the Kaplan and Zingales critique.","[Ek, Chanbora] Minist Econ & Finance, Macroecon & Fiscal Policy Dept, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Wu, Guiying Laura] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, Div Econ, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Wu, GL (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, Div Econ, Singapore, Singapore.",EKCH0002@e.ntu.edu.sg; guiying.wu@ntu.edu.sg,,"Wu, Guiying Laura/0000-0002-5102-9837",,,,,45,10,12,2,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

The wage is set in a bargaining process where the firm's shareholder and worker share the production surplus. As debt service is considered to be a part of production costs, firms borrow to reduce the surplus which allows to lower the wage. We study the model's response to financial shock under two Taylor-type interest rate rules: first one responds to inflation and borrowing, second one to inflation and unemployment. We have found that the second rule delivers better policy in terms of the welfare measure. Additionally, we show that the feedback on unemployment in this rule depends on the extent of workers' bargaining power.","[Girdenas, Sarunas] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Girdenas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Business Sch, Econ Dept, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",sg325@exeter.ac.uk,,,ESRC,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"For advice and discussion, I would like to thank Tatiana Damjanovic, Dudley Cooke, Jack Rogers, Martin Ellison, Julian Neira, Keqing Liu, and all participants in the Macroeconomics Workshop at University of Warwick, the Search and Matching 2014 Conference and Exeter Economics Department seminars.

I find asymmetries in the responses of job flows to positive and negative oil price innovations. Yet, these asymmetries do not pass a test of symmetry on the impulse responses, especially after accounting for data mining. Third, I use a test for the absence of job reallocation to evaluate whether an unexpected increase in the real price of oil price triggers an important change in job reallocation.

The experimental design is based on signal jamming equilibrium (SJE) models of fraud in which managers make potentially inaccurate public reports and investors bid on shares. Under SJE, managers always exaggerate reports by a fixed amount up to the maximum possible report, independent of the truth. Shareholders can perfectly correct managers' reports (except for the maximum possible report). In contrast, the results of the experiment show four robust deviations from SJE predictions: (1) managers exaggerate and shareholders correct reports according to dominated mixed-strategies with probabilities significantly less than one, (2) managers exaggerate more frequently and by more when outcomes are poor, (3) shareholders adjust low reports by less than high reports, and (4) shareholders correct relatively high reports by more in booms than busts even though managers' reporting strategies are invariant to economic prospects.

We formulate and characterize implementability via rights structures under different specifications, which require having well-defined convergence dynamics and being consistent with farsighted behavior. We identify how implementation via rights structures is related to implementation via mechanisms. In the presence of at least three agents, we find the class of rights structures, implementability via which is equivalent to Nash and strong Nash implementability.

This article recounts three arguments for this interpretation and then critically examines them. The arguments are: (1) Friedman's methodology is based upon Alfred Marshall's own realist methodology; (2) key passages in Friedman's 1953 essay express a causal realist stance; and (3) Friedman and Schwartz's work on US monetary history presupposes causal realism. These arguments are contestable. First, there are important differences between Marshall's and Friedman's methodology. Second, key passages in the 1953 essay are prima facie incompatible with a causal realist stance. Third, Friedman and Schwartz's 'transmission mechanism', appended to their monetary history, is arguably instrumentalist in character. The article concludes with some brief reflections on how Friedman's approach to economics, including his 1953 essay, could be read as strategically malleable, rather than being an 'objectively' prescriptive methodology.","[Mariyani-Squire, Edward] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Mariyani-Squire, E (通讯作者)，Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",e.mariyani-squire@westernsydney.edu.au,"Mariyani-Squire, Edward/AAD-1890-2021",,,,,,73,0,0,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In a consumption-saving problem we show that self-regulation can generate unintended income effects, which have important implications for public policies on saving behavior. We also provide several examples to illustrate how self-regulation can rationalize many well-known choice anomalies. These behavioral implications follow from a key feature of the model that self-regulation decisions can respond to changes in incentives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We argue that this claim conflates time consistency with two distinct properties of preferences: stationarity and time invariance. While time invariance and stationarity together imply time consistency, the converse does not hold. Although non-dictatorial social preferences cannot be stationary, they may be time consistent if time invariance is abandoned. If individuals are discounted utilitarians, revealed preference provides no guidance on whether social preferences should be time consistent or time invariant. Nevertheless, we argue that time invariant social preferences are often normatively and descriptively problematic. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Children in the integrated intervention arm (teacher training and parenting) had significantly higher scores in assessments of language and socio-emotional development than children in preschools receiving teacher training alone at the 18-month follow-up. There were significant improvements in classroom organization and teacher behavior at the preschools in the teacher-training only arm, but these did not translate into improved child outcomes at 18 months. We found no effects of any intervention on child assessments at the 36-month follow-up. Our findings suggest that, in resource-poor settings with informal preschools, programs that integrate parenting support with preschools may be more (cost-) effective for improving child outcomes than programs focusing simply on improving classroom quality.","[Ozler, Berk] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Fernald, Lia C.

This paper develops a New Keynesian small open economy model to show, analytically and numerically, that several prevalent features of LICs dependence on external financing, public investment inefficiency, and a low degree of home bias in public investment play important roles in government spending effects. External financing increases the resource envelope, mitigating the crowding out effects, but it tends to appreciate the real exchange rate, lowering traded output. Although capital scarcity in LICs implies high returns to public capital, low marginal investment efficiency can substantially dampen the output multiplier. Also, public investment may not be effective in stimulating output in the short run, as LICs often rely on imports to a large extent to carry out public investment projects, weakening its role as a short-run demand stimulus.","[Shen, Wenyi] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Yang, Shu-Chun S.] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Yang, Shu-Chun S.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Zanna, Luis-Felipe] Int Monetary Fund, Inst Capac Dev, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; National Sun Yat Sen University; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Yang, SCS (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.;Yang, SCS (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",wenyi.shen@okstate.edu; syang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw; fzanna@imf.org,,,U.K.'s Department for International Development [60925]; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan,"U.K.'s Department for International Development; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors thank Andrew Foster and Douglas Gollin (the editors), Andrew Berg, Giovanni Melina, Catherine Pattillo, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Using individual and panel regressions on disaggregate data, this study provides evidence of the aggregation bias and marked differences in inflation persistence across product categories. Furthermore, it shows that cross-regional differences in inflation persistence remain, even after controlling for the product category. While this study generally confirms the earlier finding of Vaona and Ascari that more backward regions exhibit higher consumer price index inflation persistence, we also show that the picture is more nuanced at the product category level.","[Gajewski, Pawel] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Gajewski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Lodz, Poland.",pawelg@uni.lodz.pl,"Gajewski, Pawel/G-3570-2013","Gajewski, Pawel/0000-0002-8220-2081",Narodowe Centrum Nauki [DEC-2014/15/B/HS4/01996],"Narodowe Centrum Nauki(National Science Centre, Poland)",This work was supported by Narodowe Centrum Nauki [grant number DEC-2014/15/B/HS4/01996].,,33,4,4,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Harmonized policy scenarios (including mass-based emissions limits and various power-sector-only carbon tax trajectories) across 16 models provide comparative assessments of potential impacts on electric sector investment and generation outcomes, emissions reductions, and economic implications. This paper compares results across these policy alternatives, including a variety of technological and natural gas price assumptions, and summarizes robust findings and areas of disagreement across participating models. Under a wide range of policy, technology, and market assumptions, model results suggest that future coal generation will decline relative to current levels while generation from natural gas, wind, and solar will increase, though the pace and extent of these changes vary by policy scenario, technological assumptions, region, and model. Climate policies can amplify trends already under way and make them less susceptible to future market changes. The model results provide useful insights to a range of stakeholders, but future research focused on intersectoral linkages in emission reductions (e.g., the role of electrification), effects of energy storage, and better coverage of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) can improve insights even further.

The former wants to reduce the resulting outcome discrepancy through monitoring the use of the transfer and imposing sanctions if the discrepancy proves too large. This external discipline combines with the 'internal discipline' of the beneficiary, that is his/her willingness and ability to align with the transfer-maker's objective. Besides the fact that costs of monitoring and sanctioning are explicitly taken into account, an original feature of our model specification is that the two types of discipline are made comparable: they can be summed up to obtain an aggregate discipline. We show that, paradoxically, an (exogenous) improvement of internal discipline may be over-compensated by a fall of external discipline. Total discipline thus decreases and the discrepancy between the actual and the intended uses of the transfer increases instead of decreasing. Another consequence is that the relationship between internal and total disciplines may be non-monotonic. These results generalize to alternative specifications of the basic model.","[Bourguignon, Francois] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Platteau, Jean-Philippe] Univ Namur, Namur, Belgium",Paris School of Economics; University of Namur,"Bourguignon, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",francois.bourguignon@psemail.eu,,,,,,,44,2,2,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

Two single-product firms compete in prices and coverage for a new technology. In equilibrium, one firm covers a larger territory than its competitor with the new technology, leading to single-product and multi-product zones, and sets a higher uniform price. If the firms merge, the merged entity can set different prices and coverage for the two products. We find that the merger raises prices and total coverage, but reduces the coverage of the multi-product zone. We also show that the merger can increase total welfare and consumer welfare.

Using a large sample of EMs and after dampening the endogeneity of the adoption of IT using a selection on observables, we find that IT countries on average have a relatively more flexible exchange rate regime than other EMs. However, the flexibility of the exchange rate regime shows strong heterogeneity among IT countries. IT countries with low trade and financial openness and with a large share of external debt exhibit a lower exchange rate flexibility than others. Moreover, the marginal effect of IT adoption on the exchange rate flexibility increases with the duration of the IT regime in place, and with the propensity scores to adopt it.","[Ebeke, Christian; Fouejieu, Armand] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Fouejieu, A (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",afouejieu@imf.org,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Specifically, it measures public preferences for improving the quality (protection) of the Pagasitikos coastal area in Greece. In doing so we explore the influence of environmental attitudes on preferences and people's willingness to pay (WTP) for coastal zone conservation. The methodology involves use of principal component and cluster analyses together with logistic regressions. Various demographic variables (such as education and income) together with people's preferences for coastal zones are shown to have a strong impact on their WTP. In a second stage of the analysis, people who accepted the CVM scenario results were grouped into two cohorts to illustrate the different attitudes to coastal zone management and ecological issues.

This paper explores the heterogeneous treatment effects of a DSM program on residential gas consumption across different groups of households categorised by their socio-economic and household characteristics. The program was employed in Ireland's Smart Metering Gas Consumer Behavioural Trial and the demand stimuli tested consisted of informational feedback on a household's gas usage. The paper also investigates the impact of the stimuli over time and across the distribution of daily household gas consumption. The demand stimuli are found to have very different effects across the socio-economic and dwelling characteristics of the households with older and larger households and dwellings revealed to be much more responsive to the feedback.

In particular, coal, as a pollution-intensive energy, is the main source of energy for China. With this in mind, it is the time to ask what the impacts of this reform would be on Chinese economy. A computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is applied to explore the impact of a 5% ad valorem coal resource tax on Chinese economy under four scenarios involving distinguished electricity pricing mechanisms and tax revenue recycling scheme by deducting consumption tax. Simulation results show that levying ad valorem tax will reduce the output of energy-intensive industries with minor negative impact on economy. A consumption tax deduction can offset the negative impact on real GDP and help the economy to restructure. The concern that reform will push up inflation is unnecessary, even under the market price mechanism of electricity. In terms of winners, export-oriented industries benefit when no tax revenue recycling, while industries producing private consumption goods benefit when ad valorem coal resource tax revenue is used to deduct consumption tax.","[Liu, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, 15 Zhongguancun Beiyitiao, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Meifang] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, 15 Zhongguancun Beiyitiao, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",liuyu@casipm.ac.cn; zhou@bit.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473242]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFA0602500],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71473242), and is part of the projects funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Project No. 2016YFA0602500).",,22,3,3,4,40,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The results show that developing countries with high inequality tend to have higher levels of domestic credit and that domestic credit booms increase the probability of banking crises. We also find that developing economies display direct channels from inequality to banking crises without an association with credit booms. We find no consistent evidence that income inequality contributes to banking crises in advanced economies. In developing countries, the probability of banking crises increases dramatically as income inequality levels increase: The probability of a systemic banking crisis within three years, is 9.5% when the Gini is as low as 0.2 in developing countries and increases to 57.4% when the Gini is 0.4.

The empirical results support strong spatial interaction and yardstick competition in public spending. Interactive behavior among the states has been found to be consistent and conditional on per capita income, fiscal transfers, infrastructure, literacy and population density. Interaction arising from yardstick competition significantly affects public spending decisions. The present study realizes the need for a well-developed and comprehensive network to strengthen the interdependence in public spending among the states for higher welfare gain.","[Sofi, Arfat Ahmad; Sasidharan, Subash] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Sofi, AA (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",aasofi50@gmail.com; subash@iitm.ac.in,"sasidharan, subash/AAH-4781-2020; Sofi, Arfat Ahmad/AAR-9842-2020","sasidharan, subash/0000-0002-6164-6417; Sofi, Arfat Ahmad/0000-0003-1168-1369",,,,,37,4,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

We find that the shadow productivity trend is endogenous, in the sense that it is an exact function of model parameters and the other three trends. We also document that, in order to be consistent with observed (real-world) trend growths, the shadow sector needs to exhibit increasing returns to scale, which is contrary to the standard procedure of imposing decreasing returns to this sector. We apply our methodology to a set of seven Latin American and Asian countries and document several empirical regularities that emerge from our analysis, the most important one being that the volatility of shadow sector output is considerably larger than the one in formal sector output.","[Solis-Garcia, Mario] Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Xie, Yingtong] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA",Macalester College; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Solis-Garcia, M (通讯作者)，Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",msolisga@macalester.edu; yingtong.xie@wisc.edu,,,Allianz Life Insurance Company Student Summer Research Fund,Allianz Life Insurance Company Student Summer Research Fund,"We thank seminar participants at the 2016 Workshop on Macroeconomics Research at Liberal Arts Colleges, the 2016 Southern Economic Association meetings, the University of Minnesota's Freeman Center for International Economic Policy's Global Policy Seminar and Jests Rodriguez-Lopez, Gary Krueger, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

We find that high levels of net foreign debt call for a policy with a significant degree of exchange rate management, which can constrain the extent of otherwise inefficient cross-border wealth transfers that arise due to debt valuation and risk premium effects. In particular, the central bank can improve consumer welfare by up to 0.1% of steady state consumption by responding to exchange rate fluctuations when domestic debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 100%. We also find that the ranking of optimal policy rules depends on the elasticity of import-export substitution. When home and foreign goods are complements, the responsiveness of the real exchange to shocks is muted, in turn mitigating the excessive cross-country wealth transfer associated with the debt valuation effect In this case, CPI targeting outperforms the nominal peg at high levels of debt by improving international risk sharing.","[Staveley-O'Carroll, James] Babson Coll, Econ Div, Westgate Hall,231 Forest St, Babson Pk, MA 02457 USA; [Staveley-O'Carroll, Olena M.] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, Box 45A,One Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Babson College; College of the Holy Cross,"Staveley-O'Carroll, OM (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, Box 45A,One Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",jstaveleyocarroll1@babson.edu; omykhayl@holycross.edu,"StaveleyOCarroll, Josh/KBB-2855-2024",,,,,,63,5,5,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

Motivated by this, an equilibrium model of a mixed public-private school system is studied in this paper, whereby private schools also face decreasing average cost over enrollment. In the model, households, heterogeneous with respect to exogenously specified income and child's ability, choose among a public and a private school. Private school charges tuition whereas public school is free. Public school spending is financed by income tax revenue collected from all households and the tax rate is determined via majority voting. Achievement of a child depends on its ability and education spending. Under the assumptions on the parameters of the model, a joint lognormal distribution of income and ability, and a Cobb-Douglas utility, majority voting equilibrium is numerically shown to exist. The model is calibrated to match certain statistics from the 2013 Turkish data. Using the calibrated model, we compare the benchmark for a mixed public-private school system with a pure public school system to understand the impact of shutting down some of the private schools in Turkey following the July 15 coup attempt. We find that mean achievement and variance of achievement after high school is higher and lower respectively in a pure public school system.","[Yesilirmak, Muharrem] ADA Univ, Baku, Azerbaijan; [Yesilirmak, Muharrem] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic",Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; ADA University; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Yesilirmak, M (通讯作者)，ADA Univ, Baku, Azerbaijan.;Yesilirmak, M (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",myesilirmak@ada.edu.az,"Yesilirmak, Muharrem/AAD-9126-2020",,,,,,32,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Unlike the classic Arrow-Debreu framing, firms and agents cannot contract upon the exogenous states underlying production risks. They can trade equities and any security written on the endogenous aggregate output. This financial structure is rich enough to promote efficient risk sharing among consumers. However, markets are incomplete from the production perspective, and the absence of prices for each primitive state of nature raises the question about the objective of firms.

I show that, compared to the usual case in which the potential entrant is cost-advantaged, tying is less effective against an entrant with a WTP advantage because an entrant with a large WTP advantage may be able to induce the buyer to buy both the tied bundle and the entrant's product. I also show that tying but failing to deter entry can be less costly when facing an entrant with a WTP advantage than when facing an entrant with a cost advantage. For a firm facing uncertainty about, for example, the entrant's entry costs, this makes tying a more attractive entry deterrence strategy against a WTP-advantaged entrant. These results shed light on the important policy question of which markets are most likely to be susceptible to entry-deterring tying.","[Corts, Kenneth S.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Corts, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada.",kenneth.corts@rotman.utoronto.ca,"Corts, Kenneth/KCJ-7518-2024","Corts, Kenneth Stevens/0009-0006-8146-3286",,,,,17,0,0,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Moreover, marginal employment during the unemployment spell leads to lower earnings.

We empirically explore the connections between these two facts by extending to longer horizons the methodology of Blanchard and Leigh (2013) regarding fiscal policy multipliers. Our results provide support for the presence of strong hysteresis effects of fiscal policy. The large size of the effects points in the direction of self-defeating fiscal consolidations as suggested by DeLong and Summers (2012).

Responses of the term structure factors to oil market shocks are shown to differ contingent on the underlying sources that drive oil price shocks and the country's dependence on oil. Oil market-specific demand shocks result in increases in the level factor in oil-importing countries, but have no such effect in oil-exporting countries. Oil supply disruptions have short-lived negative responses of the slope factors in the US and Canada, associated with loosening monetary policy, whilst demand side shocks tend to lead to increases the slope in all countries.

Indirect exporting depends on a combination of fixed and variable trade cost factors. We first hypothesize that firms that perceive customs, transportation, crime and legal systems as severe obstacles anticipate higher fixed costs and are more likely to export indirectly. The second hypothesis is that indirect exporting tends to be a temporary strategy. Econometric models are used to test the first hypothesis and transition matrices to test the second. In particular, probit, Heckman-probit and fractional response models are estimated to analyse the determinants of the export mode and the share of indirect exports. The results indicate that the factors that account for the fixed cost of exporting, mainly affect the decision to export indirectly (extensive margin), but some of them also affect, to a lesser extent, the amount exported indirectly (intensive margin). More specifically, factors such as customs and trade restrictions and transportation obstacles affect the extensive margin only, whereas crime affects both margins. Secondly, trade agreement membership mainly affects trade in manufactured goods, while exchange rate volatility affects positively the extensive and intensive margin of indirect exports of services. The results also indicate that firms are more likely to change their status as an indirect exporter than they are to change their status as a direct exporter or a non-exporter, which provides support to the second hypothesis.","[Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada; Johannsen, Florian] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Chair Econ Theory & Dev Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Gottingen; Universitat Jaume I,"Martínez-Zarzoso, I (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Chair Econ Theory & Dev Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.;Martínez-Zarzoso, I (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",imartin@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),I would like to thank the comments and suggestions received from two anonymous referees and from the participants in the 1st Meeting on International Economics at the University Jaume I.

Binary choice probabilities admit a strong utility representation if there exists a utility function u such that the probability of choosing a over b is a strictly increasing function of the utility difference . Debreu (Econometrica 26(3):440-444, 1958) obtained a simple set of sufficient conditions for the existence of a strong utility representation when alternatives are drawn from a suitably rich domain. Dagsvik (Math Soc Sci 55:341-370, 2008) specialised Debreu's result to the domain of lotteries (risky prospects) and provided axiomatic foundations for a strong utility representation in which the underlying utility function conforms to expected utility. This paper considers general mixture set domains. These include the domain of lotteries, but also the domain of Anscombe-Aumann acts: uncertain prospects in the form of state-contingent lotteries. For the risky domain, we show that one of Dagsvik's axioms can be weakened. For the uncertain domain, we provide axiomatic foundations for a strong utility representation in which the utility function represents invariant biseparable preferences (Ghirardato et al. in J Econ Theory 118:133-173, 2004). The latter is a wide class that includes subjective expected utility, Choquet expected utility and maxmin expected utility preferences. We prove a specialised strong utility representation theorem for each of these special cases.","[Ryan, Matthew] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Econ, 120 Mayoral Dr, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Ryan, M (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Econ, 120 Mayoral Dr, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",mryan@aut.ac.nz,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The model permits distinct rates of factor-augmenting technical change for capital and labour that distinguish between short-term versus long-term effects, as well as a non-unitary elasticity of substitution and time-varying factor shares. The advantage of the Canadian data for this purpose is that they provide a unified treatment of measurement issues that have had to be improvised in the US and European data used by previous researchers. In contrast to previous results, we find that an elasticity of substitution and distinct factor biases of technological progress are not well determined by the model. For the Canadian data, the KMW model does not appear to provide a framework that overcomes the classic Diamond-McFadden-Rodriguez non-identification result. That impossibility theorem is manifested in our findings, not overcome by them.","[Stewart, Kenneth G.] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Li, Jiang] Global Affairs Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Victoria,"Stewart, KG (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.",kstewart@uvic.ca,"Stewart, Kenneth/AAQ-8009-2021","Stewart, Kenneth/0000-0002-7575-3264; Li, Jiang Beryl/0009-0003-8355-9941",,,,,27,2,2,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Based on daily data from 17 March 2011 to 27 March 2015 and univariate GARCH-based modelling augmented with interaction terms, the main empirical results can be summarized as follows: first, the 2013 reform has improved the risk-return pattern of the Chinese aggregate stock market. Second, since the reform, Chinese sectoral stocks have become more sensitive to the price adjustments of oil products. In particular, upward price adjustments impose larger effects on stock market volatility than downward price adjustments, primarily leading to a significant reduction in stock market volatility. Counter-intuitively, the main conclusions show that China's 2013 oil product pricing reform has significantly reduced the risks of stock investments and financing, implying that a market-oriented pricing mechanism can actually decrease the financial market uncertainty surrounding domestic oil product price adjustments.

In this paper, to explore the reasonable improvement pathway of energy consumption structure in China's industrial sector, we treat fossil energy and non-fossil energy as two different factors into the production function, and conduct a stochastic frontier analysis to estimate the factor-biased degree of production technical change and the substitution elasticities between factors. The results show that the production technology of China's industrial sector is more biased to fossil energy and labor and deviated from non-fossil energy and capital. There is a substitution relationship between capital and labor, as well as labor and fossil energy, and the relationship between capital and fossil energy is complementary. We find that the energy consumption structure in most industrial sub-sectors has a large room for improvement. We propose that the Chinese government should promote the market-oriented reform of energy pricing mechanism to improve the energy consumption structure based on the differentiated characteristics of the energy consumption structures of different industrial sub-sectors.

However, the effect of industrial structural adjustment on housing prices is worthy of further investigation. In China, it would be helpful to measure this effect to coordinate housing policy and the Made in China 2025' strategy, which aims to accelerate industrial restructuring. We selected a spatial panel data model to quantify the effects of the industrial rationalisation and sophistication attributable to spatial dependence in housing prices. Estimation results show that structural adjustment has a statistically significant effect on housing prices that varies widely across regions. In descending order, the impact of industrial structure sophistication decreases in eastern, central, western, and northeastern China. This finding suggests that the government should match housing with local industry, prevent excessive real estate development in conventional agricultural areas, and pay close attention to changes in housing prices caused by increasing industrial restructuring.","[Zhang, Haiyong; Wang, Xinyu] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Haiyong] Chuzhou Univ, Sch Math & Finance, Chuzhou, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology; Chuzhou University,"Wang, XY (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou, Peoples R China.",wangxinyu@cumt.edu.cn,,"wang, xinyu/0000-0002-3019-1181; Zhang, Haiyong/0000-0003-4328-6996",Program for Scientific Research at Chuzhou University [2015GH25]; Program for Anhui Provincial Planning in Philosophy and Social Sciences [AHSKQ2016D51]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Provincial Department of Education [KJ2017A424]; Program for Excellent Young Talents in the Universities of Anhui Province [gxyq2017089],Program for Scientific Research at Chuzhou University; Program for Anhui Provincial Planning in Philosophy and Social Sciences; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Provincial Department of Education(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); Program for Excellent Young Talents in the Universities of Anhui Province,This work was supported by the Program for Scientific Research at Chuzhou University (grant number 2015GH25); the Program for Anhui Provincial Planning in Philosophy and Social Sciences (grant number AHSKQ2016D51); the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Provincial Department of Education (grant number KJ2017A424); and the Program for Excellent Young Talents in the Universities of Anhui Province (grant number gxyq2017089).,,42,6,6,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Each agent receives at most one object and has non-quasi-linear preferences over bundles, each consisting of an object and a payment. We focus on the following cases: (i) objects are linearly ranked, and if objects are equally priced, agents prefer a higher-ranked object to a lower-ranked object, or (ii) objects are partitioned into several tiers, and if objects are equally priced, agents prefer an object in the higher tier to an object in the lower tier. First, we analyze the (Walrasian) equilibrium structures in those cases. A minimum price rule assigns a minimum price equilibrium to each preference profile. Second, on the normal-rich common-object-ranking domains and normal-rich common-tiered-object domains, by assuming some conditions, we characterize minimum price rules in terms of agents' welfare, and by four properties, i.e., efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and no subsidy.

Thus, we still lack an understanding of how monetary policy and bank capital regulation interact in the presence of financial fragility. This paper aims to contribute to furthering this understanding. Specifically, we ask how the monetary policy rule should look like in the presence of cyclical capital requirements. We extend the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with bank capital in Aliaga-Diaz and Olivero by introducing price rigidities in the spirit of the New-Keynesian literature. We find that: First, anti-cyclical requirements have important stabilization properties relative to the case of constant requirements. This is true for all types of fluctuations that we study, which include those caused by productivity, preference, fiscal, monetary, and financial shocks. Second, output and consumption volatilities present in the no regulation economy can be recovered with anti-cyclical requirements as long as the policy rate responds only slightly to credit spreads. Third, monetary policy rules that respond to credit conditions also perform better in terms of welfare.

However, such measure introduces uncertainty for exporters in relation to border rejections. Shipments may fail to pass inspections and may be refused entry into the importing country. This risk is shaped by variance in the quality of the exported product, and the stringency of the border controls. We examine how the risk of rejection at European borders on safety grounds is affecting Chinese agri-food exporters. We combine information from the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed with Chinese firm-level export data by product, destination and year for the period 2000-2011. Information externalities and reputation effects are important. Border rejections amplify the turnover among firms at the extensive margin of trade.

In equilibrium, the price level is determined according to the fiscal theory of the price level. However, the market value of government debt exceeds its fundamental value. We then examine the dynamic properties of the model and show that the market value of the government debt can fluctuate even though there are no changes to current or future taxes or spending.

In one treatment arm, we allow husbands to participate in the training as well. While the impact of the training on income hiding is not significant at usual significance levels if only women are allowed to follow the training, we provide some evidence that the training invites women to hide income. Our study also suggests that allowing husbands to be present at the training intensifies this effect.

Yet we have relatively little empirical knowledge of the effects on the regional distribution of output of shocks to national macroeconomic variables such as GDP and investment This is an important gap in the empirical literature since much government macroeconomic policy seeks to influence GDP using instruments such as investment expenditure. It is likely that such national shocks will have differential regional impacts and so affect the regional output distribution. Policy-makers need to know the sign, size and timing of such effects before making policy decisions at the national level. We simulate the effects of aggregate shocks on individual provinces' GDP within the framework of a vector autoregressive (VAR) model restricted in a manner following Lastrapes (Economics Letters, 2005). We use annual data from 1980 to 2012 to estimate the model which includes 28 of China's provinces and simulate the effects on provincial outputs of shocks to aggregate output and investment. We find great diversity of effects across the provinces with discernible geographic patterns. There is evidence that output shocks benefit coastal provinces with developed industrial structure, export-exposure and less reliance on SOEs; the opposite is found for the effects of an investment shock and we conjecture that this is likely to have been the result of the strong bias in central government investment policy in favour of the interior provinces during a substantial part of our sample period.

We postulate that given this new low cost of maintaining lives, there is a moral duty to rescue those who are infected. This obligation creates a financial quasi-liability which for some African countries is comparable to their debt-to-GDP ratios. We construct a model to show that expenditure on prevention can pre-empt some of these liabilities. However, even with optimal prevention the quasi-liability is likely to remain too high to be affordable for a significant number of African countries. Extending the model to two players, we show that if the international community accepts part of the quasi-liability, as it does, it should finance a broadly equal share of prevention and treatment of future infections to mitigate moral hazard and avoid sub-optimal investment in prevention.","[Collier, Paul] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Collier, Paul] LSE, Int Growth Ctr, London, England; [Sterck, Olivier] Univ Oxford, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford,"Collier, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.;Collier, P (通讯作者)，LSE, Int Growth Ctr, London, England.",paul.collier@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Sterck, Olivier/0000-0003-3835-9388",Rush Foundation,Rush Foundation,"This work was supported by the Rush Foundation.

The starting point, scope for bargaining, and number of reforms thus jointly determine the trajectory of constitutional history. We test the relevance of this theory for Africa by analysing the formation and reform of the independence constitutions negotiated and adopted during the 1950s and early 1960s. We provide historical evidence that independence occurred in a manner consistent with the incremental reform hypothesis. After independence, constitutional bargaining continued, although the alignment of interests inside and outside government initially favoured illiberal reforms. Liberal trends re-emerged a few decades later. We provide statistical evidence of incremental reform during both post-independence sub-periods. In general, the African countries that experienced the fewest constitutional moments and the narrowest domain of bargaining in the first decades of independence tend to have better contemporary institutions than states that began with less restrictive constitutional rules and experienced more constitutional moments.","[Congleton, Roger D.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Yoo, Dongwoo] Univ Ulsan, Dept Econ, Ulsan, South Korea",West Virginia University; University of Ulsan,"Congleton, RD (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",roger.congelton@mail.wvu.edu; dongwooyoo@ulsan.ac.kr,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

In a model that is capable of matching asset pricing moments, a short-lived shock that destroys a small fraction of the economy's stock of pledgeable collateral generates a persistent recession, a stock market crash, and a flight-to-safety effect. This novel mechanism creates a tight link between the asset pricing implications of macroeconomic models and their ability to propagate and amplify the effects of macroeconomic shocks.","[Jaccard, Ivan] European Cent Bank, DG Res, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Jaccard, I (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, DG Res, Frankfurt, Germany.",ivan.jaccard@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,108,3,3,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

By using a panel data investigation over 1970-2015, we check whether the trade of these countries with developed economies (using the proxy of G7 countries) and the rest of the world affects life expectancy and the infant mortality rate. We also assess the moderating effect of governmental corruption. Our findings show two interesting results. First, trade openness has a positive effect on health in the MENA region as it reduces the infant mortality rate and boosts life expectancy for both men and women. Second, better control over corruption and more focus on trade with developed countries would lead to more technology and information spillovers, which positively affect the health sector.","[Jawadi, Fredj; Kacem, Abdeljaoued] Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91000 Evry, France; [El Gouddi, Sami] Ctr Etud & Rech Econ & Sociales, Tunis, Tunisia; [Ftiti, Zied] EDC Paris Business Sch, OCRE Lab, Def 1, Courbevoie, France; [Ftiti, Zied] Univ Tunis, ISGT, LR GEF2A, Tunis 1002, Tunisia",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite de Tunis,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91000 Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,"Ftiti, Zied/J-6533-2019","Ftiti, Zied/0000-0002-6216-1104; JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,28,7,8,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Furthermore, we show how the stereotype survives and even gets reinforced.

We find that only 15.1 percent of the decline in goods-sector employment from 1992 to 2012 stems from US trade deficits; most of the decline is due to differential productivity growth.

The paper contrasts a potentially innovative cooperative approach with the standard coercive approach. Empirical results show that the effectiveness of enforcement at inducing better environmental management depends on the overall regulatory enforcement approach. For example, greater cooperation undermines the effectiveness of more severe enforcement forms. Specifically, as the environmental enforcement approach becomes more cooperative, the effectiveness of federal inspections and monetary penalties decreases. These results generally demonstrate that a cooperative enforcement approach proves less effective than a coercive approach.

However, the support for these findings is much weaker when using a multivariate framework, in which case we find more evidence of stationary behavior.

This paper, based on multiple regression equations, outlines the direction and intensity of the dependence, using data arising from an opinion poll, covering an 8-year period, carried out on an average population of 8921 individuals. In essence, the present application reveals, an appropriate method for acquiring a higher market share, to its largest extent, the orientation towards consumer and product, price being a subsidiary instrument, specific only to companies trying to maintain themselves in the market.

This paper uses a generalization of a two-good wealth accumulation equation to estimate the evolution of the national wealth-income ratio, and finds that, similarly to the European evidence, the ratio rises from about 280 percent in the 1970s to about 500 percent on the eve of the current financial crisis. On average, during 1974-96, the saving-induced wealth growth cancels out the capital losses, whereas in the subsequent decade, 1997-2007, the balance changes considerably when the saving effect vanishes and the prolonged capital gains result in a rising wealth-income ratio. During the recession, income falls faster than wealth. The results remain robust to several alterations of the benchmark framework.","[Charalampidis, Nikolaos] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Charalampidis, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",charalan@uci.edu,,,"Onassis Foundation, Scholarship Program","Onassis Foundation, Scholarship Program","I am deeply grateful to Thomas Piketty and Stergios Skaperdas for their guidance and advice.

This paper investigates intergenerational occupational mobility using a novel genealogical dataset for settler South Africa, spanning its transition from an agricultural to an early industrialised society (1800-1909). We identify fathers and sons for whom we have complete information on occupational attainment. We follow a two-generation discrete approach to measure changes in both absolute and relative mobility over time. Consistent with qualitative evidence of a shift away from agriculture as the economy's dominant sector, we see the farming class shrinking and the skilled and professional classes growing. Controlling for changes in the structure of the labour market over time, we find increasing mobility, becoming significant after the discovery of minerals in 1868. We find this mobility particularly for semi-skilled workers but virtually no improved mobility for sons of farmers. We also test hypotheses related to the mobility prospects for first-born sons and sons of immigrants.","[Cilliers, Jeanne] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden; [Fourie, Johan] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, LEAP, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Lund University; Stellenbosch University,"Cilliers, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden.",jeanne.cilliers.7367@ekh.lu.se,,"Cilliers, Jeanne/0000-0001-7683-6195",Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA); Elite Fund of the EMS Faculty at Stellenbosch University; National Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF); PSPPD project,Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA); Elite Fund of the EMS Faculty at Stellenbosch University; National Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF)(National Research Foundation - South Africa); PSPPD project,"We would like to thank Rulof Burger, Martin Dribe, Patrizio Piraino, Martine Mariotti, Shula Marks, Neil Rankin, Servaas van der Berg, Dieter von Fintel, conference participants at the South African Historical Society meetings in Stellenbosch, the African Economic History meetings in Wageningen and the World Economic History Congress 2015 in Kyoto, and seminar participants at the University of Cape Town, Nijmegen University, Stellenbosch University, and the Centre for Economic Demography at Lund University for helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.

We collect data on bank and total credit to the private sector in emerging markets and evaluate the signalling performance by using the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC). Our results show that nominal credit growth and the change in the credit-to-GDP ratio have the best signalling properties and significantly outperform the credit-to-GDP gap in almost all specifications for policy-relevant horizons. These findings are in stark contrast with the results on advanced economies, where the credit-to-GDP gap is the single best performing EWI. Our results emphasize the importance of caution when applying statistical methods calibrated for advanced markets to emerging economies.","[Gersl, Adam] Joint Vienna Inst, Mariahilfer Str 97, A-1060 Vienna, Austria; [Gersl, Adam; Jasova, Martina] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Gersl, A (通讯作者)，Joint Vienna Inst, Mariahilfer Str 97, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.",adam.gersl@gmail.com; martina.jasova@fsv.cuni.cz,"Gersl, Adam/HGB-2925-2022; Jasova, Martina/U-7971-2018","Gersl, Adam/0000-0002-0370-4148;",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P402/12/G097],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"The authors thank Jan Babecky, Mariarosaria Comunale, Petr Jakubik, Christian Schmieder, participants at the CNB-IES Conference Challenges for Financial Stability in Europe, Prague, Oct 6-7, 2016, and two anonymous referees for useful comments.

First, we introduce the so-called airport cost pooling game, which is a generalization of the well-known class of airport game (Littlechild and Thompson, 1977). We determine the Shapley value of this class of game through a decomposition method for this game into unanimity cost games, exploiting the linearity of the Shapley value. Second, we characterize the Shapley value for airport cost pooling game by applying the so-called collective balanced contributions property, meaning that for any two airplanes from two different airlines, the withdrawal of one airline leads to the same loss to the airplane in the other.

While the recent crisis has exposed some weaknesses in these models, I argue that DSGE models currently have few contenders to replace them as core models in the policy process. The prominent role for forward-looking behaviour and their simplicity make DSGE models very suitable for policy analysis. In addition, DSGE models are flexible enough to be used for many purposes, while other models are often more limited in terms of the questions they can address. As a result, I argue that improved DSGE models-modified to take the lessons of the recent crisis into account-will remain as a workhorse tool in many policy institutions for a long time to come.","[Linde, Jesper] Sveriges Riksbank, Stockholm, Sweden; [Linde, Jesper] CEPR, London, England",Sveriges Riksbank; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Lindé, J (通讯作者)，Sveriges Riksbank, Stockholm, Sweden.;Lindé, J (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",jesper.l.linde@gmail.com,,,,,,,64,39,42,2,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We conclude that financial inclusion contributes to reducing income inequality to a significant degree, while the size of the financial sector does not. Although our results are still preliminary and constrained by data limitations, they still bear significant policy implications. More specifically, fostering financial inclusion has one more important by-product, which had hardly been analyzed yet, namely reducing income inequality. More specifically, given the broad definition of financial inclusion used in our analysis, promoting financial inclusion implies facilitating the use of credit to low-income households, as well as granting credit to small and medium-sized enterprises.","[Martinez Turegano, David] Bank Spain, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia Herrero, Alicia] BRUEGEL, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Garcia Herrero, Alicia] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Banco de Espana; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Martinez Turegano, D (通讯作者)，Bank Spain, Madrid, Spain.",elalambiq@gmail.com; alicia@ust.hk,,,,,,,16,37,40,9,38,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Furthermore, Smith models, in part, his distinction between natural and violent on Aristotle's use. Smith explains the distinction in his study of the history of physics and astronomy. In those fields there is, at least going back to Aristotle, an idealized view of 'natural' motion or movement versus interfered or violent motion or movement, which has changed over time, particularly from ancient to classical physics and astronomy. Smith used this sense of 'natural' particularly when dealing with movement in The Wealth of Nations: especially the movement of goods, capital and labour. In Smith's system, the natural non-violent movement of humans, or actions generated by humans, will lead to so-called natural prices, natural rates of profit and natural wage rates around which market prices, profit and wage rates will 'gravitate'.","[Pack, Spencer J.] Connecticut Coll, New London, CT 06320 USA; [Schliesser, Eric] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schliesser, Eric] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",Connecticut College; University of Amsterdam; Ghent University,"Schliesser, E (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, POB 15578, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Nescio2@yahoo.com,,,,,,,62,6,6,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

It exploits the external resources and capabilities of its own network system in order to improve business performance and increase technological capabilities. It takes inspiration from successful innovative products in order to create a similar product but with technical improvements and lower production costs. In the current management literature there are different points of view regards to the competitive advantage to be innovator or imitator: some scholars argue that being innovator is advantageous to companies in order to dominate new market and to acquire a wide range of consumers whereas others point out that it is more efficient and successful to follow the first comer. However none has been studied how the combination between innovation and imitation may affect firms' performance through adpting knowledge exploitation approach and creating relationship with firms' Innovation Network System.

We use the quantile-on-quantile (QQ) approach of Sim and Zhou (2015) to explore some nuanced features of the energy-growth nexus and to capture the relationship in its entirety. The results show a positive association between economic growth and energy consumption, with considerable variations across economic states in each country. A weak effect of economic growth on energy consumption is noted for the lower quantiles of economic growth in China, India, Germany and France, which suggests that energy as an input has less importance at low levels of economic growth. A weak effect of economic growth on energy consumption is also noted for the highest quantiles of income in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Korea, which indicates that energy demand decreases with the increase in economic growth as these countries have become more energy efficient The weakest effect of energy consumption on economic growth is observed at lower quantiles of energy consumption in China, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

Existing literature is conflicted: recommending both to invest them at home, and save them in sovereign wealth funds abroad. I reconcile these views by combining a stochastic model of precautionary savings with a deterministic model of a capital-scarce resource exporter. I show that both developed and developing countries should build an offshore Volatility Fund, but refrain from depleting it when oil prices fall because it cannot be known when, or if, they will rise again. Instead, consumption should adjust and only the interest on the fund should be consumed. To do this I develop a parsimonious framework that nests a variety of existing results as special cases, which I present in four principles: for capital-abundant countries, i) smooth consumption using a Future Generations Fund, and ii) build a Volatility Fund quickly, then leave it alone; and for capital scarce countries, iii) consume, invest and deleverage, and iv) invest part of the Volatility Fund domestically, then leave it alone.","[Wills, Samuel] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Oxford, England; [Wills, Samuel] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wills, Samuel] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Oxford; University of Sydney; Australian National University,"Wills, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Oxford, England.;Wills, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Wills, S (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",samuel.wills@sydney.edu.au,,,BP; ESRC [ES/K0093031/1],BP; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I would like to thank Martin Ellison, Wouter den Haan, John Muellbauer, Peter Neary, David Vines, Tony Venables, Rick van der Ploeg and seminar participants at the University of Oxford for helpful comments.

Analysis is provided applying statistical analysis and ordered logit models based on the individual data from the Polish Labour Force Survey. The main determinants of wages in Poland are: gender, age or job seniority, level of education, size of firm and occupation. However, the influence of these factors in the following periods and samples (containing all, female and male employees) may be different. Women earn less than men in all education classes and in all NACE branches (NACE - Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) branches and this disparity has increased over time.

We decompose the effect of changes in banks' cost of funds on aggregate borrowing into the product of banks' marginal propensity to lend (MPL) to borrowers and those borrowers' marginal propensity to borrow (MPB), aggregated over all borrowers in the economy. We apply our framework by estimating heterogeneous MPBs and MPLs in the U.S. credit card market. Using panel data on 8.5 million credit cards and 743 credit limit regression discontinuities, we find that the MPB is declining in credit score, falling from 59% for consumers with FICO scores below 660 to essentially zero for consumers with FICO scores above 740. We use a simple model of optimal credit limits to show that a bank's MPL depends on a small number of parameters that can be estimated using our credit limit discontinuities. For the lowest FICO score consumers, higher credit limits sharply reduce profits from lending, limiting banks' optimal MPL to these consumers. The negative correlation between MPB and MPL reduces the impact of changes in banks' cost of funds on aggregate household borrowing, and highlights the importance of frictions in bank-borrower interactions for understanding the pass-through of credit expansions.","[Agarwal, Sumit] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; Off Comptroller Currency, Washington, DC USA; Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY USA; CEPR, Cambridge, MD USA",Georgetown University; United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Agarwal, S (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,"Agarwal, Sumit/F-4836-2012","Agarwal, Sumit/0000-0002-8305-3786",,,,,77,65,74,6,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Each firm chooses one of three possible strategies for running its advertising campaign. The two rival firms care only about capturing a dominant share of the relevant market. Hence, if a firm expects to capture dominant market share with probability p is an element of [0, 1], then its payoff in the game we study is also p. Our analysis leads to four results.

Females and high income people are the target groups for increased visitation, while among the non-patrons, the ethnic majority is another potential clientele. Somewhat surprising is the finding that neither patrons nor non-patrons see the museum as having significant tourist value, and contrary to prospect theory, there is a preference for enhancing the museum's services over keeping the museum.

We provide insights into the potential added value of common unemployment insurance as a fiscal risk sharing device which crucially hinges on its ability to provide interregional smoothing. Running counterfactual simulations based on microdata for the period 2000-2013, we find that 10% of the income fluctuations due to transitions into and out of unemployment would have been cushioned through interregional smoothing at EA-level. Smoothing gains are unevenly distributed across countries, ranging from % in Malta to 22% in Latvia. Our results suggest that the interregional smoothing potential is as important as intertemporal smoothing through debt. We find that four member states would have been either a permanent net contributor or net recipient. Contingent benefits could limit the degree of cross-country redistribution, but might reduce desired insurance effects. We also study heterogeneous effects within countries and discuss moral hazard issues at the level of individuals, the administration and economic policy.","[Dolls, Mathias; Neumann, Dirk; Peichl, Andreas] ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Dolls, Mathias; Neumann, Dirk; Peichl, Andreas] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Fuest, Clemens] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Fuest, Clemens; Peichl, Andreas] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Neumann, Dirk] OECD, Paris, France; [Peichl, Andreas] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Munich; Ifo Institut; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Mannheim,"Dolls, M (通讯作者)，ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.;Dolls, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",dolls@zew.de,"Peichl, Andreas/D-7829-2018",,European Research Council under the European Union [269831]; European Research Council (ERC) [269831] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This paper uses EUROMOD version F6.0+.

This article provides ameta-analysis of prior experimental research and reports the results of a new experiment to elucidate how cooperation varies with the environment in this canonical game. We describe forces that affect initial play (formation of cooperation) and unraveling (breakdown of cooperation). First, contrary to the backward induction prediction, the parameters of the repeated game have a significant effect on initial cooperation. We identify how these parameters impact the value of cooperation-as captured by the size of the basin of attraction of always defect-to account for an important part of this effect. Second, despite these initial differences, the evolution of behavior is consistent with the unraveling logic of backward induction for all parameter combinations. Importantly, despite the seemingly contradictory results across studies, this article establishes a systematic pattern of behavior: subjects converge to use threshold strategies that conditionally cooperate until a threshold round; conditional on establishing cooperation, the first defection round moves earlier with experience. Simulation results generated from a learning model estimated at the subject level provide insights into the long-term dynamics and the forces that slow down the unraveling of cooperation.","[Embrey, Matthew] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England; NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of Sussex; New York University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Embrey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,,"Embrey, Matthew/0000-0002-3423-4142",National Science Foundation [SES-1225779]; Center for Experimental Social Science,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Center for Experimental Social Science,"We thank the editor, anonymous referees, James Andreoni, Yoella Bereby-Meyer, Russell Cooper, Pedro Dal Bo, Douglas DeJong, Robert Forsythe, Drew Fudenberg, Daniel Friedman, P.J.

We study the business-cycle implications of this phenomenon in an estimated dynamic general equilibrium model with multiple credit-constrained agents. A progressive relaxation of credit constraints initially leads to both higher macroeconomic volatility and stronger comovement between debt and real activity. This pattern reverses at LTV ratios not far from those currently observed in many advanced economies, due to credit constraints becoming non-binding more often. The non-monotonic relationship between credit market conditions and macroeconomic fluctuations carries important lessons for regulatory and macroprudential policymakers. While reducing the average LTV ratio may unintentionally increase macroeconomic volatility, a countercyclical LTV ratio proves to be successful in dampening business cycle fluctuations and, most importantly, avoiding dramatic output drops.

To be able to pursue a deceptive strategy, however, a subject must be aware of the misreporting opportunity. This paper provides experimental evidence on the role of the time dimension for dishonest decision-making and for the cognition process of the chance to deceive. We conduct a laboratory experiment of self-serving deceptive behavior which combines two exogenously varied levels of reflection time with a cognition process about the deception opportunity. We find that time pressure leads to more honesty compared to sufficient contemplation time. More importantly, decomposing misreporting into its two components, i.e., the cognition process of the misreporting opportunity and the conscious decision to misreport, reveals that more reflection time increases awareness of the misreporting opportunity. However, more time has no effect on the conscious decision of whether to misreport or not. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This monotonic investment response contrasts with the empirical evidence that suggests a rather hump-shaped investment behavior. In this paper, I present a two-country general equilibrium model that generates hump-shaped investment responses from labor market frictions. In the model, I decompose investment into tradable and non tradable components and show that an increase in the growth rate of a country results in scarcities of the non-tradable components which raise the relative price of investment goods. These scarcities occur because labor is unable to reallocate quickly between sectors within economies. This mechanism has two main implications. First, the induced movement in relative prices equates cross-country returns to capital and thus greatly reduces initial investment. Second, domestic saving now plays a more important role in financing investment, inducing a co-movement between these variables. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The gender differences in preferences explain at least a quarter of the early career gender wage gap.","[Wiswall, Matthew] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Bureau of Economic Research; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Wiswall, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD047873] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,46,152,200,6,116,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The procedure is flexible and simple to implement. Firstly, a quasi-closed form pricing formula for European options in the G.A.R.C.H. diffusion model is derived. This result greatly eases the computational burden for computing option prices, and well suited for our model estimation. Then, based upon the joint data, we develop an efficient importance sampling-based maximum likelihood (E.I.S.-M.L.) estimation method for the objective and risk-neutral parameters of the G.A.R.C.H. diffusion model and a particle filter algorithm for latent state variable. Hence, this allows us to infer the market prices of risks that link the objective measure and the risk-neutral measure. Finally, we illustrate our approach using actual data on the Hang Seng Index (H.S.I.) and index warrant prices. The results show that both the return and volatility risks are priced by the market. Moreover, an option pricing study demonstrates that the market price of the volatility risk plays an important role in fitting option prices.","[Wu, Xinyu; Zhou, Hailin] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Bengbu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Anhui University of Finance & Economics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS","Wu, XY (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Bengbu, Peoples R China.",xywu.aufe@gmail.com,"li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023","Wang, Shouyang/0000-0001-5773-998X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501001, 71101001]; M.O.E.

Based on the general valuation model, stock return or price should reflect the firm's fundamental value and we expect CARs to show a close relationship with the firm's fundamental value over a long horizon. However, no distinct relationship between CARs and operating performances is found. The stock price reactions which are temporary and unrelated to the firm's fundamental values may be explained by market inefficiency in Korea.","[Ahn, Hyeonmi] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Doyeon] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 38541, Gyeongbuk, South Korea",Yonsei University; Yeungnam University,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 38541, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.",dkim@ynu.ac.kr,,,,,,,48,1,1,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Unlike standard unit root tests, which have low power, especially in cases where the series is characterized by a fractional process, the long-memory approach provides an exact measure of the degree of persistence. However, long-memory models are known to overestimate the degree of persistence of the series in the presence of structural breaks. We show that regime changes do exist in both the mean and trend of the current account to GDP ratios. Thus, we test persistence allowing for both smooth and sharp breaks. Our methodology also allows any number of sharp breaks, whereas standard unit root tests only permit either one or two breaks. Hence, our approach is more general and more robust to misspecifications caused by the omission of breaks than standard methods. We show that current accounts are sustainable in both groups of countries, with the G7 and South Africa displaying long-memory behaviour.","[Andre, Christophe] OECD, Econ Dept, Paris, France; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Turkey; [Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Gil-Alana, Luis Alberiko] Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, Campus Univ, Pamplona, Spain; [Gil-Alana, Luis Alberiko] Univ Navarra, NCID, Campus Univ, Pamplona, Spain; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Eastern Mediterranean University; Feng Chia University; University of Navarra; University of Navarra; University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",Rangan.Gupta@up.ac.za,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196",,,,,70,6,6,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In the absence of a dominant alternative, the decision maker may stick to the default even if it is dominated capturing the phenomenon of choice procrastination in the presence of difficult choices. We show that the prevalence of difficult-choice situations in equilibrium is related to the magnitude of the choice procrastination effect. In general, features of the choice procedure that are typically viewed as biases tend to protect the decision maker, in the sense that they encourage competitors to offer higher-value alternatives in equilibrium.

Actual savings and all dimensions of psychological preparedness for FPR were positively predicted by retirement financial literacy and self-rated financial literacy. Moreover, we found that perceived FPR emotional load decreases with education, and perceived FPR task complexity diminishes with age. Further, increasing income was predictive of a higher subjective FPR competence and a perception of FPR as less stressful. Finally, professional experience in the financial domain was linked to a higher self-assessed capability in terms of FPR, but also with a lower personal FPR engagement.

A dynamic multi-country, multi-sector computable general equilibrium trade model with modeling of the dual-dual economy and with a consistent tariff aggregator is used to simulate a series of new scenarios that include updated information on the agreement. We also go beyond estimating macro-level economic effects to analyze the impacts on poverty.

The impact on poverty indicators in Ghana and Nigeria would be marginal. From the perspective of WA countries, this study supports the view that recent EU concessions are not sufficient and that domestic fiscal reforms are needed in WA countries themselves.","[Bouet, Antoine; Laborde, David; Traore, Fousseini] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Bouët, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",a.bouet@cgiar.org,,,"European Commission, Directorate-General for Trade","European Commission, Directorate-General for Trade","European Commission, Directorate-General for Trade.",,33,7,7,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In particular, we discuss the emergence of a deflationary safety trap equilibrium with endogenous risk premia. It is an acute form of a liquidity trap, in which the shortage of a specific form of assets, safe assets, as opposed to a general shortage of assets, is the fundamental driving force. At the Zero Lower Bound, our model has a Keynesian cross representation, in which net safe asset supply plays the role of an aggregate demand shifter. Essentially, safety traps correspond to liquidity traps in which the emergence of an endogenous risk premium significantly alters the connection between macroeconomic policy and economic activity. Helicopter drops of money, safe public debt issuances, swaps of private risky assets for safe public debt, or increases in the inflation target, stimulate aggregate demand and output, while forward guidance is less effective. The safety trap can be arbitrarily persistent, as in the secular stagnation hypothesis, despite the existence of infinitely lived assets.","[Caballero, Ricardo J.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Caballero, Ricardo J.; Farhi, Emmanuel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Farhi, Emmanuel] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Farhi, E (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Farhi, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Emmanuel.farhi@gmail.com,,,,,,,66,108,118,4,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Using data from the Spanish Labour Trends Survey for the period 2001-2011, we study the factors influencing the decision to use online recruitment and explore the differences between Internet and eight traditional recruitment channels. Our results show that the adoption of the Internet monotonically increases over the sample period, when Internet becomes more universal and even in periods with excess of applicants. Large firms operating in information-intensive activities, and located in regions more developed and with better infrastructures are more likely to search for new employees online. We also find that Internet and traditional recruitment methods follow different patterns, especially when using personal referrals and public employment services. Our results suggest the presence of network externalities derived from the increase number of compatible online job seekers.","[Campos, Raquel] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Arrazola, Maria; de Hevia, Jose] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain",University of Kent; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Arrazola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain.",maria.arrazola@urjc.es,"Arrazola, María/AAP-8781-2021; de Hevia, Jose/AAP-8798-2021","Arrazola, María/0000-0002-4407-9510; de Hevia, Jose/0000-0002-8730-6269",,,,,38,2,7,3,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It finds that export quality has only been increasing with a higher variation in export values among existing exports in low- and lower-middle-income countries. It also observes that export quality has been increasing with both a higher variation in export values among existing exports and new products exported in upper-middle- and high-income countries.

In a sample of Italian manufacturing firms (n = 2163), analysis reveals that the new entrants' high innovative activity is mainly driven by the new CEO's innovation propensity, which is strictly dependent on his tenure. Likewise, the lower innovation activity observed in mature firms is mostly explained by the dynamics of the product's lifecycle and the CEO's tenure. More generally, the existence of a negative relationship between innovation and firm age is questioned, as controlling for time-related variables that overlap during the company's lifecycle -product age and CEO's tenure - turns the relationship positive. Finally, the innovative behavior of incumbent companies turns out to be dependent on the renewal abilities of newly appointed external CEOs, whereas CEOs from within the family play a minor role.","[Cucculelli, Marco] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60100 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Cucculelli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60100 Ancona, Italy.",m.cucculelli@univpm.it,"Cucculelli, Marco/J-2479-2019","Cucculelli, Marco/0000-0003-0035-9454",,,,,87,41,43,2,52,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Furtado's work has recently been revisited by several authors in the history of economic thought. This text explores Furtado's response to the perceived failure of development theory to explain the reality of underdeveloped nations in the late 1970s. Expanding the scope of analysis and assigning culture a pivotal role helped explain the dynamics of development and underdevelopment. This theoretical movement occurred as development economics was drifting out of the mainstream of economic theory. Unlike the discussion of underdevelopment in the 1950s, this discussion of creativity and dependence encountered an adverse intellectual landscape despite being one of Furtado's most original contributions. This theoretical turning point is interestingly connected to Furtado's second term at the University of Cambridge. Like the first discussion of underdevelopment during the 1950s, which was critical to the formulation of his historical-structural analytical method, the discussions of the 1970s also led to this Brazilian author's vivid and interesting contributions to the field of development economics.","[Cunha, Alexandre M.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Cedeplar, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Cunha, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Minas Gerais, FACE Dept Econ, Ave Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",alexandre@cedeplar.ufmg.br,"Cunha, Alexandre/I-2930-2013; Britto, Gustavo/K-2334-2016","Cunha, Alexandre/0000-0002-9949-0112; Britto, Gustavo/0000-0002-5285-3684",CNPq (the Brazilian National Research Council); FAPEMIG (the State of Minas Gerais Research Foundation),CNPq (the Brazilian National Research Council)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEMIG (the State of Minas Gerais Research Foundation)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)),"Cedeplar/UFMG.

Their criticisms include preposterous claims such as that the crack epidemic has had no effect on murder and that the statistically significant finding that RTC laws increase the murder rate in the post-crack period should be disregarded because the analysis over a shorter period lacks the power to discern an effect (since it clearly did discern an effect). They also attempt to undermine the showing that RTC laws increase murder by providing an alternative calculation of the standard error that reduces the p-value to .056, without appearing to realize that this would still be strong evidence that RTC laws are harmful. Finally, they raise the challenging econometric question of whether state-specific trends should be included in panel data models, but a synthetic controls analysis would be a better approach and it strongly confirms that RTC laws increase violent crime (Donohue, Aneja, and Weber 2018).","[Donohue, John J.] Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Donohue, JJ (通讯作者)，Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",donohue@law.stanford.edu,,,,,,,17,0,2,0,16,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

Using data available for the Sacramento area in the United States for 2013, we estimate marginal emission rates of electricity and marginal price of electricity provided for charging PEVs at different times of the day. As the marginal emission rates and wholesale electricity price have different daily patterns, there is a trade-off between emission and charging cost. Moreover, the estimates in the literature of the social costs for the most important emission, CO2, vary substantially, implying that the social cost of charging PEVs vary with the assumed cost. Simulations show that the charging time of lowest social costs for PEVs is found to be at midnight if the social cost of CO2 is not very high (<$90/ton), however, we find this pattern changes with an increase in the social cost of CO2.

In contrast to existing reviews on long panels, we discuss models with both individual and time effects, split-panel jackknife bias corrections, unbalanced panels, distribution and quantile effects, and other extensions. Understanding and correcting the incidental parameter bias caused by the estimation of many fixed effects are our main focuses, and the unifying theme is that the order of this bias is given by the simple formula p/n for all models discussed, with p being the number of estimated parameters and n the total sample size.","[Fernandez-Val, Ivan] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Weidner, Martin] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Weidner, Martin] Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, London WC1E 7AE, England",Boston University; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Fernández-Val, I (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ivanf@bu.edu; m.weidner@ucl.ac.uk,"Fernandez-Val, Ivan/G-3455-2016","Weidner, Martin/0000-0001-6135-6164",ESRC [ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,121,32,34,2,25,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

It shapes urban areas, defines their relationships with neighboring regions, intensifies economic flows and exacerbates energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper sets out a proposal for an innovative commuting satellite account (CSA), integrated in a multi-regional input-output model. This framework combines commuting activities with regional distribution of income, distinct household consumption structures, real estate renting activities and the energy consumption and environmental flows incorporated in the different industries. To assess the opportunity costs of commuting, the CSA framework is applied to the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. The socio-economic-environmental impacts of a scenario in which commuters become non-commuters by moving their residence to the municipality in which they work are estimated. The analysis indicates that: commuting, in general, induces significant economic and environmental opportunity costs. Finally, the adoption of policy-oriented recommendations contributing to limit sprawling in metropolitan regions is discussed.","[Ferreira, Joao-Pedro; Ramos, Pedro; Cruz, Luis; Barata, Eduardo] Univ Coimbra, CeBER, Coimbra, Portugal; [Ferreira, Joao-Pedro; Ramos, Pedro; Cruz, Luis; Barata, Eduardo] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Coimbra, Portugal; [Ferreira, Joao-Pedro] Res Unit Governance Competitiveness & Publ Polici, Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Ferreira, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, CeBER, Coimbra, Portugal.;Ferreira, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Coimbra, Portugal.;Ferreira, JP (通讯作者)，Res Unit Governance Competitiveness & Publ Polici, Aveiro, Portugal.",joao.ferreira@fe.uc.pt,"ferreira, joao/JJE-8433-2023; Barata, Eduardo/K-2165-2017; Ferreira, João Pedro/AAB-2489-2022; Cruz, Luis/M-4259-2013; Ferreira, Joao/HNP-5121-2023; Barata, Eduardo/AAM-4579-2020","Barata, Eduardo/0000-0003-2609-4642; Ferreira, João Pedro/0000-0002-2304-6138; Cruz, Luis/0000-0002-9280-1715; Barata, Eduardo/0000-0003-2609-4642; Ferreira, Joao Pedro/0000-0002-6726-7856; Ramos, Pedro/0000-0002-6656-7689",Project EMSURE - Energy and Mobility for Sustainable Regions; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/115133/2016]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/115133/2016] Funding Source: FCT,Project EMSURE - Energy and Mobility for Sustainable Regions; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This work has been carried out under the Energy for Sustainability Initiative of the University of Coimbra and supported by Project EMSURE - Energy and Mobility for Sustainable Regions and by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia under a post-doctoral grant [SFRH/BPD/115133/2016].,,26,10,12,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Such a characterization misses an essential aspect of a social science, namely reactivity, i.e. human beings systematically respond to economic data, and in particular to interventions by economic policy, in a foreseeable way. To illustrate this finding, the paper uses examples from different fields: happiness policy, world heritage policy, and science policy. Reactivity requires a different policy approach from governments claiming to maximize social welfare in the form of happiness. What is needed are basic constitutional provisions, or rules of the game, decided behind the veil of ignorance. Moral considerations must enter when the basic rules setting the way in which individuals interact are determined. Moral aspects are also indispensable as guidance to individuals when they take decisions within these rules. It is most unlikely that intelligent learning machines can fulfill this task in an acceptable manner.","[Frey, Bruno S.] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Frey, Bruno S.] CREMA, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Frey, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland.;Frey, BS (通讯作者)，CREMA, Zurich, Switzerland.",bruno.frey@bsfrey.ch,"Frey, Bruno/AAW-9103-2021",,,,,,42,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2520-1794,2520-1808,978-3-319-94529-3; 978-3-319-94528-6,VIRTUES ECON,Virtues Econ.,,2018,3.0,,,,,,141,150,,10.1007/978-3-319-94529-3_10,0.0,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL9EL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457322400010,0

These episodes are also associated with a persistent increase in the share of income going to the top. We investigate three channels through which these impacts could occur. First, the impact of liberalization on inequality is stronger where credit markets lack depth and financial inclusion is low; positive impacts of liberalization on poverty rates also vanish when financial inclusion is low. Second, the impact on inequality is also stronger when liberalization is followed by a financial crisis. Third, liberalization seems to alter the relative bargaining power of firms and workers: the labor share of income falls in the aftermath of capital account liberalization.","[Furceri, Davide; Loungani, Prakash] Int Monetary Fund, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Furceri, Davide] Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy",International Monetary Fund; University of Palermo,"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dfurceri@imf.org; ploungani@imf.org,,,,,,,43,68,75,5,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Using quarterly data ranging from 1996Q1 to 2014Q2, we estimate a benchmark consumption-smoothing model and an extended model that incorporates external shocks. Overall, we find that the predicted optimal CA in both the models can track the actual CA movements and the extended model performs better over the benchmark model. Further, we also find that the optimal CA is more volatile than the actual CA which implies that the capital flows have been less than optimal and thus makes an interesting case for further liberalization of the capital account. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at further liberalization of capital flows will allow larger CA deficits to achieve higher economic growth since it will help agents to further smoothen their consumption without worrying about risks associated with insolvency.","[Garg, Bhavesh; Prabheesh, K.

There is less agreement as to why. In popular discussion, fiscal policy and continued strong export demand have been championed, with less support for monetary policy. But there is little formal empirical work which disentangles the relative contributions of these three factors. It is the purpose of this paper to make a start in this direction. It does so within the framework of a small vector-autoregressive model. The main finding is that the three factors together actually exacerbated the effects of the GFC on average over the 2009-2011 period, with most of the blame falling on fiscal policy. This seemingly anomalous finding is further explored and explained by households' response to cash hand-outs which were saved and not spent; indeed, it is conjectured that they took cash hand-outs and government predictions of doom as indicators that bad times were ahead and saved rather than spent in response.

We find that currency performance is remarkably responsive to changes in investor attention. These impacts, generated rapidly, are present over the relatively long term, especially for emerging currencies, and are intensified during periods of high uncertainty. We also demonstrate that there is a prominent asymmetric effect for the impact of attention, as past currency performance also influences attention. Typically, past currency performance can determine the magnitude of the impact on current currency performance. Moreover, we confirm that investor attention has a predictive power for forecasting emerging currency performance in the out-of-sample analysis. Further, these forecasts generate substantial economic value in the framework of asset allocation. By contrast, statistical predictability and economic value do not exist in the currencies from developed markets. These results indicate that investor attention can alter currency performance and its predictability. More broadly, our study emphasizes the potential of employing investor attention for emerging currency performance forecasting applications.","[Han, Liyan; Wu, You] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Libo] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Yin, LB (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yinlibowsxbb@126.com,"Yin, Libo/Q-7525-2017; Yin, Libo/AAJ-1976-2021","Yin, Libo/0000-0003-0193-6735; Wu, You/0000-0002-2009-6674","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671193, 71401193, 71371022]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,"This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under projects Nos. 71671193, 71401193, and 71371022, and the Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics.",,58,16,16,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The purpose of this article is to focus on an area of foreign bank influence that has thus far only begun to emerge from the extant literature: the effect of foreign banks on the broader business environment in transition. In addition to improving financial intermediation and broader access to credit, has the presence of foreign financial institutions helped to shape a better business environment in the long-run? Or did foreign banks retard local institutional development and thus worsen the overall business environment? Using cointegration techniques across a sample of 21 diverse transition countries from 1983 to 2015, I find that foreign bank entry had a positive impact across business environment indicators, but with some indicators taking longer to influence than others. The policy implications are that business environments can be improved by facilitating foreign bank entry rather than restricting it.","[Hartwell, Christopher A.] Kozminski Univ, Dept Int Management, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Hartwell, CA (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Int Management, Warsaw, Poland.",chartwell@kozminski.edu.pl,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,1,,,,,19,35,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1361703,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FS6KV,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419907200002,0

With a static notion of efficiency defined for a state of competitive equilibrium, neoclassical economists study development in equilibrium frameworks, regarding underdevelopment as the consequence of market failures. How might one, who is not equipped with marginalist lenses, look at development processes as they unfold in history? Prior to the emergence of marginalism such observations abounded in the works of the so-called protectionists, where ever-evolving production complementarities figure prominently, and there were considerations of indivisibility. In the postwar era, this is present in the works of some early development economists, especially Albert Hirschman in his employment of backward and forward production linkages to characterize development processes, which are viewed as unfolding series of disequilibria. Historical sequences of events reflect path-dependence and they feedback on each other to exhibit circular and cumulative causation. One thing leads to another, or some things lead to others and so on, including institutional changes. However, the activation of linkages could encounter obstacles, with technological strangeness being one, in which case sequential policy intervention could be warranted. This article briefly considers differences with the neoclassical approach in generating policy recommendations.","[Ho, P.

In particular, economics frames efficiency as a core feature of time-value understood in a purportedly descriptive sense. Economic time-value is stripped of its normative quality, and held up for scientific investigation and brute factual description of the sort associated with criterial and natural-kind concepts. As such, economics deploys the conceptual devices such as the time-value of money in its quest to objectively ascertain in a purportedly morally-neutral fashion behaviors that are favorable to capital efficiency maximization.

While to some extent this entails failed experimentation, positive managerial attitudes also substantially contribute to a sustained use of profit sharing.

We show that older siblings causally affect younger siblings educational choices and early career earnings. We focus on critical course choices in high school and overcome the identification challenges of estimating spillover effects in education by exploiting exogenous variation in choice sets stemming from a pilot program. The pilot induced an essentially random subset of older siblings to choose advanced math-science at a lower cost, while not directly affecting the course choices of younger siblings. We find that younger siblings are 2-3 percentage points more likely to choose math science if their older sibling unexpectedly could choose math-science at a lower cost. We argue that the main influence of the pilot program on the younger siblings may be attributed to the social influence of the older sibling. Spillovers are strongest among closely spaced siblings, in particular brothers, and they have a lasting impact on the career outcomes of younger brothers. We argue that competition is likely one of the driving forces behind younger siblings conforming to their older siblings' choices.","[Joensen, Juanna Schroter] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Nielsen, Helena Skyt] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Chicago; Aarhus University,"Joensen, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jjoensen@uchicago.edu; hnielsen@econ.au.dk,,"Nielsen, Helena/0000-0003-2577-4734",,,,,51,37,44,3,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

Management of complex dam, hydroelectric, and river systems frequently requires tradeoffs between alternative operational profiles, each with its own set of heterogeneous external effects. Substantial evidence suggests that segments of the public hold non-market values, including non-use values, for both riverine environmental effects and a wide array of external effects of hydropower production and distribution. However, non-market non-use valuation exercises related to re-purposing dam operations continue to focus exclusively on downstream external effects, calling into question their usefulness in decision-making processes. Focusing on the Glen Canyon Darn (GCD), a critical source of hydropower and peaking capacity on the Colorado River, US, we measure non-market values, expected to be significantly composed of non-use values, using the contingent valuation (CV) method for two proposed management options inclusive of multiple social, cultural, and environmental effects of both downstream riverine effects and hydropower production and distribution in the broader basin. To provide a defensible basis for inclusion of relevant external effects in the valuation exercise, we undertook a multi-year study of the GCD policy domain. Using a nationally-representative, address-based CV internet survey, results from an advisory referendum voting format suggest that the average US household has a median net willingness to pay (WTP) to continue existing GCD operations of $21.51 per year [95% CI: $2.98, $40.04] after accounting for WTP to change operations under the US Department of Interior's preferred alternative.

The results of the paper, estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach, show significant differences when the rate of change of TFP is assumed to be varying as opposed to being uniform. Significantly, the rate of convergence differs significantly across the subgroups of countries under the assumption of varying rate of change of TFP. Rates of convergence under the assumption of varying rates are clearly higher than those under the uniform rate for high income countries while the results for countries in other income categories are mixed.","[Karnik, Ajit] Middlesex Univ Dubai, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",Middlesex University,"Karnik, A (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ Dubai, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",A.Karnik@mdx.ac.ae,"Karnik, Ajit/ABC-9627-2021","Karnik, Ajit/0000-0002-9817-9648",,,,,39,0,0,1,3,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2018,65.0,5,,,,,531,550,,10.2298/PAN160203009K,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF8BA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454464700001,0

A recent study proposed the copula DCC based on the vine structure. Due to the arbitrary variable selection, their method can produce unnecessary dependence in the multivariate structure, with extra economic and computational burdens. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate directional dependence by copula to track the causal relationship among multiple variables and then extend the copula bivariate DCC method to a directional time varying partial correlation in the multivariate structure. Our proposed method provides a reasonable and efficient conditional dependence structure, without the trial and error process. We offer an application of our method to the U.S. stock market as an illustrated example.","[Kim, Jong-Min] Univ Minnesota Morris, Div Sci & Math, Stat Discipline, Morris, MN USA; [Jung, Hojin] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Jeonju Si, South Korea",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota Hospital; University of Minnesota Morris; Jeonbuk National University,"Jung, H (通讯作者)，Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Jeonju Si, South Korea.",hojin.jung@jbnu.ac.kr,,"Kim, Jong-Min/0000-0003-3821-2060",,,,,23,3,3,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using difference-in-differences estimation, it finds that, in the short run, the UCS had little or no impact on either savings or consumption expenditures. In the long run, the UCS still had no effect on savings, but there is some evidence of an increase in consumption. These effects are generally consistent with economic theory. The provision of healthcare coverage at little or no cost to previously uninsured households has an income effect that will increase both savings and consumption and a risk reduction effect that will reduce precautionary savings and thus increase consumption. These two effects on savings are of opposite sign and appear to cancel each other out, while both effects on consumption are positive and so appear to increase consumption, at least in the long run.","[Kirdruang, Phatta] Thammasat Univ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Glewwe, Paul] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN USA",Thammasat University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Kirdruang, P (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",phatta@econ.tu.ac.th,,,NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD041023] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,29,4,4,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

In most cases the information, provided in financial statements, is not sufficient to make decisions, thus the importance of voluntarily disclosed information increases. The Internet and companies' websites may serve as a vehicle for the provision of such information. Therefore, the purpose of the article is to measure the extent of voluntary information disclosure on the websites of Lithuanian companies and to investigate whether there is a significant association between theoretically possible disclosure determinants. Research methods used in the study are the following: comparative analysis of scientific literature, logical, systematic analysis, content analysis using scope and quantity index approaches and correlation analysis using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results showed a statistically significant connection between the company's size (as determined by its earnings) and the company's voluntary information disclosure index. The companies with higher earnings are inclined to provide a wider scope and a larger volume of information. Furthermore, the connection between the number of employees and the word quantity index wasn't established. This research adds to the samples of previous studies and analyses disclosure of financial and non-financial information on companies' websites.","[Kundeliene, Kristina; Stepanauskaite, Agne] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Kundeliene, K (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",kristina.kundeliene@ktu.lt; agne.stepanauskaite@gmail.com,"Kundeliene, Kristina Mrs./A-3809-2008",,,,,,61,5,5,1,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This perspective has served society well in past decades. However, recent productivity slowdowns in developed economies and the failure of innovation policies to continue to deliver desired results have called this perspective into question. Scholars explain these slowdowns by the oversimplification of the linear model which fails to consider the complexities associated with innovation processes. Although it is generally believed that Vannevar Bush's report Science - The Endless Frontier - was based on his belief in a linear model of innovation and the notion that basic research is the ultimate source of all innovation, an examination of Bush's writings and his life reveals that he believed in a more sophisticated model in which basic and applied research cross-fertilize each other and in which government's job is not so much to stimulate basic research as it is to facilitate interactions between basic and applied research for the benefit of both and the prosperity of society. This paper explicates Bush's model of the research and innovation process, explores the implications of that model, and derives policy recommendations.","[Leyden, Dennis Patrick] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC USA; [Menter, Matthias] Univ Augsburg, Fac Business & Econ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; University of Augsburg,"Menter, M (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Fac Business & Econ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",matthias.menter@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,,,,,,,31,27,28,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

The empirical analysis is based on a dynamic factor model and an unobserved components model that is consistent with an Open Economy New Keynesian Phillips curve. The findings suggest that in the short-run, Thai inflation has become increasingly sensitive to global factors since 2001, while becoming less reliant on domestic ones. During 2001-2007, the importance of this global factor can be attributed to a global output gap, while in the period thereafter, it only corresponds to world oil price movements. While global factors are important, Thai inflation is still heavily influenced by domestic monetary policy in the long-run. The implementation of an inflation targeting framework in May 2000 by the Bank of Thailand has led to improved inflation behavior through better anchored long-term inflation expectations.","[Manopimoke, Pym] Bank Thailand, Puey Ungphakorn Inst Econ Res, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Manopimoke, P (通讯作者)，Bank Thailand, Puey Ungphakorn Inst Econ Res, Bangkok, Thailand.",pymm@bot.or.th,,,,,,,60,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This method relies on a parameter called real project gamma' that measures the proportion of project returns that is covariant with the macroeconomic variable. We compare two approaches for estimation of this gamma when the project returns and the macroeconomic variable are cointegrated. First, we use Weitzman's own approach, and second a simple data transformation that keeps gamma within the zero to one interval. In a Monte-Carlo study, we show that the method of using a standardized series is better and robust under different data-generating processes. Both approaches are examined in a Monte-Carlo experiment and applied to Swedish time-series data from 1950-2011 for annual time-series data for rail freight (a measure of returns from rail investments) and GDP.","[Mantalos, Panagiotis] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, Vaxjo, Sweden; [Hultkrantz, Lars] Orebro Univ, Sch Business, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Orebro University,"Hultkrantz, L (通讯作者)，Orebro Univ, Sch Business, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden.",lars.hultkrantz@oru.se,,"Hultkrantz, Lars/0000-0003-1172-1076",,,,,15,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Although subsequent work isolated and explored different portfolios subject to these constraints, absolute portfolio risk has been consistently ignored. A different restriction - maximization of the traditional Sharpe ratio on the constant TE frontier in absolute risk/return space - is added here to the existing constraint set, and a method to generate this portfolio is explained. The resultant portfolio has a lower volatility and higher return than the benchmark, it satisfies the TE constraint and the ratio of excess absolute return to risk is maximized (i.e. maximum Sharpe ratio in absolute space).","[Maxwell, Michael; Daly, Michael; Thomson, Daniel; van Vuuren, Gary] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"van Vuuren, G (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",vvgary@hotmail.com,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",,,,,19,7,8,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Money's dual nature perfectly corresponds to the phenomena associated with the tragedy of commons that are caused by the inherent conflict between the individual's concern with self-interest in economic welfare and the community's concern with long term sustainability.","[Mayumi, Kozo] Tokushima Univ, Fac IAS, Tokushima 7708502, Japan; [Giampietro, Mario] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain",Tokushima University; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Mayumi, K (通讯作者)，Tokushima Univ, Fac IAS, Tokushima 7708502, Japan.",kozo.mayumi@gmail.com; mario.giampietro@uab.cat,"Mayumi, Kozo/R-8499-2019","Mayumi, Kozo/0000-0002-5278-7939",,,,,15,2,2,0,1,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

In that case, each player receives an exogenous 'disagreement value'. We characterize the set of stationary subgame perfect equilibria under all q-majority rules. Under unanimity rule, equilibrium payoffs are strictly increasing in disagreement values. Under all less-than-unanimity rules, expected payoffs are either decreasing or first increasing and then decreasing in disagreement values. We conduct experiments involving three players using majority and unanimity rule,,finding qualitative support for several, but not all, of our main predictions. Having a high disagreement value is indeed an advantage under unanimity rule. Under majority rule, the player with the highest disagreement value is more likely to be excluded, but this does not consistently result in a lower average payoff. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) employ software and internet-connected machines that communicate in real-time to reduce error rates and increase efficiency. The basis is the co-operation of separate control units that are capable of autonomous decision-making, managing the assigned technological unit and in particular becoming an independent and full member of comprehensive production units. The Industry 4.0 concept requires continuous innovation and education that not only depends on the peoples' skills but also on organizational culture. Appropriate managerial approaches play a vital role in the development of organizational culture. Most studies discuss technical aspects, but do not pay attention to managerial approaches and organizational culture, which are a major factor influencing the success of this concept. The aim of the paper is to examine the level of organizational culture in the Czech Republic and to seek appropriate managerial approaches for the development of organizational culture that can support the environment for innovation in the organization and therefore facilitate the entrepreneurship in the Industry 4.0 concept. A partial goal will be, among other things, to identify the implications of Industry 4.0 for human resources. In order to determine organizational culture in organizations, a large study was carried out in the form of a questionnaire survey - the Czech translation of Wallach's Questionnaire (1983). According to the findings, the respondents perceive the organizational culture in the organizations under review is more bureaucratic and supportive than innovative. In their view the signs of innovative culture are not so striking. It is necessary to change managerial approaches to support innovative solutions.","[Mohelska, Hana; Sokolova, Marcela] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Mohelska, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",hana.mohelska@uhk.cz,"Sokolová, Marcela/B-3452-2012; Mohelska, Hana/F-9896-2019","Sokolová, Marcela/0000-0002-0641-7750; Mohelska, Hana/0000-0003-0441-0712","University of Hradec Kralove [2203/2018, 6/2018]",University of Hradec Kralove,This work was supported by the University of Hradec Kralove under the specific project 6/2018 grant Determinants of cognitive processes impacting the work performance and the project Excellence (2203/2018).,,37,68,83,4,46,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Australian consumer survey data from 2275 individuals were used to analyse the relationship between price and patient experience of GP care. Using both standard models for count data and a latent class model that distinguishes between patients with high- and low-quality experiences, we find no evidence that lower prices have a negative impact on patients' perceptions of GP quality. Nevertheless, some patient characteristics such as age, gender and health status play a significant role in quality-of-care perceptions. The results show that Australian patients have not had to compromise GP quality, as expressed in terms of patient experience, when seeking low-priced care. This supports the view that there are sufficient checks and balances on the GP sector in Australia to ensure positive patient experiences even for low-cost GP consultations.","[Mu, Chunzhou; De Abreu Lourenco, Richard; van Gool, Kees; Hall, Jane] Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, Level 2 Bldg 5 Block D,1-59 Quay St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Mu, CZ (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, CHERE, Level 2 Bldg 5 Block D,1-59 Quay St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.",Chunzhou.Mu@chere.uts.edu.au,"Hall, Jane P/I-3469-2014; De Abreu Lourenco, Richard/ABC-3150-2020; Mu, Chunzhou/A-4460-2019; van Gool, Kees/JXW-8446-2024","De Abreu Lourenco, Richard/0000-0002-5978-8774; Mu, Chunzhou/0000-0002-6464-1267; van Gool, Kees/0000-0002-1424-9304; Hall, Jane/0000-0002-2191-0543",REFinE at the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation at UTS; Commonwealth of Australia; Centre of Research Excellence under the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute,REFinE at the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation at UTS; Commonwealth of Australia(Australian Government); Centre of Research Excellence under the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute,"The authors are supported by REFinE at the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation at UTS, a Centre of Research Excellence under the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute, which is supported by a grant from the Commonwealth of Australia as represented by the Department of Health.

This paper studies the structure of maximum independent sets in an acyclic transitive digraph and shows how they can be used for simplification of corresponding models.","[Paluch, Stanislav; Majer, Tomas] Univ Zilina, Fac Managements Sci & Informat, Dept Math Methods & Operat Res, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Majer, Tomas] Univ Zilina, Fac Managements Sci & Informat, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Palúch, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Managements Sci & Informat, Dept Math Methods & Operat Res, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",stanislav.paluch@fri.uniza.sk; tomas.majer@fri.uniza.sk; stefan.pesko@fri.uniza.sk,,,Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0658]; Scientific Grant Agency of Ministry of Schools and Sport SR [VEGA 1/0582/16]; Slovak Academy of Science [VEGA 1/0582/16],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); Scientific Grant Agency of Ministry of Schools and Sport SR; Slovak Academy of Science,"This work was supported by Slovak Research and Development Agency - grant APVV-14-0658 Optimization of Municipal and Regional Public Transport and also by Scientific Grant Agency of Ministry of Schools and Sport SR and Slovak Academy of Science, grant VEGA 1/0582/16 Economic optimization of processes on networks.",,11,0,0,0,4,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,258,265,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500034,0

We run estimations on a set of currency collapses, banking crises and sovereign defaults in 49 advanced and developing countries from 1978 to 2011. The trade-weighted foreign demand effect mitigated the economic downturn following a banking or a sovereign debt crisis in all countries, while only the advanced ones benefited from it after a currency collapse. Trade-based spillover effects make banking crises more costly in the developing countries, in those that liberalize their financial account. It contrasts with what is observed during currency or sovereign debt crises.","[Pentecote, Jean-Sebastien] Normandy Univ, UNICAEN, CNRS, CREM, Caen, France; [Rondeau, Fabien] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, Rennes, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Caen Normandie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes,"Rondeau, F (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, CREM, Rennes, France.",fabien.rondeau@univ-rennes1.fr,"Rondeau, Fabien/H-3878-2019","RONDEAU, Fabien/0000-0003-1189-5930",University of Rennes 1; CREM-CNRS research centre,University of Rennes 1; CREM-CNRS research centre,This project benefited from financial support of the research funding programme 'Emerging scientific issues' of the University of Rennes 1 and of the CREM-CNRS research centre.,,36,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Contrary to all prior literature on the subject, the authors find that performance on the Wonderlic test is positively correlated with NFL performance. However, the authors find no clear evidence that Wonderlic scores are correlated with draft position. Beyond this primary finding, the authors reveal many other interesting results that should help researchers better understand a quarterback's progression from college to the NFL.","[Pitts, J.

Usually there are several production lines with capacity constraints and setup times (cleaning, changeover etc). The production plan must define the quantity of products that will be produced on each production line in given planning horizon. The products consumption is stochastic value and therefore safety stocks are required to reduce the possibility of stock-outs. On the other hand, products shelf life can be very important for retailers since they must sell these products to final customers. Considering available stock of products at the start of planning horizon, as well as expected consumption, production plan must solve lot-sizing and scheduling problem so that the stock level of each product does not fall under safety stock level or go over maximum desirable stock regarding shelf life. Additionally, production facility has limited warehouse capacity for product storage. In this paper, we propose the mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) model to solve lot-sizing and scheduling problems with the main objectives: minimizing the violation of minimum and maximum stock level per each product, minimizing the violation of maximum stock level of all products, and finally minimizing total stock in the system.","[Popovic, Drazen; Bjelic, Nenad; Vidovic, Milorad; Radivojevic, Gordana; Ratkovic, Branislava] Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Dept Logist, Vojvode Stepe 305, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Popovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Dept Logist, Vojvode Stepe 305, Belgrade, Serbia.",d.popovic@sf.bg.ac.rs; n.bjelic@sf.bg.ac.rs; m.vidovic@sf.bg.ac.rs; g.radivojevic@sf.bg.ac.rs; b.ratkovic@sf.bg.ac.rs,"Bjelic, Nenad/R-7550-2019; Popović, Dražen/Q-7273-2019; Bjelić, Nenad/ABA-4240-2020",,"Ministry of Education, Science and Technical development of the Government of the Republic of Serbia [TR36006]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technical development of the Government of the Republic of Serbia","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technical development of the Government of the Republic of Serbia through the project TR36006, for the period 2011-2018.",,5,0,0,0,0,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,291,297,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500039,0

We argue that the location rent component of housing cost is key to explicating the connection. We trace how the housing market makes relative income instrumental for maximizing utility even if households' utility functions are not interdependent. Over time, productivity growth yields higher wages but households compete some of that away on the housing market. This structural inflation of location rents counteracts preferences to work less as wages rise and hinders the expansion of leisure. Relative income effects are shown to arise as a consequence of a market institution that monetizes socially-imbued preferences.","[Rtischev, Dimitry] Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Gakushuin University,"Rtischev, D (通讯作者)，Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Boundary tightening was shown to significantly improve the quality of the finally balanced SUTs well beyond that of existing techniques. Most notably, improvements occurred when boundary tightening was applied prior to the balancing process - showing that it can be used as a valuable preliminary to other approaches. It also multiplied the improvement in SUTs quality when more accurate updated information was added to the SUTs. The findings of this paper strongly suggest that this boundary tightening algorithm will improve the quality of the output of the balancing process and it is equally likely to be useful when applied to other processes that handle uncertain data.","[Serpell, Martin C.] Univ West England, Dept Comp Sci & Creat Technol, Bristol, Avon, England",University of West England,"Serpell, MC (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Dept Comp Sci & Creat Technol, Bristol, Avon, England.",martin2.serpell@uwe.ac.uk,"Kolisnyk, Mykyta/HTT-4095-2023",,University of the West of England,University of the West of England,This work was supported by the University of the West of England.,,30,5,5,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Economic growth has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and improved the lives of many more over the last half-century. The question of how to measure development has attracted the attention of economists and other social scientists as well as non-government organizations and policy-makers for many decades. Right measurement is a powerful instrument for social progress; wrong or imprecise measurement a source of hazard and even havoc. Measurement of a region's progress plays a crucial role in improving the prosperity and quality of life of regional communities. This process has however proven difficult as contemporary views on the measurement of regional development are presented as multi-dimensional concepts. Several methods of evaluating regional economies exist, most of the methods have their own limitations in the selection of relevant indicators and weighting scheme. Despite the limitations, several approaches in the form of composite indices have been proposed by the European Union and the other institutions.

This directive envisioned a de facto division of labor between universities, that would emphasize basic research, and PRIs, that would become Malaysia's translational research and technology commercialization hubs. Employing a scientific and technical human capital conceptual lens, this paper assesses the extent to which PRIs have met the expectations of the new commercialization directive through the analysis of data collected during a 2011-2012 survey among university and PRI researchers. First, we find descriptively that, in comparison to university researchers, PRI researchers do not differ substantially in terms of average patents and prototypes produced, our proxies for technology commercialization. Second, we investigate factors among PRI researchers that explain commercialization behavior and find that holding a PhD correlates strongly with publication and patenting behavior while conducting applied research and expressing adequate commercialization support correlates modestly with prototyping behavior. Implications for research and policy are discussed.","[Strong, Derek R.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Chandran, V. G.

Organic agriculture is expected to play a major role for a healthy world in the future whereas inorganic agriculture nowadays increases the volume of agricultural production and presents lower priced foods but causes health problems. The agricultural investments are generally evaluated by using linguistic terms since most of the evaluation criteria are intangible and inherently require imprecise data to be used. In this paper, we analyze six types of agricultural investment alternatives using eight different criteria based on linguistic data. One of the most-used multi-criteria decision-making methods, TOPSIS is used under fuzziness for the solution of this problem. A sensitivity analysis is also given to examine the robustness of the decision.","[Suder, Asli] Istanbul Tech Univ, Management Engn, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kahraman, Cengiz] Istanbul Tech Univ, Ind Engn Dept, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University; Istanbul Technical University,"Kahraman, C (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Ind Engn Dept, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",kahramanc@itu.edu.tr,"kahraman, cengiz/N-9259-2013","kahraman, cengiz/0000-0001-6168-8185",,,,,34,14,16,1,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This paper investigates the extent to which the so called Nelson-Siegel model (DNS) and its extended version that accounts for time varying volatility (DNS-GARCH and DNS-EGARCH) can optimally fit the yield curve and predict its future path in the context of an emerging economy. The study expands the earlier work (Koopman, et al. 2010) by looking at more elaborate specifications for volatility modeling such as E-GARCH and also evaluates the predictive role of considering the time-varying volatility in the model in terms of out-of-sample forecasting. For the in-sample fit, all three models fit the curve remarkably well even in the emerging markets. However, the DNS-EGARCH model fits the curve slightly better than the other two models. Moreover, all three specifications of the yield curve that are based on the Nelson-Siegel functional form, outperform the benchmark AR(1) forecasts at all three specified forecast horizons. The DNS comes with more precise forecasts than the volatility based extended models for the 1-month ahead forecasts, while the other two outperform the standard DNS for 6- and 12-month horizons.","[Ullah, Wali; Bari, Khadija Malik] IBA, Dept Econ & Finance, Karachi, Pakistan",,"Ullah, W (通讯作者)，IBA, Dept Econ & Finance, Karachi, Pakistan.",waliullah@iba.edu.pk,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,3,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

These CSR benefits include an increase in stakeholders' assessment of the corporation with a boost in perceived trustworthiness. Companies, however, may treat sustainability reports as a tool to legitimize their actions. In order to achieve the desired results from CSR activities, companies disclose only selected information to customers, employees and/or owners. The aim of this paper is to answer the question of whether companies change measures in subsequent CSR reports to avoid revealing unfavorable information in sustainability reports. We analyzed 116 reports of corporations from different countries: Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine and Latvia. We used the reports from the website: http://database.globalreporting.org/ For every company we used two newest reports for two consecutive years in the period 2010-2016. We used t-test to verify the hypothesis that companies remove and add the same number of CSR measures in subsequent reports and that corporations from controversial industries change disclosed information to higher extent than companies from other industries. We stated, that companies replace one measure with the new one to keep the impression of the same level of disclosure and to maintain or increase the level of legitimacy. Research showed that companies change the number and type of disclosed measures and they don't explain reasons of the changes made in the reports, which may indicate a desire to green the organization by presenting only positive information. However, we can't confirm that there is a significant difference in changes of CSR measures revealed between companies from controversial and non-controversial industries. The paper fills a research gap in the research on the reliability of CSR disclosure. It concentrates on the motives and the range of measures unveiled in the sustainability reports to legitimize a company's activity.","[Waniak-Michalak, Halina] Univ Lodz, Management Fac, Dept Accounting, Social Sci Econ, Matejki 22-26 St, Lodz, Poland; [Sapkauskiene, Alfreda; Leitoniene, Sviesa] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Social Sci Management & Adm, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",University of Lodz; Kaunas University of Technology,"Waniak-Michalak, H (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Management Fac, Dept Accounting, Social Sci Econ, Matejki 22-26 St, Lodz, Poland.",hwaniak@uni.lodz.pl; alfreda.sapkauskiene@ktu.lt; sviesa.leitoniene@ktu.lt,"Leitoniene, Sviesa/G-7250-2015; Waniak-Michalak, Halina/ABH-4130-2020; Sapkauskiene, Alfreda/AAF-9934-2019","Leitoniene, Sviesa/0000-0001-8457-5773; Waniak-Michalak, Halina/0000-0003-1857-4339; Sapkauskiene, Alfreda/0000-0002-0070-4097",,,,,48,5,5,1,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This article explores the regional structures of irrigation water rights and water governance and empirically analyses the priority effects of water rights on irrigated agriculture at the micro level in Idaho, an arid and semiarid state in the western United States. We integrate a unique data set of water rights and water supplies with agricultural features and environmental characteristics into our empirical analysis. Results indicate that seniority in water resources allocation has significant, positive effects on both the average crop revenue and crop water use efficiency. Local water rights structures differ significantly in seniority and water sources from region to region. In response to the heterogeneity in local water rights structures, the aforementioned effect of allocative priority of water rights on average crop revenue per hectare and crop water productivity varies significantly, reaching up to an 87% difference, when measured across regions. In addition, the priority effects of water rights are nonlinear, which reflects the influence of historical patterns of water rights establishment on water institutions to date.","[Xu, Wenchao] Xiamen Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Econ, 422-11 Siming S Rd, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Xu, Wenchao] Xiamen Univ, WISE, 422-11 Siming S Rd, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Lowe, Scott E.] Boise State Univ, Grad Coll, Boise, ID 83725 USA",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Idaho; Boise State University,"Xu, WC (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Econ, 422-11 Siming S Rd, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Xu, WC (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, WISE, 422-11 Siming S Rd, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",wenchaoxu@xmu.edu.cn,"Xu, Wenchao/ABB-4659-2021","Xu, Wenchao/0000-0002-2832-2453",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673228]; National Science Foundation [EPS-0814387]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720161070],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 71673228; National Science Foundation EPS-0814387 and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 20720161070.,,36,3,3,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Its main argument is that to deal with the complexity of property we must abstract secondary elements, such as the physical dimensions of some types of assets, and focus on the interaction between transactions. This sequential-exchange framework captures the main problem of property in the current environment of impersonal markets. It also provides criteria to compare private and public ordering, as well as to organize public solutions that enable new forms of private ordering. The analysis applies the lessons in Coase (1960) to property by not only comparing realities but also maintaining his separate definition of property rights and transaction costs. However, it replaces his contractual, single-exchange, framework for one in which contracts interact, causing exchange externalities.","[Arrunada, Benito] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Barcelona, Spain; [Arrunada, Benito] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics,"Arruñada, B (通讯作者)，Pompeu Fabra Univ, Barcelona, Spain.;Arruñada, B (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.",benito.arrunada@upf.edu,"Arruñada, Benito/M-3408-2019","Arruñada, Benito/0000-0003-1391-9895",Spanish Government [ECO2014-57131-R],Spanish Government(Spanish Government),"Thanks to Douglas W.

The history of planning and social partnership, the courses of nationalisation and privatisation and the problem of damaging the state are discussed as well. The author concludes that the crisis has not resulted in the strengthening of the developmental or welfare role of the state, the evolution of a developmental welfare state has become less likely in Ireland in the course of crisis management. Another lesson is that the state can manage certain bad assets of the private sector in a way that yields a profit to the public. There are other costs of the crisis management, however, which are to be paid by the people and result in a decrease of state ownership and a shrinking of the welfare systems.","[Artner, Annamaria] HAS Inst World Econ & Habil, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budapest, Hungary; [Artner, Annamaria] King Sigismund Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Artner, A (通讯作者)，HAS Inst World Econ & Habil, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budapest, Hungary.;Artner, A (通讯作者)，King Sigismund Univ, Budapest, Hungary.",artner.annamaria@krtk.mta.hu,"Artner, Annamaria/U-9126-2017","Artner, Annamaria/0000-0002-3979-4624",Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) [112069],Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA)(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),"This research was supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA), Grant No. 112069.",,64,1,1,0,4,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Private and public debt are high, both legacies of the boom, the slump and the sudden stop. Productivity growth remains low. Because of high debt and low growth, the recovery remains fragile. We review the history and the main mechanisms at work. We then review a number of policy options, from fiscal consolidation to fiscal expansion, cleaning up of non-performing loans, labor market reforms, product market reforms, and euro exit. We argue that at this point, the main focus of macroeconomic policy should be twofold. The first is the treatment of non-performing loans, the second is product market reforms and reforms aimed at increasing micro-flexibility in the labor market.

We find that smoking and smoking addiction are associated with lower levels of happiness and higher levels of depression. This finding is robust to alternative ways of measuring smoking behavior, as well as to the methodological approach to estimation that addresses endogeneity. Specifically, comparing the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) results with the two-stage least square (2SLS) results, we find that although the OLS results overstate the effects of smoking status and addiction on wellbeing, the emerging conclusion of a negative effect of smoking behavior is still valid in the case of 2SLS.

The data used are mainly from household surveys and national accounts balance sheets, covering about two thirds of the world's population and over 95% of global household wealth. Lists of the most wealthy published in the media are used to adjust the upper tail. Wealth levels and distributions are imputed for countries without data. Estimated global household wealth stood at USD 251 trillion in 2014, having grown from USD 117 trillion in the year 2000. Wealth per adult in 2014 was USD 53,000. The estimated Gini coefficient of global wealth was 92.2% in 2014 and the share of the top 10% was 88.3%. Wealth inequality fell from 2000 to 2007, with the share of the top 10% falling from 89.4% to 86.5%, before rising steadily to 2014. From 2000 to 2008 the share of financial assets in gross wealth, an important driver of wealth inequality, fell from 55.2% to 50.2%, before climbing to 55.0% in 2014. Household debt rose from 13.6% of gross assets in 2000 to 16.0% in 2008, and has since fallen to 13.9%.","[Davies, James B.] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada; [Lluberas, Rodrigo] Univ ORT Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Lluberas, Rodrigo] Banco Cent Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Shorrocks, Anthony F.] Global Econ Perspect Ltd, London, England; [Shorrocks, Anthony F.] UNU WIDER, Helsinki, Finland",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University ORT Uruguay,"Davies, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",jdavies@uwo.ca,,,,,,,48,33,34,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Our results indicate that Sunni regime countries receive favorable treatment in terms of loan allocation, as well as Shia majority populated countries in exceptional occasions of conflict with other religious minority groups, while non-Muslim countries are the least favored. There is also evidence that lending by the World Bank to the same group of countries and over the same time frame does not respond to the political stance of Saudi Arabia founded on religion. These findings reveal the advantage that Saudi Arabia gains by assuming the leadership of a Regional Development Bank in contrast to coordinating common strategies in a global International Financial Institution with other large shareholders for whom religion might not be essential for political alliances.

Since then, China has been transformed. Forty years ago, in 1978, China was unquestionably a socialist economy of the familiar and well-studied command economy variant, even though it was more decentralized and more loosely planned than its Soviet progenitor. Twenty years ago--that is, by the late 1990s--China had completely discarded this type of socialism and was moving decisively to a market economy. China today is quite different both from the command economy of 40 years ago, and from the Wild West Capitalism of 20 years ago.

The paper uses a dynamic Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function and the generalised method of moments (GMM) as estimation techniques to estimate the parameters of interests. The research findings are: the estimated effects (measured by elasticity) of teledensity on the provincial level agricultural output have been positive and statistically significant both in the short and long runs. In the long-run, the size of the effect is substantial: from 0.94 to 1.06. This implies that the agriculture sector of the P. R.

Its impact on profits and thus innovation rates and welfare is a more controversial issue in the literature.This paper proposes a North-South model dealing with parallel trade, price controls and compulsory license (if the South is not served). Our results challenge the literature claiming that parallel trade leads to higher innovation and welfare. Moreover, conditions apply for CL to be used; in particular, it should never be used for neglected diseases, as malaria and tuberculosis. When the South issues CLs, it is compensated for the welfare losses caused by the North allowing parallel trade, and innovation and northern welfare do not decrease. The best outcome, however, is market segmentation, i.e. no parallel trade in the first place. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This article is a voice in this discussion. It provides, empirically verified arguments, allowing one to support or reject the accepted research hypotheses. These assume that: (1) The expectations with respect to income dynamics play a more important role in stimulating innovation activity than the dynamics of (actual) income levels; and (2) Different economic structures and levels of technological development in the chosen Balkan states, despite the geographic proximity of these states and similarity in economic situation, influence the geographic differentiation in terms of the innovation activity. The obtained research results show a greater differentiation in terms of actions of companies than previously thought. It has been confirmed that when the companies sense an improvement in economic situation, their innovation activity increases, this is, however, accompanied by a noticeable anticipatory element. It turned out that the expectations regarding an improvement in economic conditions have an additional stimulating effect on such an activity, whereas the recession itself, as well as the expectations in that respect, have a de-stimulating effect. It turned out that the expectations with regard to the future economic situation are the most important here, a factor that has been neglected so far.","[Tomaszewski, Marek; Swiadek, Arkadiusz] Univ Zielona Gora, Dept Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Zielona Gora, Poland",University of Zielona Gora,"Tomaszewski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Dept Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Zielona Gora, Poland.",m.tomaszewski@wez.uz.zgora.pl,"Tomaszewski, Marek/AAF-1028-2019; Swiadek, Arkadiusz/P-8676-2014","Tomaszewski, Marek/0000-0003-2590-5159; Swiadek, Arkadiusz/0000-0002-5566-3114",,,,,40,15,15,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

For a two-player game with scalar and compact action sets, existence entails that one reaction curve be increasing and continuous and the other quasi-increasing (i.e., not have any downward jumps). The latter property amounts to strategic quasi-complementarities. The paper provides a number of ancillary results of independent interest, including sufficient conditions for a quasi increasing argmax (or non-monotone comparative statics), and new sufficient conditions for uniqueness of fixed points. For maximal accessibility of the results, the main results are presented in a Euclidean setting.

We construct measures for non-cognitive skills based on previous research in the field, such as self-reports and non-response in the background questionnaire. We also take advantage of the computer based nature of the assessment to explore the effects of other constructs such as skipped questions in the test, average time per question, average time per correct answer and the number of keyboard and mouse movements before answering a question. We find that, even after controlling for PIAAC scores, previously proposed proxies of non-cognitive skills (self-reports and survey non-response) are significantly associated with individual earnings. We also use these measures of non-cognitive skills to propose a correction of the PIAAC scores as a measure of cognitive skills in the earnings equation. By doing so, we observe that the relationship between earnings and PIAAC scores might be partially mediated by non-cognitive skills. However, our results also show that PIAAC test scores remain highly significant and as the main determinant of earnings after the correction.","[Anghel, Brindusa] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain; [Balart, Pau] Univ Illes Baleares, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Banco de Espana; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Anghel, B (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain.",brindusa.anghel@bde.es; pau.balart@uib.cat,"Anghel, Brindusa/JXR-7658-2024; Balart, Pau/I-4213-2019; ANGHEL, BRINDUSA/H-5147-2015","Balart, Pau/0000-0002-9088-537X; ANGHEL, BRINDUSA/0000-0002-3504-0235",,,,,54,7,7,2,27,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Heterogeneous, generationally-linked households choose between 'traditional' and 'modern' contraception. The modern has a higher fixed but lower variable cost of averting childbirths. Initially the rich adopt the modern, which unleashes society-wide diffusion. Eventually everyone switches, lowering fertility further and across households. Hastening the switch is falling child mortality. Quantitative experiments suggest contraception was a vital link between the historical mortality and fertility transitions, though not the latter's proximate cause.

Low-income nations have either too much genetic diversity, which hampers trust, or too little, which hinders innovation, both of which are necessary for economic development. A group of anthropologists has dismissed the study for having incorrect data and creating false connections between genetic diversity, trust and innovation. Beyond this, the Ashraf and Galor genetic hypothesis is problematic because it ignores recent epigenetic research and draws a veil over the international economic causes of global inequality. Ashraf and Galor argue that the winners and losers in national incomes have been chosen by nature rather than political and economic history. In tracing the causes of national inequality to genetics, Ashraf and Galor have naturalized history.","[Chernomas, Robert; Hudson, Ian] Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Chernomas, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, 501 Fletcher Argue Bldg, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada.",robert.chernomas@umanitoba.ca,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In response, he uses two models, one with time-varying parameters, and another with constant parameters. Forecasts are then based on a Bayesian model averaging strategy, which mixes forecasts from the two models. In reality, structural parameters are constant, but the (unknown) true model features expectational feedback, which the reduced-form models neglect. This feedback permits fears of parameter instability to become self-confirming. Within the context of a standard asset-pricing model, we use the tools of large deviations theory to show that even though the constant parameter model would converge to the rational expectations equilibrium if considered in isolation, the mere presence of an unstable alternative drives it out of consideration.","[Cho, In-Koo] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 1407 West Gregory, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Cho, In-Koo] Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, In-Koo] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO USA; [Kasa, Kenneth] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Hanyang University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Simon Fraser University,"Cho, IK (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 1407 West Gregory, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Cho, IK (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.;Cho, IK (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO USA.",inkoocho@illinois.edu; kkasa@sfu.ca,,,National Science Foundation; Korea Research Foundation [2015S1A5A2A01011999],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Korea Research Foundation(National Research Foundation of Korea),"We thank Mikhail Anufriev, Jaroslav Borovicka, Jim Bullard, George Evans, Lars Hansen, Seppo Honkapohja, Albert Marcet, Tom Sargent, and Noah Williams for helpful comments and discussions.

It identifies some mental and behavioral rules of mainstream economics as a whole and of the mainstream segment of two important subdisciplines, namely, macroeconomics and financial economics. There are social reasons behind the sharing of these rules. They are institutions. More specifically, academics who do not comply with these rules are subject to punishment, while conformists may be rewarded. At the same time, many supporters of mainstream economics have internalized these rules as legitimate, in part because of the prestige of their advocates. Social sanctions and internalization characterize social norms. These institutions are also conventions. Through various mechanisms, some academics follow these rules at least in part because others have done so; in addition, the prevailing rules are not necessarily superior to existing or conceivable alternatives. The combination of social norms and conventions may have negative consequences for the discipline.","[Dequech, David] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Dequech, D (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,"Dequech, David/D-2312-2012",,Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [307914/2014-3]; Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (Fapesp) [2015/11822-7]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [15/11822-7] Funding Source: FAPESP,Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (Fapesp)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC)),"University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

We derive hypotheses from three prominent models for choices between risky monetary payoffs under regular and reduced self-control. We test the hypotheses in a lab experiment, using a well-established ego depletion task to reduce self-control, and measuring risk attitudes via finely graduated choice lists. Manipulation checks document the effectiveness of the depletion task. We find no systematic evidence in favor of the theoretical predictions. In particular, depletion does not increase risk aversion.

The fundamental growth is defined as the growth justified by the fundamentals, the equilibrium growth-as the growth consistent with the economy being in medium-term equilibrium. Results suggest that the slowdown reflects both return of the credit activity to its fundamental value, and return of the fundamental values to their equilibrium levels, after years of excessiveness during the pre-crisis period.

Our analysis is based on a stochastic general equilibrium overlapping generations model of endogenous health accumulation calibrated to match pre-2010 U.S. data. We find that population aging not only leads to large increases in medical spending but also a large shift in the relative size of private vs. public insurance. Without the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aging by itself leads to a 40% increase in health expenditures by 2060 and a 9.6% increase in GDP which is mainly driven by the increase of the fraction of older higher-risk individuals in the economy as well as behavioral responses to aging and the subsequent expansion of the healthcare sector. Aging increases the premium in group-based health insurance (GHI) markets and enrollment in GHI decreases, while the individual-based health insurance (IHI) market, Medicaid and Medicare expand significantly. The size of Medicare will almost double by 2060 as the elderly dependency ratio increases. Additional funds equivalent to roughly 2.7% of GDP are required to finance Medicare and Medicaid. The introduction of the ACA increases the fraction of insured workers to almost 100% by 2060, compared to 82% without the ACA. This increase is driven by the stabilization of GHI markets and the further expansions of Medicaid and the IHI market. The ACA mitigates the increase of healthcare costs by reducing the number of the uninsured who pay the highest market price for healthcare services. Overall, the ACA adds to the fiscal cost of population aging mainly via the Medicaid expansion. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for behavioral responses, structural changes in the healthcare sector and general equilibrium adjustments when assessing the economy-wide effects of aging.

Nominal debt combined with a countercyclical exchange rate policy allows more hedging against shocks than real savings if markets are incomplete. Thus, the loss of either repayment or monetary reputation severely affects the government's ability to smooth consumption. The model offers a simple explanation for the Bulow and Rogoff critique, while simultaneously helping explain the issuance of nominal sovereign bonds by emerging economies.

With Gaussian shocks, I provide general sufficient conditions for the existence of at least three equilibria when the income process is either ARMA(1,1), AR(2), or has a persistent-transitory (PT) representation with negatively correlated shocks. The possibility of multiple equilibria calls for caution in comparative statics exercises and policy analyses using heterogeneous-agent models.

We focus on disentangling price changes from quantity changes at retirement. The mandatory retirement policy in China provides a quasi-experimental setting for nonparametric identification of the true causal effects of fully anticipated retirement. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that food expenditure declines at retirement, particularly among the less-educated group. We further show that this decline is driven by a reduction in prices rather than quantities.

However, its effectiveness, welfare consequences, and interaction with public regulation are poorly understood. This article presents a unified dynamic framework for studying the interaction between public regulation, self-regulation, and boycotts. We show that the possibility of self-regulation saves on administrative costs, but also leads to delays. Without an active regulator, firms self-regulate to preempt or end a boycott and private politics is beneficial for activists but harmful for firms. With an active regulator, in contrast, firms self-regulate to preempt public regulation and private politics is harmful for activists but beneficial for firms. Our analysis generates a rich set of testable predictions that are consistent with the rise of private politics over time and the fact that there is more self-regulation and activism in the U.S., while public regulation continues to be more common in Europe.","[Egorov, Georgy] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Egorov, Georgy] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Harstad, Bard] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Oslo,"Egorov, G (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Egorov, G (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,49,25,31,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

A challenge for any model is to represent situations which involve large departures from a benchmark mix of energy technologies which would be associated with deep transformations of the energy sector (e.g., energy mix with a high penetration of renewables or near-complete decarbonization). This paper proposes a model which differentiates technologies at the level of investments and which is capable of representing large shifts in the market shares of competing technologies that produce a homogeneous energy good (e.g., electricity). We compare the partial equilibrium properties of the proposed technology investment choice model with the standard approach for modeling technology competition based on product differentiation. We also embed both approaches in a numerical general equilibrium multi-sector Ramsey growth framework. We find that the technology investment choice model overcomes some important limitations of the standard approach and is more suited to accommodate large changes in market shares of energy technologies in response to highly stringent energy and climate policy.

Our goal is to empirically analyze the determinants of innovation in electricity storage and its role in fostering technological innovations in renewable and conventional electricity generation. Using a global firm-level data set of electricity patents from 1963 to 2011, we find that better electricity storage promotes innovation not only in renewable energy but also in conventional technologies. Specifically, our estimates show that an additional storage patent increases the probability to apply for patents in renewable energy and efficiency-improving fossil fuel technologies two years from now by 1.09% and 0.65%, respectively. This implies that improved electricity storage technologies can boost the energy efficiency of conventional, fossil fuel-fired power plants as well as increase the use of renewable electricity. Thus, the ability of electricity storage to curb carbon emissions depends on: the competitiveness of renewable energy against conventional electricity generation, and conventional power generation mix as storage increases fossil-fuel efficiency and reduces ramping costs.

We show that this Hotelling tax on carbon emissions is actually inefficient. The least-cost policy path takes advantage of the climate system's inertia to delay reducing emissions and allow greater cumulative emissions. The efficient carbon tax follows an inverse-U-shaped path and grows more slowly than the Hotelling tax. Economic models that assume exponentially increasing carbon taxes are overestimating the cost of limiting warming, overestimating the efficient near-term carbon tax, and overvaluing technologies that mature sooner.","[Lemoine, Derek] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, 1130 E Helen St,McClelland 401, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Lemoine, Derek] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rudik, Ivan] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 260 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Rudik, Ivan] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, 260 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA",University of Arizona; National Bureau of Economic Research; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Lemoine, D (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, 1130 E Helen St,McClelland 401, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.;Lemoine, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dlemoine@email.arizona.edu; irudik@iastate.edu,,"Lemoine, Derek/0000-0002-1298-9472",University of Arizona's Renewable Energy Network,University of Arizona's Renewable Energy Network,"Lemoine: Department of Economics, University of Arizona, 1130 E Helen Street, McClelland 401, Tucson, AZ 85721 and NBER (email: dlemoine@email.arizona.edu); Rudik: Department of Economics and Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, Iowa State University, 260 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 (email: irudik@iastate.edu).

Non-market valuation of urban ecosystems is useful to inform cost-benefit analyses -which is particularly pressing in developing world cities, where peri-urban forests are deteriorated. We estimate the recreational value of Desierto de los Leones National Park and Dinamos Park -two peri-urban recreational sites near Mexico City. Methods: We implement the Travel Cost Method which estimates the use value of a recreational site by inferring the annual demand for trips to such site. Demand estimation is carried out via latent class count models (LCCM) to control for the heterogeneity in preferences suggested by the presence of large number of visits from a subgroup of visitors. Results: Desierto de los Leones receives two types of visitors, each type assigning recreational values of 2008 USD 33 and USD 12 per trip. The weighted average recreational value of Desierto amounts to USD 223 annually per person. Dinamos Park is visited by three types of visitors. One type accounts for a third of the visitors, and is not responsive to travel costs. The second and third types assign recreational values of, respectively, USD 2 and USD 6 per trip. The weighted average recreational value of Dinamos amounts to USD 158 annually per person. Conclusions: We suggest that these estimates can be interpreted as lower bounds of the value of the recreational value of the forests under studies, due to Mexico City's sprawl, population increase, and the improvement in the economic conditions of its inhabitants.","[Martinez-Cruz, Adan L.; Sainz-Santamaria, Jaime] CIDE Reg Ctr, Ciudad De Aguascalientes, Mexico; [Martinez-Cruz, Adan L.] Univ Politecn Suiza Zurich, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Martínez-Cruz, AL (通讯作者)，CIDE Reg Ctr, Ciudad De Aguascalientes, Mexico.;Martínez-Cruz, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Suiza Zurich, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",adan.mar-tinez@cide.edu; jaime.sainz@cide.edu,"Martinez-Cruz, Adan L./ABI-7504-2020","Martinez-Cruz, Adan L./0000-0001-7865-5339",,,,,62,2,4,2,4,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

In order to identify causal effects running from offshoring to innovation, we use a quasi-experimental comparison group approach by means of (conditional) difference-in-difference estimations applied to German establishment-level data for firms that conducted offshoring activities in the period 2007-13. We find that the international relocation of business functions has a negative impact on the firms' propensity to be innovative in terms of product and process innovations as well as product improvements. While for larger firms the reduction in process innovations is most striking, potentially due to a lack of resources, stagnation in expertise and a reduction in intra-organizational learning-by-doing associated with the relocation of some business activities, for small and medium-sized enterprises we particularly observe a reduction in product innovations after the offshoring activity has taken place. When interpreting this 'pessimistic' picture on the link between offshoring and the innovation performance of firms, the reader should note that our findings for German establishments have to be assessed through the lens of a global economy in economic recession after 2008, which may have intensified the negative impact of offshoring on the firms' innovation performance.","[Mitze, Timo] Univ Southern Denmark, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark; [Mitze, Timo] RWI, Essen, Germany; [Mitze, Timo] RCEA, Essen, Germany; [Kreutzer, Fabian] Niederrhein Univ Appl Sci, Krefeld, Germany",University of Southern Denmark,"Mitze, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.;Mitze, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",tmitze@sam.sdu.dk,,"Mitze, Timo/0000-0003-3799-5200",,,,,51,4,4,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

The extent of downward nominal wage flexibility is somewhat greater in Korea than in Great Britain and the United States, which have the most flexible labor markets among OECD countries. Our analysis at the establishment level uncovers the nature of this downward nominal wage flexibility. The observed downward flexibility does not result from a fraction of employers cutting most of their workers' wages, but from a majority of employers cutting a fraction of their workers' wages fairly routinely. The size of nominal wage reductions is substantial. In addition, employers tend to 'choose' high wage earners for wage cuts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It discusses China's institutional and economic transformation through the lens of the model of growth and convergence developed in Acemoglu, Aghion, and Zilibotti (JEEA 2006), which emphasizes the dichotomy between investment- and innovation-led growth. The economic reforms introduced in the 1980s and 1990s have enabled the Chinese economy to grow at historically unprecedented rates through fostering investment, reallocation, and technology adoption from abroad. The Chinese stimulus package introduced in 2008 appears to have prolonged the longevity of China's investment-driven growth beyond its optimal point. Over the last decade, China has activated the engine of innovation-led growth. The article discusses the virtues and limits of such ongoing transition, based on research in progress using firm-level data on R&D and productivity growth.

It formalises the argument that, under certain circumstances, federations have an incentive to foster tax competition among their subunits in order to attract tax base from other federations. We show that optimal fiscal equalisation serves the purpose of redistributing income from rich to poor subunits and of choosing an optimal level of tax competition. The latter is chosen as a trade-off between three goals. First, decentralised tax rate setting has positive fiscal externalities within the federation and, thus, tax rates are inefficiently low. Second, in the presence of hold-up problems in investment, tax rates may be inefficiently high. Then, tax competition serves as a commitment device for low future tax rates and is, thus, welfare enhancing. Third, generous fiscal equalisation within the federation is a commitment to not aggressively compete with subunits outside the federation for tax base; as a consequence, with optimal equalisation, equilibrium tax rates are higher within and outside the federation-and even higher than in the case of centralised (i.e. federal level) tax rate setting.","[Becker, Johannes; Kriebel, Michael] Univ Munster, Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Becker, J (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Munster, Germany.",johannes.becker@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,45,2,2,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Our results can be summarized as follows. In the special case of a zero entry cost, an increase in the nominal interest rate decreases R&D, the arrival rate of innovations and economic growth as in previous studies. However, in the general case of a positive entry cost, an increase in the nominal interest rate affects the distribution of innovations that are implemented and would have an inverted-U effect on economic growth if the entry cost is sufficiently large. We also calibrate the model to aggregate data of the US economy and find that the growth-maximizing inflation rate is about 3%, which is consistent with recent empirical estimates. Finally, we also explore the welfare effects of inflation and consider a number of extensions to the benchmark model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Of particular interest are four well-defined historical examples of factionalism within the IRA. The history of Irish republicanism is consistent with the prediction that increasing the opportunities for cell members outside of life in the organization, particularly through amnesty, destabilizes the organization but leaves a hardcore of remaining terrorists.

We point out three of its striking empirical features, which current literature leaves unexplored: co-existence of steady growth of real transaction price and excess supply, accelerations in price-to-income ratio, and significantly strong positive correlation between real transaction prices and income inequality. A search-equilibrium model is built to explain these facts. Heterogeneous buyers and homogeneous sellers randomly search for partners to trade in a frictional property market The search equilibrium of the property market is either a high-price-and-low-transaction elitist matching equilibrium, or a low price-and-high-transaction pooled matching equilibrium. The terms of trade determine which equilibrium arises. Empirical observations argue for the development of China's property market through evolution from a pooled matching equilibrium to an elitist matching equilibrium. We set out to show that the market equilibrium is always inefficient, due to crowding out externalities and market incompleteness. Policy experiments support redistributive tax, as a means to improve social welfare. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, experimental evidence presents a high variation of truth-telling rates for strategy-proof mechanisms. We crash test the connection between the strategy-proofness of the mechanism and truth-telling. We employ a within-subjects design by making subjects take two simultaneous decisions: one with no strategic uncertainty and one with some uncertainty and partial information about the strategies of other players. We find that providing information about the out-of-equilibrium strategies played by others has a negative and significant effect on truth-telling rates. That is, most participants in our within-subjects design try and fail to best-respond to changes in the environment. We also find that more sophisticated subjects are more likely to play the dominant strategy (truth-telling) across all the treatments.

This effect is greatest when he starts. The longer he is employed at his job, the more the firm will already have learned about his ability. The incentives for an employee to influence the firm's perceptions of his ability decrease over time. If rotating the employee to a different job leads to new uncertainty about his ability, this generates a fresh impulse for effort. However, job rotation also reduces the employee's time horizon, thus reducing future rents from reputation. This trade-off leads to a unique optimum. We derive a simple rule of thumb for an optimal rotation time. Our main results still hold for cases of complete but imperfect information transmission. The incentive effects of job rotation also prevail in a setting in which skills are job-specific. We study several extensions: rotations across multiple employees, absence of commitment to a rotation time, different bargaining positions, discounting over time, and learning by doing effects.

In the past, Japan's worldwide tax system taxed foreign source income upon repatriation. However, to stimulate dividend repatriations from Japanese-owned foreign affiliates, the Japanese government introduced a foreign dividend exemption system in 2009 that exempted dividends remitted by Japanese-owned foreign affiliates to their parent firms from home-country taxation. This paper examines the effect of this dividend exemption system on profit repatriation by Japanese multinationals. We find that the response of Japanese-owned affiliates to the dividend exemption was heterogeneous. More particularly, foreign affiliates with a large stock of retained earnings were generally more responsive to the reform and significantly increased dividend payments to their parent firms in response to the enactment of the dividend exemption system. Dividend payments by these affiliates also became more sensitive to withholding tax rates on dividends levied by host countries under the new exemption system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Projects may differ in their value for the designer, and their cost is private information. In this allocation problem, the quantity of procured projects is endogenously determined by the mechanism. The designer faces ex-post constraints: the participation and budget constraints must hold for each possible outcome, while the mechanism must be strategyproof. We identify settings in which the class of optimal mechanisms has a deferred acceptance auction representation which allows an implementation with a descending-clock auction. Only in the case of symmetric projects do price clocks descend synchronously such that the cheapest projects are implemented. The case in which values or costs are asymmetrically distributed features a novel tradeoff between quantity and quality. The reason is that guaranteeing allocation to the most favorable projects under strategyproofness comes at a price of a diminished expected number of implemented projects. (C)2017 Elsevier Inc.

The question is evidently analogous to asking what makes one prospect riskier than another, but beliefs are neither objective nor representable by a unique probability. Our starting point is an abstract class of preferences constructed to be (strictly) partially ordered by a more ambiguity averse relation. First, we define two notions of more ambiguous with respect to such a class. A more ambiguous (I) act makes an ambiguity averse decision maker (DM) worse off but does not affect the welfare of an ambiguity neutral DM. A more ambiguous (II) act adversely affects a more ambiguity averse DM more, as measured by the compensation they require to switch acts. Unlike more ambiguous (I), more ambiguous (II) does not require indifference of ambiguity neutral elements to the acts being compared. Second, we implement the abstract definitions to characterize more ambiguous (I) and (II) for two explicit preference families: alpha-maxmin expected utility and smooth ambiguity. Thirdly, we give applications to the comparative statics of more ambiguous in a standard portfolio problem and a consumption-saving problem. Crown Copyright (C)2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the model, entrepreneur capital is subject to extortion which affects the extensive and intensive margins of entrepreneurship. Extortion rates are endogenous and hump-shaped across entrepreneurs despite common property rights. The quantitative analysis is guided by micro-level evidence related to extortion in Poland and yields a number of implications broadly consistent with establishment-level facts in developing economies.

We analyze these developments under two alternative model specifications: fixed and random effects panel data models. More precisely, in the random effects setting, we focus our attention in the analysis of some efficiency issues that have to do with the so-called working independence condition. This assumption is introduced when estimating the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of nonparametric estimators. In the fixed effects setting, to cope with the so-called incidental parameters problem, we consider two different estimation approaches: profiling techniques and differencing methods. Furthermore, we are also interested in the endogeneity problem and how instrumental variables are used in this context. In addition, for practitioners, we also show different ways of avoiding the so-called curse of dimensionality problem in pure nonparametric models. In this way, semiparametric and additive models appear as a solution when the number of explanatory variables is large.","[Rodriguez-Poo, Juan M.; Soberon, Alexandra] Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain; [Rodriguez-Poo, Juan M.] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland",Universidad de Cantabria; University of Geneva,"Soberon, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain.",soberonap@unican.es,"Rodriguez-Poo, Juan Manuel/F-6994-2016","Rodriguez-Poo, Juan Manuel/0000-0001-8751-3025; Soberon, Alexandra/0000-0001-5268-6751",Programa Nacional de Formacion de Profesorado Universitario/ Spanish Ministery of Education [ECO2013-48326-C2-2-P]; UCEIF Foundation [APIE 1/2015-17],Programa Nacional de Formacion de Profesorado Universitario/ Spanish Ministery of Education; UCEIF Foundation,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the Programa Nacional de Formacion de Profesorado Universitario/ Spanish Ministery of Education.

The model considers the effect of devaluation on output, sovereign debt valuation, and the development of bilateral economic relations between Italy and its major trade partners. The simulation results are consistent with the findings of recent applied research: the Italian economy would follow the V-shaped pattern observed in most currency crises. After an initial period of stress, and provided an appropriate set of countercyclical policy measures is implemented, real GDP would recover and resume growth at a reasonable pace. In particular, while the expected positive impact of nominal exchange rate realignment on external balance would be transitory, higher nominal growth would bring about a persistent reduction in unemployment and the public debt-to-GDP ratio. These results are robust to a set of sensitivity checks, considering a number of adverse circumstances such as exchange rate overshooting, financial panic, supply-side constraints, and the application of retaliatory tariffs.","[Bagnai, Alberto; Ospina, Christian A.

Three key results emerge. First, governments tend to bias outlays towards social expenditure and away from military expenditure at election times. Second, the size of this tradeoff is larger when we exclude countries involved in conflict, where national security plays an important role on voter choice. Third, while certain categories of social expenditure are higher during left administrations, military expenditure is higher during right administrations.

In this framework, the investor, with CRRA preferences, has two objectives: the maximization of the expected utility and the minimization of the portfolio expected illiquidity. The CRRA utility is measured using the portfolio realized volatility, realized skewness and realized kurtosis, while the portfolio illiquidity is measured using the well-known Amihud illiquidity ratio. Therefore, the investor is able to make her choices directly in the expected utility/liquidity (EU/L) bi-dimensional space. We conduct an empirical analysis in a set of fourteen stocks of the CAC 40 stock market index, using high frequency data for the time span from January 1999 to December 2005 (seven years). The robustness of the proposed model is checked according to the out-of-sample performance of different EU/L portfolios relative to the minimum variance and equally weighted portfolios. For different risk aversion levels, the EU/L portfolios are quite competitive and in several cases consistently outperform those benchmarks, in terms of utility, liquidity and certainty equivalent.","[Brito, R.

We first construct a small DSGE model to derive a dynamic expression of PIR, linking PIRto macroeconomic fundamentals and the stance of monetary policy. Based on the theoretically derived PIR, variance decomposition suggests that interest rate and real income growth appear to be the main sources for the deviations of PIR. Using the difference between actual PIR and the estimated fundamental PIR as the predictor, we find that both in-sample and out-of-sample forecastability of the PIR over the future dynamics of PIR are significant.","[Chen, Nan-Kuang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Sect 4 Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Cheng, Han-Liang] Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, 75 Chang Hsing St, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chen, NK (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Sect 4 Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",nankuang@ntu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 100-2410-H-002],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),We would like to thank two anonymous referees and the guest editor for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Particularly, we were interested in getting the insight into the fragment of the market that is operated by personal loan companies, with special emphasis on the profile of the average (statistical) borrower. Our examination was motivated by the controversies surrounding the law amendment started in Poland in 2015 in order to regulate the fraction of the consumer credit market represented by personal loan companies. By utilizing logistic and multivariate linear regression models with variables obtained from our survey, we tested whether the legal reform was well-informed and well-addressed. We found that Polish households have serious problems with distinguishing various entities that provide loans to private individuals and that such problems manifest even greater problem of material shortcomings in Poles' debt literacy. We also evidenced low public trust to lending entities, particularly to loan companies. In the light of the findings the law amendment is well-grounded, however it should be supported by actions aimed at enhancing households' financial literacy.","[Cwynar, Andrzej; Cwynar, Wiktor] Univ Econ & Innovat Lublin, Lublin, Poland; [Wais, Kamil] Univ Informat Technol & Management Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland; [Parda, Radoslaw] Leadership Consulting, Rzeszow, Poland",University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow,"Cwynar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Innovat Lublin, Lublin, Poland.",cwynary@gmail.com; wiktor.cwynar@gmail.com; kamil.wais@gmail.com; radekparda@gmail.com,"Cwynar, Wiktor/AAA-9664-2020; Cwynar, Andrzej/AAD-5409-2019","Cwynar, Wiktor/0000-0001-6890-5189; Cwynar, Andrzej/0000-0003-2702-0397",,,,,21,5,5,0,3,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

First, I exploit the variation over time and across states to identify the effect of an increase in class hours on same-aged students' intelligence scores, using data on seventeen year-olds from the German Socio-Economic Panel. Second, I investigate the influence of earlier instruction at younger ages, using data from the German National Educational Panel Study on high school graduates' competences. The results show that, on average, neither instructional time nor age-distinct timing of instruction significantly improves students' crystallized cognitive skills in adolescence. Yet, there is suggestive evidence that increasing instructional time may benefit male students exacerbating gender differences in numeracy.","[Dahmann, Sarah C.] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dahmann, Sarah C.] ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Sydney,"Dahmann, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Merewether Bldg H04, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",sarah.dahmann@sydney.edu.au,,,German Academic Scholarship Foundation,German Academic Scholarship Foundation,"This paper was largely written while I was at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) and I gratefully acknowledge funding from the German Academic Scholarship Foundation.

We compare four different designs: the uniform yardstick, the unweighted uniform yardstick, the discriminatory yardstick, and the best-practice yardstick. The effect of a specific design on prices depends on two separate mechanisms, one which affects the incentive power to increase productive efficiency and another which affects the risk of collusion. We show theoretically that for the best-practice yardstick, which is widely applied in several industries in a number of countries, these two mechanisms point in the same direction (high prices), which is confirmed by the experiment. Both the theoretical analysis as well as the economic experiment show that the discriminatory yardstick results in lower prices than the unweighted uniform yardstick. The theory, however, does not give a clear answer on the relative performance of the discriminatory versus the weighted uniform yardstick. In the experimental analysis, we find that the advantage of the discriminatory yardstick in terms of giving incentives to improve productive efficiency exceeds the disadvantage of a relatively higher risk of collusion. This conclusion appears to be robust for different degrees of heterogeneity of the industry. Hence the discriminatory yardstick yields the lowest prices for consumers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we apply agent-based computational techniques to explore this issue in a multi-market environment in which the processes driving the fundamental value of the securities traded in different jurisdictions are heterogeneous. A natural exemplification is to assume that security dealers have the opportunity to submit orders by choosing among stock markets at different stages of development. We argue that the proper policy objective to be pursued is not volatility in itself but price efficiency, that is, the volatility in excess of the discounted stream of subsequent dividends. In this case, a global coordination of tax rates is incentive-compatible, given that it minimizes the distortion associated with speculative trading, on the one hand, and it ensures that the loss of trading volume is lower if compared to the case of unilateral taxation on the other. Notwithstanding a fundamental heterogeneity of the markets involved, the optimal tax rate turns out to be symmetric provided that fundamental value trajectories are positively correlated.","[Gaffeo, Edoardo] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38100 Trento, Italy; [Molinari, Massimo] Univ Rome Tre, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy",University of Trento; Roma Tre University,"Gaffeo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38100 Trento, Italy.",edoardo.gaffeo@unitn.it,,"MOLINARI, MASSIMO/0000-0001-8635-5053",,,,,52,2,2,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The Northridge disaster featured a low rate of injury and a quick recovery, but long-lasting and well documented consequences for mental health. Difference-in-difference results show that infants born closest to the epicenter were 0.2 percentage points more likely to be born with low birth weight. Impacts were larger and more precisely identified for women who experienced the earthquake in their first or third trimester. Among the subsample of mothers most susceptible to stress first-time, single mothers low birth weight was 0.5 percentage points more likely to occur.

This paper examines choice of environmental policy instruments (tax-centered, quota-centered, and mixed policy) in markets where multiple dominant firms are price makers and multiple fringe firms are price takers. Environmental policy is not necessarily applied to all firms or facilities. This study focuses on the situation where only dominant firms are objects of environmental policy because this situation best reflects actual policy instruments. Understanding whether abatement costs exceed the environmental damage is essential to determining the best policy. The major finding of the study is that deadweight loss is reduced if dominant firms adopt eco-friendly technology and the regulator increases the ratio of taxed dominant firms to all dominant firms. Additionally, mixed policy is efficient when market distortion as a result of pricing power decreases.","[Mori, Daiken] Rikkyo Univ, Dept Econ, Toshima Ku, 3-34-1 Nishi Ikebukuro, Tokyo 1718501, Japan",Rikkyo University,"Mori, D (通讯作者)，Rikkyo Univ, Dept Econ, Toshima Ku, 3-34-1 Nishi Ikebukuro, Tokyo 1718501, Japan.",d.mori@rikkyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We apply relatively advanced dynamic two step system-GMM and quantile regression. Political stability is found to be a key determinant of economic growth. More importantly, political instability (or risk) is found to be higher in the OIC countries and is a deterrent to economic growth. Also, for the lower and middle income OIC countries, political instability appears to affect economic growth more severely perhaps due to the absence of strong economic and political institutions. Moreover, political instability is also found to be significantly higher in the oil -dependent OIC countries. Notably, political instability is likely to affect growth through the channels of investment and human capital accumulation in the developing countries. Finally, the impact of political stability and political instability on growth is found to be equally distributed across the OIC countries with higher or lower growth level. Therefore, the development of political and economic institutions along with human capital development is recommended for all the developing countries in general and the OIC countries in particular.","[Uddin, Md Akther; Ali, Md Hakim; Masih, Mansur] Lorong Univ A, INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur 59100, Malaysia",Lorong Universiti A; INCEIF,"Masih, M (通讯作者)，Lorong Univ A, INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur 59100, Malaysia.",aktherpu@gmail.com; bmhakimru@gmail.com; mansurmasih@gmail.com,"Uddin, Md Akther/R-1904-2017; Hakim, BM/K-9387-2018","Uddin, Md Akther/0000-0002-2134-6073; Hakim, BM/0000-0001-9159-530X; Masih, Mansur/0000-0002-9965-0091",,,,,51,77,82,1,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Fitting the model with forecaster-level data for Canada and the US, we identify three key differences between the two countries. First, the average estimated anchor of US inflation forecasts has tended to decline gradually over time in rolling samples, from 3.4% for 1989-1998 to 2.2% for 2004-2013. By contrast, it has remained close to 2% since the mid-1990 for Canadian forecasts. Second, the variance of estimates of the long-run anchor is considerably lower for the panel of Canadian forecasters than US ones following Canada's adoption of inflation targets. And third, forecasters in Canada look much more alike than those in the US in terms of the weight that they place on the anchor. One explanation for these results is that an explicit inflation-targeting regime (Canada) provides for less uncertainty about future monetary policy actions than a monetary policy regime where there was no explicit numerical inflation target (the US before 2012) to anchor expectations.","[Yetman, James] Representat Off Asia & Pacific, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yetman, James] Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland",Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Yetman, J (通讯作者)，Representat Off Asia & Pacific, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Yetman, J (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland.",james.yetman@bis.org,,,,,,,22,9,9,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The scientific novelty in this article is embodied by the interaction of various clusters of manufacturing with producer services. Taking the location quotient as the index measuring cluster, it was found that various manufacturing clusters and producer service clusters in the east achieved comparative equilibrium, while the middle and the west were comparatively imbalanced in development. By comparison of influencing factors, it was shown that decline of energy consumption and technology level, acceleration of multinational corporations, strengthening of competition and cooperation and strictness of regulation are beneficial to traditional industrial clusters. However, the effects of these factors on modern industrial clusters were the opposite. Empirical analysis showed that traditional manufacturing clusters had a close relationship with traditional producer service clusters, and were the opposite with modern producer service clusters.Finally, the countermeasures for achieving the interacting development of industrial clusters were proposed from aspects of the gradient development of producer services clusters, the guidance of dominant industries in manufacturing clusters, promotion of industry clusters by centralising high-levelled elements and the diversity of policy guidance.","[Li, Bingqiang] Lishui Univ, Sch Entrepreneurship, Lishui, Peoples R China; [Li, Bingqiang] Taizhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Taizhou, Peoples R China",Lishui University,"Li, BQ (通讯作者)，Lishui Univ, Sch Entrepreneurship, Lishui, Peoples R China.;Li, BQ (通讯作者)，Taizhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Taizhou, Peoples R China.",AndyLBQ@163.com,,,Zhejiang Soft Science [2015C35048],Zhejiang Soft Science,This study was supported by the Zhejiang Soft Science (project 2015C35048).,,34,5,5,5,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The presence of increasing marginal costs for exporters introduces significant market interdependence across borders missing from traditional models of international trade that rely on constant marginal cost technology. Such market interdependence represents an additional channel through which local shocks are transmitted globally. To identify increasing marginal cost at the level of the firm, we build in flexible production assumptions that nest increasing, decreasing, and constant marginal cost technology to an otherwise standard international trade model. We derive an estimating equation that can be taken directly to the data. Our structural equation explicitly guides our inference on the shape of the marginal cost curve from estimated coefficients. The results suggest that increasing marginal cost is predominant at the firm level. Moreover, utilizing plant-level information on physical and financial capacity constraints, we find that the degree of increasing marginal cost is significantly exacerbated by both types of constraints. The evidence suggests that access to larger markets through greater international integration may not have the expected welfare gains typically predicted in standard models.

We take the literature further in two ways. First, we analyze mechanisms through which social trust enables liberalizing reforms-by overcoming obstacles in the political process (stemming from ideology, ideological fractionalization, coalition government, minority government, and legislature-seat instability). Second, we define reforms as distinct changes in the quality of the legal institutions and in the scope of regulation and separate reforms that increase economic freedom in these two areas from reforms that decrease it. We study separately how social trust, interacted with the different types of political hindrances, affects the probability of reforms. We find a dual role of social trust in the political process-facilitating liberalizing reforms and making deliberalizing ones more difficult. This suggests that trust does not make agreement on any reform more probable-the content of the reform is crucial.","[Berggren, Niclas; Bjornskov, Christian] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Berggren, Niclas] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Inst Environm & Expt Econ KIE, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bjornskov, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Prague University of Economics & Business; Aarhus University,"Berggren, N (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",niclas.berggren@ifn.se; chbj@econ.au.dk,"Berggren, Niclas/N-3578-2019","Berggren, Niclas/0000-0003-0673-5123",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Swedish Research Council; Torsten Soderbergs stiftelse; Czech Science Foundation (GA CR) [16-19934S],Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Torsten Soderbergs stiftelse; Czech Science Foundation (GA CR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The authors wish to thank Andreas Ek, Shaomeng Jia and Joe Rieff, as well as conference participants at the 2016 Public Choice Society meeting in Fort Lauderdale, the 2016 European Association of Law and Economics meeting in Bologna and the 2016 Southern Economic Association meeting in Washington, DC, and two referees at this journal for helpful comments and suggestions, and the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation (Bjornskov), the Swedish Research Council (Berggren), Torsten Soderbergs stiftelse (Berggren) and the Czech Science Foundation (GA CR, grant No. 16-19934S) (Berggren) for financial support.",,63,25,25,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

For loss-averse players with choice-acclimating expectations, the utility from playing a mixed strategy is not linear but convex in the probabilities they assign to their pure strategies. As a consequence, they are generally unwilling to randomize and an equilibrium may fail to exist. For players with choice-unacclimating expectations, by contrast, randomizing over their pure strategies may indeed constitute a credible best response and an equilibrium always exists. Building upon these insights, we delineate how expectation-based loss averse players differ in their strategic behavior from their counterparts with standard expected-utility preferences, derive novel strategic effects, discuss equilibrium selection, and derive equilibrium play for some simple games.

Firms inside parks can improve performance due to certain advantages related to knowledge spillovers and shared resources that can be particularly useful in earlier stages of the industry life cycle. In these industries, local knowledge sharing is particularly useful because no standards are clearly established, as we have confirmed in a sample of 12,800 firms from the PITEC database, located either on- or off-park. We also find that young firms can benefit more from the park than more established businesses in terms of both business growth and innovative capacity. Although older firms have greater experience and investments that would increase their capacity to absorb external knowledge, their associated rigidities prevent them from incorporating changes into their structures.","[Diez-Vial, Isabel; Fernandez-Olmos, Marta] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Diez-Vial, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.",diezvial@ccee.ucm.es,"Diez-Vial, Isabel/ABF-9207-2020","Fernandez Olmos, Marta/0000-0002-5623-2391","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2015-67122-R, ECO2014-57131-R, ECO2011-29445]; Government of Aragon (Spain); European Social Fund through the COMPETE research group [S125]; Catedra de Empresa Familiar (University of Zaragoza) [UZ2016-SOC-01, 27242]; Grupo de Investigacion Consolidado Estrategias de Crecimiento Empresarial - Universidad Complutense de Madrid [940376]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Government of Aragon (Spain)(Gobierno de Aragon); European Social Fund through the COMPETE research group; Catedra de Empresa Familiar (University of Zaragoza); Grupo de Investigacion Consolidado Estrategias de Crecimiento Empresarial - Universidad Complutense de Madrid,"Funding for this research was provided by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (ECO2015-67122-R, ECO2014-57131-R, ECO2011-29445), the Government of Aragon (Spain) and the European Social Fund through the COMPETE research group (S125).

First, we define a new equilibrium concept that we call moment-based Markov equilibrium (MME), in which firms keep track of their own state, the detailed state of dominant firms, and few moments of the distribution of fringe firms' states. Second, we provide guidelines to use MME in applied work and illustrate with an application how it can endogenize the market structure in a dynamic industry model even with hundreds of firms. Third, we develop a series of results that provide support for using MME as an approximation. We present numerical experiments showing that MME approximates MPE for important classes of models. Then, we introduce novel unilateral deviation error bounds that can be used to test the accuracy of MME as an approximation in large-scale settings. Overall, our new framework opens the door to study new issues in industry dynamics.","[Ifrach, Bar] Airbnb, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA; [Weintraub, Gabriel Y.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Airbnb; Stanford University,"Ifrach, B (通讯作者)，Airbnb, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA.",,,,,,,,70,11,23,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

I extend our 1990 argument in three directions. First, instead of mark-up pricing, I model labor and product markets separately. The labor supply to the capitalist sector of the economy is assumed la Lewis to be unlimited. Consequently the wage cannot be determined endogenously but is fixed by an extended notion of subsistence based on Smith, Ricardo, and Marx. For tractability the product market is assumed to be perfectly competitive. The second innovation is to show how disequilibrium adjustment resolves the overdetermination inherent in the model. There are three equations - aggregate demand, goods supply, and labor supply -but two unknowns - the labor-capital ratio and the real price (the inverse of the real wage). Consequently equilibrium does not even exist until we define the adjustment process. The third innovation is to distinguish capital deepening from capital widening. This is important because, ceteris paribus, wage-led growth is more likely to stimulate the economy the greater the fraction of investment devoted to capital deepening. A final section of the paper shows that US data on employment and inflation since the 1950s are consistent with the theory developed in this paper.","[Marglin, Stephen A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Marglin, SA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,33,7,8,0,7,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Voluntary sustainable practices generate a positive and significant effect on corporate risk-taking. We also find that country-level determinants play a complementary role. Firms operating in countries with better intellectual property rights protection and overall infrastructure benefit more from environment-friendly practices and R&D intensity. Further, we find that ESI has a positive effect on risk taking in countries with higher CO2 emissions per capita, energy usages per capita and more stringent environmental policies. These results are robust after correcting for potential endogeneity, alternative measures of R&D intensity or ESI score.

Spatial Economic Analysis. Hedonic house price models need to account for spatial heterogeneity - the variation in the functional surface of shadow prices. In this context, the complexity of spatial domains raises issues for traditional spatial econometric methods. Specifically, discontinuities in the spatial surface need to be accounted for, including irregular boundaries, peninsulas and interior holes. Motivated by an application to housing markets, we develop a method for estimating the functional surface of a regression coefficient that varies over such an irregular spatial domain. Spatially varying coefficients for a specific regressor are estimated by a combination of three smoothing problems using splines based on finite element analysis. The effect of additional regressors is also allowed.

New measures of consumer inflation uncertainty are compared to the economic and monetary policy uncertainty indices of [Baker, S., N. Bloom, and S. Davis. 2016. Measuring Economic Policy Uncertainty. Quarterly Journal of Economics.]. Economic policy uncertainty is more strongly correlated with uncertainty about shorter-run inflation than with uncertainty about longer-run inflation, while monetary policy uncertainty is more correlated with uncertainty about longer-run than shorter-run inflation. Both economic and monetary policy uncertainty Granger cause inflation uncertainty. Consumer inflation uncertainty can be computed for demographic subgroups. High income and high education consumers have the lowest inflation uncertainty, but their short-run inflation uncertainty is most strongly correlated with policy uncertainty. The long-run inflation uncertainty of the top income quintile is less correlated with policy uncertainty, possibly reflecting stronger anchoring of inflation expectations for this group. Policy uncertainty appears to reflect the expectations of consumers more than professional forecasters or financial markets.","[Binder, Carola Conces] Haverford Coll, Econ 370 Lancaster Ave, Haverford, PA 19041 USA",Haverford College,"Binder, CC (通讯作者)，Haverford Coll, Econ 370 Lancaster Ave, Haverford, PA 19041 USA.",cbinder1@haverford.edu,,"Binder, Carola/0000-0001-5694-2070",,,,,55,4,4,30,162,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Signature Financial Group court case is largely responsible for opening the door on the issuance of business method patents, while the 2008, in re Bilski decision closed it (at least partially) once again. The result of the first decision was a significant increase in the number of patents issued and law suits filed for infringement. This paper is the first the authors are aware of to utilize these court cases as natural experiments to gauge investor belief regarding the utility of business method patents on publicly traded companies. We find that investor beliefs about the effect of business method patents on company value evolved between 1998 and 2008, as investors modified their expectations for the effects of the in re Bilski decision based on what actually occurred after the State Street decision. We also find that investor sentiment varied by industry subsector. Our findings offer insights into the ongoing debate over the utility of business method patents, which may inform managers, investors, and both statutory and regulatory policy makers.

Its latest project was the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) on 31 December 2015. Fulfilling these commitments would promote predictability in ASEAN, as well as strengthen its credibility. But to what extent has ASEAN met this deadline? The blueprint for achieving the goal envisages the AEC standing on four pillars and meeting the deadline depends on progress on each of them. Each pillar presents a demanding set of challenges to be met before the AEC can be fully realized. We find that although ASEAN has come a long way toward realizing its goal, considerable challenges remain. Accommodating AEC accords will not be easy when they require changes to domestic laws or even the national constitution. The flexibility that characterizes ASEAN cooperation, the celebrated ASEAN way, may hand member states a convenient pretext for non-compliance. How to enforce the accords remains an issue. If the AEC is to bemore than a display of political solidarity, ASEANmust find away to give the commitments more teeth.

Based on a formal theoretical model and ample empirical evidence, this article argues instead that currency crises are always and everywhere about external imbalances. They are usually preceded by booms in consumption, investment, and output. Since part of the added spending falls on imports, output and saving rise less than investment, pushing the current account into deficit. The exchange rate depends on the gap between cumulative capital inflows and the cumulative current account deficit. When the boom starts, this gap is positive and the central bank can hoard reserves and sterilize capital inflows. Yet later, as optimism fades, the gap inevitably turns negative, leading to the depletion of reserves and the collapse of the exchange rate. Panic can lead to precipitous speculative attacks.

We argue that, given China's institutional setting, FDI may be a channel for technology transfer but this does not necessarily lead to innovation.","[Qu, Yi] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Surrey Int Inst, Dalian 116025, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yingqi] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yingqi] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of Leeds,"Wei, YQ (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.;Wei, YQ (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",y.wei@leeds.ac.uk,"Qu, Yi/HPE-2345-2023; Wei, Yingqi/I-4245-2019","Wei, Yingqi/0000-0003-2556-880X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC: 71572150, 71673227]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We thank Professors Maria Socorro Gochoco-Bautista and Masahiro Endoh for valuable comments.

Under aggregate demand uncertainty, this improves screening for valuable projects. Entrepreneurial moral hazard and private cost information threatens this benefit. Crowdfunding's after-markets enable consumers to actively implement deferred payments and thereby manage moral hazard. Popular crowdfunding platforms offer schemes that allow consumers to do so through conditional pledging behavior. Efficiency is sustainable only if expected returns exceed an agency cost associated with the entrepreneurial incentive problems. By reducing demand uncertainty, crowdfunding promotes welfare and complements traditional entrepreneurial financing, which focuses on controlling moral hazard.","[Strausz, Roland] Humboldt Univ, Inst Econ Theory 1, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Strausz, R (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Econ Theory 1, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",strauszr@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,,"Strausz, Roland/0000-0001-7111-1486","DFG (German Research Foundation) [SFB/TR-190, SFB649]",DFG (German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I thank Helmut Bester, Simon Board, Tilman Borgers, Peter Cramton, Francoise Forges, Willy Fuchs, Sebastian Schweighofer-Kodritsch, Daniel Krahmer, Nicolas Lambert, Matthias Lang, Johannes Maier, Moritz Meyer-ter-Vehn, Steven Tadelis, Colin von Negenborn, Georg Weizsacker, two anonymous referees, and audiences at Ann Arbor (Michigan), Berkeley, EUI Florence, Harvard/MIT, Princeton, Stanford, Toulouse, Tutzing, and UCLA.

The study accounts for both the supply and demand effects of RPS - i.e., increased costs and a higher consumer valuation for regular power. Our analysis shows that the regular power price always increases after the introduction of RPS, while the effect of RPS on the equilibrium price of green power, the quantities of regular and green power, the welfare of consumers, and suppliers' profits is case-specific and dependent on the relative magnitude of the cost and utility effects, the strength of consumer preference for green power, the suppliers' costs before RPS, the impact of RPS on green power costs, and the degree of competition among power suppliers. While the introduction of RPS aims at increasing the use of green energy in electricity production, our analysis shows that the introduction of the policy can end up reducing the total quantity of green power used. Intriguingly, this adverse policy impact will occur under seemingly optimal conditions for the green power sector; i.e., a high consumer valuation of green energy and/or low cost difference between the green power and its conventional counterpart. Finally, the analysis shows that the policy design can play a key role in determining the incidence of RPS, while the identification of the winners and losers of the policy can provide insights on the political economy of RPS and the positions held by different groups in policy negotiations.

However, in states that expand their Medicaid programs, childless adults may obtain Medicaid without undergoing an intensive SSI disability review process and with substantially higher income and assets than the SSI program allows. This expanded availability of Medicaid coverage, independent of SSI participation, creates an opportunity to increase earnings and savings without jeopardizing health insurance coverage. In this paper, we use the natural experiments created by state decisions to expand Medicaid to nondisabled, nonelderly adults without dependent children to study the effect of decoupling Medicaid eligibility and cash assistance using a difference-in-differences study design. We collected data on the income eligibility limits, enrollment caps, and coverage characteristics of state Medicaid expansions to childless adults from 2001 to 2013. We combine these data with the nationally representative American Community Survey to estimate the effects of state expansion on SSI participation. We find relative declines in SSI participation of 0.17 percentage points on average after the introduction of Medicaid coverage for childless adults, a 7% relative decrease. This finding suggests the potential for small but important efficiency gains from separating SSI and Medicaid eligibility. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, a single market with all agents is optimal if and only if the meeting technology satisfies a novel condition, which we call joint concavity. Both outcomes can be decentralized by sellers posting auctions combined with a fee that is paid by (or to) all buyers with whom the seller meets.

We use two measures of diversification: i) entropy based on factors, constructed by principal components analysis, and ii) entropy based on asset risk. In each case, weights for each strategy are estimated by using the interior point method, for which monthly forecasts of returns are calculated a year ahead for each market Spot prices are modeled using an ARIMA model and bilateral contracts are modeled using growth rates. We compare risk-diversified portfolios with mean-variance portfolio. Although diversification does not necessarily mean a lower risk, we show that the mean-variance portfolio's risk is not always lower than the risk-diversified approaches. Also, we show that diversification converges to one for the highest risk portfolio, but this does not happen in the case of entropy based on factors, because one asset can participate in more than one principal component. Clearly, the mean-variance approach is unable to perform a diversified allocation. These results are useful for retailer-generators who want combine the criteria of risk and diversification.

We also provide an axiomatic characterization of the induced rationally inattentive preferences and show how they reveal the amount of information a decision-maker acquires.","[De Oliveira, Henrique] Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Denti, Tommaso] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mihm, Maximilian] NYU Abu Dhabi, Div Social Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Ozbek, Kemal] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); New York University Abu Dhabi; University of St Andrews,"De Oliveira, H (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",henrique@psu.edu; tdenti@princeton.edu; max.mihm@nyu.edu; kemal.ozbek@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Ozbek, Kemal/0000-0003-3265-233X",,,,,32,27,36,0,8,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

We find an apparent increase in the business life of firms who subcontract out part of their projects.

We propose and characterize a new notion of skewed distributions, and use a recursive non-expected utility to provide conditions under which rejection of symmetric noise implies rejection of negatively skewed noise, yet does not preclude acceptance of some positively skewed noise, in agreement with recent experimental evidence. In the context of decision making under uncertainty, our model permits the co-existence of aversion to symmetric ambiguity (as in Ellsberg's paradox) and ambiguity seeking for low likelihood good events.

These legal devices lower the visibility of a person's criminal record, and thereby reduce the informal sanctions that may be imposed on him. This reduction is enjoyed by the ex-convict only if he does not become a repeat offender, because otherwise he re-obtains a criminal record. Thus, the value a person attaches to having his record expunged is inversely related to his criminal tendency. Therefore, by making expungements costly, the criminal justice system can sort out low criminal tendency individuals - who are unlikely to recidivate - from people who have high criminal tendencies. Moreover, the availability of expungements does not substantially affect a first time offender's incentive to commit crime, because one incurs a cost close to the reduction in informal sanctions that he enjoys by sealing his criminal record. On the other hand, expungements increase specific deterrence, because a person who has no visible record suffers informal sanctions if he is convicted a second time. Thus, perhaps counter-intuitively, allowing ex-convicts to seal their records at substantial costs reduces crime. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To understand this practice, we propose a principal-agent model in which the charity optimally offers a higher commission to a more efficient solicitor, raising the price of giving significantly. Outsourcing is, therefore, profitable for the charity only if giving is very price-inelastic, which is not supported by empirical evidence. We show that outsourced fundraising can be optimal if: donors are unaware of this practice; the professional solicitor better activates donors' warm-glow feelings toward the cause; or there is a significant fixed cost of fundraising. We argue that informing the public of the mere existence of paid solicitations may be the most effective policy available. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The DEA model uses: adjusted operational cost as the input variable, seven output variables and weight restrictions. Although non-discretionary variables or environmental variables are available in the dataset, the regulator argued that no statistically significant correlation was found between the DEA efficiency scores and the non-discretionary variables. This study evaluates the statistical correlation between the DEA efficiency scores and the available environmental variables. Spatial statistic methods are used to show that the efficiency scores are geographically correlated. Furthermore, due to Brazil's environmental diversity and large territory it is unlikely that only one environmental component is sufficient to adjust inefficiencies across the Brazilian territory. Thus, a new combined environmental variable is proposed. Finally, a second stage model using the proposed environmental variable and accounting for a spatial latent structure is presented. Results show major differences between original and corrected efficiency scores, mainly for utilities located in harsh environments and which originally achieved lower efficiency scores.

Agents choose a behavior (e.g., tax evasion, production of low-quality products, corruption, harassing behavior, substance abuse, etc.) and then are randomly matched with another agent. There are complementarities in behaviors so that an agent's payoff decreases with the mismatch between her behavior and her partner's, and with overall negative externalities created by the behavior of others. A law is an upper bound (cap) on behavior. A law-breaker, when detected, pays a fine and has her behavior forced down to the level of the law. Equilibrium law-breaking depends on social norms because detection relies, at least in part, on whistle-blowing. Law-abiding agents have an incentive to whistle-blow on a law-breaking partner because this reduces the mismatch with their partners' behaviors as well as the negative externalities. When laws are in conflict with norms and many agents are breaking the law, each agent anticipates little whistle-blowing and is more likely to also break the law. Tighter laws (banning more behaviors), greater fines, and better public enforcement, all have counteracting effects, reducing behavior among law-abiding individuals but increasing it among law-breakers. We show that laws that are in strong conflict with prevailing social norms may backfire, whereas gradual tightening of laws can be more effective in influencing social norms and behavior.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jackson, Matthew O.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jackson, Matthew O.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Stanford University; The Santa Fe Institute,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",daron@mit.edu; jacksonm@stanford.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023","Jackson, Matthew O./0000-0001-9846-4249","NSF [SES-0961481, SES-1155302]; ARO MURI Award [W911NF-12-1-0509]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ARO MURI Award(MURI),"We thank Pascual Restrepo for excellent research assistance and comments.

In this paper, we theoretically examine the relationships among the stringency of effluent limits imposed on individual polluting facilities by permit writers, environmental protection agencies' monitoring decisions, and the ambient quality of the local environment. In particular, we explore the establishment of effluent limits when (1) the national emission standard represents only an upper bound on the local issuance of limits and (2) negotiation efforts expended by regulated polluting facilities and environmentally concerned citizens play a role. We find that the negotiated discharge limit depends on the political weight enjoyed and the negotiation effort costs faced by both citizens and the regulated facility, along with the stringency of the national standard and local ambient quality conditions.","[Arguedas, Carmen] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Earnhart, Dietrich] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Rousseau, Sandra] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Brussels, Belgium",Autonomous University of Madrid; University of Kansas; KU Leuven,"Arguedas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, Madrid, Spain.",carmen.arguedas@uam.es,"Rousseau, Sandra/C-8723-2011; Arguedas, Carmen/H-4170-2016","Rousseau, Sandra/0000-0001-8948-8644; Arguedas, Carmen/0000-0002-2719-6918","Spanish Government [ECO2011-25349, ECO2014-52372-P]",Spanish Government(Spanish Government),"We wish to thank Mitchell Polinsky, Daniel Klerman, Jun Jie Wu, the participants of the 2014 World Congress of Environmental and Resource Economists, the 2015 Conference of the Society of Environmental Lawand Economics, the 2016 Annual Conference of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, and two anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions on earlier drafts.

This paper deals with how groups of agents emerge in a dynamic contest characterized by lack of formal structure and uncertainty regarding the possible individual outcomes, focusing on the features of the cooperators and on the dynamics emerging among them. Through the development of a stylized agent-based model we start by showing how similarity in values can be a successful driver for cooperation but are also able to highlight the limits of such process, by looking at how and how much agents cooperate with similar others. A second-version of the model, where memory of past interactions has a role, introduces further dynamics and is able to create successful and relatively stable groups.","[Cruciani, Caterina; Pellizzari, Paolo] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy; [Moretti, Anna] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Cruciani, C (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy.",cruciani@unive.it; anna.moretti@unive.it; paolop@unive.it,"Moretti, Anna/AAQ-3310-2020; Pellizzari, Paolo/K-4927-2015","Moretti, Anna/0000-0002-6790-8924; Cruciani, Caterina/0000-0003-3368-7825",,,,,28,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

It posits that the Black/White pay gap may vary across occupations that require the use of different types of skills. We classify occupations into hard-skill intensive versus soft-skill intensive jobs using the skill content measures of different occupations from the Occupational Information Network (O*Net). We then use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and Current Population Survey (CPS) to investigate the impact of job skill type on the wage gap. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, we show that this wage gap in white-collar jobs is smaller for hard-skills jobs than it is for soft-skills jobs. Moreover, we demonstrate that, in response to variations in the wage gap across different occupations, Blacks are more likely to self-select themselves into hard-skills jobs, ceteris paribus. This shows not only that discrimination against Blacks varies across occupations, but also that such discrimination induces the self-selection of Blacks into certain occupations. Moreover, this finding highlights the role played by co-worker/customer discrimination in explaining the racial wage gap in the U.S. labor market. (JEL J15, J31)","[Fan, C.

Despite this individual impact, adding punishment or reward capabilities to the third party monitor has no significant effect in the aggregate.

We find that official purchases of foreign assets have a large positive effect on a country's current account that diminishes considerably as capital mobility rises. There is an important additional effect through the lagged stock of official assets. Official purchases of domestic assets, or quantitative easing (QE), appear to have no significant effect on a country's current account when capital mobility is high, but there is a modest positive impact when capital mobility is low. The effects of purchases of foreign assets spill over to other countries in proportion to their degree of international financial integration. We also find that increases in US bond yields are associated with increases in foreign bond yields and in stock prices, as well as with depreciations of foreign currencies, but that all of these effects are smaller on days of US unconventional monetary policy announcements. We develop a theoretical model that is broadly consistent with our empirical results and that highlights the potential usefulness of domestic unconventional policies as responses to the effects of foreign policies of a similar type.","[Gagnon, Joseph E.] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bayoumi, Tamim; Saborowski, Christian] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Londono, Juan M.; Sapriza, Horacio] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics; International Monetary Fund; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Gagnon, JE (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",jgagnon@piie.com,,,,,,,15,17,18,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Progressively, agent heterogeneity, local interaction, sentiment formation and out-of-equilibrium dynamics are becoming central pieces on the analysis of short-term business fluctuations. This paper offers a contribution to this new literature by exploring a macro framework where endogenous fluctuations emerge regardless from the occurrence of shocks to technology or preferences. The proposed setting separates firms into two groups, which follow different wage setting strategies. The firms may systematically change from one class of wage setters to the other following local interaction rules and by making a global assessment of the profitability of each of the wage setting alternatives. Under reasonable parameterizations, long-term large periodicity cycles are generated; these cycles might constitute a meaningful component of the observed output gap and price level volatility, a component that complements the typical view on exogenous disturbances over an otherwise stable economy.","[Gomes, Orlando] IPL, ISCAL, Lisbon Accounting & Business Sch, Ave Miguel Bombarda 20, P-1069035 Lisbon, Portugal; [Gomes, Orlando] IUL, BRU, Ave Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal",Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Gomes, O (通讯作者)，IPL, ISCAL, Lisbon Accounting & Business Sch, Ave Miguel Bombarda 20, P-1069035 Lisbon, Portugal.",omgomes@iscal.ipl.pt,"Gomes, Orlando/B-6043-2009; Gomes, Orlando/JAC-2919-2023","Gomes, Orlando/0000-0002-7251-8736",,,,,50,3,4,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

A more recent tradition argues that an increase in equality and a rise in the wage share can increase growth by increasing consumption and investment demand, so that growth is wage-led. Bhaduri and Marglin and others argue, however, that even if economic activity is demand-determined, a shift in income distribution towards profits can increase output and growth. This paper examines how a reduction in inequality affects economic growth, thereby contributing to the debate on wage-led and profit-led growth and broadening it to focus on inequality rather than the profit share. It does so by reviewing and re-examining the cases in which workers save, the determinants of investment, and the open economy, three issues that have been emphasized in the literature.","[Krishna Dutt, Amitava] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Krishna Dutt, Amitava] FLACSO, Quito, Ecuador",University of Notre Dame,"Dutt, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;Dutt, AK (通讯作者)，FLACSO, Quito, Ecuador.",,,,,,,,59,2,3,3,16,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The number of research activities regarding even more profitable release windows, such as home video or television, has been substantially lower. Although international distribution is essential for a motion picture project to break even, there has been little significant re-search on most other markets. This paper aims at summarizing the current state of research on the motion picture industry, particularly from marketing and management perspective, revealing research gaps, and proposing recommendations for future research endeavors. Therefore, a three-pillar scheme is developed to systemize previous findings: Research on intraorganizational decision making, contractual relationships between national stakeholders, and international market competition are differentiated. Since these insights are mainly derived from U.S. theatrical exhibition, they can hardly be applied to other markets and exhibition windows. Thus, potential research areas are identified to expand knowledge of posttheatrical and international markets.","[Kumb, Florian; Kunz, Reinhard] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany; [Kumb, Florian; Siegert, Gabriele] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Bayreuth; University of Zurich,"Kumb, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany.;Kumb, F (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",florian.kumb@googlemail.com,"Kunz, Reinhard/AAD-8676-2022","Kunz, Reinhard/0000-0003-4162-7400",,,,,212,7,7,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

However, when remittances, internal or international, provide social benefits similar to public transfers they may overlap: 'crowding-out' effects occur. Employing three long- sample Vietnam Household Living Standard surveys undertaken during the 2000s, this paper studies the crowding- out effects of remittances in Vietnam, a developing country that has experienced a soaring inflow of remittances since 2000. Significant crowding-out effects for both domestic and international remittances on income are found below the poverty line in Vietnam, consistent with an altruistic motive. Beyond this, transfer derivatives are positive and statistically significant in both areas, suggesting a switch of motives from altruism to exchange at the poverty line. The substituting relationship between public transfers and remittances observed for the rural poor reveals key challenges to delivering an equal and efficient social security system in the country.

Using a second round of follow-up data collected 18 months after the intervention, we find that the 6-month treatment effects are all sustained over the medium run.

To the extent an ECE exists, firms have an incentive to alleviate the effect through a variety of institutional nudges that promote consumers to make a choice. This study empirically tests the effectiveness of two institutional nudges on the ECE in a field experiment at a bar. Focusing on craft beer sales, we manipulate the number of options on the menu and use institutional nudges (a control menu, a menu with a special prominently displayed, and a menu with Beer Advocate scores). In the field experiment, the ECE was alive and well using the control menu, but the effect reversed itself when the menu included Beer Advocate scores. Our results suggest the ECE might be turned on and off by manipulating search costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate how this alters the incentives for participation in a technology-centred international environmental agreement (IEA) where countries choose between conventional abatement and a breakthrough abatement technology that exhibits a network externality. When switching technologies is costly, we obtain that equilibrium adoption is indeterminate because the future adoption rate is subject to strategic uncertainty. Participation in an IEA that mandates the adoption of the breakthrough technology will be complete only if countries expect that all other countries will adopt eventually. Long-run temperature targets can be regarded as a device to coordinate countries' expectations on that outcome.","[Narita, Daiju] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Kita Ku, Kita 9 Nishi 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan; [Narita, Daiju] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Wagner, Ulrich J.] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, Mannheim, Germany",Hokkaido University; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Mannheim,"Narita, D (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Kita Ku, Kita 9 Nishi 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan.;Narita, D (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",daiju.narita@econ.hokudai.ac.jp,"Narita, Daiju/AAH-2870-2020","Narita, Daiju/0000-0001-5695-9913; Wagner, Ulrich/0000-0002-4046-2803","Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness [RYC-2013-12492, ECO2012-31358]; Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation [JCI- 2009-04392]; Spanish Ministry for Science and Education [SEJ2007-62908]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry for Science and Education(Spanish Government); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness (RYC-2013-12492 to U.W., ECO2012-31358 to U.W.); Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation (JCI- 2009-04392 to U.W.); Spanish Ministry for Science and Education (SEJ2007-62908 to U.W.).",,19,2,3,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The main objective of this paper is to present a theoretical model that relates royal patronage with artist's creativity. Methods: This paper presents a theoretical model on the interaction between artists and gallerists of the 18th century, and it allows to study the optimal level of creativity applied by artists to their works. Results: The model predicts a positive relationship between royal patronage and creativity. Conclusions: The death of King Louis XIV and the consequent reduction in royal patronage could explain the decline, documented by art historians, in the level of complexity of art works produced during the Rococo period.","[Ponzio de Leon, Carlos Alejandro] Comis Fed Competencia Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,"de León, CAP (通讯作者)，Comis Fed Competencia Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",carlsaponzio@yahoo.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,5,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Moreover, we explore the relevance of the inequality extraction ratio (IER) in the analysis of social conflict, institutional instability and corruption. Methods: Estimation of IER and Gini index for 18 Latin American countries in the period 1990-2013, using household surveys. Estimation of multivariate econometric models with fixed effects to analyze the relationship between income distribution and indicators of social conflict. Results: AL improves two positions in the ranking of global inequality using the IER instead of Gini index. Within Latin America there is a process of convergence in levels of inequality, but the two measures evolve differently: while the Gini index increases in the 90s and decreases in the 2000s, the IER decreases throughout the entire period. In addition, we found a positive association between IER and social conflict. Conclusions: Using the IER, LA is not as unequal as with the Gini index. Moreover, countries in LA with high rates of IER are more likely to have high levels of social conflict.","[Serrano, Joaquin; Benzaquen, Ivana] Univ Nacl La Plata, CEDLAS, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Serrano, Joaquin] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",National University of La Plata; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Serrano, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl La Plata, CEDLAS, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.;Serrano, J (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",jserrano@cedlas.org; ibenzaquen@cedlas.org,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,7,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

This paper aims to fill this knowledge, gap by shedding further light on the impacts of different globalization dimensions (both economic and non-economic) on informality in developing countries. Employing a new Bayesian Model Averaging technique, which allows panel regression with fixed effects and endogenous regressors, we find that the indicators significantly affecting informality are trade integration, trade diversification and concentration, de facto and de jure financial openness, and social globalization. By contrast, many covariates found significant by previous empirical studies do not seem to be robust to being included in informality modelling.","[Thi Hong Hanh Pham] Univ Nantes, Inst Econ & Management, LEMNA, Chemin Cens Tertre, BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France",Nantes Universite,"Pham, THH (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, Inst Econ & Management, LEMNA, Chemin Cens Tertre, BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France.",thi-hong-hanh.pham@univ-nantes.fr,,,,,,,43,17,17,1,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This paper examines experimentally how pure pressure to justify affects conformity behavior in economic environments. The evidence suggests that pressure to justify increases sensitivity to norm deviations. In a one-shot anonymous interaction, compared with the case when the behavior is simply observed by the audience, individuals' behaviors are more likely to reflect what they believe the audience thinks they should do when they must explain their decisions to the audience. Whether justification pressure can discourage selfish behavior is positively correlated with the proportion of individuals who believe the audience disapproves of such behavior. The implications of these findings can help shape institutions to promote conformity and prosocial behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical studies have found a possible fifth stylized fact, roughness, and our approach explicitly incorporates this into the model of the prices. Our setup generalizes the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-based multi-factor framework of Benth et al. (2007) and allows us to perform statistical tests to distinguish between an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-based model and a rough model. Further, through the multi-factor approach we account for seasonality and spikes before estimating - and making inference on - the degree of roughness. This is novel in the literature and we present simulation evidence showing that these precautions are crucial for accurate estimation. Lastly, we estimate our model on recent data from six European energy exchanges and find statistical evidence of roughness in five out of six markets. As an application of our model, we show how, in these five markets, a rough component improves short term forecasting of the prices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, we provide an analytical, critical review of the key bibliography concerning some fundamental aspects that shape the relationship between economic globalization and cooperatives, an issue that has been generally neglected by previous literature. Three key fields are addressed: 1) the viability of cooperatives, based on their strengths and possible weaknesses, under current globalization; 2) the role of these organizations in promoting the local development and stability of local communities; and 3) the tensions and potentialities that internationalization entails for cooperatives. Based on the analytical review and the organization of the literature, we propose an agenda for further research. This includes some hypotheses and strategies for testing them that would be essential to assess the role of cooperatives in economic globalization, and sheds light on key areas for future research that could provide a better understanding of the complexity surrounding the relationship between globalization and cooperatives.","[Bretos, Ignacio; Marcuello, Carmen] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Bretos, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.",ignaciobretos@gmail.com,", Carmen/HTR-2718-2023; Bretos, Ignacio/HTN-4797-2023; Marcuello, Carmen/GMX-4468-2022; Bretos, Ignacio/AAQ-5137-2021","Marcuello, Carmen/0000-0003-1745-8037; Bretos, Ignacio/0000-0002-4941-2028","Aragon Regional Government; European Social Fund, S64 GESES-Research Group","Aragon Regional Government(Gobierno de Aragon); European Social Fund, S64 GESES-Research Group(European Social Fund (ESF))","This study is financed by the Aragon Regional Government and the European Social Fund, S64 GESES-Research Group.

The findings suggest that how individuals enter the labour market does matter for final earnings.

We interpret this finding as evidence of the entrapment hypothesis, in that, people who enter the labour market in more disadvantaged positions, such as in the household enterprise, either as self-employed or as unpaid family workers, suffer a penalty in their future earnings.

A novel feature of the study is the importance of market share on both sides of the importing relationship that of the exporting and importing firms. We find that exchange rate pass-through and the currency of invoicing are dependent on the size (or market share) of both importers and exporters. Very small or very large exporters have higher rates of pass-through and tend to invoice in the foreign currency, while it is the opposite for exporters in the middle range. By contrast, for larger importers, pass-through is lower and local currency invoicing is more prevalent.

We show how to derive a target criterion that is: (i) consistent with the model's structural equations, (ii) strong enough to imply a unique equilibrium, and (iii) optimal, in the sense that a commitment to adjust the policy instrument at all dates so as to satisfy the target criterion maximizes the objective function. The proposed optimal target criterion is a linear equation that must be satisfied by the projected paths of certain economically relevant target variables. It takes the same form at all times and generally involves only a small number of target variables, regardless of the size and complexity of the model. While the projected path of the economy requires information about the current state, the target criterion itself can be stated without reference to a complete description of the state of the world. We illustrate the application of the method to a nonlinear DSGE model with staggered price-setting, in which the objective of policy is to maximize household expected utility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Retailers provide product-specific services that increase demand and manufacturers use minimum RPM to compete for favorable retail services for their products. Minimum RPM increases consumer prices and can create a prisoner's dilemma for manufacturers without increasing, and possibly even reducing, the overall level of retail services. If manufacturer market power is asymmetric, minimum RPM may distort the allocation of services toward the high-priced products of the manufacturer with more market power.

Literature to date has not analysed the cross-country effect of the recent episode of price instability. Previous studies have either not considered this period or have not utilised panel data techniques and therefore have not provided a comparative analysis of developed and developing countries. This paper explores the income and price elasticities between these two country groups and discusses the economic implication of the results. We use a panel data analysis accounting for income and price asymmetry and apply the dynamic fixed-effects methodology to separate panels for developed and developing countries for the period 1980-2012. Sixteen countries are included in this analysis which account for over 65% of total global oil consumption. A particular focus is on the income and substitution effects. The results indicate heterogeneous response to oil price shocks. Developing countries have an income effect 6.3 times stronger than developed countries. The substitution effect in developed countries is 2.1 times stronger than in developing countries. Policy recommendations include the pursuing of oil-efficiency improving technology, and ensuring that regional consumption pattern variations are considered in policy formation.

In the Netherlands these benefits equal almost 40% of the market rent on average. We show that rent control benefits for the 10% tenants with highest income are 5% points higher than the benefits for the 10% with lowest incomes. Next we provide evidence that rent control influences the housing tenure choice decision. We find that on average rent control reduces transitions within the social housing sector, but not transitions from the social housing sector. Only the 20% tenants with highest incomes postpone moves out of social housing in response to rent control. This suggests that the inequitable distribution of rent control benefits is prolonged by the reduction in transition rates out of social housing. It also suggests that recent policy in the Netherlands that reduces rent control benefits for high income households can increase the mobility of those affected.","[Kattenberg, Mark A.

This has created a generation of children who remain behind in rural areas when their parents migrate for work. Previous research has found mixed impacts of parental migration on the educational achievement of left-behind children (LBC), perhaps because of methodological deficiencies and lack of recognition of the heterogeneity of this population of children. Our study attempts to examine the impact of six types of parental migration on the academic achievement of a rural junior high school sample. Our study uses a panel of 7148 junior high school students to implement a difference-in-difference analysis and finds that parental migration has a negative and significant impact on the academic achievement of junior high school students. Our study suggests that the Chinese Government should implement measures to dismantle barriers to the human capital accumulation of LBC to ensure sustainable economic growth and human capital development in China.","[Li, Lili; Wang, Lei; Nie, Jingchun] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China",Shaanxi Normal University,"Wang, L (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China.",lilili2996113@126.com; wangleiml@snnu.edu.cn; niejingchun@yeah.net,"Jingchun, Nie/F-4974-2016; Wang, Lei/JZT-4952-2024","Jingchun, Nie/0000-0002-7006-5796; Wang, Lei/0000-0001-5326-565X; Li, Lili/0000-0002-1243-9243",,,,,37,18,18,3,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2017,25.0,2,,,,,45,59,,10.1111/cwe.12193,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EP6EA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397469900003,0

I focus first on the expectations issue. For both Keynes and Friedman, monetary policy aims at the stabilisation of expectations; and in both cases, major issues arise for knowledge and uncertainty, although each conceives this in a different manner. Next I deal with the core of monetary policy principles: while Keynes's approach is at odds with our modern strategy of inflation-targeting, Friedman would warn us that, even in this case, interest-rate manipulation might not be the appropriate approach. The analysis concludes with the issue of interest rate determination-the issue of intertemporal coordination and financial stability. Policy principles are always rooted in theoretical investigation: Keynes's approach is based upon an analysis of intertemporal coordination failures, whereas Friedman's policy schemes require that financial markets be made perfectly competitive.","[Rivot, Sylvie] Univ Mulhouse, Mulhouse, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Haute-Alsace (UHA),"Rivot, S (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, BETA, 65 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",rivot@unistra.fr,,,,,,,70,0,0,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The theoretical framework relates income inequality to product quality and prices using a simple demand composition effect. The model predicts that a more unequal income distribution in a destination country leads to higher average prices, though the effect is nonlinear and disappears for rich enough countries. The predictions are tested using detailed firm-level data. Controlling for income per capita, prices are systematically higher in more unequal destinations, and the strength of this effect depends on income per capita. Results are particularly important for middle-income countries and hold only for differentiated goods, and in particular for products with a high degree of vertical differentiation.","[Flach, Lisandra] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany; [Janeba, Eckhard] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, Mannheim, Germany",University of Munich; University of Mannheim,"Flach, L (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany.",Lisandra.Flach@econ.lmu.de,,,,,,,50,10,10,3,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Issues of control are central to the definition of JVs, and this naturally calls for an interpretation in the context of the property rights theory (PRT) of the firm. In a series of seminal papers, Grossman, Hart and Moore (GHM) offer a rigorous framework to predict the allocation of control rights. Notably, under the standard assumptions of GHM, JVs are suboptimal. However, JVs are not suboptimal in more general settings where a number of the original framework's assumptions are relaxed. In the context of PRT, this paper surveys more than 20 contributions that address the optimality of JVs under contract incompleteness. The surveyed papers question the assumptions of GHM and reveal the circumstances in which JVs outperform sole ownership. Although contributions are scattered over time and bibliographical sources, we believe sufficient material has accumulated over 25 years of economic modelling to encourage some systematization. The discussion is organized in an intuitive and non-technical way; in particular, effort is devoted to analysing each paper in detail and providing a unified framework.","[Gattai, Valeria; Natale, Piergiovanna] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Natale, P (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy.",piergiovanna.natale@unimib.it,,,Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca; CISEPS,Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca; CISEPS,"The authors are grateful to the Editor, the Associate Editor, two anonymous Referees, Ferdinando Colombo and Mario Gilli for helpful comments and insightful discussions.

One prominent and well researched example is China's decentralization in 1980-1990s. This paper proposes a rationale to account for a voluntary devolution of centralized power by a non-democratic ruler through decentralization. The idea is that decentralization serves as a commitment device to ensure that ex post chosen policies reflect regional preferences, thereby boosting individual productive effort incentives, hence tax revenues used to provide national public goods. Thus, it helps to overcome the holdup problem, enhancing efficiency and possibly benefitting the non-democratic ruler. (C) 2016 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.

We show that an increase in health care supply due to a change in private physician, incentives has a theoretically ambiguous impact on patient welfare. The increase can reflect either induced demand for ineffective care or a reduction in prior rationing of effective care. Furthermore, physician market structure matters in determining the welfare effects of changes in private physician incentives. We then analyze a change to Medicare fees that caused physicians to increase their provision of chemotherapy. We find that this increase in treatment improved patient survival, extending median life expectancy for lung cancer patients by about 18%. Consistent with the model, we find that while the treatment response was larger in less concentrated markets, survival improvements were larger in more concentrated markets.

We integrate a limited extraction capacity and related investments in the endogenous growth model of Tsur and Zemel (2005) to study its effect on economic development. The capacity constraint gives rise to three effects. On the one hand, higher energy costs and the reallocation of production towards capacity investments decrease production available for consumption, research and/or capital investments (energy costs and reallocation effect). On the other hand, research investments may increase, which boosts available production (research effect). Depending on the capital endowment and the strength of the effects, long-run consumption may be boosted or depressed. In particular, the capacity constraint may render everlasting consumption growth non-optimal in a resource-rich economy. Furthermore, we find that capacity investments may be postponed to later points in time if the capital endowment is high.","[Kollenbach, Gilbert] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Hagen, Germany; [Kollenbach, Gilbert] Univ Siegen, Sch Econ Disciplines, Siegen, Germany",Fern University Hagen; Universitat Siegen,"Kollenbach, G (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Hagen, Germany.;Kollenbach, G (通讯作者)，Univ Siegen, Sch Econ Disciplines, Siegen, Germany.",Gilbert.Kollenbach@Fernuni-Hagen.de,"Kollenbach, Gilbert/AAO-4207-2020","Kollenbach, Gilbert/0000-0002-1168-3316",,,,,33,4,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

But why economic institutions vary across countries and what are their deep origins is still a question that is widely debated in the developmental economics literature. In this study, we provide an empirical test for the provocative hypothesis that the prevalence of infectious diseases influenced the formation of personality traits, cultural values, and even morality at the regional level (the so called Parasite- Stress Theory of Values and Sociality), which then shaped economic institutions across countries. Using the prevalence of pathogens as an instrument for cultural traits such as individualism, we show in a two-stage least squares analysis that various economic institutions, measured by different areas of the index of Economic Freedom by the Heritage Foundation, have their deep origins in the historical prevalence of infectious diseases across countries. Our causal identification strategy suggests that cultural values affect economic institutions even after controlling for a number of confounding variables, geographic controls, and for different sub-samples of countries. We further show that the results are robust to four alternative measures of economic and political institutions.","[Nikolaev, Boris] Baylor Univ, Dept Entrepreneurship, One Bear Pl 98011, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Nikolaev, Boris] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Salahodjaev, Raufhon] Westminster Int Univ Tashkent, Tashkent, Uzbekistan; [Salahodjaev, Raufhon] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL USA; [Salahodjaev, Raufhon] CARG, Tampa, FL USA",Baylor University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Westminster International University Tashkent; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Nikolaev, B (通讯作者)，Baylor Univ, Dept Entrepreneurship, One Bear Pl 98011, Waco, TX 76798 USA.;Nikolaev, B (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",borisnikolaev@gmail.com; salahodjaev@gmail.com,"Nikolaev, Boris/JZT-5006-2024; Salahodjaev, Raufhon/AAZ-8549-2020","Salahodjaev, Raufhon/0000-0002-5578-811X",,,,,75,46,48,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2017,70.0,1,,,,,97,128,,10.1111/kykl.12132,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EM6FP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395408500005,0

Learning gives rise to an incentive for the central bank to accommodate less the effect of inflation expectations and cost-push shocks on inflation and induces thus a deviation from rational expectations equilibrium. However, discretionary monetary policy under learning suffers from an excessively low stabilization bias. To improve the social welfare, the government should appoint a liberal central banker, i.e., set a negative optimal inflation penalty that decreases with the value of learning coefficient. The main conclusions are valid under both constant- and decreasing-gain learning.","[Andre, Marine Charlotte; Dai, Meixing] BETA, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",,"André, MC (通讯作者)，BETA, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",,,"Andre, Marine Charlotte/0000-0003-4554-7598",,,,,60,3,3,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

A standard New Keynesian framework with learning supports this claim both asymptotically, because a higher inflation target shrinks the E-stability region when a central bank follows a Taylor rule, and in the transition phase, because a higher inflation target slows down the speed of convergence of expectations. Transparency helps anchoring expectations. However, the importance of being transparent diminishes with the level of the inflation target. Finally, the higher the inflation target, the more policy should respond to inflation and the less to output to guarantee E-stability. Hence, a policy that increases both the inflation target and the monetary policy response to output would be reckless.","[Ascari, Guido] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Florio, Anna] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via Lambruschini 4-B, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Gobbi, Alessandro] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, Milan, Italy; [Gobbi, Alessandro] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Felice 5, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Oxford; Polytechnic University of Milan; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Pavia,"Ascari, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",guido.ascari@economics.ox.ac.uk; anna.florio@polimi.it; alessandro.gobbi@unipv.it,"florio, anna/AAA-8696-2019","ASCARI, GUIDO/0000-0002-5037-1964","MIUR through PRIN 09 programme; European Union [288501, 612796]",MIUR through PRIN 09 programme; European Union(European Union (EU)),"The authors thank Klaus Adam, Efrem Castelnuovo, Martin Ellison, Takushi Kurozumi, and Seppo Honkapohja for helpful comments.

Results show the existence of a non-linear relationship between economic growth rate and inflation. They indicate that the threshold for the influence of inflation on economic growth is 12.88%, and an inflation rate exceeding this threshold level negatively influences economic growth whereas an inflation rate under this threshold positively influences economic growth. These results show that a high inflation rate will have a considerable influence on economic growth. In this respect, it is crucial to ensure sustainable growth, which plays a significant part in increasing the efficiency of the monetary policies implemented and assuring stability. Hence, while determining the target inflation rate in their attempts to deal with inflation, political and economic decision-makers in these economies should not disregard the concept of threshold within the framework of monetary policy.","[Aydin, Celil] Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, TR-10200 Bandirma, Turkey",Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University,"Aydin, C (通讯作者)，Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, TR-10200 Bandirma, Turkey.",celil.aydin@atauni.edu.tr,"AYDIN, Celil/AAE-3086-2020; Alemu, Minyahil/ABC-7732-2020","AYDIN, Celil/0000-0002-0398-9884;",,,,,40,2,5,0,5,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

In theory, while financialization leads to a rise in financial investments by nonfinancial corporations and thus deviates funds from real investment, it also intensifies the pressure for financial payments and therefore restricts the funds available for real investment. We estimate an aggregate investment function including control variables (profitability, debt, cost of capital and output growth) and two measures of financialization (financial receipts and financial payments). The study concludes that there is a long-term investment equation, and finds evidence that the process of financialization has hampered real investment largely as a result of financial payments. The article also finds that profitability and debt are both detrimental to real investment.","[Barradas, Ricardo] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Barradas, Ricardo; Lagoa, Sergio] Dinamia CET IUL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Barradas, Ricardo] Inst Politecn Lisboa, ESCS, Lisbon, Portugal; [Barradas, Ricardo] Inst Politecn Lisboa, ISCAL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lagoa, Sergio] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Dept Polit Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Barradas, R (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Lisbon, Portugal.;Barradas, R (通讯作者)，Dinamia CET IUL, Lisbon, Portugal.;Barradas, R (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Lisboa, ESCS, Lisbon, Portugal.;Barradas, R (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Lisboa, ISCAL, Lisbon, Portugal.",,"Barradas, Ricardo/ABC-1847-2020","Barradas, Ricardo/0000-0003-0212-3568; Lagoa, Sergio/0000-0003-2790-6518",Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/SOC/03127/2013] Funding Source: FCT,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),,,60,29,31,5,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

With the aid of dynamic model averaging, this paper aims to highlight that this relation resurfaces if (i) inflationary pressures are captured by a richer set of real activity measures, and (ii) one accounts for the existence of a non-linear response of inflation to the driving variable. Based on data for the US and other G7 countries, our results show that the relation between economic activity and inflation is quite sturdy when one allows for more complex assessment of the former. We find that measures of economic activity describe inflation developments to a varying degree across time and space. This can blur the picture of inflation-real economy comovements in models where only a single variable of economic activity is considered. The output gap is often outperformed by unemployment-related variables. Our results also confirm a weakening of the inflation-activity relationship (i.e. a flattening of the Phillips curve) in the last decade that is robust both across activity measures and across countries.","[Vasicek, Borek] Czech Natl Bank, Econ Res Dept, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vasicek, Borek] European Commiss, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, Brussels, Belgium; [Baxa, Jaromir] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Baxa, Jaromir] AS CR, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Plasil, Miroslav] Czech Natl Bank, Financial Stabil Dept, Prague, Czech Republic; [Plasil, Miroslav] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech National Bank; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vasícek, B (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Econ Res Dept, Prague, Czech Republic.;Vasícek, B (通讯作者)，European Commiss, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, Brussels, Belgium.",borek.vasicek@gmail.com,"baxa, Jaromir/K-3195-2019","baxa, Jaromir/0000-0002-9768-209X",Czech National Bank Research Project [B7/11]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P402/12/G097],Czech National Bank Research Project; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"This work was supported by Czech National Bank Research Project No. B7/11.

We also establish a link between optimal severance and efficiency of the legal system and characterize the effects of shifting the burden of proof from the employer to the worker. Quantitatively, the welfare effects of suboptimal severance payments vary in general equilibrium between I and 3 %. The model accounts also for two neglected features of the legislation. The first is the discretion of judges in declaring the nature, economic vs. disciplinary, of the layoff. The second feature regards the relationship between severance and tenure.

In the basic version of the trade gravity model, we take into account the standard factors suggested by the literature of the subject. In its extended version, we control for additional factors including relative endowments of factors of production, a technological gap as measured by TFP and relative patenting performance, quality of institutions or impact of regional and bilateral trade agreements or exchange rate volatility. In most of the cases, the coefficients for the traditional gravity determinants are economically sensible and their impact on the dependent variable is statistically significant. The gravity approach proves to be a robust tool for identifying the determinants of trade intensity and thus for predicting future trade flows.","[Broclzicki, Tomasz] Univ Gdansk, Econ European Integrat Div, Fac Econ, Sopot, Poland; [Broclzicki, Tomasz] Univ Gdansk, Inst Dev, Sopot, Poland; [Ciolek, Dorota] Univ Gdansk, Dept Econometr, Fac Management, Gdansk, Poland; [Ledziewska, Katarzyna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; University of Warsaw,"Broclzicki, T (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Econ European Integrat Div, Fac Econ, Sopot, Poland.;Broclzicki, T (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Inst Dev, Sopot, Poland.",,"Śledziewska, Katarzyna/ABF-8746-2020","Śledziewska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-0824-4582; Ciolek, Dorota/0000-0001-7042-6638",National Science Centre (NCN) [2012/05/B/HS4/04209],National Science Centre (NCN),"The research was conducted and financed within the grant of the National Science Centre (NCN) entitled An analysis of international trade of Poland in the light of new trade theories.

The paper, then, evaluates the effects of the fiscal mix against one particular counterfactual. Namely, the paper asks: how would the euro-area macro-economy have evolved if the Member States had strictly adhered to the fiscal behaviour embedded in pre-crisis fiscal rules? Towards this end, the paper first puts the fiscal mix into the context of New Keynesian business cycle theory, arguably the dominant theory of business cycles to date. The paper, then, builds a two-country model of a currency union to provide a quantitative assessment of how the fiscal mix may have affected the 'Core' countries and the 'Periphery' of the euro-area. The results suggest that fiscal policy in the euro-area as a whole and in each of the two blocks separately stimulated economic activity more and that public debt rose more than would have been the case under strict adherence to pre-crisis fiscal behaviour.","[Callegari, Giovanni] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; CEPR, Washington, DC USA",European Central Bank; University of Bonn; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Callegari, G (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

The ambition is not predictive, as most economic cycle models have, while it is rather explicative. Authors use examples of China, USA and Europe to show interaction of long and ultra-long waves. The paper concludes that cyclical changes in strategy mix necessarily influence cyclical development of product. We find that strategic cycle theory can offer a good explanation for long term cyclical waves, because, as we assume, diverse strategies adopted by different generations result from changing circumstances for decisionmaking while framing their life strategies.","[Cermakova, Klara] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Vorlicek, Jan] Coll Business & Law, Vltavska Str 576, Prague 5, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cermáková, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",Klara.cermakova@vse.cz; j.h.vorlicek@seznam.cz,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,273,282,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300027,0

This encounter with the lower bound provides a natural experiment for investigating the causes of monetary policy inertia. To exploit this experiment, we estimate Taylor rules with Tobit specifications that permit both interest rate smoothing and persistent shocks (serial correlation) as explanations for inertia. The interest rate smoothing hypothesis leads to a specification in which lagged actual values of the dependent variable appear on the right-hand side of the Taylor rule, while the persistent shocks hypothesis leads to a specification in which lagged values of an unobserved latent dependent variable appear on the right-hand side of the Taylor rule. The divergence of actual and latent dependent variables that occurs at the lower bound provides leverage in distinguishing the two hypotheses. For a conventional Taylor rule, we find evidence of both sources of inertia. For a modified Taylor rule that includes a measure of financial stress, our evidence suggests that interest rate smoothing is the principal source of monetary policy inertia.","[Chappell, Henry W., Jr.] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [McGregor, Rob Roy] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Belk Coll Business, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",American University of Sharjah; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"McGregor, RR (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Belk Coll Business, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",rrmcgreg@uncc.edu,,,,,,,31,4,4,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We build a probabilistic input demand function from entropy maximization in which firms may purchase some of their inputs from other firms paying the required transport costs and accounting for the spatial structure of trading partners in a geographical system. In the second model, firms trade inputs to reduce the overall cost of production and intermediate sales are encouraged by low distance costs and low competition from alternative input sources.

Second, we decompose the income Gini into the determinants of income generation functions. Based on the decomposition result, socio-economic factors are the most important determinants of income inequality followed by geographic factors. Demographic factors have the least effect on income inequality in all four countries. Third, we propose a new method to quantify the effect of change in each covariate of income generation function on income Gini. That allows us to quantify the effects of change in specific policy such as increase in investment in schooling or public health to specific group of the population in society on income inequality.

Basic innovations determine so called long-term cycles (also long waves), on which the process of medium-term business cycles then depends. The second phase of each long wave is characterized by stagnation phenomena in economics, which is a huge issue of the current situation, because at the moment we are in the final phase of one of these long waves.

Results: We estimate one cointegration vector that represents the labor demand function. We perform hypothesis testing on this function: zero degree homogeneity in prices; unitary product demand elasticity; structural break in the labor demand function intercept; change in the long run product demand elasticity between sub-periods; existence of adjustment costs. Conclusions: The income elasticity of demand was unstable after the crisis, although not in the sense suggested by the previous debate.

In this case, when the private production and public sector are small, the central government should transfer from the productive regions local government to low-productive regions.","[Furukawa, Akiyoshi] Chukyo Univ, Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Chukyo University,"Furukawa, A (通讯作者)，Chukyo Univ, Sch Econ, Showa Ku, 101-2 Yagoto Honmachi, Nagoya, Aichi 4668666, Japan.",ecockawa@mecl.chukyo-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The beta distribution has been traditionally proposed as the underlying distribution of this methodology. However, the original expressions proposed by the creators of PERT are only obtained from the beta distribution if a constant variance is considered. This paper analyses, from a critical point of view, the hypothesis of constant variance in PERT methodology. The main conclusion is that if, as it is usual, the beta is the underlying distribution, the hypothesis of constant variance is more reasonable than the variance depending on the most likely value, m. Alternatively, other distributions are presented where the hypothesis of constant variance will not seem adequate. This fact suggests that despite of its historical application, the beta distribution should not be an appropriate distribution to be applied in PERT.","[Garcia Perez, Jose] Univ Almeria, Ctra Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Garcia Garcia, Catalina; Lopez Martin, Maria del Mar] Univ Granada, Campus Univ La Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; University of Granada,"Pérez, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Almeria, Ctra Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain.",jgarcia@ual.es; cbgarcia@ugr.es; mariadelmarlopez@ugr.es,"MARTIN, MARIA DEL MAR MM.L.M LOPEZ/IZP-7948-2023; garcia, catalina/JAC-6069-2023; garcia, catalina/M-9019-2014; garcia perez, Jose/HMP-1301-2023","garcia, catalina/0000-0003-1622-3877; garcia, catalina/0000-0003-1622-3877;",,,,,15,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,407,417,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300040,0

In the context of the empirical study, we adopt a multivariate BEKK-GARCH model with its asymmetric generalization. Overall, our results suggest that there is a significant shock and volatility transmission from the S&P 500 to the other stock markets while the opposite (from the others to the US) is also observed for some market-pairs under investigation. Furthermore, we analyze whether market volatilities and time-varying correlations significantly change during the different phases of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis or not. The linear regression analyses with the dummy indicators suggest heightened variances and correlations, which signifies the crisis spillover and contagion.","[Gencer, Hatice Gaye; Hurata, Mehmet Yasin] Yeditepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey",Yeditepe University,"Gencer, HG (通讯作者)，Yeditepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business Adm, Istanbul, Turkey.",gaye70@yahoo.com,"Gencer, Hatice/AAY-1010-2020",,,,,,38,1,1,0,4,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

ARDs are civilian deaths that occurred during or shortly after an arrest or detention by state or local law enforcement. These deaths may be attributed to a variety of factors, including use of force by police, injuries sustained when attempting to elude police, self-inflicted injuries and medical conditions. Using data compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statistics for the period 2003-2009 and employing a Poisson regression model, the results of the present study suggest that race is not statistically related to ARDs. Hence, the percentage of a state's population that is African-American has no effect on ARDs. The factors found to be most significantly related to ARDs include the gun-related murder rate, the percentage of the state population that is under the age of 35, population density and police per capita. All were found to be positively related to ARDs. This study is one of the first studies that examines the determinants of state-level ARDs, and this study is one of the few studies on ARDs that finds that race is not a factor in ARDs","[Gius, Mark] Quinnipiac Univ, Dept Econ, Hamden, CT 06518 USA",Quinnipiac University,"Gius, M (通讯作者)，Quinnipiac Univ, Dept Econ, Hamden, CT 06518 USA.",Mark.gius@quinnipiac.edu,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The traditional view of intergovernmental grants is that grants can be used by the central government to correct for positive spillover externalities or fiscal equalization. We first we explain how the set-up of the developing soft budget constraint view of grant policy differs from the traditional view in fundamental ways. We then use a simple workhorse model of intergovernmental soft budgets under perfect information to examine different motivations for central government bailouts and expand the usual textbook analysis of grants to illustrate the intertemporal distortions under the alternative view of grants. This type of model has been extended in various directions. We examine extensions that include capital taxation, tax competition, forms of equalizing grants, overlapping budget constraints, multiple grant instruments, and the case when public spending is an input to private production. We also briefly review certain papers that examine intergovernmental soft budgets and bailouts when public investment has uncertain returns, a feature of the original models relating to SOEs, and a closely related literature that deals with decentralized leadership and an analogy to Becker's Rotten Kid Theorem. We conclude with some thoughts on directions for future research.","[Goodspeed, Timothy J.] CUNY Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Goodspeed, Timothy J.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, CES Ifo, GEN, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Goodspeed, TJ (通讯作者)，CUNY Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.;Goodspeed, TJ (通讯作者)，CUNY, Grad Ctr, CES Ifo, GEN, New York, NY 10021 USA.",,,"Goodspeed, Timothy J./0000-0002-5983-6078",,,,,40,12,12,0,8,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2017,,221,,,,,113,134,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.17.2.5,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FT6OG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423272900005,0

We analyse ownership and technology choices in vertical R&D collaborations. Under non-contractible R&D outcomes, trade-offs arise between R&D specifically designed towards a manufacturer (increasing investment productivity) and a general technology (hold-up reduction). Stronger downstream competition shifts optimal ownership towards the supplier and favours contracting over ownership rather than specific performance contracts. Downstream ownership is combined with the specific technology if the supplier's expertise is more pronounced or the specific technology is more productive. Contracts incorporating exit clauses increase the gains from collaborations.","[Herbst, Patrick] Univ Stirling, Stirling, Scotland; [Walz, Uwe] Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Stirling; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Herbst, P (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling, Scotland.",,"Walz, Uwe/D-1926-2013","Herbst, Patrick/0000-0003-2916-7456",LOEWE center SAFE,LOEWE center SAFE,"We would like to thank session and seminar participants at the annual EEA conference in 2009 in Barcelona, the Verein fur Socialpolitik meeting 2009, the 9th annual International Industrial Organization conference in Boston, the German Economic Association of Business Administration 2008, the 2010 ISNIE conference, the Christmas meeting of the German Economists Abroad Network 2010 and the University of Tuebingen 2014 for helpful comments on a previous version of the paper.

The article elucidates such variations by combining three analytical approaches, namely, (i) modes of innovation (differentiating between science-technology-innovation (STI) and doing-using-interacting (DUI) modes), (ii) regional innovation systems (distinguishing between organizationally thick and diversified, thick and specialized, and thin systems), and (iii) types of knowledge linkages that connect actors during the innovation process. We explore in detail the key characteristics of the spatial architectures of innovation and knowledge flows in STI and DUI industries located in regional innovation systems with varying degrees of organizational thickness and specialization. We also discuss empirical examples documented in the extant literature to illustrate our arguments on how innovation and knowledge circulation unfold in space in various territorial and industrial contexts.","[Isaksen, Arne] Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway; [Trippl, Michaela] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria",University of Agder; University of Vienna,"Isaksen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway.",arne.isaksen@uia.no; michaela.trippl@univie.ac.at,,,Research Council of Norway [233737/O50],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),Parts of the work were supported by the Research Council of Norway (grant number 233737/O50).,,82,67,72,6,86,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The two-stage estimates of the earnings equation, corrected for worker selectivity, are used to decompose the gender earnings differentials into productivity-related and discriminatory factors. Our results suggest that the size of the gender earnings gap is larger in the wage sector than in the self-employment sector, but not by large margin, and so is the discrimination effect when not controlled for worker selectivity. With worker selectivity controlled, the discrimination effect is greatly intensified in the wage sector, while it becomes not significant in the self-employment sector. These findings imply that the observed gender earnings gap in the wage sector is largely ascribed to discrimination against women, while the gender earnings gap in the self-employment sector is mostly due to productivity difference that, in part, is caused by worker selectivity.","[Jung, Jin Hwa] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Seoul, South Korea; [Choi, Kang-Shik] Yonsei Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Yonsei University,"Choi, KS (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",kangchoi@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,32,0,0,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

There are two benefits associated with the use of a reciprocal grantback clause. First, it improves efficiency by reducing the (minimum) contract compatible royalty rate to zero. As a result, the production becomes efficient because both the licensor and the licensee produce at the same marginal cost. Second, a reciprocal grantback clause is a more effective provision than a one-way grantback clause to guarantee the transfer of superior technology, hence it promotes better technology diffusion.","[Kesavayuth, Dusanee] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, RIPED, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kesavayuth, Dusanee] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Sch Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",University Thai Chamber Commerce; University Thai Chamber Commerce,"Kesavayuth, D (通讯作者)，Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, RIPED, Bangkok, Thailand.;Kesavayuth, D (通讯作者)，Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Sch Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",dusanee_kes@utcc.ac.th,"Kesavayuth, Dusanee/AAR-7084-2020","Kesavayuth, Dusanee/0000-0002-7398-8908",University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce,University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce,"I would like to thank Cristiano Antonelli (the Editor), two anonymous referees, Kate Rockett, and Vasileios Zikos.

Although the appellate body has ruled that the use of zeroing would not be allowed in the weighted-average-to-weighted-average comparison methodology nor in the transaction-to-transaction comparison methodology, it has not ruled on whether the use of zeroing is allowed in the W-T comparison methodology prior to the instant case. Design/methodology/approach - This paper mainly analyzes the WTO appellate body report on the USA-anti-dumping and countervailing measures on large residential washers from Korea's rulings (DS464) and reviews other WTO appellate body reports on the use of zeroing in anti-dumping measures. This paper reviews the relevant provisions of the WTO anti-dumping agreement and the US Anti-Dumping Act, and also referred prior papers on the use of zeroing. Findings - The appellate body upheld the panel's finding that the USA's use of zeroing in the W-T comparison methodology is inconsistent with Article 2.4.2 of the anti-dumping agreement. As zeroing inflates dumping margins, increases the amount of duty collected, and hinders the expansion of trade in goods. The use of zeroing should be prohibited or permitted only in very limited circumstances. Originality/value - The text of Article 2.4.2 does not clearly prohibit the use of zeroing. The paper reviews the WTO appellate body's rulings on the use of zeroing in the W-T comparison methodology in the USA - anti-dumping measures on large residential washers from Korea (DS464). The appellate body report was very recently circulated, on September 9, 2016. The appellate body has not ruled on whether the use of zeroing is allowed in the W-T comparison methodology prior to the instant case. This paper, first, concludes that the W-T comparison methodology is inconsistent with Article 2.4.2 of the anti-dumping agreement.","[Kim, Sang Man] Duksung Womens Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jongho] Hoseo Univ, Cheonansi, South Korea",Duksung Women's University; Hoseo University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Hoseo Univ, Cheonansi, South Korea.",hihiccup@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

A structural equation modelling using partial least squares path modelling methodology was applied in order to determine the impact of perceived benefits on the satisfaction with the loyalty program.

On the other hand, convenience (as a part of utilitarian benefits) and recognition benefit (as a part of symbolic benefits) are not important in the case of the satisfaction with the loyalty program in Lithuanian grocery retailing.

The level of provision of each country is decided by a policy maker elected by majority rule at the country level. We compare the case in which policy makers set their policies noncooperatively with the case in which they set their policies through Coasian cooperation. Cooperation induces policy makers to internalize cross-border externalities, but it also induces strategic voters to elect a policy maker who cares less about the public good to reduce their public good contribution. The former effect increases public good provision while the latter reduces it. We show that once voters' incentives are taken into account, whether cooperation is beneficial depends neither on voters' preferences, nor on the magnitude of spillovers, nor on the size, bargaining power, or efficiency of each. country. Instead, it depends only on the curvature of the demand for the public good: cooperation increases (decreases) public good provision when the demand function is more (less) convex than the unit elastic demand function. Hence, the desirability of international cooperation depends mostly on the type of public good considered.","[Loeper, Antoine] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Loeper, A (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",aloeper@eco.uc3m.es,"Loeper, Antoine/Y-5670-2018","Loeper, Antoine/0000-0001-9210-5405","Ministerio Economia y Competitividad (Spain) [ECO 2013-42710-P, MDM 2014-0431]; Comunidad de Madrid, MadEco-CM [S2015/HUM-3444]","Ministerio Economia y Competitividad (Spain); Comunidad de Madrid, MadEco-CM(Comunidad de Madrid)","This paper previously circulated under the title Public Good Provision and Cooperation Among Representative Democracies.

We investigate how the timeliness and accuracy of information quality affect the value of information sharing. We use the inventory bullwhip effect (BWE) to measure the value of information sharing in a two-level supply chain consisting of one retailer and one manufacturer. The retailer faces a price-sensitive demand and the price is an AR (1) process. Our study shows if customer demand and retailer's immediate order are delayed, using retailer's historical order quantity to forecast can decrease manufacturer's BWE. If information errors happen, during delivery and utilization, information sharing is not always valuable for the manufacturer. Sometimes, no information sharing can decrease much more of BWE. If information errors occur when the retailer collects demand information, value of information sharing is more significant than when there are no information errors.","[Lu, Jizhou; Feng, Gengzhong; Wang, Nengmin] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Lu, Jizhou; Lai, Kin Keung] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Feng, Gengzhong; Wang, Nengmin] Minist Educ Proc Control & Efficiency Engn, Key Lab, Xian, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Int Business Sch, 199 South Changan Rd, Xian 710062, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; City University of Hong Kong; Shaanxi Normal University,"Lai, KK (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Lai, KK (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Normal Univ, Int Business Sch, 199 South Changan Rd, Xian 710062, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",mskklai@cityu.edu.hk,"Lu, Jizhou/ABC-6209-2021; Lai, Kin Keung/AEB-4278-2022","Lai, Kin Keung/0000-0003-0014-2095; Lu, Jizhou/0000-0003-2981-3630","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71390335, 71390333, 71572145]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Numbers 71390335, 71390333 and 71572145].",,40,7,9,3,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Production is characterized as a function of social and physical capital stocks that both vary across the regions. DS stands for total factor productivity, while SC stands for human capital and civic cooperativeness combined. SC accumulates via public spending on universal primary education, cultural, and civic events and such, and is exposed to regional spillover effects. Numerical simulations of the static solution of the government's welfare maximization problem reveal that the optimal rate of spending on SC (m(*)) is negatively related with the income share of physical capital, SC spillovers and fiscal decentralization. Simulations also show that SC homogeneity is positively associated with both the level and equitability of aggregate income. The maximum attainable levels of income, welfare and social cohesion and the most equitable incomes are all observed to realize at some intermediate range of m(*) values. In case DS augments SC, however, social cohesion improves and welfare declines monotonously in m(*).","[Neyapti, Bilin] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Neyapti, B (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",neyapti@bilkent.edu.tr,"Neyapti, Bilin/AAE-5557-2020",,,,,,45,2,2,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Long-term unemployment, of course, as well as overall unemployment, is mainly influenced by the economic cycle. In addition to fluctuations in the economy, there are many other factors. This article examines the impact of distraints imposed on non-employed persons. The article deals with data on the total unemployment rate, the long-term unemployment rate and the incidence of long-term unemployment for individual regions of the Czech Republic. It turns out that the rate of distraints in the population is a significant factor causing regional differences in long-term unemployment. The regions with a high share of distraints in the population show higher long-term unemployment. A distraint imposed on a jobseeker reduces his motivation to find work while discouraging some employers from hiring these people. The situations of people affected by distraints are very often worsened, and they fall into a debt trap that prevents them from finding employment. Without significant government interventions, this situation cannot be improved. However, it is obvious that long-term unemployment may have a retroactive effect on the level of distraints in the population.","[Pavelka, Tomas] Univ Econ Prague, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pavelka, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",pavelkat@vse.cz,,,Faculty of Business Administration [IP 300040],Faculty of Business Administration,This article is provided as one of the outputs of the research project of the Faculty of Business Administration IP 300040 Competitiveness.,,9,3,3,0,5,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1153,1162,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300115,0

The shock examined is the introduction of a new onshore wind sector in North East Scotland. A simple analytical model is developed to show how, a priori, the size of the new sector (the model shock) is uncertain and asymmetrically distributed as a result of spatial correlation in costs and returns across potential development locations. The importance of allowing for this uncertainty is tested by comparing the results from a CGE model where the sector size is assumed known with certainty to those from a model where the sector size is a random variable with an asymmetric distribution. The results show the extent to which allowing for uncertainty can influence the magnitude of estimated impacts with some variables more sensitive to the uncertainty than others.","[Phimister, Euan; Roberts, Deborah] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen Ctr Res Energy Econ & Finance, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Roberts, Deborah] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Dundee, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; James Hutton Institute,"Roberts, D (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen Ctr Res Energy Econ & Finance, Aberdeen, Scotland.;Roberts, D (通讯作者)，James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Dundee, Scotland.",deb.roberts@hutton.ac.uk,"Roberts, Deborah/G-8693-2013","Roberts, Deborah/0000-0003-0018-6039; Phimister, Euan/0000-0002-6483-0113","Scottish Government's Rural and Environmental Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS) under Theme 8 'Vibrant Rural Communities' of the Food, Land and People Programme","Scottish Government's Rural and Environmental Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS) under Theme 8 'Vibrant Rural Communities' of the Food, Land and People Programme","Deb Roberts acknowledges funding support from the Scottish Government's Rural and Environmental Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS) under Theme 8 'Vibrant Rural Communities' of the Food, Land and People Programme (2011-2016).",,40,13,13,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The social aspect is among the most significant ones. In other words, there is no complete revitalization without solving social problems. The presented study discusses problems related to the broadly approached revitalization projects and their main directions of development, based on the example of Polish revitalization programmes of territorial self-governmental units. The first part of the paper presents the definitional aspects of revitalization taking into account social, economic, environmental, spatial, functional, cultural and technical dimensions. Moreover, the definition, structure and purpose of a revitalization programme was characterized. Next the primary objectives and current developmental directions of revitalization in Poland were discussed based on the selected applicable revitalization programmes. Today the main directions of revitalization processes in Poland cover: the reduction of poverty and social exclusion, supporting local business, cleaner environment activities, sustainable spatial and functional development, supporting technical infrastructures, promoting culture-based socio-economic development.","[Raszkowski, Andrzej; Gluszczuk, Dariusz] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Management & Tourism, 3 Nowowiejska St, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Raszkowski, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Management & Tourism, 3 Nowowiejska St, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.",andrzej.raszkowski@ue.wroc.pl; dariusz.gluszczuk@ue.wroc.pl,"Głuszczuk, Dariusz DG/T-3080-2018",,,,,,12,5,5,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1305,1314,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300130,0

The responses of firms' productivity to trade liberalization are heterogenous: exporters, on average, improve their level of technology adoption, whereas nonexporters downgrade their level of technology adoption. The degree to which firms adjust production technology depends on domestic market size, export destination market size, trade impediments, and export status. The conflicting empirical results of the impact of trade liberalization on exporters' productivity are rationalized by showing that changes in different trade costs (variable vs. fixed costs) affect firms' productivity differently. We calibrate the model's parameters to match firms' characteristics in the global economy. The results indicate that endogenous productivity increases the gains from trade liberalization.","[Saad, Ayhab F.] Doha Inst Grad Studies, Dept Dev Econ, Doha, Qatar",Doha Institute for Graduate Studies,"Saad, AF (通讯作者)，Doha Inst Grad Studies, Dept Dev Econ, Doha, Qatar.",asaad@dohainstitute.edu.qa,,,,,,,43,3,3,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Modifications of outperformance certificates with barrier, i.e. barrier reverse outperformance and barrier reverse outperformance certificates with cap have a significant place in the segment of partial guaranteed investment tools due to a security buffer. These modifications of outperformance certificates with barrier are designed with the aim to make a disproportionately higher profit in bear market. Certificates 'profit functions provided in an analytical form are described in detail. It has been proved that the certificates 'profit functions are designed using two groups of instruments, i.e. an underlying asset and a financial derivative on its underlying instrument, especially American vanilla and barrier options. Financial engineering principles are explored to the investment certificates creation using the analytical expression of the American-style of vanilla and barrier call/put options. Pricing formulas are developed for these certificates with a specification of the conditions for the issuer in the primary market with the aim to achieve a profit. Then some investment certificates for these categories of innovative products connected with the United States Brent Oil ETF on 1(st) December 2014 are created, analysed and compared to each other. Also, the investor's best results at the future trade date are revealed. Our approach is based on real-traded American vanilla options data gained from Bloomberg. Due to lack of real-traded barrier options, the barrier option premiums are processed with Haug option pricing model in Bloomberg. The main aim is to prove the nature of barrier reverse outperformance certificates' creation and their cap modification with the increasing of the intellectualization of all potential investors.","[Soltes, Vincent; Harcarikova, Monika] Tech Univ Kosice, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Soltes, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",vincent.soltes@tuke.sk; monika.harcarikova@tuke.sk,"Šoltés, Vincent/AAA-2329-2020; Timková, Monika/AAH-4364-2019","Timková, Monika/0000-0002-5774-3230; Soltes, Vincent/0000-0002-2656-5582",,,,,48,2,2,0,6,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

According to Thirlwall's law, the BoP equilibrium growth rate in an economy is determined using the ratio of the income elasticities of demand for exports and imports and the growth in foreign demand. The results obtained are compared with the multisector version of Thirlwall's law as an alternative approach that considers the structure of the economy and how specialization affects BoP-constrained growth. The results show that almost all the transition countries in the sample grew at a higher rate than is consistent with the BoP equilibrium and that the multisector version of this approach predicts actual growth in these countries.","[Soukiazis, Elias] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Coimbra, Portugal; [Muchova, Eva; Lesko, Peter] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",Universidade de Coimbra; University of Economics Bratislava,"Lesko, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",peter.lesko@euba.sk,"Leško, Peter/AAF-3249-2021","Soukiazis, Elias/0000-0001-9265-0438; Muchova, Eva/0000-0001-9758-5313; Lesko, Peter/0000-0002-3240-6721",VEGA [1/0393/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"The article was prepared with the support of the project VEGA, no. 1/0393/16.",,16,6,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

In earlier work, I presented an explanation: voters correctly saw reforms as part of a long-term dynamic game, and they correctly saw how the reform affected outcomes (e.g., by affecting beliefs or coalition formation). Recent advances in behavioral economics derived from insights from sociology emphasize preference endogeneity, noting that beliefs are affected by those of others with whom one identifies and need not be consistent with rationality, as conventionally defined. Thus, individuals may have beliefs about the economic system that differ from those of economists. People may support policies which economists' analyses suggest are contrary to their interests because they believe these policies advance their interests. Based on previous analyses of the causes of these seeming perversities, I show how economists can modify policy proposals in ways that enhance likelihood of support, e.g., with contingent provisions which are operative in the states of the world that economists know (believe) are unlikely to occur, but which enhance the wellbeing of individuals with such beliefs in those states. Those selling products that are adverse to one's health have learned how to persuade customers to buy them. Likewise, politicians who are selling policies that are adverse to society's wellbeing have learned how to market their ideas. Economists will similarly have to learn how to persuade citizens of the desirability of the evidence- and theory-based policies that they advocate.","[Stiglitz, Joseph E.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Stiglitz, JE (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking,Institute for New Economic Thinking,"The author gratefully acknowledges the research support of the Institute for New Economic Thinking.

Neo-Kaleckians and neo-Goodwinians have applied different estimation strategies, with the former typically estimating behavioural equations, while the latter have often used reduced-form demand equations. Further differences include the lag structure, the output measure, the control variables and the sample. This paper, first, tries to clarify the terms of the debate. While neo-Kaleckians interpret the model as a mediumterm, partial-equilibrium goods market model, neo-Goodwinians are interested in the interaction of demand and distribution and regard the model as a long-run model with short-run cycles. Second, we elaborate a Kaleckian-Minskyan view of the economy as characterised by a wage-led demand regime and cycles driven by financial fragility. Many of the reported results may suffer from omitted variable bias as they do not include financial control variables. At least in the recent past, financial effects on demand have been much larger in size than distribution effects. A wage-led Minsky model with a reserve-army distribution function gives rise to pseudo-Goodwin cycles.","[Stockhammer, Engelbert] Univ Kingston, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England",Kingston University,"Stockhammer, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kingston, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England.",,"Stockhammer, Engelbert/M-1744-2019","Stockhammer, Engelbert/0000-0002-5329-3535",,,,,54,42,46,1,5,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

This paper shows that the supervisor can credibly express her trust in the agent's ability only by being unclear about what to do. Suggesting what to do, i.e., directives, could reveal the supervisor's distrust and reduce the agent's equilibrium effort level even though it provides useful information about the decision environment. There is also an equilibrium in which directives are neutral in expressive content. However, it is shown that neologism proofness favors equilibria in which directives are double-edged swords.","[Suzuki, Toru] Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Suzuki, T (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",toru.suzuki@uts.edu.au,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,1,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Applying an alternative approach to identifying the factors that shape a national innovation culture is challenging as there has been little empirical research in the area. Moreover, the global cross-cultural concepts of national innovation culture hold little relevance for post-socialist countries. The trans-disciplinary socio-political approach employed in this article relies on the qualitative analysis of the dominant concepts used in political economy and sociology to identify the socio-cultural and political aspects of Croatia's post-socialist transformation into a capitalist country. This is presented as one of the critical formative determinants of innovation culture. Croatia is chosen as a typical innovation-weak post-socialist country, where innovation remains weak. The analysis presented here suggests that transition-induced factors dominated by crony variance of capitalism' have an equal, if not a greater, suppressive impact on the current innovation culture than standard explanations based on the socio-cultural heritage of socialism and cultural inertia.","[Svarc, Jadranka] Ivo Pilar Inst Social Sci, Zagreb, Croatia",Ivo Pilar Institute of Social Sciences,"Svarc, J (通讯作者)，Ivo Pilar Inst Social Sci, Zagreb, Croatia.",jadranka.svarc@pilar.hr,"Svarc, Jadranka/J-9562-2017",,,,,,89,4,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2017,29.0,3,,,,,359,374,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1315001,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FB9SJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406479000006,0

The starting point of the analysis is an interesting yet not very well known episode of the economist's life: a period when Keynes, then a British Treasury official, was entrusted with the task of creating a currency for Northern Russia. The ensuing design and architecture of the North Russian rouble virtually became an opportunity for Keynes to put into practice some of his general currency-related ideas, and the entire project influenced Keynes's economic thought in two specific ways. First, the Russian experience can be traced in the economist's reflections on two fundamentally different financial policies: the inflationary approach adopted by the Bolsheviks, and the anti-inflationary strategy of the British government. Keynes made use of his experience with the Russian hyperinflation in a multitude of his works, especially in the papers on inflation and its consequences. Second, certain elements of the project influenced the actual formation of Keynes's view on the function and balancing of the international monetary markets. This part is based on monitoring the continuity of thoughts and actions, starting from India Currency and Finance and ending with the North Russian rouble and the design of the bancor.","[Svoboda, Frantisek] Masaryk Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Publ Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Svoboda, F (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Publ Econ, Brno, Czech Republic.",fsvoboda@mail.muni.cz,"Svoboda, František/GXE-9705-2022; Svoboda, Frantisek/O-3639-2014","Svoboda, Frantisek/0000-0003-0994-0990","Faculty of Arts, Masaryk University","Faculty of Arts, Masaryk University","This paper was supported by the Faculty of Arts, Masaryk University.",,25,0,1,0,2,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2017,64.0,4,,,,,477,492,,10.2298/PAN150405015S,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FJ5KL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412790300006,0

As a response, the European Central Bank (ECB) warns against 'talking down monetary policy' (ECB Vice-President Vitor Constancio, 2016). This note uses a textbook model of optimal monetary policy to study a situation in which the public misperceives the interest rate elasticity of aggregate demand, which reflects policy effectiveness. We show that as a result of underestimating policy effectiveness demand shocks can no longer be stabilized perfectly, thus resulting in inefficient inflation and output dynamics. In the presence of misperceptions, a negative demand shock leads to a prolonged period of negative inflation rates.","[Tillmann, Peter] Justus Liebig Univ, Dept Business Studies & Econ, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Tillmann, P (通讯作者)，Justus Liebig Univ, Giessen, Germany.",Peter.Tillmann@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

However, it is still unclear how employees perceive organizational CSR efforts and whether such perceptions bring employee reactions. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to filling this gap by looking into the relation between CSR and employees' organizational commitment and engagement and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB).

An increase in per capita remittances erodes international competitiveness by appreciating the real effective exchange rate, also leading to a fall in traded to non-traded goods production ratio in the economy; hardly any statistically significant impact of foreign aid on these variables is detected. These point to premature deindustrialization consequences of large remittance inflows that could slow down structural transformation towards manufacturing. Although remittances and foreign aid may have a significant impact on poverty alleviation in this region, policy planners should pay attention to more effective utilization of remittances and foreign aid.","[Uddin, Md.

The developed models show that the economic and financial situation in a given country affects the residential property markets. Residential property markets are connected, despite the fact that they are situated in different parts of Europe. The economic and financial crisis in the countries of the PIGS group affects not only the PIGS markets but also the real estate markets of the European-G8 and Poland.

However, little is known about how demographic structure affects economic growth since no study has examined an extensive collection of channels through which demographic structure could affect economic growth in a single context. This paper overcomes this limitation by examining 45 potential mediating variables between demographic structure and economic growth. A causal search algorithm is used to identify channels through which demographic structure affects economic growth. Our results suggest that demographic structure affects economic growth differently between developed and developing countries. For developed countries, we find that an increase in the share of middle-aged workers has a positive effect on economic growth through institutions, investment and education channels. On the other hand, an increase in the share of the senior population has a negative effect on economic growth through institutions and investment channels. For developing countries, we find (but with weak evidence) that an increase in the share of young workers has a negative effect on economic growth through investment, financial market development and trade channels.","[Wongboonsin, Kua; Phiromswad, Piyachart] Chulalongkorn Univ, Sasin Grad Inst Business Adm, Sasa Patasala Bldg,Phyathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,"Phiromswad, P (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Sasin Grad Inst Business Adm, Sasa Patasala Bldg,Phyathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",piyachart.phiromswad@sasin.edu,,,Thailand Research Fund [RTA5780011]; Chulalongkorn University,Thailand Research Fund(Thailand Research Fund (TRF)); Chulalongkorn University(Chulalongkorn University),This research is supported by the Thailand Research Fund RTA5780011 and Chulalongkorn University.

In the empirical sections, we first estimated the elasticities of the substitutions and then used these elasticities to evaluate the quality composition of the EU's seafood imports from the beneficiary countries.

The study also revealed that the participation rate of the unmarried labour force from Punjab and Sindh were high compared with the labour force living in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), which indicates the better social and economic awareness of the people of Punjab and Sindh as compare with Balochistan and KPK.","[Zaheer Khan, Muhammad] BUITEMS, Quetta, Pakistan; [Hafeez, Amtul] NUML, Islamabad, Pakistan","Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering & Management Sciences BUITEMS","Zaheer Khan, M (通讯作者)，BUITEMS, Quetta, Pakistan.",zaheer.onnet@gmail.com,"Khan, Muhammad Zaheer/JED-6124-2023","Khan, Muhammad Zaheer/0000-0002-6817-4096",,,,,14,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Performance differences will inevitably affect resource allocation in regional high-tech industry and in the upgrading of industrial structure. Thus, this article conducts a systematic study of convergence issues in China's high-tech industry development performance by adopting the spatial panel econometric method and related approaches. First, to measure the comprehensive performance of China's high-tech industry development, the study applies the Malmquist index and efficacy coefficient method from the perspective of R&D efficiency and economic efficiency; then, by adopting a spatial autoregressive (SAR) panel data model, it studies the absolute beta convergence and convergence mechanism of China's provincial high-tech industry development performance from 2001 to 2013. The results indicate the existence of distinct absolute beta convergence in China's high-tech industry development performance since the 21st century, which is mainly due to technology diffusion. The convergence rate of central China is notably faster than that of other regions.","[Ze-Lei, Xiao] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ze-Lei, Xiao; Du Xin-ya] Cent China Normal Univ, Hubei Inst Econ & Social Dev, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Fei, Fan] Wuhan Univ, Inst Dev Cent China, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Central China Normal University; Wuhan University,"Fei, F (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Inst Dev Cent China, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.",ieicddd@163.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [41271128, 71271159, 71303088, 41501141]; Humanities and Social Science of Ministry of Education Fund of China [14YJC790140]; National Social Science Foundation of China [16BGL200]; Jiangsu Province Social Science Fund of China [13JDB015]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science of Ministry of Education Fund of China; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Jiangsu Province Social Science Fund of China,"Natural Science Foundation of China [41271128,71271159, 71303088,41501141]; Humanities and Social Science of Ministry of Education Fund of China [14YJC790140]; National Social Science Foundation of China [16BGL200]; Jiangsu Province Social Science Fund of China [13JDB015].

We decompose the overall effect into contributions of changes in prices, quality and variety. Estimating trade elasticities for narrow product categories of EU imports, we infer quality from data on imported values and volumes. For the EU as a whole, we find that trade agreements increased quality by 7% on average but did not affect prices or variety. This translates into a cumulative reduction in the consumer price index of 0.24% over our sample period. We also find a high degree of impact heterogeneity across EU countries, trading partners, and the type of trade agreement, with high-income EU countries seeing much stronger quality increases and larger overall consumer benefits.","[Berlingieri, Giuseppe] ESSEC Business Sch, Cergy, France; [Berlingieri, Giuseppe; Breinlich, Holger; Dhingra, Swati] CEP, Strasbourg, France; [Breinlich, Holger] Univ Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Dhingra, Swati] London Sch Econ, London, England",ESSEC Business School; University of Surrey; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Berlingieri, G (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Cergy, France.;Berlingieri, G (通讯作者)，CEP, Strasbourg, France.",giuseppe.berlingieri@essec.edu; h.breinlich@surrey.ac.uk; s.dhingra@lse.ac.uk,,"Berlingieri, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0935-4860; Breinlich, Holger/0000-0002-1205-1863",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,13,14,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

This relationship is explained by two mechanisms: first, pollution modifies agents' work-leisure trade-off as it deteriorates their working conditions (incentive effect); and second, a polluted environment is likely to generate more frequent epidemic outbreaks and to affect agents' immune systems (health effect). Bosi et al. () explore the aggregate consequences of the incentive effect and show that it can generate endogenous fluctuations in the economic activity. The present paper focuses on the health effect as we study a Ramsey model augmented with the spread of infectious disease.

Cryptocurrencies have very high unconditional volatility, and are subject to sudden, massive, price swings. We start with a standard log-normal stochastic volatility model, then explore two formulations which incorporate discontinuous jumps to volatility and returns. Jumps to volatility are permanent, while jumps to mean returns have contemporaneous effects only. Results point to two high volatility periods: the first from late 2013 to early 2014, likely associated to the Mt. Gox incident; the second covers the year of 2017, peaking on December - likely driven by increased popular attention. Jumps to mean returns are specially relevant to capture large price variations, mostly negative, associated with formative events in cryptocurrency markets, such as hacks and unsuccessful fork attempts.

An alternative but rather unconventional method is the estimation of quality-adjusted unit value indexes. An advantage of the latter method is the interpretation of the implicit quantity index as the simple ratio of quality-adjusted or standardized quantities. In this paper we compare the two methods. We show that the expenditure-share weighted time dummy price index and the quality-adjusted unit value index can be written as ratios of weighted geometric and harmonic means, respectively, of quality-adjusted prices. Next, we argue that the two indexes will have similar trends and volatility if the quality-adjusted prices in the quality-adjusted unit value index are based on the estimated time dummy model.

These deliver worse material outcomes in general, but they reduce the feelings of betrayal during bad times. Some evidence consistent with our model is gathered from the Trump-Clinton 2016 election: on average, subjects primed with the importance of competence in policymaking decrease their support for Trump, the candidate who scores lower on competence in our survey (even amongst Trump supporters).

The issue of taxation has been the subject of numerous debates at the European level for several years. A good tax system should contribute to the state treasury with sufficient revenues, should not be an administrative burden, and must be sufficiently efficient and transparent. Purpose of the article: The article provides an extensive analysis of the opinions of respondents on the effectiveness of the financial administration of the Slovak Republic. The aim is to analyse the views and attitudes of the respondents on the key factors affecting the effectiveness of financial administration in terms of respondents' age, gender, occupation and place of residence using mathematical-statistical methods. Methods: In the empirical quantitative research Factor Model Analysis (Factor Analysis) and Analysis of Variance (Anova) were used. The data was obtained through a questionnaire survey, which-was carried out in four districts of Slovakia and focused on a wide range of respondents divided into four age-related categories. Findings & Value added: In terms of research carried out, it is possible to conclude that there is dissatisfaction with the overall tax and customs system in the Slovak Republic. An analysis of respondents' views on the effectiveness of the tax system has shown that it is possible to identify several key factors that affect it, and they are: collection of levies and availability, competence of tax administration staff, computerisation of tax administration, tax collection efficiency, labour costs, and administrative difficulty of tax administration. in the paper, we also discuss these in more detail. The research results offer relevant and interesting implications for public authorities, policy makers and reformers as well as motives for further investigation of the tax administration issue.","[Dobrovic, Jan] Univ Presov Presov, Presov, Slovakia; [Rajnoha, Rastislav] Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Koraus, Antonin] Acad Police Force Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Presov; Pan-European University,"Rajnoha, R (通讯作者)，Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Entrepreneurship, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia.",rastislav.rajnoha@paneurouni.com,"Korauš, Anton/ABE-8542-2020; Dobrovič, Ján/AAG-8258-2021; Rajnoha, Ing.

We present a model in which autocratic rulers are politically constrained both by the elite and by the street. These political constraints are inter-related such that when leaders extract rent from the economy on behalf of the elite they increase the probability of facing a revolt in the street. We suppose that rulers differ in the efficiency with which they extract rents and citizens make inferences about the ruler's type when idiosyncratic shocks occur. Equilibria are characterized in which elite-led coups serve to reset citizens' beliefs about the leader's type and pre-empt revolutions during periods of popular unrest. We then investigate the empirical implications using panel data on popular unrest and coups in sub-Saharan Africa. OLS and IV estimates support the causal mechanism highlighted in our theory. The magnitude of the effect is substantial - a one standard deviation increase in protest intensity increases the probability a coup occurs by a factor of almost three in our baseline IV specification.,"[Dorsch, Michael T.] Cent European Univ, Nador U 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Maarek, Paul] Univ Cergy Pontoise, 33 Blvd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France",Central European University; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Dorsch, MT (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Nador U 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",dorschm@ceu.edu; paul.maarek@u-cergy.fr,"maarek, paul/HGH-4161-2022","maarek, paul/0000-0001-6593-4179",,,,,68,11,11,0,1,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

Governments in less developed financial institutional infrastructure (for instance, emerging markets) tend to abuse their power by intervening in the domestic debt market. This study shows that better financial institutional infrastructure helps to discipline governments. The results suggest a negative effect of domestic public sector debt on financial development, but only at low level of financial freedom and integration.

This study uses an experimental design with 466 entrepreneurs in Cali, Colombia. Results show that entrepreneurs are more likely to accept riskier bets when those are related to the possession of their companies than in non framed lotteries. The data shows that the existence of the endowment effect increases the certainty equivalent of a lottery, for the median entrepreneur, by 36.5%. This could explain why many entrepreneurs prefer to continue operating their underperforming firms, as well as why many entrepreneurs overvalue their firms during investment processes. This paper presents an alternate view on the drivers behind entrepreneurs' risk-taking behavior and opens a door for future research on the role of biases on entrepreneurs' decision-making processes.","[Echeverry Penon, Isabela] Camara Comercio Cali, Cali, Colombia; [Reyes Ortega, Santiago] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA",Inter-American Development Bank,"Peñón, IE (通讯作者)，Camara Comercio Cali, Cali, Colombia.",iecheverry@ccc.org.co; sreyes@iadb.org,,,"Cali Chamber of Commerce, as part of its knowledge creation strategy","Cali Chamber of Commerce, as part of its knowledge creation strategy","The authors that contributed to this article did it in their personal capacity.

We test three potential pitfalls of the affirmative action policy: (i) whether the introduction of the policy distorts effort and selection in the contest, (ii) whether it leads to reverse discrimination, that is, discourages entry from the advantaged category and (iii) whether the possibility of ex-post retaliatory actions undermines the effectiveness of the policy. We find that the affirmative action contest increases entry of players from the disadvantaged category without affecting entry of advantaged players. This increases overall effort in the contest. However, we find that the possibility of retaliation can undermine the benefits of the affirmative action policy reducing contest participation. This suggests that retaliation is an important aspect to consider when implementing affirmative action policies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In these sectors the output (education or health respectively) depends on the actions of different agents and iris unclear what the effects of such incentive systems are on the behaviour of untargeted agents. In this study we focus on patient health, modelled as a joint product of patient effort (through lifestyle and behaviour) and doctor effort (through diagnosis and treatment). Patient response to doctor effort is shown to be a priori ambiguous and depends on the degree of complementarity or substitution between doctor and patient effort. We build an empirical model to estimate the effect of doctors' treatment effort on patient behaviour. To address the endogeneity of doctor effort we exploit a change in payments to doctors in the U.K. that led to incentive changes that varied by practice, depending on their prior performance levels. We use panel data on the physical activity, drinking and smoking behaviours of over 2000 cardiovascular disease patients aged over 50 in England and link these data to their primary care practice performance data. Our results indicate that primary care practices increased the proportion of patients with controlled disease from 76% to 83% in response to the payment change. Patients responded by reducing the frequency of drinking alcohol and their cigarette consumption, suggesting that patient efforts are complements to doctor effort. Understanding such complementarities has implications for assessing the design and effectiveness of pay-for-performance schemes which encourage higher doctor effort. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Data come from a large representative survey, conducted in post-socialist countries in 2015/16. To deal with endogeneity, we instrument party membership with information on whether family members were affected by the Second World War. Instrumental variable results suggest that links to the former Communist party increase the likelihood of paying bribes today; this result applies to the former party members as well as their children and relatives. Among bribe payers, people with the party links are more likely to offer bribes as well as think that bribe payments are expected.

However, imports of nonluxury watches and other luxury items unpopular for corrupt exchanges did not exhibit the same cycle. Nor did imports of luxury watches increase in Hong Kong, Singapore, or the US.

This paper also provides evidence relating the role of gender with family life. In particular, it focuses on how the husband's more traditional role as income provider continues to remain pronounced, although the impact of short term fluctuations in that income affects both partners equally. Impacts of this sort are not as significant for unmarried couples, and the analysis posits this as a reason why German couples, particularly younger ones, prefer cohabitation rather than entering into formal marriage agreements. Finally, drawing from the results of this study, the authors recommend some public policy suggestions to support unemployed couples. (C) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

This paper presents empirical evidence on the relationship between a possible cause of empirical studies finding undervaluation - consumer inattention - and the demand for fuel cost savings in automobiles. Using survey data on respondents' attention to automobile fuel costs, attribute preferences, and discrete choice experiments, I find heterogeneity in inattention toward and willingness to pay for fuel cost savings. Estimates from discrete choice models suggest that inattentive consumers make choices as if they undervalue fuel cost savings and attentive consumers make choices as if they fully value these savings. The data show that respondent-specific characteristics that influence fuel costs, such as vehicle miles traveled, partly explain the degree of inattention, a finding that is consistent with models of rational inattention. The results imply that designing energy efficiency policies requires careful consideration of consumer inattention.","[Leard, Benjamin] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Resources for the Future,"Leard, B (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",leard@rff.org,,,,,,,41,6,7,1,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

J,"Metcalf, G",,,,"Metcalf, Gabriel",,,Sand Castles Before the Tide? Affordable Housing in Expensive Cities,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GROWTH MACHINE,"This article focuses on cities with unprecedented economic success and a seemingly permanent crisis of affordable housing. In the expensive cities, policymakers expend great amounts of energy trying to bring down housing costs with subsidies for affordable housing and sometimes with rent control. But these efforts are undermined by planning decisions that make housing for most people vastly more expensive than it has to be by restricting the supply of new units even in the face of growing demand. I begin by describing current housing policy in the expensive metro areas of the United States. I then show how this combination of policies affecting housing, despite internal contradictions, makes sense from the perspective of the political coalitions that can form in a setting of fragmented local jurisdictions, local control over land use policies, and homeowner control over local government. Finally, I propose some more effective approaches to housing policy. My view is that the effects of the formal affordable housing policies of expensive cities are quite small in their impact when compared to the size of the problemlike sand castles before the tide. I will argue that we can do more, potentially much more, to create subsidized affordable housing in high-cost American cities. But more fundamentally, we will need to rethink the broader set of exclusionary land use policies that are the primary reason that housing in these cities has become so expensive. We cannot solve the problem unless we fix the housing market itself.","[Metcalf, Gabriel] SPUR, San Francisco Bay Area, CA 94105 USA",,"Metcalf, G (通讯作者)，SPUR, San Francisco Bay Area, CA 94105 USA.",,,,,,,,57,35,43,1,100,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We support the second hypothesis that the use of ICT enhances access, production and dissemination of knowledge in Sudanese universities. We support the fourth hypothesis that the use of ICT introduces 'creative-destruction' effect by providing opportunities for knowledge production, building connection and organizational changes; but simultaneously also creating hazards to knowledge production and building disconnection for those who do not share the knowledge in public and private Sudanese universities. We show that the most important advantageous related to the use of Internet for enhancing production, creation and transfer of knowledge include increasing digital knowledge for academic and researchers, rapid quantitative and qualitative increase in transferring information, development of new models for disseminating and distributing electronic information, and increase free access to electronic publications for academic purposes.

To this end, I develop a time-varying parameter panel Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) with a novel common stochastic volatility factor in the error structure, which is estimated in an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The common stochastic volatility factor reveals that macroeconomic volatility was more pronounced during the Asian financial crisis than during the more recent global financial crisis. Next, the panel BVAR's common, state- and variable-specific indicators capture several interesting economic facts. In particular, the fluctuations of the common indicator closely follow the trend line of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development composite leading indicators for Australia, making it a good proxy for nationwide business cycle fluctuations. Furthermore, despite significant co-movements of Australian state and territory business cycles during times of economic contractions, the state indicators suggest that the average degree of synchronisation across the Australian state and territory cycles in the 2000s is only half of that in the 1990s. Given that aggregate macroeconomic activity is determined by cumulative activity of each of the states, the results suggests that the federal government should consider granting state governments greater autonomy in handling state-specific cyclical fluctuations.","[Poon, Aubrey] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Poon, A (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Strathclyde Business Sch, Duncan Wing,199 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0QU, Lanark, Scotland.",aubrey.poon@strath.ac.uk,,"Poon, Aubrey/0000-0003-2587-8779",Economic Society of Australia,Economic Society of Australia,"The author would like to acknowledge financial support by the Economic Society of Australia via the 2015 Peter Kenyon Memorial Postgraduate Scholarship.

With the exception of a few recent studies however, these studies focus on sample periods that end prior to the Great Recession. The few exceptions that extend the analysis period beyond the Great Recession suggest that the pro-cyclical relationship between macroeconomic conditions and mortality obtained in earlier studies might have weakened over time. In this paper, we revisited the relationship between state unemployment rate and a large set of outcomes of health and health behaviors using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) between 1990 and 2014. Overall, our results suggest that state unemployment rate is weakly related to both health and health behaviors as our estimates are too small to have any meaningful implications, although they are largely imprecisely estimated. Finally, we tested whether the Great Recession played a significant role in influencing the pattern in the relationship between unemployment rate and health and health behaviors. Our results from this analysis do not reveal any measurable recession effect, although the estimates are again largely imprecise.","[Tekin, Erdal; McClellan, Chandler] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, IZA, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Tekin, Erdal; McClellan, Chandler] NBER, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Minyard, Karen Jean] Georgia State Univ, Dept Publ Management & Policy, POB 3992, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Minyard, Karen Jean] Georgia State Univ, Georgia Hlth Policy Ctr, Andrew Young Policy Studies, POB 3992, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",American University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Tekin, E (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, IZA, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.;Tekin, E (通讯作者)，NBER, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",tekin@america.edu,,,Gary and Stacey Jacobs Fellowship,Gary and Stacey Jacobs Fellowship,Erdal Tekin gratefully acknowledges support from the Gary and Stacey Jacobs Fellowship.,,5,9,11,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Industrial ecosystems are here defined as multi-tiered production systems involving heterogeneous agents operating in sectoral value chains and contributing to the capability domains of the ecosystem (and its participants) with closely complementary but dissimilar sets of resources and capabilities. The geographical boundaries of the industrial ecosystem are shaped by the evolving interdependencies linking organisations within the ecosystem and by the new linkages consolidating beyond that. Thus, the industrial ecosystem is a structured production space centred mainly on its productive organisations, as well as other institutions, intermediaries and demand-side actors, purposefully involved in co-value creation processes along various types of diversification and innovative industrial renewal trajectories. Drawing on a five-year research programme in the Emilia Romagna industrial ecosystem, a number of case studies are introduced to highlight these trajectories and the underpinning structural learning dynamics. The paper concludes by identifying a number of policy implications, focusing on strategies for enhancing the structural readiness of the industrial ecosystem and promoting smart diversification and innovative industrial renewal policies.","[Andreoni, Antonio] Univ London, SOAS, Dept Econ, Econ, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Andreoni, A (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",antonio.andreoni@soas.ac.uk,,"Andreoni, Antonio/0000-0001-9389-0927",Gatsby Charitable Foundation,Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"Senior Lecturer in Economics, Department of Economics, SOAS University of London.

Even if, on the one hand, theaters aim to increase revenue from box office as a consequence of the systematic reduction in public funds; on the other hand, they pursue the objective to increase its attendance. A common practice by theaters is to provide incentives to customers to discriminate among themselves according to their reservation price, offering a schedule of different prices corresponding to different seats in the venue. In this context, price and allocation of the theater seating area is decision variables that allow theater managers to manage their two conflicting goals to be pursued. In this paper, we introduce a multi-objective optimization model that jointly considers pricing and seat allocation. The framework proposed integrates a choice model estimated by multinomial logit model and the demand forecast, taking into account the impact of heterogeneity among customer categories in both choice and demand. The proposed model is validated with booking data referring to the Royal Danish theater during the period 2010-2015.","[Baldin, Andrea; Bille, Trine] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18B,3 Floor, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Ellero, Andrea; Favaretto, Daniela] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Copenhagen Business School; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Baldin, A (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18B,3 Floor, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",ab.mpp@cbs.dk; tbi.mpp@cbs.dk; ellero@unive.it; favaret@unive.it,"Baldin, Andrea/G-9320-2019; Ellero, Andrea/C-8900-2013","Baldin, Andrea/0000-0002-4386-2423; Bille, Trine/0000-0002-0139-166X",,,,,33,10,12,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We extend and generalize a standard target zone model by introducing perceived uncertainty about the lower edge of the band. We find that informal soft edge target zone bands lead to weaker honeymoon effects, wider target zone ranges, and higher exchange rate volatility than formal target zone bands. These results suggest that it would be beneficial for exchange rate policy intentions to be stated clearly in order to anchor exchange rate expectations and reduce exchange rate volatility. We also study how exchange rate dynamics can be characterized in models in which financial markets are aware of occasional changes in the policy regime. We show that expected changes in the central bank's exchange rate policy may lead to exchange rate oscillations, providing an additional source of exchange rate volatility, and to capture this it is important to take into account the possibility of regime changes in exchange rate policy.","[Chen, Yu-Fu] Univ Dundee, Business & Management Studies, Dundee, Scotland; [Funke, Michael] Hamburg Univ, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany; [Funke, Michael] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany; [Moessner, Richhild] Bank Int Settlements, Centralbahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Dundee; University of Hamburg; Ifo Institut; Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Moessner, R (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Centralbahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",richhild.moessner@bis.org,,"Chen, Yu-Fu/0000-0001-9246-9938",,,,,50,4,4,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We find that the growth in U.S. exports led to increased demand for 2 million jobs in manufacturing, 0.5 million in resource industries, and a remarkable 4.1 million jobs in services, totaling 6.6 million. Two-thirds of those service sectors jobs are due to the export of services themselves, whereas one-third is due to the intermediate demand from manufacturing and resource-or merchandise-exports, so the total labor demand gain due to merchandise exports was 3.7 million jobs. In comparison, U.S. merchandise imports from China led to reduced demand of 1.4 million jobs in manufacturing and 0.6 million in services (with small losses in resource industries), with total job losses of 2.0 million. It follows that the expansion in U.S. merchandise exports relative to imports from China over 1995-2011 created net demand for about 1.7 million jobs. Comparing the growth of U.S. merchandise exports to merchandise imports from all countries, we find a fall in net labor demand due to trade, but comparing the growth of total U.S. exports to total imports from all countries, then there is a rise in net labor demand because of the growth in service exports.","[Feenstra, Robert C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Feenstra, Robert C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sasahara, Akira] Univ Idaho, Coll Business & Econ, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Feenstra, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rcfeenstra@ucdavis.edu,"Sasahara, Akira/AAO-3712-2021","Sasahara, Akira/0000-0002-4384-0806",,,,,29,66,74,3,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We discuss and introduce alternative adaptations of Gale's original procedure that can offer improvements over TTC in terms of equity, along with various other distributional considerations. Instead of giving all the trading power to those students with the highest priority for a school, we argue for the distribution of the trading rights of all slots of each school: This allows them to trade in a thick market where additional constraints can be accommodated by choosing an appropriate pointing rule. We propose a particular mechanism of this kind, the equitable top trading cycle (ETTC) mechanism, which is also Pareto efficient and group strategy-proof just like TTC and eliminates avoidable justified envy situations.

To identify causal effects, I exploit the timing of a national reform that eliminated primary school fees in 1997 to implement a regression discontinuity design. At the cutoff, the reform increased educational attainment by nearly one year on average, with impacts across all grade levels through the end of secondary school. Women with more schooling both delay and reduce overall fertility, increase early child health investments, and have less chronically malnourished children. In terms of mechanisms, women with additional schooling do not abstain more from sex as adolescents, but they are more likely to have used contraceptives before a first pregnancy and they delay marriage. Other downstream effects include improved employment outcomes and greater wealth.","[Keats, Anthony] Wesleyan Univ, Econ Dept, PAC 123,238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",Wesleyan University,"Keats, A (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Econ Dept, PAC 123,238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",akeats@wesleyan.edu,,,,,,,40,81,96,1,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Because of international selection and fiscal externalities, noncooperative policies entail under-subsidization of wages. Targeted (domestic-only or export) wage subsidies are dominated from a welfare point of view by a uniform subsidy.

This study investigates the determinants of foreign currency borrowing of households in Cambodia using survey data. We find that Cambodian households engage in risk-hedging behavior against exchange rate risks in the sense that their likelihood of borrowing in foreign currency increases as the share of foreign currency in their incomes increases. We also found that expectations of depreciation in the local currency inclined households more toward borrowing in local currency, as would be predicted. Finally, better educated households are more likely to make loan currency choices consistent with risk hedging while less educated households are more inclined to be influenced by the currency used in purchases. Similarly, household use of financial services, which like education may serve to proxy financial literacy, is correlated with risk-hedging behavior against currency mismatch risks. These results suggest that financial literacy has the potential to enhance risk-hedging behavior against exchange rate risks for Cambodian households. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, it decomposes the poverty differential between household types into a component due to endowments and another due to the return to these endowments. I use data from five Household Income, Expenditure and Consumption Surveys, that span a period of far reaching economic, social and political changes, from 1999 to 2013. Results suggest that female-headed households were poorer than male-headed households for all years under study in urban areas; and slightly less poor over part of the period in rural areas. This difference is greater for widowed mothers. Most of the poverty differentials between female-headed and male-headed households cannot be explained by differences in endowments in all years. In fact, if female-headed households had the same endowments as male-headed households in urban areas they would have been poorer than they already were.","[Alazzawi, Shireen] Santa Clara Univ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Santa Clara University,"Alazzawi, S (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Econ Dept, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",salazzawi@scu.edu,,,Economic Research Forum,Economic Research Forum,"I am grateful to Andrew Sharpe, Ragui Assaad, Hasan Vergil, Mahmut Tekce, Hassan Aly and participants at the IARIW-CAPMAS Conference: Experiences and Challenges in Measuring Income, Wealth, Poverty and Inequality in the Middle East and North Africa, Cairo, Egypt, November 23-25, 2015 and the Middle East Economics Association Annual Meeting in Boston, USA, January 3-6, 2015, and two anonymous referees and the editor, Stephan Klasen, for helpful comments and suggestions.

Our analysis focuses on international environmental agreements (IEAs) entered into by countries that decide rationally and autonomously on whether to adopt a climate-friendly policy. This raises the question, how many and which countries will sign such an lEA? In addition to material incentives to combat climate change, issues pertaining to justice and fairness motivate reciprocal behavior, even during international negotiations. Integrating reciprocity preferences may stimulate cooperation and thus increase participation in an LEA. However, there is some evidence that fairness also stabilizes small-sized lEA coalitions. Hence, this gives rise to the following open question: under which conditions does reciprocity have an enhanced and harmful impact on an lEA? Furthermore, we introduce heterogeneity with respect to a country's emphasis on reciprocity, the costs it incurs when implementing a climate-friendly policy, its benefits from preventing negative consequences of climate change, and country size. In addition, the present paper examines which countries might or might not sign an lEA, and identifies the characteristics that determine a country's participation or non-participation in a coalition.

This paper investigates the possible spillovers from a shock to Chinese Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) to developed (the United States, the Euro Area, Japan and South Korea) and emerging economies (Brazil and Russia). To take into account the non-linear nature of uncertainty shocks, we estimate a Smooth-Transition Vector Auto-Regressive (STVAR) model differentiating phases of expansion and phases of recession. We find important asymmetries in the responses to Chinese uncertainty shocks of macro-variables especially for the United States (US), the Euro Area (EA) and South Korea. Indeed, these countries display almost no response to the identified shock during booms. However, when hit in downturns, they suffer from a fall in industrial production, inflation and exports together with an increase in unemployment (except for Korea). Emerging countries (Brazil and Russia) stand out in the extent to which they significantly respond to the Chinese shock in both identified regimes. Lastly, the Japanese economy seems to be less sensitive to the Chinese shock.","[Fontaine, Idriss] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Cergy, France; [Razafindravaosolonirina, Justinien] Univ Corse, CEMOI, Corte, France; [Didier, Laurent] Univ La Reunion, CEMOI TEPP CHRS FR3435, St Denis, Reunion, France",CY Cergy Paris Universite; University of La Reunion,"Fontaine, I (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Cergy, France.",idriss.fontaine@u-cergy.fr; razafindravaosolonirina_r@univ-corse.fr; laurent.didier@univ-reunion.fr,,,,,,,36,43,45,2,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Utilising the China Family Panel Studies survey for 2010 and 2012, we measure the inequality in individual educational outcomes (measured in years of schooling) in aggregate and for each of ten birth cohorts. We run regressions to identify the key determinants of these outcomes, all of which can be classified as 'circumstances' that lie beyond the control of each individual, and which reveal important variations in the magnitude and significance of key determinants across birth cohorts. The results are then used to calculate the share of 'inequality of opportunity' in overall educational inequality. The lack of equal opportunity for Chinese people with regard to their educational outcomes is shown to stem primarily from the divisive hukou system, with further significant contributions from father's education, birth cohort, province, parents' Communist Party membership, gender, family size and ethnicity, in that order.

I demonstrate that increasing the risk surrounding the variance of future consumption does not change its unconditional variance, but it generates a fourth-degree risk deterioration in future consumption, yielding in particular an increase in its excess kurtosis. If shocks to the volatility of consumption growth are persistent, the term structure of annualized excess kurtosis is increasing. In a Lucas economy with a EU representative agent, this increases the aggregate risk premium if and only if the fourth derivative of the utility function u is negative, and it makes its term structure increasing. Persistent stochastic volatility also reduces the interest rate if and only if the fifth derivative of u is positive, and it makes its term structure decreasing. These conditions are satisfied under constant relative risk aversion, and these results are robust to Epstein-Zin preferences. We show that persistent stochastic volatility is supported by the evidence that the excess kurtosis of consumption growth is positive and has an increasing term structure, using quarterly growth data in the U.S. between 1947 and 2016.

We propose to apply this estimation method to investigate the role of firms in individual wage variation. Using a longitudinal match employer-employee dataset from Spain, we show that the analysis of wage determination can be misleading when wages are censored. In particular, the role of firm wage policies in wage dispersion is overestimated by more than ten percentage points, while the role of time-invariant individual characteristics is underestimated by fifteen percentage points. Hence, controlling for censored wages appears to reinforce the idea that when explaining individual wage dispersion, what workers are' is more important than what workers do'.","[Gonzalez de San Roman, Ainara] IE Univ, Castellon Plana 8,28, Madrid, Spain; [Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F.] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Crta Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain",IE University; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Rebollo-Sanz, YF (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Crta Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",yfrebsan@upo.es,"Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F./K-6940-2012","Rebollo-Sanz, Yolanda F./0000-0003-1876-7093",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2013-43526-R]; [P09-SEJ-4546],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government);,We also acknowledge the comments from the seminar participants at Pablo Olavide University and ESPE Congress.

Although existing models partially predict such variations, so far, they have been unable to predict oil prices accurately in this highly volatile market. The development of an effective, predictive model has therefore become a prime objective of research in this field. Our approach, albeit based in part on previous research, develops an original methodology, in that we have created a risk forecasting model with the ability to predict oil price fluctuations caused by changes in both fundamental and transient risk factors. We achieve this by disintegrating the multi-scale risk-structure of the crude oil market using Variational Mode Decomposition. Normal and transient risk factors are then extracted from the crude oil price using Variational Mode Decomposition and modelled separately using the Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) model. Both risk factors are integrated and ensembled to produce the risk estimates. We then apply our proposed risk forecasting model to predicting future downside risk level in three major crude oil markets, namely the West Taxes Intermediate (WTI), the Brent Market, and the OPEC market. The results demonstrate that our model has the ability to capture downside risk estimates with significantly improved precision, thus reducing estimation errors and increasing forecasting reliability.

The objective of this article is to study the business cycle implications of such a decline. We first develop a tractable monetary model in which households face idiosyncratic unemployment risk that they can partially self-insure using savings. A low level of liquid household wealth opens the door to self-fulfilling fluctuations: if wealth-poor households expect high unemployment, they have a strong precautionary incentive to cut spending, which can make the expectation of high unemployment a reality. Monetary policy, because of the zero lower bound, cannot rule out such expectations-driven recessions. In contrast, when wealth is sufficiently high, an aggressive monetary policy can keep the economy at full employment. Finally, we document that during the U.S. Great Recession wealth-poor households increased saving more sharply than richer households, pointing towards the importance of the precautionary channel over this period.","[Heathcote, Jonathan; Perri, Fabrizio] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA; [Heathcote, Jonathan; Perri, Fabrizio] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Heathcote, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA.;Heathcote, J (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",,,,European Research Council [313671]; European Research Council (ERC) [313671] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank our editor, Gita Gopinath, and four anonymous referees for excellent suggestions.

We show that in the presence of excess burden of taxation with foreign competitors, output subsidy coupled with import tariff and partial privatization is adopted to improve the social welfare. However, if the excess burden of taxation is relatively large, the government may switch to use production tax coupled with tariff policy and partial privatization to improve the social welfare.","[Lee, Jen-Yao] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Int Business, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan; [Wang, Leonard F.

Specifically, when the labor demand elasticity is large, lobbying is successful in inducing the policymaker to set the minimum wage in accordance with her political ideology. However, the paper also shows the conditions under which lobbying will reverse the ideological preference and induce a business-friendly government to increase the minimum wage. Empirical analysis on a panel data for ten Canadian provinces gives considerable support for theoretical predictions. The real minimum wage decreases in skill-adjusted union density and political ideology, while larger labor demand elasticity reinforces the influence of political ideology in the presence of lobbying.","[Lesica, Josip] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",McMaster University,"Lesica, J (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",lesicaj@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,74,2,3,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

When projects are large and take time to build, however, that prediction can be reversed. We investigate the investment/uncertainty relationship empirically using historical data on opening dates of new U.S. copper mines - large, irreversible projects with substantial construction lags. Both the timing of the decision to go forward and the price thresholds that trigger that decision are assessed. In particular, we build upon a reduced form analysis to construct a structural model of entry.

The size distortions in these case are more pronounced in comparison to the bootstrap M and ADF tests. We found that the bootstrap version of likelihood ratio test (with autoregressive recolouring) demonstrates better performance than bootstrap M tests.

Together with other social structures they influence the trajectories of societal change. Such factors are however tightly connected and should not be analysed in isolation but considered as interdependent with each other. This study contributes to the understanding of interconnections among institutions and other structural factors by focusing on two features: the manifold nature of linkages and the possibility of relations being asymmetric. An analogy to symbiotic relationships, common in ecology, serves as inspiration for an innovative methodological strategy to empirically study multiple interconnections. Focusing on the Brazilian municipality level, the study includes 54 structural factors in a correlation network. Empirical results include the identification of centroids, meaning most connected factors, which tend to gain or lose importance at higher levels of municipal development; and the identification of positive asymmetric relationships between structural factors, which may inform on system dynamics.","[Von Jacobi, Nadia] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; [Von Jacobi, Nadia] Univ Pavia, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Pavia, Italy",University of Oxford; University of Pavia,"Von Jacobi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England.;Von Jacobi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Pavia, Italy.",nadia.vonjacobi@sbs.ox.ac.uk,"von Jacobi, Nadia/JRY-5666-2023","von Jacobi, Nadia/0000-0003-0306-9524",Fondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli (Laboratorio Expo); EU-FP7 CrESSI grant [613261],Fondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli (Laboratorio Expo); EU-FP7 CrESSI grant,"The author would like to thank three anonymous reviewers, and Geoffrey Hodgson, Samuel Bowles, Ugo Pagano, Thorvald Gran, Renata Targetti, Francesco Scervini and Enrica Chiappero-Martinetti for comments on previous versions.

Based on previous studies, we link the theory with professional skill and career advancement of women. We argue that a gender imbalance has prevailed for centuries affecting women's careers; and, the transformation of accounting technologies, corporate structures, and the amalgamation of cultures have exacerbated gender inequality. Women's lack of self-motivation and men's dominance in accounting contexts keep women subordinate to men in accounting workplaces.

We detect a gradual shift of the focus of policy from short cycles to intermediate cycles at the beginning of the Great Moderation, followed by a strengthening of policy's reaction to long fluctuations once credibility was attained, and, during the Great Recession, a renewed interest in shorter output cycles. We document that the violation of the Taylor principle until the early 1980s and the strengthening of the reaction of policy to inflation thereafter were more marked at intermediate than at long cycles.

Results suggest that good governance significantly reduces the probability of being subjectively poor, both over the whole population and also among households that are poor in terms of monetary income.

Nevertheless, there has been insufficient progress in measuring PI. We calculate a novel measure of PI with the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Advancing beyond prior approaches, we define PI as the logged average of 20+ years of post-tax and post-transfer (post-fisc) real equivalized household income. We then assess how well various household- and individual-based measures of economic resources proxy PI. In both datasets, post-fisc household income is the best proxy. One random year of post-fisc household income explains about half of the variation in PI, and 2-5 years explain the vast majority of the variation. One year of post-fisc HH income even predicts PI better than 20+ years of individual labor market earnings or long-term net worth. By contrast, earnings, wealth, occupation, and class are weaker and less cross-nationally reliable proxies for PI. We also present strategies for proxying PI when HH post-fisc income data are unavailable, and show how post-fisc HH income proxies PI over the life cycle. In sum, we develop a novel approach to PI, systematically assess proxies for PI, and inform the measurement of economic resources more generally.","[Brady, David] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Publ Policy, INTS 4133,900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Brady, David] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Giesselmann, Marco] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Giesselmann, Marco] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany; [Kohler, Ulrich] Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; [Radenacker, Anke] Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany",University of California System; University of California Riverside; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technische Universitat Chemnitz; University of Potsdam; Hertie School,"Brady, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Publ Policy, INTS 4133,900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.;Brady, D (通讯作者)，WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany.",dbrady@ucr.edu,,"Brady, David/0000-0002-4059-3272; Giesselmann, Marco/0000-0001-6769-3612","National Institutes of Health [R01 HD069609]; National Science Foundation [1157698]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We appreciate suggestions from JOEI editor Markus Jantti and reviewers, Kenneth Couch, Rob Freeland, David Grusky, Brad Heim, Jan Paul Heisig, Peter Krause, Bruce Meyer, Jurgen Schupp, and John Robert Warren.

We designed an experiment characterized by strategic uncertainty and multiple equilibria where coordinating on the efficient outcome is a challenge. Participants, interacting anonymously in a group, could pay a cost either to obtain information about their counterparts, or to create a freely available public record of individual conduct. Both monitoring institutions were actively employed. However, groups were unable to attain higher levels of cooperation compared to a treatment without monitoring. Information about past conduct alone thus appears to be ineffective in overcoming coordination challenges.","[Camera, Gabriele] Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Camera, Gabriele] Univ Basel, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Casari, Marco] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Basel; University of Bologna,"Camera, G (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, Orange, CA 92866 USA.;Camera, G (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",camera@chapman.edu; marco.casari@unibo.it,,"CASARI, MARCO/0000-0003-2515-9352; Camera, Gabriele/0000-0001-5548-2033",NSF [DMS-0437210],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank two anonymous referees for helpful comments, M.

In the theoretical analysis, we allow for nonconstant returns to scale in technological activities. Differently from previous literature, our results show that, under broad and plausible model parameterizations, the marginal growth effect of skilled workers is increasing with the distance to the frontier for sufficiently poor countries while it is decreasing (in agreement with the existing literature) only for countries close to the technological frontier. Our empirical analysis provides robust evidence for this theoretical prediction by using a 10-year panel of 85 countries for the years in between 1960 and 2000, as well as by using the System Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) technique to address the problem of endogeneity. Results are robust to different proxies of human capital and different specifications.","[Cerina, Fabio] Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; [Cerina, Fabio; Manca, Fabio] CRENoS, Cagliari, CA, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Cerina, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Viale St Ignazio 78, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",fcerina@unica.it; fabio.manca@ec.europa.eu,,"Cerina, Fabio/0000-0003-4671-3404",Regional Government of Sardinia,Regional Government of Sardinia,"We would like to thank Philippe Aghion, Luca Deidda, Alessio Moro, Fabiano Schivardi for their suggestions and all the participants at the seminar at the University of Cagliari, University of Sassari, and University of Barcelona as well those at the conferences in Huelva (XIV Encuentro de Economia Aplicada), Saint Petersburg (DEGIT XVI), NewDelhi (8th Annual Conference on Economic Growth andDevelopment), Rimini (4thWorkshop on Developments in Macro and Growth), Bologna (54th Meeting of the Italian Economists Association), and Manchester (125th Royal Economic Society Conference).

In both cases, absence may affect the employee's career. Evidence from German panel data reveals a significantly negative (positive) link between short-term sickness related absence and the probability of a subsequent promotion (dismissal). Instrumental variable analyses suggest no causality in this context. We find no evidence of systematic gender differences in the link between absence and subsequent instances of mobility. Throughout our analysis, we give special attention to the role of health. According to our evidence, health appears to play no significant role for individual career advancement.
