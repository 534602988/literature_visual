Aim: To develop a generic, quantitative credit rating methodology for the Department of Health and the Department of Education combined, as well as specific quantitative credit rating methodologies, for each department, individually. Setting: A comparison between generic and specific subnational credit rating methodologies to assess which fits the South African subnational environment best. Studies and results obtained from other nations were used to construct the approach. Methods: In a typical credit rating methodology, both quantitative and qualitative information is considered. In South Africa (as a developing economy), the quantitative information equates to a smaller portion of the final credit rating. A generic quantitative credit rating methodology, as well as specific credit rating methodologies, was developed. The appropriateness of these generic and specific models was tested with regards to prediction accuracies using Red, Amber or Green (RAG) statuses on a traffic light series. An illustration of the predicted versus actual ranks is provided, as well as an example to illustrate how model-predicted RAG statuses, based on quantitative information, may be overlaid with more recent qualitative information to derive a final ranking. Results: A generic, quantitative credit rating methodology for the Departments of Health and the Department of Education combined was developed, as well as specific credit rating methodologies for each department separately. The specific subnational credit rating methodology outperformed the generic methodology considerably; more precisely, the generic models predicted a maximum of 50% of the new cases correctly as opposed to the specific Health and Education models' 78%. Conclusion: The primary contribution of this study was to develop and compare generic and specific subnational credit rating methodologies. A further contribution was to test the appropriateness of these models' prediction accuracies using RAG statutes. The specific subnational credit rating methodology was found to outperform the generic methodology considerably.","[Fourie, Erika; Verster, Tanja; van Vuuren, Gary W.] North West Univ, Ctr Business Math & Informat, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"van Vuuren, GW (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Ctr Business Math & Informat, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",wgary@hotmail.com,"Verster, Tanja/E-8373-2011; van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","Verster, Tanja/0000-0002-4711-6145; van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538; Fourie, Erika/0000-0003-3321-0576",Department of Science and Technology (DST) of South Africa; DST,Department of Science and Technology (DST) of South Africa; DST(Department of Science & Technology (India)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the valuable input given by anonymous referees.

These effects are generated by market imperfections, in the view of neo-classical equilibrium theory. In real economies such imperfections are not exemptions but frequent phenomena, e.g. stemming from increasing returns to scale or scope, or structural changes of products and industrial processes. Although the existence of WEI is not in question, they are usually not considered in practical assessments of transport infrastructure investments because they can only be estimated with high uncertainty and in industrialised countries in particular - they are assumed to be of negligible magnitude. This paper presents approaches to WEI measurement based on GDP and on welfare, analyses the feasibility for combining WEI with conventional CBA, and discusses issues related to decision-making in situations where consideration of WEI appears to be relevant.","[Rothengatter, Werner] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Econ, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Rothengatter, W (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Econ, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany.",rothengatter@kit.edu,,,,,,,34,27,28,1,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We design a comprehensive taxonomy of GVC participation modes and explore their impact on firms' innovativeness and performance. Our findings highlight relevant heterogeneities in how GVC participants fared the crisis. While high-skill relational suppliers display a significant propensity to engage in innovative activities and R&D projects, other modes of GVC participation have no premium compared to domestic companies. This heterogeneity is also reflected in differential productivity and sales growth. Compared to the precrisis trends, we document a severe demand shock for low-skill and subordinated firms, while relational GVCs appear to be somewhat sheltered from the effects of the crisis.","[Brancati, Emanuele] LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Econ & Finance, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Brancati, Emanuele; Brancati, Raffaele; Maresca, Andrea] MET, Via Sabotino 2A, I-00195 Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Brancati, E (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Econ & Finance, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",ebrancati@luiss.it,"Maresca, Andrea/AAC-5356-2022","Brancati, Emanuele/0000-0002-4221-7991",,,,,81,52,54,8,117,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This defense in participations strategy provides disincentive for raiders as partial ownerships increase market power of competitors and then reinforce the 'outsider effect'. Also, we find conditions for a general result, which state that takeovers are less profitable in an industry with participations rather than in an industry without any capital links. We provide information to regulators about the positive social impact of cross participations in the context of mergers and expose an economic dilemma between a 'laissez-faire' and an interventionist approach.

The mechanism that explains this difference (discrimination, difference in skills, etc.) is not clear. Nevertheless, this result stresses the importance of applying enhanced meritocratic safeguards to oral examinations, especially when a career as a judge is at stake.","[Georgiou, Georgios] Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Econ Dept, AS2 06-02,1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Georgiou, G (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Econ Dept, AS2 06-02,1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",ecsgg@nus.edu.sg,"GEORGIOU, GEORGIOS/AAU-8822-2020","GEORGIOU, GEORGIOS/0000-0002-8133-8606",,,,,42,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Considerable research has focused generally on innovativeness in forest sector firms, but little attention has been given to the actions of firms to the chaotic market environment during the GFC. Our objective is to clarify how a customer orientation and the practice of developing new markets during a market downturn results in enhanced knowledge-based resources, manifested as increased innovativeness. Our longitudinal design includes data representing 2012 and 2015 from 89, US-based forest sector firms. Responding firms are more focused on process than product innovativeness. During the GFC, responding firms concentrated more on foreign market development than on domestic market development. Firms with a stronger customer orientation in response to the GFC realized higher innovativeness post-GFC. Also, firms actively developing new foreign markets in response to the GFC realized higher process innovativeness. Our results support a stronger customer focus for forest sector firms as it translates to increased innovativeness and potentially improved product development. In addition, allocating resources to foreign market development during financial downturns can be a strategy to build innovativeness.

In an effort to address the criticism associated with administering a single car ownership policy, cities are considering the possibility of carrying out both policies simultaneously, so that residents can choose whether to pay for the license plate through an auction or get it for free from a lottery but with a longer wait time. We study residents' preferences toward the two car ownership policies when both are administered at the same time, a problem that has not been investigated in the literature. We then examine the influence of car ownership policies on the choice of electric cars, which is also new to the literature. Using data collected from a stated preference survey, we estimate mixed logit models using the hierarchical Bayes approach based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Results show that strong preference heterogeneity exists in respondents' policy choice. We proceed to conduct regression analysis to explain the variations in the preferences toward license plate auction and electric cars. Our main results include: (1) We find that prospective car buyers in Beijing and Shanghai are willing to bid 27,000 yuan and 49,000 yuan to shorten their wait time to get car license plates by one year, respectively; (2) The subsidy to electric cars can be reduced by 102,000 yuan in Beijing and 85,000 yuan in Shanghai if the wait time for an electric car license plate is shortened by one year; (3) Car buyers in favor of license plate auction are those who are from high-income households, who are not buying their first cars, and who are below 30 or above 40 years old; and (4) When promoting the adoption of electric cars, policy incentives, such as making it easier to obtain an electric car license plate and providing attractive subsidies, are as important as the technological advancement electric car manufacturers strive to make, such as improving the driving range of electric cars.","[Yang, Xiaofang; Jin, Wen; Jiang, Hai] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaofang] Inner Mongolia Univ, Transportat Inst, Hohhot 010070, Peoples R China; [Xie, Qianyan; Han, Weijian] Ford Motor Co, Res & Adv Engn, 2101 Village Rd MD-2149, Dearborn, MI 48121 USA; [Shen, Wei] Ford Motor Co, Asia Pacific Res, Beijing Yintai Ctr, Unit 4901, Tower C,2 Jianguomenwai St, Beijing 100022, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Inner Mongolia University; Ford Motor Company,"Jiang, H (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",xf-yang12@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; jinw11@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; haijiang@tsinghua.edu.cn; qxie@ford.com; wshen5@ford.com; whan1@ford.com,"Shen, Wei/AAK-5955-2020","Shen, Wei/0000-0002-1705-6444; Jiang, Hai/0000-0003-3414-9682",Natural Science Foundation of China [71622006]; Center for Data-Centric Management in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Tsinghua University; Ford University Research Programs,Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Center for Data-Centric Management in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Tsinghua University; Ford University Research Programs,"The authors are very grateful to the handling editor Yoram Shiftan and the anonymous referees whose thoughtful comments and constructive suggestions have allowed them to improve the quality of this manuscript.

J,"Ford, M",,,,"Ford, Marcus",,,The Functions of Higher Education,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In very broad outline, the history of higher education in the United States has had four phases characterized by their primary function: preserving Christian civilization, advancing the national interest, research, and growing the global economy. Today, when we talk about the need for more higher education the assumption is that what is needed is more education devoted to economic growth and, to a lesser extent, certain types of research. Against this background there have always been a few outliers, colleges that do not fit this general trend. These colleges make it clear that there are alternatives to the status quo that do not involve retreating to some previous mode of higher education. It is also possible to educate young people for the continuation of Western civilization, public service, and environmental civilization. Given the critical importance of the global environmental crisis, a good case can be made for looking at these alternatives to the status quo, especially those alternatives that focus on public service and environmental sustainability. The simple fact that higher education has shifted over the centuries in terms of its mission provides some reason to believe that it could, once again, adopt a new form.","[Ford, Marcus] Eureka Coll, Philosophy & Religious Studies, Eureka, IL 61530 USA; [Ford, Marcus] No Arizona Univ, Environm Humanities, Flagstaff, AZ USA",Northern Arizona University,"Ford, M (通讯作者)，Eureka Coll, Philosophy & Religious Studies, Eureka, IL 61530 USA.",Marcus.Ford@nau.edu,,,,,,,13,5,26,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We assess the trade-offs among service quality, incorporating accessibility, service frequency, and comfort (which are important for transit users); transit ridership per capita (reflecting the society perspective); financial viability from the agency perspective; and affordability of fares for minimum wage earners. We also assess the overall performance of transit in these cities, considering these perspectives in an integrated manner. Agencies vary widely in achieving and reconciling the above outcomes and trade-offs. Generally speaking, however, agencies that perform well (or badly) on one of these objectives and trade-offs also perform well (or badly) on the others, and in terms of overall transit performance. Finally, we discuss how our assessment may be improved upon, including in terms of better and more nuanced measures, in future work. We suggest that metrics be assessed uniformly and reported regularly across transit agencies, to track and reliably compare their performance over time; and that it would be desirable to understand how transit users and decision makers weigh the relative importance of key objectives, and to incorporate this understanding in assessments of transit performance.","[Verbich, David; El-Geneidy, Ahmed M.] McGill Univ, Fac Engn, Sch Urban Planning, Room 401,Macdonald Harrington Bldg,815,Rue Sher, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C2, Canada; [Badami, Madhav G.] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Room 403,Macdonald Harrington Bldg,815,Rue Sherb, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C2, Canada; [Badami, Madhav G.] McGill Univ, McGill Sch Environm, Room 403,Macdonald Harrington Bldg,815,Rue Sherb, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C2, Canada",McGill University; McGill University; McGill University,"Badami, MG (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Room 403,Macdonald Harrington Bldg,815,Rue Sherb, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C2, Canada.;Badami, MG (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, McGill Sch Environm, Room 403,Macdonald Harrington Bldg,815,Rue Sherb, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C2, Canada.",david.verbich@mail.mcgill.ca; madhav.badami@mcgill.ca; ahmed.elgeneidy@mcgill.ca,"El-Geneidy, Ahmed/N-3904-2013","El-Geneidy, Ahmed/0000-0002-0942-4016",SSHRC Joseph Armand Bombardier Canada Graduate Scholarship,SSHRC Joseph Armand Bombardier Canada Graduate Scholarship(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We wish to thank Brendon Hemily for providing the fare database, Lauren Rudko for CTJTA data on Canadian agencies, Andrew Owen and David Levinson for accessibility measures for American cities, and Genevieve Boisjoly for help with calculating accessibility measures for Toronto and Montreal.

However, the same holds, I argue, for restrictions that are due to indifference. Berlin also observed that it would be counterintuitive if an agent could increase her freedom by changing her preferences. I criticize the argument that Dowding and Van Hees (2007, 2008) present according to which this observation counts in favour of explicating freedom in terms of intentionality.","[Hindriks, Frank] Univ Groningen, Fac Philosophy, Eth Social & Polit Philosophy, Oude Boteringestr 52, NL-9712 GL Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Hindriks, F (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Philosophy, Eth Social & Polit Philosophy, Oude Boteringestr 52, NL-9712 GL Groningen, Netherlands.",f.a.hindriks@rug.nl,,"Hindriks, Frank/0000-0002-5818-4071",,,,,45,2,2,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Besides the typical variables, such as the share of a particular polluting industry, environmental taxes, energy taxes, research and development, the dummy variable of the crises and enterprise's sustainability score were also included in the model. The fixed effect panel model was used as a framework for the analysis. The original contribution of this paper is that the factor referring to the enterprises' sustainability was empirically tested in the expanded model. Higher energy taxes, research and development and the number of sustainable enterprises decrease the level of greenhouse gases. The size of agriculture, production and construction has a positive sign, which means that a higher value of the indicator is associated with a higher level of greenhouse gases. This implies that the analysed set of factors can be applied to adjust the trend in the region and might be useful for the climate change policy adjustment.","[Lapinskiene, Giedre; Peleckis, Kestutis] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Nedelko, Zlatko] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SL-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; University of Maribor,"Lapinskiene, G (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",giedre.lapinskiene@vgtu.lt; kestutis.peleckis@vgtu.lt; zlatko.nedelko@um.si,"Lapinskienė, Giedrė/HNR-0508-2023","Nedelko, Zlatko/0000-0002-6840-877X; Lapinskiene, Giedre/0000-0003-0179-794X",,,,,29,31,31,0,18,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The evidence is consistent with official newspapers becoming more concentrated on political goals and nonofficial newspapers becoming more focused on commercial objectives, thus better enabling the newspaper industry to pursue a dual role as the government's mouthpiece and an information institution supporting the market economy. Our results are robust to using a matched firm-month research design that examines the content of articles written about the same firm in the same month, a matched firm-event approach that examines concurrent newspaper articles published immediately following corporate earnings announcements, and a difference-in-differences approach to test for conglomeration effects.","[Piotroski, Joseph D.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wong, T.

If unilateral divorce has differential costs by gender, it may impact household work by gender through bargaining channels. However, little research has examined how divorce laws affect men's levels and share of household production. To examine this, I use data on matched couples from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and exploit time variation in state divorce laws. I find that unilateral divorce laws lead to a decrease in marital investment, as measured by mens' and women's household work. The evidence also supports a bargaining response to divorce laws, as fathers in states without joint-custody laws engage in a significantly higher share of household work under unilateral divorce than those in states with joint-custody laws, consistent with a higher cost of marital dissolution among fathers who stand to lose custody of their children.","[Roff, Jennifer] CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Roff, Jennifer] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Roff, Jennifer] Inst Labor Econ IZA, New York, NY USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Roff, J (通讯作者)，CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.;Roff, J (通讯作者)，Inst Labor Econ IZA, New York, NY USA.",,,,,,,,53,4,5,2,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The literature review reveals that social currency and brand equity have been investigated so far, but the effect of these variables on consumers' purchase intention is yet unknown. Therefore, this paper intends to investigate the effect of social currency aspects on purchase intention for consumers with the mediating role of brand equity measures. First, this study aims to provide empirical data on the topic. Second, it provides empirically tested model to analyse the effect of brand equity measures on purchase intention in social communities. To do this, partial least squares approach was utilized to analyse the date obtained from the customers of an internet store in Iran. The results reveal that brand trust and brand loyalty as measures of brand equity are affected by social currency. But the impact of social currency on brand perceived quality is not supported. Our findings can broaden the understanding of researchers and managers in various dimensions of social currency, brand equity, and purchase intention and further the research agenda in the literature.","[Alavijeh, Mohammad Reza Karimi; Sepahvand, Akbar; Esmaeili, Ahmad] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Accounting & Management, Dept Business Management, Tehran, Iran; [Joksiene, Izolda] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Econ Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Allameh Tabataba'i University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Alavijeh, MRK (通讯作者)，Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Accounting & Management, Dept Business Management, Tehran, Iran.",mr.karimi@atu.ac.ir; a.sepahvand1991@gmail.com; alunet.ismaeili@gmail.com; izolda.joksiene@vgtu.lt,"Esmaeili, Ahmad/AFV-4948-2022; Sepahvand, Akbar/AAD-2572-2019","Esmaeili, Ahmad/0000-0001-5129-5089; Joksiene, Izolda/0000-0002-7871-8878",,,,,48,3,3,2,25,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

An empirical analysis is performed on the panel data to identify the profit-shifting activities of these banks. Focusing on the banking sector of Eastern European countries, which are a microcosm of the European Union, substantial evidence of profit shifting is found and confirms that banks have enhanced tax-planning opportunities similar to firms from different jurisdictions.

Many companies spend a lot of money to get precise geographic and demographic information about their customers, mostly using some IP geolocation database. In the paper some of these databases are described and we discussed their effect on business. The issue of IP geolocation databases is the necessity of regular maintenance because of changes in IP address assignment and devices relocation. The problem can be solved with active IP geolocation methods, which are mostly based on delay measurement. The paper deals with verification of selected database records' trustworthiness using active IP geolocation methods. We present the comparison of geographic location gained from databases and calculated using results of measurement. Most of results verified by active methods were accurate, but small percentage of database records had wrong location. This could influence the enterprises' business due to targeting the wrong information to customers. Therefore, the paper recommends to regularly check all database records with some active IP geolocation method to prevent providing incorrect information.","[Balej, Jiri; Zach, Petr] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Informat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Komosny, Dan] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn & Commun, Dept Telecommun, Tech 12, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Brno University of Technology,"Balej, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Informat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jiri.balej@mendelu.cz; komosny@feec.vutbr.cz; petr.zach@mendelu.cz,"Balej, Jiri/D-7068-2017","Balej, Jiri/0000-0002-6054-8700",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,24,32,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200003,0

Two types of convergence are calculated - beta that is based on the neoclassical growth theory, and sigma convergence. Panel data were used to estimate the parameters of the model. The method used was LS. All parameters are statistically significant. It can be stated that both sigma and beta convergence have occurred over the monitored period. However, the same is not true for different sub periods. Beta convergence that is a necessary condition for the existence of sigma convergence did not occur during the period 2000-2006 or 2006-2009. Due to this fact, economic convergence between the monitored countries for the given period of time cannot be discussed.

The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between working capital management and firm profitability. Using a panel data set on HGFs from Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern Europe during the time span 2006-2015, we found an inverted U-shape relationship between working capital level and firm profitability. Our findings indicate that HGFs should find and maintain the optimal working capital level that maximizes their profitability. Our results proved to be robust when we employ different methodology (quantile regression), different sub-samples as well as alternative measures of profitability and working capital management. The study highlights the importance of short-term financial decisions in enhancing HGFs' profitability, with significant implications for academics and practitioners.

We study the technical efficiency as well as the total factor of productivity changes differences between countries by employing the Data Envelopment Analysis. The efficiency scores are calculated with an output-oriented model. Specification of inputs and outputs is one of the major problems for measurement of bank's efficiency and productivity changes. To determine inputs and outputs, we made use of assets approach that treats banks as classical intermediators between depositors and borrowers. We have determined three inputs (personnel, physical capital, purchased funds) and two outputs: net loans, total securities. Our results showed that average technical efficiency (for all banks) trended upward during the study period. This increase efficiency is not common for all banks in the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovak. We found that efficiency for Czech, Polish and Slovak banks increase during research time. Development of efficiency Hungarian banks has on the contrary a downward trend from 0.882 in 2009 to 0.856 in 2013. We also founded that the Total Factor of Productivity (TFP) changes across all countries was relatively stable in 3 of the 4 observation periods. However, there was a substantial decline in TFP in 2011-2012. Examination of the trends for each of the countries showed that Hungary overly influenced the sample mean. The TFP remained stable during this period for all Poland and Czech Republic, declined slightly for Slovakia, but declined precipitously for Hungary in 2011-2012.","[Cernohorska, Libena] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ Adm, Inst Econ Sci, Pardubice, Czech Republic; [Pilyavskyy, Anatoliy] Lviv Univ Trade & Econ, Fac Int Econ Relat & Informat Technol, Dept Higher Math & Quantitat Methods, Lvov, Ukraine; [Aaronson, William] Temple Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Adm & Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University of Pardubice; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Lviv University of Trade & Economics; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Cernohorska, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ Adm, Inst Econ Sci, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",Libena.cernohorska@upce.cz; apiliavs@mail.lviv.ua; waaronso@temple.edu,,,Czech Science Foundation [17-02509S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The paper has been created with the financial support of The Czech Science Foundation (project GACR No. 17-02509S, Emerging financial risks during a global low interest rate environment).",,42,4,4,0,3,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

As employees and their clients communicate primarily via email, much crucial business data is conveyed via email content. Where businesses are understandably concerned, they need a sophisticated workflow management system to manage their transactions. A workflow management system should also be able to classify any incoming emails into suitable categories. Previous research has implemented a system to categorize emails based on the words found in email messages. Two parameters affected the accuracy of the program, namely the number of words in a database compared with sample emails, and an acceptable percentage for classifying emails. As the volume of email has become larger and more sophisticated, this research classifies email messages into a larger number of categories and changes a parameter that affects the accuracy of the program. The first parameter, namely the number of words in a database compared with sample emails, remains unchanged, while the second parameter is changed from an acceptable percentage to the number of matching words. The empirical results suggest that the number of words in a database compared with sample emails is 11, and the number of matching words to categorize emails is 7. When these settings are applied to categorize 12,465 emails, the accuracy of this experiment is approximately 65.3%. The optimal number of words that yields high accuracy levels lies between 11 and 13, while the number of matching words lies between 6 and 8.","[Chaipornkaew, Piyanuch; Prexawanprasut, Takorn] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Coll Innovat Technol & Engn, Bangkok, Thailand; [Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Discipline Business Analyt, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, Madrid, Spain; Yokohama Natl Univ, Inst Adv Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",National Chung Hsing University; National Tsing Hua University; University of Sydney; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Complutense University of Madrid; Yokohama National University,"Prexawanprasut, T (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Coll Innovat Technol & Engn, Bangkok, Thailand.",takorn.pre@dpu.ac.th,"Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X",,,,,18,0,0,0,0,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-02-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,429,436,,10.26480/icemi.01.2017.429.436,0.0,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GZ,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461012100145,0

The impacts of these events varied considerably across Member States and sectors. Considering the fact that industry is one of the driving forces of economic growth and development, the impact of EU integration upon the industrial sector of the member and partner countries is determined by major structural changes in the EU's productive structure. Productivity gains or losses explain much of the development of productive structures. Decomposition analysis at the level of the Member States help to identify those countries that, in the past 15 years, saw gains in labor productivity and what countries managed to shift resources towards sectors with high productivity growth. Preliminary research results show that structural change seems to take place within the EU countries and even within the regions rather than between them, and between the large sectors rather than within them. Therefore, the main objective of the present article is to identify and highlight the structural changes registered by the European Union's new member states.","[Crudu, Rodica] Acad Econ Studies Moldova, Int Econ Relat Fac, Kishinev, Moldova",Academy of Economic Studies of Moldova,"Crudu, R (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies Moldova, Int Econ Relat Fac, Kishinev, Moldova.",rodikakrudu@gmail.com,"Crudu, Rodica/AAW-1435-2020","Crudu, Rodica/0000-0002-6470-8601",,,,,27,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-54112-9; 978-3-319-54111-2,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,7,,,,,,423,436,,10.1007/978-3-319-54112-9_27,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ4CE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424822700027,0

Public opposition is often thought to be a barrier to the political feasibility of the road mileage user-fee. We use a nationally representative public opinion survey to investigate the level and intensity of support for replacing the fuel tax with a general mileage user-fee and with three specific modes of administration of the fee. Our results confirm that public opposition to the adoption of mileage user-fees to address the growing revenue inadequacy of fuel taxes is high, with the number of opponents exceeding the number of supporters by a ratio of 4-1. Furthermore, public support is somewhat sensitive to respondents' belief in the user-pays principle and perceptions of the characteristics of the mode of administration. Additionally, relative to supporters, those who oppose the mileage user-fee are more likely to state that they are willing to take political action against the adoption of mileage user-fees.","[Duncan, Denvil; Nadella, Venkata; Bowers, Ashley; Graham, John D.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 East 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Giroux, Stacey] Indiana Univ, Survey Res Ctr, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Bowers, Ashley] Indiana Univ, Survey Res Ctr, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Duncan, D (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 East 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",duncande@indiana.edu; vnadella@indiana.edu; sagiroux@indiana.edu; afbowers@indiana.edu; grahamjd@indiana.edu,,"Duncan, Denvil/0000-0001-7554-5548",,,,,46,9,10,1,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

This paper investigates to what degree the economy is greening horizontally (sector-wise). Starting with a sectoral case study, we undertake a longitudinal analysis of the breath and strength of the greening of the automotive sector from 1965 to 2012, focusing on powertrain technologies. The empirical analysis is based on patent data amongst big car producers and focuses on identifying changes in two main aspects: (1) the convergence/divergence of firms' green strategies and technologies within the automotive sector; and (2) the contribution of alternative key green technological trajectories relative to the dominant design. Our findings indicate that the evolution of relative green patenting has followed a positive, linear growth over the last decades with increasing participation of alternative propulsion technologies and increasing convergence of automakers' strategies towards a diversified portfolio.","[Faria, Lourenco G.

The popularity of mobile applications is closely related to the changes of consumer needs and behaviour. Moreover, the usage of mobile applications has a potential for the development of consumer engagement state through the creation of the exceptional experience. Consumer engagement in the usage of mobile applications may have an impact on consumers' loyalty and intentions to recommend and repetitively use mobile application. Mobile applications should enable consumer engagement resulting in beneficial consumers' solutions for enterprises. Considering results of the prior researches in this area, it is known that the main factor determining decision not to use mobile application (to delete or reject it) is a poor usability. Poor usability of mobile applications can be a result of different reasons including an inadequate selection of the aspects of mobile application ignoring consumers' usage goals. Therefore, this paper aims to identify key aspects of mobile applications that potentially have an impact on its usage and consumer engagement. The paper proposes a theoretical framework that integrates aspects of mobile application affecting applications' usability and, therefore, consumer engagement, and consequences of it. The framework is based on the overview of conceptual and empirical studies of consumer engagement in a mobile environment, aspects of the mobile application and mobile applications' user's typology.","[Gatautis, Rimantas; Tarute, Asta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Mkt, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Tarute, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Mkt, Kaunas, Lithuania.",rimantas.gatautis@ktu.lt; asta.tarute@ktu.lt,,,Kaunas University of Technology [MTEPI-P-15030],Kaunas University of Technology,This research was funded by a grant (No. MTEPI-P-15030) from the R&D and Innovation Fund of Kaunas University of Technology.,,25,0,0,1,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5,,,,,,875,884,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_56,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000056,0

At the same time, the results of the study will help investors and policymakers determine the profitability and volatility of the market so that they make the right decision to hold the securities.","[Ho, Thuy Tien; Ho, Thu Hoai; Ngo, Van Toan] Univ Finance & Mkt, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",,"Ho, TT (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Mkt, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",tienht@ufm.edu.vn; hoaiho.ueh@gmail.com; Ngovantoan2425@gmail.com,"Van Toan, Ngo/AAC-4143-2021",,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",2287-478X,,,INT CONF KOREA DISTR,,,2017,,,,,,,237,240,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ1UR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418104000064,0

In higher education context, if nonacademic employees are not satisfied with their motivation factors, employee performance is very low, and inefficiency is increased. According to that, the purpose of this study was to identify factors that are most influencing on the job satisfaction of staff officers of state universities in Sri Lanka. This paper reviews the literature on single and multiple studies concerned about the job satisfaction and formulated the conceptual model. Mainly, researcher formulated the three dimensions as independent variables, namely, psychological factors, environmental factors, and work relationship, and work-life balance and job satisfaction have been taken as the dependent variables. The research method applied in this study is descriptive survey method. The researcher used questionnaire as the main instrument for this study. Multiple regression analysis method was used to measure the impact of identified job satisfiers on staff officers' job satisfaction. Results of his study indicate that there was positive relationship between satisfier factors and job satisfaction and there was an impact of identified job satisfiers on overall job satisfaction. Psychological factors have by far been the greatest influence on staff officers' job satisfaction. The correlation analysis revealed that there is a positive relationship between three main dimensions and job satisfaction. The study offers practical suggestions to the educational institutions and human resource managers on how to increase the job satisfaction and organization performance.","[Jayatilake, Lakmini V.

The determinants of female labor force participation have been studied extensively by previous studies but this paper differs in some ways. First and foremost, previous studies have used traditional estimation techniques such as simple logit or probit estimators. Here, we have used a newly developed estimator called special regression, and we have included the random individual effect in the model by using recursive mixed-process estimator. Second, we have taken into account endogeneity problem of education which is mostly ignored by researchers. Finally, previous studies, generally, have used 1 year data. This paper has used 14 years data so we might see whether there is a change in the effect of explanatory variable. Generally speaking, estimation results have demonstrated that education, not surprisingly, has positive and significant effect. Marital status, having children and region are other important variables.

Especially during a crisis, when cash from banks is extremely important to realize a plan of restructuring, the relationships to banks(s) becomes a crucial factor. One factor in the field of relationships to banks is the so called relationship banking, which is a well-known practice in the bank oriented economies in Europe. Relationship banking means a long run relationship between one or a small number of banks to firms, especially in lending, so the terminus is in this field relationship lending. Banks receive intensive information about the firm over a long period of time, so that the banks are able to estimate at a high level the economic situation of the firms. On the other hand the enterprises are looking for a higher level of understanding and help in critical situations. Relationship banking leads to lower competition among the banks, so that there is a fear of firms paying too much for banking products. On the basis of a huge telephone-questionnaire in Poland concerning financial management we have tried to answer some research questions in the field of relationship banking in detail in order to bring light into this somewhat dark area of relationships between banks and firms. The main aspect of relationship banking is the duration of this relationship. Using empirical methodology, we analyse this relationship on the basis of the length of time as well as aspects such as the age of the firm, the number of bank relationships, the industry, the influence of strategies and the access to credits.","[Pernsteiner, Helmut] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria; [Weclawski, Jerzy] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Lublin, Poland",Johannes Kepler University Linz; Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Pernsteiner, H (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria.",helmut.pernsteiner@jku.at; jerzy.weclawski@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,"Węcławski, Jerzy/AAQ-3686-2020","Pernsteiner, Helmut/0000-0002-3977-6098",,,,,14,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,203,211,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_19,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500019,0

Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of four technical trading rules (moving average, filter, trading range breakout and channel breakout rule) in six stock market indices of the Balkan States. Also, the paper is providing resume evidence on the predictive power of four mentioned trading rules. We apply the Reality Check and the Superior Predictive Ability test using bootstrap methodology to evaluate the relative performance of those rules. Furthermore, presented tests provide an answer to data snooping problems, which is essential to obtain unbiased outcomes. The original time series is resampled with random draw in two ways: a parametric residual-based method from the AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model, and a nonparametric, the moving block bootstrap. After including data snooping biases, this study finds that the null hypothesis that trading rules do not outperform the benchmark can be rejected at the 5 percent significance level for five separate stock indices, excluding the MBI10 index. Similarly, such results show the rejection of the weak-form market efficiency hypothesis in case of mentioned stock markets. Applied technical trading rule algorithms in all six stock market indices mainly generate more losing trades then wining trades. Finally, transaction costs have relatively small effect on the overall performance of selected technical trading rules in case of indices BELEX15, CROBEX, SBITOP and MONEX20, but with some changes in choice of the best technical trading rule considering the effects of trading frequencies.","[Radovanov, Boris; Marcikic, Aleksandra] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Dept Business Informat & Quantitat Methods, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Radovanov, B (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subot, Dept Business Informat & Quantitat Methods, Novi Sad, Serbia.",radovanovb@ef.uns.ac.rs; amarcikic@ef.uns.ac.rs,,,,,,,45,5,5,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The research leveraged data on monthly outflow from the unemployment pool and the number of vacancies in Poland from 2000 to 2013. All variables were subject to distinct seasonality patterns. The number of vacancies was characterized by the highest seasonal variation, whereas the lowest variation was observed for the number of registered unemployed persons. Moreover the matching function was enhanced with a binary variable describing periods of increase and decrease in unemployment. The analysis indicated a clear yearly pattern in elasticity coefficients in the matching function. The pattern was similar both elasticity coefficients (outflow from the unemployment pool and the number of vacancies). The highest values were reached during winter months and the lowest during summer months. Similar pattern was observed with regards to returns to scale. Increasing returns to scale were observed between December and May and decreasing returns between June and October.

These proposals deal also with the administration and procedures. Groups of companies should be administered by the principal tax authority. The tax audit of group members should be performed by national authorities, which should be coordinated by the principal tax authority. The CCCTB proposal requires the cooperation between concerned authorities. The leading role of the principal tax authority, different procedural rules in 28 Member States and different interests of the concerned authorities can lead to the unfounded differences in the quality of tax administration and legal protection of taxpayers rights. Taxpayers may tend to administrative shopping. The aim of this paper is to analyze the administration and procedures mentioned in proposals for Directives on CCTB and CCCTB, to consider pros and cons of these proposals and, eventually suggest another solution. The author concludes that best solution for fair and effective administration is to establish one tax authority on the EU level (EU Specialized Tax Office) and introduce complex EU procedural rules (EU Tax Procedure Code).

However, these innovations seem to differ distinctively from recognized technological and economic forms of innovation by their formation and scaling processes, actor constellations, and the complexity of knowledge combination. Due to cognitive and institutional diversity in the development of sustainability innovation, combining knowledge bases transnationally is considerably challenging. This article illustrates such a case of knowledge bases combination by a comparative institutional analysis and innovation biographies of German-Chinese innovation projects in the green building sector. To grasp the largely underexplored dynamics of territorial and relational geographies in transnational sustainability innovation, this article places micro-dynamics and their institutional foundation center stage. Conceptually, recent evolutionary institutional geography approaches and knowledge-based theories are linked with the aim of contributing to both the geography of sustainability transitions and the ongoing debate in evolutionary economic geography. Thereby a deeper exploration of path dynamics and a more profound integration of agency and institutional changes is made possible.","[Strambach, Simone] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, D-35032 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Strambach, S (通讯作者)，Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",simone.strambach@staff.uni-marburg.de,"Hallstedt, Sophie I./A-4669-2015","Strambach, Simone/0000-0002-8713-9683","ASLinn project (Anchorage, Sustainability and Localization of Innovation)","ASLinn project (Anchorage, Sustainability and Localization of Innovation)","The research has received support from the ASLinn project (Anchorage, Sustainability and Localization of Innovation), which is gratefully acknowledged.

This article provides partial results of explorative study within cases of breaking the food safety requirements in the Czech Republic, based on data of the Czech Agriculture Food Inspection Authority and State Veterinary Administration, respectively.

As such, how to choose between alliances and acquisitions becomes a critical decision, and one important determinant is interfirm factors. This study probes three crucial yet underexplored interfirm differences, and develops scales to capture managers' perceptions of the differences that, based on managerial cognition literature, dictate the ally-versus-acquire choice. Further, we argue that managers adjust their judgement across varying objective conditions. Each perceived difference is thus paired with a moderator identified respectively from the resource-based view, competitive dynamics, and collaborative capability literature. Evidences on Taiwanese firms show that a larger resource-deployment difference enhances acquisition likelihood, while greater differences in marketing praxis and human resource management increase alliance formation. Moreover, the resource-deployment difference leads to alliances for relatively younger partners, and the difference in human resource management favors acquisitions when focal firms have more interfirm governance experience.","[Tseng, Chiung-Hui] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Int Business, Coll Management, 1 Ta Hsueh Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Tseng, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Int Business, Coll Management, 1 Ta Hsueh Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",ctseng@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,48,1,1,0,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Using the ARDL modeling approach, it finds that political and institutional factors are crucial both in the long run and the short run in FDI inflows to the country. On the macroeconomic side, the market size of the country, availability of natural resources, openness to trade, and deprecation in the nominal exchange rate are found to positively affect FDI inflows to the country. On the other hand, macroeconomic instability is found to effect FDI inflows negatively. In addition, better political stability, government effectiveness and regulatory quality, and better performance of the rule of law are found to positively affect FDI inflows to the country. A careful liberalization of the foreign exchange market and that of external trade, sustaining the current growth momentum of the economy, improving institutional quality, and strengthening the political stability of the country, among others, are fundamental areas that the government could work on to strengthen Ethiopia's position in FDI inflows on the continent.","[Yimer, Addis] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Yimer, A (通讯作者)，Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",addisyimer@gmail.com,"Yimer, Addis/GPC-7338-2022","Yimer, Addis/0000-0002-9494-2386",,,,,65,6,7,1,6,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,123,151,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_7,0.0,,,29,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900007,0

Limited funding available for REDD + suggests that there is a need to adopt a targeted approach (i.e., targeting selected groups or regions) to make REDD + projects more effective. However, there is no clear understanding of how targeting could be done based on households' preferences for various design features of a REDD + policy. Using choice experiment data obtained from two groups of households (project participants and outsiders) belonging to three types of forest management regimes (private, government and community) in Indonesia, this paper aims to identify classes of households that have similar preferences towards REDD + design features. The scale adjusted latent class analysis indicates that there are four classes of households: (1) supporters emphasising household benefits, (2) supporters emphasising community projects, (3) indifferent but objecting restrictions, and (4) sceptics demanding monetary benefits. We also found that forest management regime is a key determinant of household classes. Our results suggest that REDD+ projects are likely to be more accepted by households in the community- and government-managed forest regimes. Such information will be useful to develop more targeted REDD+ projects.","[Rakatama, Ari; Pandit, Ram; Iftekhar, Sayed; Ma, Chunbo] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Pandit, Ram; Iftekhar, Sayed; Ma, Chunbo] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Rakatama, Ari] Indonesian Minist Environm & Forestry, Directorate Gen Ecosyst & Nat Resource Conservat, Jakarta 10207, Indonesia; [Ma, Chunbo] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, China Ctr Econ Dev & Innovat Strategy, Dept Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; Ministry of Environment & Forestry; Jinan University,"Rakatama, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.;Rakatama, A (通讯作者)，Indonesian Minist Environm & Forestry, Directorate Gen Ecosyst & Nat Resource Conservat, Jakarta 10207, Indonesia.",ari.rakatama@research.uwa.edu.au,"Ma, Chunbo/D-3478-2011; Iftekhar, Sayed/J-5298-2013; Rakatama, Ari/AAA-9655-2022","Ma, Chunbo/0000-0002-9973-2943; Rakatama, Ari/0000-0001-8271-5736; Iftekhar, Md Sayed/0000-0002-2827-2943; Pandit, Ram/0000-0003-4053-5694",Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan/LPDP); ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions; ARC DECRA grant [DE180101503]; University of Western Australia; Australian Research Council [DE180101503] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan/LPDP); ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council); ARC DECRA grant(Australian Research Council); University of Western Australia; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank all forest authorities, enumerators, respondents, and informants for the supports and contributions in this study.

The development of HSR service network in megaregions can change accessibility landscapes and create advantaged and disadvantaged cities. This study investigates how HSR service development has restructured uneven regional accessibility by developing a new regional accessibility measurement to incorporate train-service-frequency-into-the-prevailing-speed-dominated-calculations. We-conduct-a-longitudinal-study-to-examine the changing patterns and relevant determinants of regional accessibility in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, as well as the differences between conventional rail (CR) cities and HSR cities. The results indicate that the development of HSR services network has enhanced regional accessibility in the YRD rather than having the overall effect of restructuring the existing accessibility patterns formed by CR services. It has reduced the disparity of regional accessibility but has widened the gap between HSR and CR cities and increased the disparity of CR cities. Combined with a Tobit regression analysis, the results suggest that HSR network development in the YRD was highly spatially selective towards the cities that had higher CR network accessibility and better economic development performance. However, the disadvantage of regional accessibility for CR cities remains persistent, which may result in the issue of 'peripheralisation of the periphery'. Some policy implications for an integration of the CR and HSR services for both CR and HSR cities are outlined in conclusion.","[Wang, Lei] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester Urban Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Wang, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","University of Manchester; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Wang, L (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester Urban Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England.",lei.wang-3@manchester.ac.uk,"Wang, Lei/J-3748-2019","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-8421-7244","Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester; National Science Foundation of China [41601169, 41871119]",Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is funded by Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester and National Science Foundation of China (41601169 and 41871119).

In recent years, overdependence on deeper and wider multinational supply and production chains and lean-optimization has led to tightly integrated systems with little slack and high sensitivity to disruptions. This study considers the impact of Emission Control Areas and establishes a link between environmental and network resilience performance for maritime supply chains using operational cost and SOx emissions cost metrics. The proposed methodological framework analyzes various abatement options, disruption intensities, fuel pricing instances and regulatory strategies. The methodology utilizes a minimum cost flow assignment and an arc velocity optimization model for vessel speed to establish the payoff for various network states. Additionally, an attacker defender game is set up to identify optimal regulatory strategies under various disruption scenarios. The results are complemented by a sensitivity analysis on SOx emissions pricing, to better equip policy makers to manage environmental and resilience legislation. The methodology and findings provide a comprehensive analytic approach to optimize maritime supply chain performance beyond minimisation of operational costs, to also minimize exposure to costly supply chain disruptions.","[Zavitsas, Konstantinos] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Zis, Thalis] Tech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark; [Bell, Michael G.

Understanding travel mode switch behaviour is essential to identify the reasons for choosing one mode of transport over another. Travel mode switch behaviour needs to be considered for efficient transport infrastructure planning. However, very little is known about mode switch behaviour of individuals due to the construction of transport infrastructure such as flyovers on roadways particularly in the context of developing countries. This research examines whether the construction of flyover infrastructure induces travel mode switch behaviour of individuals. The study also considers a non-flyover road in order to have a comparison between results from flyover and non-flyover users. The objective of this research are: to measure induced mode switch behaviour caused by the construction of transport infrastructure; and to model induced mode switch behaviour. Using purposive sampling technique, the data was collected through an intercept survey and online questionnaire from 1060 vehicle users who used flyover and non-flyover roads based on the percentage of modal share in Dhaka. A Multinomial logistic regression model determined that flyovers have a significant impact on induced travel mode switch behaviour of individuals. Induced mode switch made by non-flyover road users are also reported. The study found that flyover users were three times more likely to shift their travel mode to private transport in order to save travel time compared to the flyover users who did not change their travel mode. This research suggests that the benefits of travel time savings for each travel mode should be taken into account when providing or evaluating new transport infrastructure. Otherwise, traffic congestion will return due to an increase of private transport, and will minimize the benefits of travel time savings.","[Rahman, Mohammad Lutfur; Baker, Douglas] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Rahman, ML (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",lrahman@juniv.edu; d2.baker@qut.edu.au,"Rahman, Mohammad Lutfur/AAV-1238-2020; Baker, Douglas C/J-1007-2012","Baker, Douglas C/0000-0001-8812-8567; Rahman, Mohammad Lutfur/0000-0003-4908-8448",,,,,63,9,9,4,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The 2008 economic crisis and the consequences of Croatia's accession to the EU in 2013 were studied as the factors leading to unfavourable trends and changes in vehicle structure. In accordance with the national policy measures, the highest levies have been imposed on new vehicles. With the age of the vehicle there is a reduction in taxes, while vehicles older than 10 years have been exempted from taxes. Combinations of such unfavourable aspects have resulted in an increase in technical defectiveness and ecological unfriendliness of vehicles. Increasing technical defectiveness of vehicles directly reduces traffic safety. The impact of changes in vehicle structure on traffic safety, as well as on the environment and human health, was analysed on the basis of processed data from the Centre for Vehicles of Croatia (CVH). The results of the study indicate the consequences of adverse changes in vehicle structure through emissions, technical roadworthiness of vehicles and the number of fatalities in road traffic.

Although the awareness among port users with regard to environmental protection has increased, environmental issues remain a public concern. The response to oil spills is the focus of this paper because it raises public and industry concerns about the effectiveness of response systems. The absence of a maritime economics perspective leaves a number of spill response aspects unaddressed. This paper identifies the economic implications of spill response regimes. The research focuses on the spill regime in eight ports in six countries : Antwerp, Hamburg, Rotterdam, Southampton, Vancouver (Canada), Houston, Los Angeles and Seattle. The research involves extensive library research and meetings with different stakeholders involved in oil spills response in/and around the ports. The examination of oil spill response practices in eight ports reveals substantial differences. These differences highlight the diverse governance structures, geographic situations and traffic composition of the ports. Firstly, it is noted that the functions of port authorities (PAs) in respect of spill response vary greatly. Secondly, there is an evident dichotomy between a port viewed as a corporate entity managing only designated port resources or as a body of water and terminals used by ships. And thirdly, traffic composition (together with the local geography) can be expected to affect spill response management. A high incidence of oil and chemical traffic can be expected to be linked with elevated protection against and, perhaps, experience with oil and chemical spills. The economics of spill response regimes is driven by the principle of the polluter pays. However, the application of this principle to the costs of spill response plays out differently under different port governance regimes and under different strategies for allocating cost responsibility. The paper identifies these differences and makes recommendations for further research so that maritime economists can give greater attention to the consequences of governance regimes and the cost recovery methods in oil spill response.","[Carlan, Valentin; Sys, Christa; Vanelslander, Thierry] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Heaver, Trevor] Univ British Columbia, Operat & Logist Div, 2329 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of Antwerp; University of British Columbia,"Carlan, V (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",valentin.carlan@uantwerp.be; trevor.heaver@sauder.ubc.ca; christa.sys@uantwerp.be; Thierry.vanelslander@uantwerp.be,"Carlan, Valentin/AAV-8992-2020; Sys, Christa/S-4101-2018; Vanelslander, Thierry/I-6083-2015","Carlan, Valentin/0000-0001-7567-5764; Sys, Christa/0000-0001-5962-334X; Vanelslander, Thierry/0000-0001-5213-3444",ClearSeas,ClearSeas,The authors wish to thank the oil spill experts for participating in the interview rounds and for sharing their professional experience.

Blocking mergers that may have little or no adverse effect on competition will not cause significant economic harm; but the failure to interdict mergers that do cause harm imposes significant costs on the economy.

A series of simulations are conducted to demonstrate the phenomenon explicitly to prove its impact. Empirical results clearly indicate the oscillations and possible existence of an optimum sample size for given algorithms. Although these two approaches are tested in the empirical study, results significantly emphasize possible existence of sample size asymmetries in other kinds of algorithms.

However, these imaginary societies only exist through radical changes to women's reproductive roles. At the same time, these societies also anticipate feminist interest in eugenics through proposals to regulate marriage, eliminate unhealthy members of society, and adopt measures for the moral improvement of the human race. Elizabeth Corbett's New Amazonia (1889) argues that a state governed only by women would achieve high moral standards, while eugenics and strict scientific regulation would guarantee improvements in health and longevity. Mary E. Bradley Lane's Mizora (1880-1881) proposes an entirely separatist world where the elimination of men, following the development of an asexual process of reproduction, would lead to a scientifically perfect society. Alice Ilgenfritz Jones and Ella Merchant's Unveiling a Parallel (1893), on the other hand, questions the idea of the intrinsic immorality of men, showing a utopia wherein women behave as badly as men given the same societal freedom. Instead, eugenic selection has supported evolution to a higher state of morality in which children are no longer conceived through sexual acts.","[Lake, Christina] Univ Exeter, Literature, Exeter, Devon, England; [Lake, Christina] Falmouth Exeter Plus, Lib & Arch, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Lake, C (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Literature, Exeter, Devon, England.;Lake, C (通讯作者)，Falmouth Exeter Plus, Lib & Arch, Exeter, Devon, England.",christina.l@virgin.net,,"Lake, Christina/0000-0002-7498-6808",,,,,47,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In its attempt to synthesize and render accessible to social actors a broad range of the latest social scientific knowledge, as well as in its confidence that knowledge can empower those actors to make progress, it recalls D'Alembert and Diderot's famous Encyclopedie. Indeed, one can say that the Report is a quintessential Enlightenment project (cf. Bury 1920). For example, in his famous Outlines of a Historical View of the Progress of the Human Mind (1796), Condorcet asserts the possibility of an accumulation of empirical and theoretical knowledge and the concomitant expansion in our capacities to alleviate social and natural evils. And Condorcet and many of his contemporaries were motivated to propose political institutions that would enable such an indefinite increase in knowledge so as to bring about the attendant improvement to people's lives.","[Raubo, Alexander] Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Free Sch Lane, Cambridge CB2 3RH, England; [Voorhoeve, Alex] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Cambridge; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Raubo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Free Sch Lane, Cambridge CB2 3RH, England.",ar948@cam.ac.uk; a.e.voorhoeve@lse.ac.uk,,,LSE's Knowledge Exchange and Impact Fund,LSE's Knowledge Exchange and Impact Fund,We are grateful to the LSE's Knowledge Exchange and Impact Fund for supporting the workshop.

Aim: This article examines the relationship between financial innovation and the financial performance of 42 commercial banks in Kenya. Setting: The financial innovations covered are the branchless banking models, which represent a departure from the traditional branch-based banking. More specifically, the financial innovations covered are: mobile banking, agency banking, internet banking and automated teller machines. Methods: We use the Koyck dynamic distributed lag model to estimate the relationship between financial innovations and bank financial performance. The model has been using dynamic panel estimation with system generalised method of moments. Results: The results show that financial innovations significantly contribute to bank financial performance, and that firm-specific factors are more important in determining the firm's current financial performance than industry factors. Conclusion: We provide evidence that financial innovations generate good results for the shareholders, suggesting that shareholders are the primary beneficiaries of financial innovations used by commercial banks.","[Chipeta, Chimwemwe] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Commerce Law & Management, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Muthinja, Moses M.] Univ South Africa, Coll Econ & Management Sci, Dept Finance Risk Management & Banking, Pretoria, South Africa; [Muthinja, Moses M.] St Pauls Univ, Fac Business & Commun Studies, Dept Business, Limuru, Kenya",University of Witwatersrand; University of South Africa,"Chipeta, C (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Commerce Law & Management, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",chimwemwe.chipeta@wits.ac.za,,"chipeta, Chimwemwe/0000-0002-4341-9114; Muthinja, Dr. Moses Mwenda/0000-0002-4210-1139",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),This work benefited from African Economic Research Consortium funding (AERC PhD Fellowship 2015).,,58,11,14,11,52,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The algorithm builds a regression-like model of expected inflation using a large panel of macroeconomic data as possible covariates. The algorithm achieves a very strong fit in-sample, and finds that the inflation expectations of households correlate with different macroeconomic variables from the expectations of professionals. However, it is difficult to exploit the predictability of inflation expectations in order to improve forecasts of the realized inflation.

Models were formulated by considering business size variables that capture establishment freight activity. Model estimation results revealed that business size indicators such as number of employees and gross floor area explained the freight generation well. Number of years in business (YB) was identified as another variable and considered in model specification to estimate FG. Detailed investigation of single variable FG models suggested that employment -based models are suitable for cities with dense commercial activities and higher land value, while area-based models better represented FG in cities with medium level of urbanization. Area appears to be a skewed indicator for representing business size in cities with dense commercial activities. In this case, where acquiring area is difficult, employment may be a better representative of growth in freight activity. As an extension of city specific FG models, three types of combined FG models were developed to provide quantitative statistical evidence for differences in model specifications across the cities. The statistical findings from these models suggest that freight activities are influenced by the interaction of establishment characteristics and its location. Interaction effect is more prominent when area is used to represent the business size. Since a systematic commodity flow survey practice is absent in India, planners and policy makers can be benefited from this study while making decisions on freight specific investment schemes and freight operation strategies. The interaction FG models discussed subsequently in this study may be utilized in transportation planning application for the state, regional and corridor level network capacity needs.","[Pani, Agnivesh; Sahu, Prasanta K.; Sarkar, Ashoke K.] Birla Inst Technol & Sci Pilani, Dept Civil Engn, Pilani 333031, Rajasthan, India; [Patil, Gopal R.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Birla Institute of Technology & Science Pilani (BITS Pilani); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Sahu, PK (通讯作者)，Birla Inst Technol & Sci Pilani, Dept Civil Engn, Pilani 333031, Rajasthan, India.",agniveshpani@gmail.com; prasantsahu222@gmail.com; gpatil@iitb.ac.in; aksarkar@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in,"Patil, Gopal R/P-4567-2014; Pani, Agnivesh/ABG-3693-2020; Sahu, Prasanta K./K-8303-2016","Patil, Gopal R/0000-0002-2281-1870; Pani, Agnivesh/0000-0002-0136-8224; Sahu, Prasanta K./0000-0002-4309-5631",,,,,49,37,38,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The local and regional railway services show the strongest growth of all market segments in the Swedish passenger railway market. The strong growth is due both to changes in travel patterns and improved subsidized railway services. One important factor in the success of the regional public transport authorities' (PTA) railway services is the redefinition of the scope of these railway services by interconnecting regional railway networks into bigger entities. In 2017, nearly all local and regional railway services in Sweden's most populated region, Malardalen, became part of a network of railway services subsidized by the PTAs in the greater region. We analyse the cooperative and competitive interactions between the stakeholders in the greater region using the key concepts in the theory of hybrid organizations. We find that despite moving towards a unified public transport market covering many counties the hybrid organizations use different governance structures and have different principles for sharing value creation.

Recognising the potential benefits with regard to accessibility, health, and sustainability, several studies have investigated policies that encourage integration of these modes. However, the actual users and trips of the combined bicycle and transit mode have not been extensively studied empirically. This study addresses this gap by (i) reviewing empirical findings on related modes, (ii) deriving user and trip characteristics of the combined bicycle and transit mode in the Netherlands, and (iii) applying latent class cluster analysis to discover prototypical users based on their sociodemographic attributes. Most trips by this combined mode are found to be for relatively long commutes where transit is in the form of trains, and bicycle and walking are access and egress modes respectively. Furthermore, seven user groups are identified and their travel behaviour is discussed. Transport authorities may use these empirical results to further streamline integration of bicycle and transit for its largest users as well as to tailor policies to attract more travellers.","[Shelat, Sanmay; van Oort, Niels] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Transport & Planning, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Huisman, Raymond; van Oort, Niels] Goudappel Coffeng, POB 161, NL-7400 AD Deventer, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Shelat, S (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Dept Transport & Planning, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",s.shelat@tudelft.nl; Hqr@goudappel.nl; N.vanOort@tudelft.nl,,"van Oort, Niels/0000-0002-4519-2013; Shelat, Sanmay/0000-0002-5412-3933",,,,,39,44,45,2,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) for 1993-2013, we examine the relationship between child-access-prevention (CAP) laws and gun carrying among high-school students. Our results suggest that CAP laws lead to an 18.5 percent decrease in the rate of gun carrying and a 19 percent decrease in the rate at which students report being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property. These results are concentrated among minors, for whom CAP laws are most likely to bind. To supplement our YRBS analysis, we assemble a data set on school-shooting deaths for 1991-2013.

We collect procurement data and use a difference-in-difference approach to compare outcomes before and after the investigation in Montreal and in Quebec City, where there have been no allegations of collusion or corruption. We find that entry and participation increased, and that the price of procurement decreased. We then decompose the price decrease to quantify the importance of two aspects of cartel organization, coordination and entry deterrence, for collusive pricing.

An analytical and tractable characterization of the stationary rotation age is established on the basis of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The rotation age is shown to be unique and to depend on the risk probability but not on producer's risk preferences. A numerical application, using these analytical findings and based on the forestry of maritime pine in southwestern France is conducted. This numerical application consists in designing an optimal carbon sequestration policy based on financial incentives aiming at extending forest rotation ages.

In the present study, the level of international trade (LIT) and intra-industry trade (IIT) were considered as two globalization indices. Adding the two indices to the import demand functions of three categories of wood products (wood raw materials, semi-finished wood products, and finished wood products), the effect of the globalization of various wood products sectors on imports of related wood products was evaluated. The findings reveal significant relationships between the import of wood as raw material and the globalization indices of semi-finished wood products and finished wood products. The import of finished wood products was positively correlated with the IIT of semi-finished wood products. However, globalization indices had no impact on semi-finished wood products imports. Other results indicate that the three categories of wood products were significantly different in terms of the mean of globalization indices (p < 0.05). Compared to the other categories, finished wood products had the highest LIT and lowest IIT, suggesting a large amount of import-based trade of the given products relative to domestic production in Iran. Overall, semi-finished wood products and finished wood products were placed in a higher stage within the LIT-IIT framework, implying that these sectors in Iran are more globalized.","[Khosravi, Sheyda; Maleknia, Rahim; Adeli, Kamran] Lorestan Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Forestry, Khorramabad, Iran; [Mohseni, Reza] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Tehran, Iran; [Hodges, Donald G.] Univ Tennessee, Nat Resources Policy Ctr, Dept Forestry Wildlife & Fisheries, Knoxville, TN USA",Lorestan University; Shahid Beheshti University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture,"Maleknia, R (通讯作者)，Lorestan Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Forestry, Khorramabad, Iran.",maleknia.r@lu.ac.ir,,"Mohseni, Reza/0000-0002-6840-1869; Khosravi, Sheyda/0000-0002-4704-4364",Department of Forestry at Lorestan University in Iran,Department of Forestry at Lorestan University in Iran,This work was funded by the Department of Forestry at Lorestan University in Iran.

J,"Visser, D; van Vuuren, GW",,,,"Visser, Dirk; van Vuuren, Gary W.",,,Procyclicality in tradeable credit risk: Consequences for South Africa,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: Tradeable credit assets are vulnerable to two varieties of credit risk: default risk (which manifests itself as a binary outcome) and spread risk (which arises as spreads change continuously). Current (2017) regulatory credit risk rules require banks to hold capital for both these risks. Aggregating these capital amounts is non-trivial. Aim: The aim was to implement the bubble value at risk (buVaR) approach, proposed by Wong (2011) to overcome the risk aggregation problem. This method accounts for diversification and for procyclicality and operates by inflating the positive side of the underlying return distribution, in direct proportion to prevailing credit spread levels (usually liquid credit default swap spreads). Setting: The principal setting for the study was the South African credit market which represents a developing market. Previous work by Wong (2011) focussed only on developed markets. Methods: Using South African data, closed form solutions were derived for free parameters of Wong's formulation, and the relationship between the spread level and the response function was developed and calibrated. Results: The results indicate that the original calibrations and assumptions made by Wong (2011) would result in excessive capital requirement for South African banks. Estimates obtained from this work suggest further calibration is required to cover the unique features of the South African milieu. Considerable differences compared with other markets were also found. Conclusion: The application of buVaR to South African government bond credit default swaps spreads highlighted the metric's countercyclical properties that would potentially have countered bubble developments had they been implemented during the credit crisis of 2008/2009. Regulatory authorities should take this important metric into account when allocating South African bank's credit risk capital.","[Visser, Dirk; van Vuuren, Gary W.] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"van Vuuren, GW (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",vvgary@hotmail.com,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",,,,,28,0,0,0,4,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This paper examines the differing productivity growth paths of some 85 British cities since the beginning of the 1970s, and explores how far these paths reflect differences across cities in the pace and nature of structural change. We find that while northern cities led productivity growth over 1971-91 southern cities then led after 1991. However, at the same time, the rate of productivity growth slowed across almost all cities between these two periods. We find evidence of considerable structural convergence across cities and a general tendency for the degree of specialisation to fall. This then leads to a decomposition analysis which identifies the relative contribution of between-sector (structural change) and within-sector effects to city productivity growth. The analysis reveals that structural change - and especially the shift from manufacturing to services - has had a negative impact on productivity growth across all cities, but that within-sector productivity developments while positive and outweighing structural change effects, have also declined over the past 45 years, as well as varying across cities. These findings point to the need for further research on the causes of this slowdown in 'within-sector ` productivity growth and why those causes appear to differ from city to city. They also point to the need for a 'place-based' dimension to policies aimed at improving national productivity performance.","[Martin, Ron; Gardiner, Ben; Evenhuis, Emil] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Sunley, Peter] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Tyler, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University of Cambridge; University of Southampton; University of Cambridge,"Martin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",rlm1@cam.ac.uk,"Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023; Evenhuis, Emil/J-4659-2019","Evenhuis, Emil/0000-0001-8473-245X; SUNLEY, PETER/0000-0003-4803-5299",ESRC [ES/N006135/1]; ESRC [ES/N006135/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research for this article was undertaken as part of a project funded by the ESRC (ES/N006135/1) into Structural Transformation, Adaptability and City Economic Evolutions, as part of its Structural Transformations Programme.

Zimbabwe underwent a land reform incorporating new players in the pork agribusinesses, as well as indigenisation, altering agrobusiness decision-making structures. One such decision is effective pricing. Aim: The objective of the study was to highlight the determinants of utilising a particular pricing objective and price flexibility policy in the Zimbabwean pork industry. Setting: The study examined the pricing objectives and price flexibility policies of pig producers, pork abattoirs and butcheries in Mashonaland Central province, Zimbabwe. Methods: The study used a cross-sectional, descriptive and quantitative survey of pig producers, pork abattoirs and pork butcheries. A structured precoded questionnaire-based interview of 166 pig producers, 6 pork abattoirs and 24 butchers was used as the data collection tool and method. A logit model was used for analysis, ascertaining determinants of a binary choice model. Results: The study found that agribusinesses' pricing objectives were determined by the product portfolio, margin, merchandise handled, distance the furthest buyer travels and consideration of other industry players' pricing at the p < 0.01 level. Furthermore, factors such as seasonality in April to September sales, quality considerations (p < 0.05), frequency of retailers and size considerations (p < 0.1) were also significant determinants of pricing objectives. Also, the agribusinesses' price flexibility policies were shown to be determined by agribusiness location, average weight of merchandise, frequency of individual customers, size consideration and consideration of other industry players' pricing at the p < 0.01 level. In addition, margin, frequency of abattoir buyers (p < 0.05) as well as pork product portfolio (p < 0.1) were also observed to be major factors towards a flexible pricing policy. Conclusion: The results suggest that pork industry players in Zimbabwe are myopic in their pricing strategies, having factors such as product portfolio, margin, merchandise handled and considerations of other industry players' strategies as dualistically determining pricing objective and price flexibility policy utilised. The study recommends that pork industry players shift from myopic pricing objectives of profit and survival and devise new pricing strategies based on sales and competitive pricing. There is also need for less rigidity in flexible price policies to take advantage of the dynamic external environment.","[Ngarava, Saul; Mushunje, Abbyssinia] Univ Ft Hare, Fac Sci & Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Alice, South Africa",University of Fort Hare,"Ngarava, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ft Hare, Fac Sci & Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Alice, South Africa.",201501225@ufh.ac.za,"Ngarava, Saul/AAQ-2685-2020","Ngarava, Saul/0000-0002-8462-0287",,,,,61,4,4,0,4,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This development underscores the importance of a more fundamental challenge for transport planning: providing all persons with accessibility to key destinations, irrespective of the features of a person's body. The challenge is to move beyond the notion of universally accessible transport systems towards an inclusive transport system. Where the former focuses on adapting existing transport systems to the needs of persons with the widest possible range of abilities, the latter refers to the goal to provide all persons with access to a range of key destinations. This challenge requires not only the adaption of existing transport systems, but also the extension of those systems to provide travel-impaired persons and others with access to destinations. The aim of the paper is to develop a basic framework that can be helpful to set priorities towards the development of such an inclusive transport system. The framework distinguishes two principles for priority setting, one derived from the principle of welfare maximization and one conceptualizing the notion of hardship. Based on these two principles of priority setting, three different categories of measures to enhance accessibility for persons experiencing travel-related impairments are distinguished: (1) measures that live up to the principle of efficiency or welfare maximization; (2) measures that reduce transport related hardship through adaptation or extension of the mainstream transport system; and (3) measures that reduce transport-related hardship through dedicated services for persons with travel impairments. The proposed framework requires changes in the practice of cost-benefit analysis, as well as a clear delineation of a hardship threshold. The latter is considered essential to make the transport problems experienced by persons with travel impairments visible to the public eye.","[Martens, Karel] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Amado Bldg, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Martens, Karel] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Martens, K (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Amado Bldg, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",cjcmmartens@gmail.com,"Martens, Karel/G-5988-2011","Martens, Karel/0000-0002-5690-0556",,,,,69,23,24,1,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Within a real-world Delphi study, experts were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: either their initial ratings were included in feedback (IN) or excluded from feedback (EX). Results showed that experts in the EX condition changed their opinion relatively more often than experts in the IN condition. Results also suggested that experts in the EX condition changed their ratings to a greater degree towards the group response than experts in the IN condition.

This is important in the context of various regulatory reforms that are being considered at present. Aim: The aim is to provide an updated analysis and description of the drivers of medical scheme expenditure on private hospitals in South Africa. Setting: Private hospital market, South Africa. Methods: Data from the three largest private hospital groups - which account for approximately 70% of the South African private hospital market share - are collected, aggregated and analysed. This study uses targeted descriptive and exploratory analyses, relying on a residual approach to hospital expenditure. Results: It is found that over time medical scheme beneficiaries, on average, are being admitted to private hospitals more frequently, as well as staying in hospital for longer during each admission. The data also indicate that over time older people are being admitted to hospital more often. Conclusion: This study's findings contradict previous assertions that it is only prices driving increased medical scheme expenditure on private hospitals.","[Erasmus, Marine; Kean, Helen] Econex, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Erasmus, Marine] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Erasmus, M (通讯作者)，Econex, Stellenbosch, South Africa.;Erasmus, M (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",marine@econex.co.za,,,Hospital Association of South Africa (HASA),Hospital Association of South Africa (HASA),This work has been commissioned and paid for by the Hospital Association of South Africa (HASA).,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

However, a large body of empirical research has shown that an increase in unemployment may increase or decrease crime. By incorporating the return to crime into standard economic models, this paper shows that an increase in unemployment, as in recessions, decreases the opportunity cost of crime and the return to crime as well. As a result, the effect of unemployment on crime is ambiguous and depends on the apprehension rate. An increase in the unemployment rate tends to decrease the crime rate at lower apprehension rates, but to increase it at higher apprehension rates. An increase in the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits does not necessarily reduce the crime rate, and the effect of more generous unemployment insurance on crime depends again on the apprehension rate.","[Lee, Kangoh] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",klee@mail.sdsu.edu,,,College of Arts and Letters at San Diego State University,College of Arts and Letters at San Diego State University,"I am grateful to Jan Brueckner, Ming-Jen Lin, and seminar participants at the University of California at Irvine for their helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.

By bringing cities and regions closer together it is argued that economies can benefit from lower generalised costs of transport leading to enhanced growth and productivity. A counter argument is that such effects are largely redistributive with some regions benefiting and others suffering depending on their ability to take advantage of new opportunities. However, some argue further than this and claim that such step changes in transport provision can lead to major changes in economic structure that can transform regions' absolute as well as relative position and thus redress the existence of regional disparities. In this paper, we address the question as to whether there is a clear and robust economic theory of the transformational impact of high-speed rail and if there is any consistent evidence to support it? The paper uses evidence from the North-west European High-Speed Rail network and a more detailed study of the UK's first highspeed line, HS1. This is followed by a discussion of the various claims and counter-claims for the impact of the proposed HS2 that will link London with Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. On the basis of this some of the implications for the appraisal of such projects are considered. The main conclusion from the paper is that transport infrastructure by itself is not likely to be transformative, but coupled with other policy interventions it can contribute to such an effect.","[Vickerman, Roger] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Vickerman, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",r.w.vickerman@kent.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,118,125,15,212,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Then, using annual data ranging from 1998 to 2014 for 20 European countries, a three-fold analysis was performed as to unveil complementary statistical links between immigrants' inflow and several financial sector specific indicators. The analysis comprehensively considered the main components of the financial sector, namely the banking sector, the insurance one, the capital market and private pensions. First we relied on the correlation and causality approach, complemented by the use of a panel regression with fixed effects. According to the country by country investigation, the information provided by the descriptive statistics, by the causality test and by the size of the fixed effects estimated through panel regressions shows that Germany clearly detaches itself among the other European countries considered. This most wanted destination among European countries and the second most preferred in the world, records the most pronounced and persistent influence of the number of immigrants on several financial sector features. From the standpoint of the financial sector, the most influenced by immigrants' inflow, it has been found that bank specific variables are on the top. This result confirms both economic intuition and practice, because immigrants are more prone to use basic banking services rather than invest on the capital market or sign life and non-life insurance contracts.","[Barbu, Teodora Cristina; Boitan, Iustina Alina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Finance & Banking, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Barbu, TC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Finance & Banking, Bucharest, Romania.",teodorabarbu65@yahoo.com; iustinaboitan@yahoo.com,"Boitan, Iustina Alina/AAY-4762-2020; boitan, iustina a/A-2326-2015; Barbu, Teodora - Cristina/ABF-7225-2020","Boitan, Iustina Alina/0000-0001-6510-5063; Barbu, Teodora - Cristina/0000-0003-3575-1712; Barbu, Teodora Cristina/0000-0003-0064-962X",,,,,28,2,2,1,5,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Empirical evidence has been mixed, and there remain gaps in the literature. The majority of FDI has been directed at developed countries. Single-country studies are needed, due to the heterogeneous relationship between FDI and growth, and because the impact of FDI on growth is said to be largest in open, advanced developed countries with an educated workforce and developed financial markets (although research has focused on developing countries). We fill these gaps with an improved empirical methodology to check whether FDI has enhanced growth in Spain, one of the largest receivers of FDI, whose gross domestic product growth was above average but has escaped scrutiny. During the observation period 1984-2010, FDI rose significantly, and Spain offered ideal conditions for FDI to unfold its hypothesized positive effects on growth. We run a horse race between various potential explanatory variables, including the neglected role of bank credit for the real economy. The results are robust and clear: The favorable Spanish circumstances yield no evidence for FDI to stimulate economic growth. The Spanish EU and euro entry are also found to have had no positive effect on growth. The findings call for a fundamental rethinking of methodology in economics.","[Bermejo Carbonell, Jorge] Comillas Pontifical Univ, ICADE Business Sch, Madrid 28008, Spain; [Werner, Richard A.] Univ Southampton, Ctr Banking Finance & Sustainable Dev, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Comillas Pontifical University; University of Southampton; Solent University,"Carbonell, JB (通讯作者)，Comillas Pontifical Univ, ICADE Business Sch, Madrid 28008, Spain.",bermejo14@hotmail.com; werner@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,137,102,108,2,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

However, the question of why the value of an asset may be below its market price economists usually redirect to philosophers. If the cost is a synonym for the market price of the sale, the best indicator of the company's value will be the aggregate price at which its own capital and debts are sold on the financial market.

First, its fuzzy format reflect key issues of global economic governance such as trade and investment liberalization, monetary integration and mobility in education. Secondly, the BRI' s novel hybrid character includes both integration process and development institution features. Thirdly, a new quality and unprecedented scale of ambitions of the fifth generation of the China's leaders is reflected in the BRI infrastructural component consisting of several routes from the China's western regions towards the centers of economic activity in Europe and South Asia as well as by the disclaimed volume of financial resources corresponds to the tasks and the funds of the leading world development institutes. Fourthly, hence a qualitatively new China's presence in some Eurasian macroregions will cause a revision of the existing system of trade and investment interests, Russia may cooperate with China for the common benefit of economic development and security, since the initiative's success can have a positive impact on improving the quality of life and economic conditions of the Eurasian population.","[Gorbunova, Mariia L.; Livanova, Elena Yu.] Natl Res Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhni Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Dept World Econ & Reg Markets, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia; [Komarov, Igor D.] Natl Res Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhni Novgorod, Inst Int Relat & World Hist, Ctr Expertise & Comprehens Anal, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia; [Komarova, Tatiana D.] Natl Res Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhni Novgorod, Inst Int Relat & World Hist, Dept Orient Languages & Language Cultural Sci, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia",Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Gorbunova, ML (通讯作者)，Natl Res Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhni Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Dept World Econ & Reg Markets, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia.",gorbunova@iee.unn.ru; igor.komarof@gmail.com; komarova.ya@gmail.com; elli1@bk.ru,"Komarov, Igor/AAG-2266-2020; Gorbunova, Mariia/H-1580-2018","Gorbunova, Mariia/0000-0003-2733-568X",,,,,20,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6245,6253,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207022,0

Drawing on the emerging dialogue between cultural economy and heterodox political economy approaches to money and finance, the article argues that a focus on regulation provides a valuable way of developing new understandings of the geographies of market making beyond cultural economy's extant reading of space as context, particularly in the form of the financial trading room. Through an original case study of the making of offshore renminbi markets in London's financial district, the analysis conceptualizes regulation as both a hitherto overlooked relational component of market making and as a set of practices that coconstitute the territoriality of markets. I demonstrate how regulatory changes made in Beijing and London are important in understanding both the growth and potential limitations of London as an offshore renminbi center. This has significant implications empirically, for the wider project of renminbi internationalization, and theoretically, in terms of understanding the geographies of market making.","[Hall, Sarah] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Hall, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",Sarah.hall@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Hall, sarah/0000-0001-5563-5909",British Academy [MD130065],British Academy,"I am grateful to those interviewed for sharing their insights on RMB internationalization.

It offers a comparison of the premium calculation using mortality rates published on the web site of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic and a smoothing mortality rates method based on so-called mixture functions. Mixture functions represent a special class of weighted average functions, where weights are determined by continuous weighting functions, which are dependent on a quotient of the original data of a number of deaths and a number of living. The advantages of this method are that the weights of the input values depend on ourselves and hence coefficients of weighted functions can be changed each year for minimization of mean square error. The effect of our method is particularly clear for single premiums in both cases. This method gives a lower probability of death, hence it can be used as a risk loading of mortality.","[Hudec, Samuel] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Gubalova, Jolana; Medved'ova, Petra; Spirkova, Jana] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Hudec, S (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",samuel.hudec@umb.sk; jolana.gubalova@umb.sk; petra.medvedova@umb.sk; jana.spirkova@umb.sk,"Špirková, Jana/ACA-8522-2022; Medveďová, Petra/HKW-5154-2023; Gubalova, Jolana/AAQ-4947-2021","Špirková, Jana/0000-0001-5864-9353; Gubalova, Jolana/0000-0003-4901-9207",Slovak Scientific Grant Agency VEGA [1/0093/17],Slovak Scientific Grant Agency VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"Samuel Hudec, Petra Medved'ova and Jana Spirkova have been supported by the Slovak Scientific Grant Agency VEGA NO. 1/0093/17 Identification of risk factors and their impact on products of the insurance and saving schemes.",,12,0,0,0,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2281-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,119,128,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2HN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505804100011,0

Thereby, not only intellectual property rights, but also different informal appropriation mechanisms are analysed. The special attention is paid to interactions among various appropriation methods. For the empirical testing, a large dataset is employed. The sample of innovation active firms used in this analysis includes 2960 entities that were engaged in developing and/or implementing a product or process innovation in the years 2010-2012. The results show that firms in the sample indicate high effectiveness of informal appropriation methods while at the same time assessing formal appropriation methods as being of low effectiveness. Moreover, it appears that formal methods vary together. A similar situation holds for informal methods. The findings give evidence that the choice and effectiveness of the appropriation strategies were affected by the firm's size, the type of innovation and the sector to which firms belonged.","[Kijek, Tomasz] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Kijek, T (通讯作者)，Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Lublin, Poland.",tomasz.kijek@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,"Kijek, Tomasz/U-2584-2018","Kijek, Tomasz/0000-0002-0134-4943",Polish National Science Centre [DEC 2013/09/D/HS4/01139],Polish National Science Centre,The project was financed by Polish National Science Centre on the basis of decision number DEC 2013/09/D/HS4/01139.,,23,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68285-3; 978-3-319-68284-6,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,89,98,,10.1007/978-3-319-68285-3_8,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1XS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448589400008,0

The paper focuses on the study of a phenomenon that, unlike other environmental factors, has a cyclical character, and its behavioural patterns can be predicted as they were scientifically researched and documented. This phenomenon is the economic cycle and is examined in the context of its impact on HRM practices. The study examines whether it is possible to include in the HR management practices a formula reflecting the individual phases of the economic cycle. When asked whether there are individual practices or sets of practices that HR managers should apply at specific phases of the economic cycle, the author analyses behaviour of selected macroeconomic factors in three successive economic cycles and define their impact on applied HRM practices.","[Letkova, Natalia] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Studentska 3, Trencin 91150, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Letková, N (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Studentska 3, Trencin 91150, Slovakia.",natalia.letkova@tnuni.sk,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2281-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,205,214,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2HN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505804100019,0

We used a qualitative research approach based on trends, which are increasing, constant or decreasing. Firstly, we identified key variables influencing IPO timing, which have sufficient support in the relevant IPO academic literature, e.g. GDP growth rates, level of compliance, stock market returns, etc. Next, a qualitative model working with 9 variables was developed. The result is represented by 19 scenarios and their qualitative solutions. The transitional graph represents all possible transitions among the 19 scenarios. The main message of the findings presented is what scenarios can occur and what actions might be implemented by CFOs in order to increase the chances of IPO success.

The main objective of this paper is to compare methodological approaches for data reporting in the conditions of the Czech insurance market, where the Czech National Bank, the Czech Statistical Office and the Czech Insurance Association represent significant statistical sources. The results show that the approaches of these three institutions are not exactly the same, with the largest difference being observed in the Czech Insurance Association. The second objective of the paper is to assess and comment on the choice of indicators for specific analyses within the Czech insurance market. As regards the choice of indicators, it is necessary to take into account the nature of the insurance product, among others the question how long the indemnity is going to be paid out and whether it is possible to determine the total amount of the loss at the very beginning of the claim adjustment. Therefore, it is necessary to differentiate between property insurance and liability insurance. The methods of description, analysis and comparison have been used in this paper.","[Necas, Svatopluk] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Necas, S (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Brno, Czech Republic.",necas@econ.muni.cz,"Necas, Svatopluk/B-1264-2015","Necas, Svatopluk/0000-0002-5997-3021",,,,,22,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6901,6906,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207087,0

The research group consisted of 151 respondents - students of military study programs at the beginning of their careers. In the mixed design of the research, the PVQ inventory of S. Schwartz's value profiles was used in an abridged version of 21 questions, and the authors created a variation for a professional-oriented situation (ATMoD) with a focus on higher order values. For each attitude identify by ATMoD, respondents were asked to give their reasons in writing. Responses were evaluated using the grounded theory with the intent to identify spontaneous of professional values. After performing ATMoD it was found that the conservative value orientation in the whole set slightly strengthened and each of the value profiles changed, some strengthened, some weakened. Significant identification with value profiles containing the basic values of the military profession - conservatism and self-transcendence have been found.","[Nekvapilova, Ivana; Mikulka, Zdenek; Fedorkova, Jolana] Univ Def, Brno, Czech Republic",University of Defence - Czech Republic,"Nekvapilová, I (通讯作者)，Univ Def, Brno, Czech Republic.",ivana.nekvapilova@unob.cz; zdenek.mikulka@unob.cz; jolana.fedorkova@unob.cz,"Nekvapilova, Ivana/AAW-5551-2021; Mikulka, Zdenek/AAC-3047-2020","Nekvapilova, Ivana/0000-0002-9643-6284; Mikulka, Zdenek/0000-0002-5427-3640",,,,,22,1,1,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,3400,3409,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525490800053,0

In order to solve this problem, new devices, therapies and systems for wrist rehabilitation have been developed. These mainly consist of virtual reality therapies, exoskeletons, gloves and vibratory therapies. The performed analysis showed that an ideal wrist rehabilitation device does not exist, but many devices complement each other and provide a good therapy. Recently it has been indicated vibratory therapies to aid the rehabilitation of traumatic injuries. These have shown very positive effects, even in the wrist rehabilitation.

The covered period of data panel was between 2000 and 2016. Following the viewpoint of firm characteristics, we employed variables based on financial statements (such as profitability, asset's composition, indebtedness, liquidity, as well as firm-level controls in terms of firm size and statutory rate). Be estimating several econometric models via the method of generalized least squares, the empirical results generally provide support for positive relations between profitability (as measured by return on equity and return on assets), assets' composition (captured by equity multiplier, capital intensity, inventory intensity), liquidity (specifically current liquidity), and statutory rates. Indebtedness proxies (in form of long term debt to assets ratio and debt to equity ratio) revealed a mixed relationship with corporate taxation, but overall indebted companies show higher levels of effective tax rates over long time. As policy implication, the empirical outcome supports the political cost theory in case of the investigated former communist Eastern European Markets.","[Onofrei, Mihaela; Oprea, Florin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance Money & Publ Adm, 22 Carol I Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Vintila, Georgeta; Gherghina, Stefan Cristian; Paunescu, Radu Alin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Finance Insurance Banking & Stock Exchange, Dept Finance, 6 Romana Sq, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Onofrei, M (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance Money & Publ Adm, 22 Carol I Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania.",onofrei@uaic.ro; vintilageorgeta@yahoo.fr; stefan.gherghina@fin.ase.ro; radupaunescu696@gmail.com; foprea@uaic.ro,"Onofrei, Mihaela/K-3668-2015; Vintila, Georgeta/C-4935-2011; Vintila, Georgeta/AAY-8162-2021; Paunescu, Radu Alin/C-2011-2016; Gherghina, Ştefan Cristian/J-3339-2012","Vintila, Georgeta/0000-0002-0342-9246; Vintila, Georgeta/0000-0002-0342-9246; Gherghina, Ştefan Cristian/0000-0003-2911-6480",,,,,58,2,2,0,10,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The paper concludes with a vision for modern intercultural courses in universities. The paper also suggests that our cosmopolitan society needs a unifying discipline leading us to mutual understanding and inevitable dialogue. Therefore, we need such a discipline which can help us to eradicate xenophobia or racism, a discipline which can move us towards multicultural society.

In Romania, public administration could be considered a feminine field of working, but it is not enough for women to hold positions from executive level. In order to have power and to play a role in an administrative reform, women must be well represented on high management positions in public institutions.

The data has been collected from the National Agency of Civil Servants and from the European Institute for Gender Equality. The gender equality problem was approached by analyzing the evolution of the number of women in leading positions and their proportion on the whole number of senior civil servants. The study has revealed that women's access on positions with power of decision in central administration institutions has been guaranteed and from this point of view, in this sector, women did not face discrimination.

The main purpose of this article is to assess the impact of the international trade in agricultural products on the economic growth of EU28. The results of the correlation and regression analyses have revealed that the international trade in agricultural products (in particular, section I and III products) contributes only insignificant part, to the economic growth of EU28 through the following indicators: GDP in market prices, self-employment, employment in the agricultural sector, labour force rate, subsidies and other transfers. The results have also disclosed that while analysing the impact of the international trade in agricultural products on economic growth, there is no necessity to research export and import volumes in separate as agricultural export and import show nearly the same (only with insignificant value differences) determinants of economic growth promotion. Another important conclusion is that the international trade in agricultural products mainly comprises the trade in live animals and animal products (meat and edible meat offal, fish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates, dairy produce, birds' eggs, natural honey, edible products of animal origin, not elsewhere specified or included, and products of animal origin, not elsewhere specified or included) as well as animal or vegetable fats and oils and their cleavage products, prepared edible fats, and animal or vegetable waxes.","[Remeikiene, Rita; Gaspareniene, Ligita] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Rozsa, Zoltan] Sch Econ & Management Publ Adm, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Pencik, Jan] Brno Univ Technol, Brno, Czech Republic",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Brno University of Technology,"Remeikiene, R (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",rita.remeikiene@laei.lt; zoltan@rozsa.sk; ligita.gaspareniene@laei.lt; pencik.j@fce.vutbr.cz,"Rózsa, Zoltán/GZK-6056-2022; Pěnčík, Jan/AAD-6995-2019; Rozsa, Zoltan/E-1043-2013","Pěnčík, Jan/0000-0002-2295-0088; Rozsa, Zoltan/0000-0002-5748-5702; Remeikiene, Rita/0000-0002-3369-485X",,,,,37,2,2,7,49,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

However, the external factors only inflation has a significant and positive effect, while GDP has a negatif and significant effect on banks profitability.

Although there are various sets of financial reporting standards, in all of them it is possible to recognize the same or very similar rules of measurement and valuation of assets and liabilities. The cost model usually comes with the possibility of applying the fair value model. It is to be expected that asset valuation at a fair value model require disproportional administrative and financial burden for smaller enterprises since they often lack staffing or financial capacity to apply it. The purpose of this study is to explore whether there is a real practical need for applying the fair value model in the financial reporting of small Croatian enterprises. In order to analyze whether Croatian small manufacturing enterprises use the revaluation model as a method of measurement of long-term tangible assets after initial recognition, an empirical research has been taken. The main field of the research is related to recognition and measurement models, accounting estimates of the useful life of assets, depreciation methods, and rates used. Research results indicate that the majority of enterprises taken into research sample use the cost model for the measurement of intangible assets after initial recognition, while those that use the revaluation model use it mostly for the properties, while the other tangible assets measure at the cost model.","[Tusek, Boris; Decman, Nikolina; Rep, Ana] Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Tusek, B (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",btusek@efzg.hr; ndecman@efzg.hr; arep@efzg.hr,"Rep, Ana/H-7980-2018; Dečman, Nikolina/P-9200-2019; Tusek, Boris/H-9445-2018","Rep, Ana/0000-0003-0769-6656; Dečman, Nikolina/0000-0001-5167-4070;",University of Zagreb,University of Zagreb,This paper is the result of a project called Current state and perspectives of using the fair value measurement in financial reporting of small enterprises which was financed by the University of Zagreb as short-term research support for 2018.,,13,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1461,1474,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202049,0

The second is the data analysis on customer behavior, for example analysis of marketing campaigns, searching for new sales opportunities, prediction of customer behavior - sometimes called Analytical CRM, and the third is the communication with the customer through various communication channels, optimizing this communication, sharing of customer information within the company - called the Collaborative CRM. An effective CRM is a strategic necessity for growth and survival in all corporate spheres.

In addition to being a simple and fast manufacturing process, this technology also allows engineers to overcome certain design difficulties in just a few hours, in comparison with traditional methods which would take up to several weeks. AM facilitates production of products using less material, maintaining the performance and quality factors. Many of the cost studies involve a scenario where a workpiece is repeatedly manufactured. However, one of the advantages of additive production is the ability to simultaneously produce different components. The current study proposes a cost analysis for two AM processes undertaken for a medical device prototype. Economic analysis for the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) case study included a sensitivity analysis based on the variation of two output printing parameters in relation to the used support structure. Six types of support structures were used for the analysis and three degrees of infill for each specific pattern. The Digital Light Processing (DLP) economic analysis included a standard support structure and a conventional orientation on the build plate. Based on the conducted study, the medical device prototype was found to be 6.56 times more expensive to print with DLP than with FDM. Regardless of the degree of filling, the mass of the prototype remained unchanged and the time varied. The increase in time is justified by the increase of the auxiliary times, namely the time when the print head moves depending on the complexity of the infill pattern. Thus, for the same component of the medical device prototype an increased cost was directly proportional to the printing time.","[Ulmeanu, Mihaela-Elena; Doicin, Cristian-Vasile; Murzac, Roman; Alexandru, Iulia-Damiana; Salvan, Mirela-Sanda] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Ulmeanu, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaela.ulmeanu@upb.ro; cristian.doicin@upb.ro; roman.murzac@upb.ro; damiana.alexandru@yahoo.com; mirelasalvan@yahoo.com,"Ulmeanu, Mihaela Elena/AAR-4126-2021; Doicin, Cristian/AAN-1420-2020","Ulmeanu, Mihaela Elena/0000-0002-6620-7122;","University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, through the Excellence Research Grants Program, UPB - GEX 2017 [UPB- GEX2017, 50/2017]","University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, through the Excellence Research Grants Program, UPB - GEX 2017","This work has been funded by University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, through the Excellence Research Grants Program, UPB - GEX 2017, Identifier: UPB- GEX2017, Ctr.

This study aims to recognize the key influencing factors of technological innovation of entrepreneurial firms and distinguish structural differences between different-sized firms in terms of influencing mechanism during institutional transition. This study used sample data of 120 listed companies in China's growth enterprise market (GEM) from 2010 to 2016. This study then analysed the state capture behaviours of China's local government and their impact on the technological innovation of entrepreneurial firms using panel regression. Results show that the charitable donations of entrepreneurial firms are significantly and negatively correlated with fiscal subsidies. This finding indirectly suggests that local governments are captured by entrepreneurial firms under the driving mechanism of legal achievements in official career. Fiscal subsidies and organizational slack of captor firms play significantly positive interaction effect on technological innovation. Compared with large-sized firms, small-sized entrepreneurial firms mainly depend on organizational slack for technological innovation. The buffering powers of small firms against significant environmental changes are weakened to a certain extent. Therefore, the fiscal subsidy policies of entrepreneurial firms should be an important instrument that should be implemented by the Chinese government over a long period. In terms of selection of objects of fiscal subsidies, the local government should favour small-sized firms to facilitate sustainable development.","[Zhou, Chunmei] Huaqiao Univ, Coll Tourism, 269 Chenghua North Rd, Quanzhou 362021, Peoples R China",Huaqiao University,"Zhou, CM (通讯作者)，Huaqiao Univ, Coll Tourism, 269 Chenghua North Rd, Quanzhou 362021, Peoples R China.",linglinghb@163.com,,,Tourism Young Expert Training Program of China National Tourism Administration [TYETP201536],Tourism Young Expert Training Program of China National Tourism Administration,This study was supported by Tourism Young Expert Training Program of China National Tourism Administration (Grant No. TYETP201536).,,46,10,10,0,18,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The simulation model of management and the mechanism for developing, formalizing and implementing strategic decisions of the company's management were used in the practice of gold mining companies in Eastern Siberia, Yakutia, which allowed to adapt the company's data to changes in the market environment and improve financial and economic stability.","[Zhuravlyov, Vladimir V.; Varkova, Natalia Y.; Khudyakova, Tatyana A.; Aliukov, Sergei V.] South Ural State Univ, Chelyabinsk, Russia",South Ural State University,"Zhuravlyov, VV (通讯作者)，South Ural State Univ, Chelyabinsk, Russia.",zhur.65@mail.ru; varkovan80@mail.ru; khudiakovata@susu.ru; alysergey@gmail.com,"Khudyakova, Tatyana/ABD-1482-2021; Khudyakova, Tatyana/AAO-8485-2021; Aliukov, Sergei/HKM-7877-2023","Khudyakova, Tatyana/0000-0001-5397-0498;","Government of the Russian Federation [02, A03.21.0011]; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [26.9677.2017/(sic)]","Government of the Russian Federation; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","The work was supported by the Government of the Russian Federation (Resolution No 211 of 16 March 2013), contract No 02.A03.21.0011.; South Ural State University expresses gratitude for financial support to the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (grant No 26.9677.2017/(sic)).",,25,1,1,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,550,561,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553201006,0

Despite the great interest in the subject of knowledge, is still a lack of clear, unified foundations in knowledge management, especially in small manufacturing enterprises. The authors of the study attempt to analyze the process of knowledge management at the operational level in a manufacturing enterprise using innovative additive technologies (AM). Despite the fact that AM technology has been known since the 1980s, there is a lack of research and development on knowledge management in such a specific, ever-growing productive branch. The dynamic development of this technology makes that knowledge in such enterprises is usually individualized and difficult to specify. The research will be described in the form of a case study. The aim of the article is the analysis of the process of knowledge management at the operational level in the manufacturing enterprise of high-tech sector, which produces parts using additive technology (AM). The results were collected based on a series of interviews with employees at various levels of the company and own observations. They suggest that knowledge management in an enterprise is currently not possible without significant cultural, organizational and technological changes. Employees lack motivation and a 'good example' from project managers. In addition, the company does not have any system for collecting, storing and transferring already acquired knowledge. The study provided implications for researchers and practitioners of knowledge management.","[Zimmer, Joanna] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Management, Wroclaw, Poland; [Madeja, Marcin] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology; Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Zimmer, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Management, Wroclaw, Poland.",joanna.zimmer@pwr.edu.pl; marcin.madeja@pwr.edu.pl,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2456,2469,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203051,0

The paper assesses how firms' absorptive capacity mediates the impact of global value chains on the innovation of handicraft exports in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The study draws three conclusions. First, the incremental innovation of craft exporters demands specific but rather mundane absorptive capacities of firms, such as language abilities and capable departments. Second, and contrary to what might be expected, the study finds that the governance modes of global value chains do not significantly affect the level of innovation. Third, a group of traders have the highest level of innovation, the highest level of absorptive capacity, and they positively affect the innovation of suppliers. Overall, the findings show that knowledge diffusion is furthered within an emerging local innovation system.","[Fransen, Jan] Erasmus Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies IHS, POB 1935, NL-3000 BX Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Helmsing, A.

Socioeconomic and mobility differences among zero-car households,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Car-free; Car-less; Mobility; Car ownership; Carsharing,WELFARE-TO-WORK; TRAVEL; OWNERSHIP; EMPLOYMENT; RECIPIENTS; PATTERNS; OUTCOMES; ACCESS,"Transportation professionals have long identified the important division between choice and constraint in modal decision-making. However, while heterogeneity within some modal groups such as transit riders is well documented, intragroup differences in other groups have been largely ignored. In particular, significant heterogeneity exists among zero-car households, who may not own a car due to choice (car-free) or constraint (car-less). Recognition of intragroup heterogeneity among zero-car households yields policy implications as cities consider where to invest their ever more precious and more limited transportation resources. Using activity diary data from the 2012 California Household Travel Survey, I investigate two research questions: first, how do car-less households compare to car-free households in terms of both their socioeconomic characteristics and their relative share of zero-car households? Second, how do motivations behind not owning a car translate into mobility differences - including daily trip counts and miles traveled? I find that, contrary to media reports that the number of car-free households that is, households that choose not to own a car is booming, 79 percent of zero-car households do not own a car because of economic or physical constraints. Car-less households in many ways mirror the captive transit population, in that they have significantly lower household incomes, lower educational attainments, and are disproportionately non-white compared to car-free households. Observed socioeconomic variations translate into mobility differences, with car-free travelers taking more trips and traveling more miles per day. Policy makers should consider extending access to carshare services, which are positively associated with more trips and miles traveled among both car-free and car-less households.","[Brown, Anne E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Transportat Studies, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, 3250 Sch Publ Affairs Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Brown, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Transportat Studies, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, 3250 Sch Publ Affairs Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",aebrown0316@ucla.edu,,"Brown, Anne/0000-0001-5009-8331",,,,,43,72,82,8,70,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Banks' interventions have a significantly negative effect on the quantity of innovations but no significant effect on their quality. The reduction in quantity is concentrated in innovations that are unrelated to the violating firm's core business, which leads to a more-focused scope of investment in innovation and ultimately an increase in the firm's value. Human capital redeployment appears to be a plausible underlying mechanism through which banks' interventions refocus the scope of innovation and enhance a firm's value.

However, small concessions can be awarded by means of a negotiated procedure. This paper seeks to evaluate the performance of urban bus operators in small- and medium-sized municipalities according to their prevailing contractual regimes. Three types of procurement procedure are analyzed: competitive tendering, negotiated contracts and contracts negotiated indirectly with the interurban bus provider. A translog stochastic cost frontier is conducted using a panel dataset (312 observations) over a nine-year period from 2007 to 2015 for the municipalities of the Barcelona province. In line with recent empirical evidence, we find no cost differences between the three contractual procedures. However, cost inefficiencies emerge in relation to the size of the municipality: the smaller the municipality, the greater the inefficiencies. As for ownership, there are no performance differences between private and other forms of delivery. Economies of density are no longer apparent at annual provisions above 300,000 vehicle-kilometers or in municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants. Therefore, the non-tendering option, as provided for under European Regulations for small concessions, gives the same results as that found for competitive tendering and indirectly negotiated procedures.","[Rosell, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, GiM IREA, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Rosell, Jordi] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Tecnocampus, Escola Super Ciencies Socials & Empresa, C Ernest Lluch 32, Barcelona 08302, Spain",University of Barcelona; Pompeu Fabra University,"Rosell, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, GiM IREA, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Rosell, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Tecnocampus, Escola Super Ciencies Socials & Empresa, C Ernest Lluch 32, Barcelona 08302, Spain.",jrosell@ub.edu,"Rosell, Jordi/H-9068-2015","Rosell, Jordi/0000-0002-9715-7228",,,,,42,6,6,0,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Focusing on two innovations, electric vehicles and car clubs, the study investigates how people, behaviour and mobility are imagined in a range of visioning documents about the future up to 2050, a timeline that is critically important for emission reduction targets. We find that people are imagined primarily as consumers in line with the rational actor paradigm, with many visions focusing on low carbon vehicles as a sustainability solution. This simple technological substitution vision does not play to the strengths of electric vehicles, and diminishes their transformative potential. There are fewer car club visions; these show less car ownership, but retain high mobility and an economic growth perspective. Our findings support the idea that much future mobility visioning is used to support the status quo, rather than to explore a variety of futures with diverse portrayal of people, behaviour and mobility.","[Bergman, Noam; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Schwanen, Tim] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Transport Studies Unit, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Birk Ctr Pk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark",University of Sussex; University of Oxford; Aarhus University,"Bergman, N (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",n.bergman@sussex.ac.uk,"Schwanen, Tim/ABE-6070-2021; Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Programme [EP/K011790/1]; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude [4182-00033B]; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Programme; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The comments from two peer reviewers and the editor on an earlier version of this manuscript are gratefully acknowledged.

This paper uses state-of-the-art dynamic factor models (DFMs) to nowcast real GDP growth for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Mexico (BRIC+M). The DFM framework is particularly suitable for EMEs, as it enables the efficient handling of data series that are characterized by different publication lags, frequencies, and sample lengths. It also allows the extraction of model-based news from a data release and the assessment of the impact of such news on nowcast revisions. Overall, we find that the DFMs generally display a good directional accuracy and provide reliable nowcasts for GDP growth.

We estimate the BRT approach on German data and study the relative importance of the indicators and their marginal effects on the probability of a recession. Our results show that measures of the short-term interest rate and the term spread are important leading indicators. The recession probability is a nonlinear function of these leading indicators. The BRT approach also helps to uncover the way in which the recession probability depends on the interactions between the leading indicators. While the predictive power of the short-term interest rates has declined over time, the term spread and the stock market have gained in importance. The BRT approach shows a better out-of-sample performance than popular probit approaches.

We analyse national-level government documents across the EU, Norway and Switzerland to determine how far they address each quality and conclude that disproportionate emphasis is currently being placed on the tangible and easily understood aspects of safety, barrier freedom and affordability.

Yet, in comparison to majority or plurality voting, we know very little about its effectiveness. Even though cumulative voting is allowed in most jurisdictions, in practice it is not widely used. Taiwan stands out as a unique jurisdiction which mandates cumulative voting on all companies. Therefore, Taiwan is the only jurisdiction, to the best of our knowledge, that can be used to test the causal effect of cumulative voting on director election. Taking advantage of an exogenous legal change that occurred in Taiwanese corporate law in December 2011, we use panel data on 640 publicly traded companies from 2009 to 2015 in a difference-in-differences framework to tease out the effect of cumulative voting. From 2001 to 2011, cumulative voting was the default rule, and 20 companies opted for majority voting. While directors and supervisors are elected every three years, not all companies change boards in the same year. Fixed-effect panel regression models show that in the 2012 election about six months after the legal reform the cumulative voting rule appears to have weakened the controlling shareholders' control of the companies that had previously opted for majority voting. The controlling shareholders' control in the 2013, 2014, and 2015 elections, however, did not decrease. The take-away lesson is that mandating cumulative voting may not create a long-term effect because controlling shareholders find other means to maintain influence. Policymakers should leave the governance decisions to the firm and focus on rules that could restrain private benefits of control and enhance transparency to rein in controlling shareholders.

All the same, researchers have rarely described business model components relevant to city logistics. In response, the purpose of this article is to analyse critical factors for viable business models of city logistics initiatives involving UCCs. Following an extensive literature review and multiple-case study of five initiatives with UCCs, we identified seven critical factors of viable city logistics business models: the ability to scale up and down the UCC solution; an ability to continuously develop and adapt to a dynamic environment; the important entrepreneurial role of the initiator as well; the acknowledgment of society; ability to innovate new services; logistics and supply chain management competence; and the ability to take full advantage of advanced IT. All seven factors describe continuously redeveloped business models seeking to seize new and unexpected opportunities, yet also indicate that city logistics systems require local authorities and municipalities to act as initiators, enablers, and customers. The models also underscore differences between purely commercial and purely municipal city logistics initiatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Control and environmental variables are incorporated to capture heterogeneity in China's forestry industry, which helps us get an unbiased estimation. The empirical results show that there was no obvious efficiency disparity among China's economic regions except Northeastern China, and the state-owned forestry structure has a significantly negative effect on productive efficiency in China's forestry industry. Moreover, provinces with poor productive performance in the forestry industry such as Inner-Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and Hebei have been identified and their individual characteristics regarding productive efficiency have also been analyzed.

The analysis is based on a forecast of the entire Danish economy made using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model with overlapping generations. We present life cycle estimates of the potential fiscal impact of immigration considering the cost of immigration on the margin as well as on average. The main conclusion is that immigrants from Western countries have a positive fiscal impact, while immigrants from non-Western countries have a large negative one, which is also the case when considering only non-refugee immigrants.

This study examined the impact on AFS use of message-based interventions encouraging LMI households to save their refunds when they electronically filed their federal income tax returns. We found that 3 out of 18 interventions resulted in statistically significant reductions in credit-related AFS use with small effect sizes. None of the interventions resulted in reduced transaction-related AFS use. Other factorsespecially prior AFS use and financial shockswere strong predictors of AFS.

In this paper, I evaluate the effectiveness of bullying laws on decreasing the share of students who experience in-school bullying victimization using a difference-in-difference framework. The school-level results show that schools in states with such laws had less reported school bullying incidents (up to 8.4%) compared to schools in states without anti-bullying laws, and these effects are much stronger in states where there is a specific clause in the law defining the term bullying. Falsification tests for other crime-related behaviors, on which the anti p-bullying laws should not have an effect, corroborate a causal interpretation of the results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Vassallo, AP",,,,"Vassallo, Andrew P.",,,CAN ONE (EVER) ACCURATELY DEFINE MARKETS?,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The ongoing debate about the role of market definition in antitrust cases addresses the usefulness and correct application of the Hypothetical Monopolist Test (HMT) as defined by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines. These guidelines intend to identify the techniques that those agencies use to evaluate the potential anticompetitive effects of a merger. In this article, I examine the accuracy of the HMT. In applying the HMT, I consider two separate models. In each model, one knows the true extent of the product market. First, I apply the HMT in a linear differentiated demand model with n firms that each produce one symmetrically differentiated product, and derive conditions whereby m products would be considered to comprise a product market. I find that the test consistently underestimates the number of products in the relevant market in that setting, and the resulting relevant product markets are arbitrary subsets of the actual product market. The second model uses a quasi-linear utility specification, where the products enter the utility function additively. The only interaction between the two products occurs through the income effects of the budget constraint. Under certain conditions, the smallest possible product market as defined by the HMT must include at least one producer of the other product. Therefore, depending on the underlying parameters of the utility function, the HMT might either overestimate or underestimate the size of the relevant product market, sometimes producing purely arbitrary results.","[Vassallo, Andrew P.] Shippensburg Univ, Econ, Shippensburg, PA 17257 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania,"Vassallo, AP (通讯作者)，Shippensburg Univ, Econ, Shippensburg, PA 17257 USA.",avasallo@ship.edu,,,,,,,17,1,1,1,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Although much of the material is broadly familiar, attention is drawn to some lesser-known aspects. These include the reliability of the civil registration data and its implications for measuring life expectancy; the variation in the rate of improvement in life expectancy over the sub-periods between 1871 and 2011; and plausible reasons for it. In recent decades as much as three quarters of longevity gains has been attributable to falling age-specific death rates among the elderly. Given that further reductions in mortality rates among the elderly may be increasingly difficult to deliver, the overall gains in life expectancy in the coming decades may not match those recorded during the first half of the twentieth century.",,,,,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,1,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

In terms of this section, in certain circumstances, 'income' is deemed to be income received by or accrued to a taxpayer. Despite the fact that the term 'income' has been used in Section 7 from the time that it was first introduced into the Act and the fact that it is defined in section 1 of the Act, there still remains uncertainty regarding the intention of the legislature and the actual meaning of the term in terms of Section 7. Aim: The objective of the study is to understand whether the term 'income', as used in Sections 7(2) to 7(8) of the Act, is used in its defined sense or if it should be ascribed a different meaning. Setting: This article examines existing literature in a South African income tax environment. Method: A non-empirical study of existing literature was conducted by performing a historical analysis within a South African context. A doctrinal research approach was followed. Results: Possible interpretations determined include 'income' as defined in section 1 of the Act, namely 'gross income' (also defined) less exempt income, 'gross income', profits and gains or 'taxable income' (i.e. 'income' less allowable expenditure, deductions and losses) and 'gross income' less related deductible expenses and losses. Conclusion: It was found that the meaning of 'income', for purposes of Sections 7(2) to 7(8), remains an uncertainty, and it is recommended that the wording of Section 7 be amended to reflect the intended meaning thereof.","[van Wyk, Danielle; Dippenaar, Mareli] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"van Wyk, D (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",dvanwyk@sun.ac.za,,"Dippenaar, Mareli/0000-0002-1589-0187; van Wyk, Danielle/0000-0002-4867-6988",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Such forest recovery has occurred in high-income economies, and increasingly in developing countries. Although this process has been studied extensively by geographers, social scientists and historians, only recently has it been analyzed by economists. This contribution has focused on how competing land use values result in changing patterns of use that lead to an increase or decrease in forest cover. A simple model of forest transition is developed to illustrate this approach in the literature. Empirical applications attempt to explain the underlying economic factors, including governance and institutions, which determine the long-run transition in land use values and patterns. The various findings of these analyses have important policy implications, including for REDD + and other forest recovery programs.

Prevention lowers the probability of an invasive species arriving. However, once invasive species have invaded an ecosystem, it is rarely economically or physically viable to eradicate them. Policy after invasion then focuses on restoration or returning habitats to their un-invaded states. We determine the optimal prevention of invasion of the emerald ash borer in Colorado, given the timing of invasion is uncertain and that managers may be able to restore the invaded ecosystem upon an invasive species arrival. Results are used to generate a switching frontier where it is optimal to invest (or not) in prevention given combinations of the probability of invasion, effectiveness of prevention efforts, and restoration possibilities.

It offers a critical perspective on the official European Neighbourhood and illustrates a complementary vision of a non-territorial civic neighbourhood seeking to capture the networked and fluid topologies of contemporary cross-border processes. The paper underlines the role of civil society in bridging the gaps created by borders, and suggests that they provide a powerful driver for maintaining neighbourly relations in a tense climate.

Relevant studies commonly focus on single types of unlawful activity, and use data on specific products. Moreover, relatively little evidence has been provided in Asian jurisdictions. This study examines the impact of antitrust decisions and unfair competition fines, imposed by the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC), on the profit margins and operation costs of firms in Taiwan. All of the administrative fines on cartels, violations of merger notifications, vertical restraints, and unfair competition are considered herein. The Difference-in-Difference model and the Quantile Regression technique were employed on a unique population-based dataset of 2,238,022 firms drawn from a census survey in Taiwan. The results point to a negative (positive) effect of the TFTC's administrative fines on firms' profit margins (operating costs). The negative effect of fines on firms' profit margins is more pronounced for the fines linked to cartel conduct. To respond to reductions in profit margins, firms are more likely to engage in research and development (R&D) activities and to use computers in business sales, on average. Moreover, small firms are more likely to increase the use of computers in business sales, whereas medium and large firms are more likely to invest in R&D to compensate for their losses stemming from their cessation of illegal activities.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Taiwan Fair Trade Commiss TFTC, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Taiwan Fair Trade Commiss TFTC, Taipei, Taiwan.;Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

An ever-expanding body of research concludes that, for a variety of reasons, consumers often behave in various non-standard ways. In light of this research, some economic regulators and competition authorities are replacing the concept of the standard consumer with the concept of the non-standard consumer. This is justified on the basis that it is more realistic and offers the potential for more effective policies anchored in the behavior of actual consumers. While there are persuasive arguments for adopting a concept of the non-standard consumer, effectively integrating non-standard consumers into relevant policies raises conceptual challenges and risks, some of which have been borne out in practice. In particular, attention needs to be given to: the specific nature of the nonstandard consumer behavior; the relative proportion of consumers characterized by non-standard behavior; possible supplier responses to remedial measures; and critically, the potential unintended effects of such policies. If these parameters and challenges are acknowledged and effectively incorporated into analytical frameworks, the potential exists for better-targeted competition and regulatory policies.","[Decker, Christopher] Univ Oxford, Law & Econ, CSLS, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Decker, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Law & Econ, CSLS, Oxford, England.",christopher.decker@wolfson.oxon.org,,,,,,,101,11,11,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Recent research has provided evidence that demographic rather than economic processes provide a more compelling explanation for observed trends in the region. In particular, mortality decline appears to be both a necessary and sufficient condition for urbanization to occur and a key driver of urban growth more broadly. The accumulation of survey data over the past few decades and the development of new geospatial datasets that incorporate satellite imagery are facilitating new, more spatially nuanced insights into the dynamics of urban population change in the region. This offers opportunity to develop better policies for managing urban change than those adopted in the past, which placed a misguided emphasis on manipulating migration incentives with little evidence of positive benefits.","[Fox, Sean] Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Fox, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Univ Rd, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England.",sean.fox@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,23,23,3,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

We show that arrays of empirical tests falsify the core predictions of the theory. We therefore examine the logic of patent-holdup theory. We show that patent-holdup theory conflates two mutually inconsistent economic mechanisms: holdup (the appropriation of a quasi rent) and the exercise of monopoly power (to set the market price to extract a monopoly rent). Moreover, three fallacies underpin patent-holdup theory: (1) that patent holdup is a straightforward variant of holdup as it is understood in transaction-cost economics; (2) that royalty stacking is holdup repeated multiple times on the same product; and (3) that standard-essential patents contribute little or no value to the markets they help create. These fallacies give rise to a theory that is logically inconsistent and incomplete, and that ignores economic fundamentals. The flaws in logic of patent-holdup theory, and its lack of fit with the evidence, suggest that a new theory about the mechanics and dynamics of SEP-intensive IT industries is called for, both as a matter of science and as a guide to antitrust and patent policies.","[Galetovic, Alexander] Univ Los Andes, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Haber, Stephen] Stanford Univ, Sch Humanities & Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Universidad de los Andes - Chile; Stanford University,"Galetovic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",alexander@galetovic.cl; haber@stanford.edu,,,"Working Group on Intellectual Property, Innovation, and Prosperity (IP2) of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University","Working Group on Intellectual Property, Innovation, and Prosperity (IP2) of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University","Peter and Helen Bing Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution, A.

We show that, on average, consumers responsible for financial decision making within a household find cash and the debit card equally helpful for monitoring their household finances. Individuals differ in major respects, however. In particular, low earners and the liquidity-constrained prefer cash as a budgeting tool.

By assumption, information can only truthfully be disclosed but, under voluntary disclosure, having found no evidence cannot credibly be communicated. If the information-acquiring party has all the bargaining power, then, under voluntary disclosure, she will invest more in information acquisition than is welfare maximizing in many situations. At lesser bargaining power, however, this need not be the case. If information directly benefits the non-acquiring party only, then incentives to acquire under voluntary disclosure are less than under mandatory disclosure, and the latter leads to less than welfare-maximizing acquisition. Most results are independent of the underlying bargaining structure as mainly use of constraints is made that hold for equilibrium payoffs from any bargaining game.","[Schweizer, Urs] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Schweizer, U (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Bonn, Germany.",schweizer@uni-bonn.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB/TR 15],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The author thanks Tim Friehe, Osnat Jacobi, Andreas Roider, Thomas Troger, Ansgar Wohlschlegel and, in particular, the editor and two referees for constructive and helpful comments during two rounds of revision.

Thus, the purpose of the research is to examine the progress achieved by European countries in implementing the concept of sustainable development. Special attention was given to the new member states that joined the EU after the year 2004. The research is conducted with the application of the Eurostat data at a macroeconomic level. It is assumed that sustainable development should be treated as a multivariate latent variable. Thus, it can be measured with the application of the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) methodology that includes confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis used in econometrics. In the article, a hypothetical SEM model for the years 2004-2013 was proposed. The model was based on nine observable variables suggested by the Eurostat for measuring sustainable development phenomena at a national level. The application of the SEM model enabled us to identify the usefulness of the observable variables proposed by the Eurostat.

One of these is detecting outliers accounting for an important share of hospital costs. The aim of the study is to identify the factors facilitating identification of cost outliers in one of the Polish reference hospitals in northeast Poland. We have analyzed 4,570 patients. Cost analysis was done retrospectively using accountancy and statistical data from the hospital. To select the outliers, we used the interquartile method using the median and the interquartile distance. To evaluate the factors that influence the patient being a cost outlier, we considered: age, length of stay, gender, type of admission, reason of discharge, and type of department. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used in the study. Our study revealed that the small percentage of the patients is responsible for the significant level of costs. The total cost outliers comprised 9% of the study sample. They accounted for almost 37% of total hospital costs, 40% of direct costs, and 34% of indirect costs. We discovered that age, gender, length of stay, reason of discharge, and type of department has a significant influence on being the cost outlier. The study revealed that the probability of being the CO increased more than 6 times for the surgical patients. This is consistent with the analysis of CO by ICD 10. The analysis revealed that almost all patients suffered from diseases related to high proportion of CO, required surgery treatment. It is concluded that identifying the cost outliers can contribute to better knowledge by managers about the nature of the costs outliers and can be especially valuable in the financing systems where high costs outliers are separately paid.","[Cyganska, Malgorzata] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Banking, Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Cyganska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Banking, Olsztyn, Poland.",m.cyganska@uwm.edu.pl,"Cyganska, Malgorzata/N-8584-2018","Cyganska, Malgorzata/0000-0003-4548-2915",,,,,34,2,2,0,3,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The scientific literature provides substantial evidence that a domestic economy may suffer a loss due to increased openness of an economy. For this reason this empirical study focuses on vulnerability of countries to the external macroeconomic shocks and macroeconomic shocks transmission through real channel in the CEECs. The main research questions are: which determinants explain vulnerability of countries to the external macroeconomic shocks and which type of external macroeconomic shocks cause the spillover effect transmission? The objective of this study-to identify the determinants explaining vulnerability of countries to the external macroeconomic shocks and the macroeconomic shocks transmission through real channel in the CEECs. The research object-the CEECs. The research methods: the systemic, logical, and comparative analysis of the scientific literature and statistical method: panel regression analysis, cross-sectional panel regression. The main findings are that the exchange rate shock (depreciation of the currencies of the main export partners) positively affects the real GDP growth of CEECs, however, depreciation of foreign currencies decrease the export flows to these countries. The economic growth in the main export partners positively affects the real GDP growth in CEECs and real export flows to these countries and the positive effect is stronger on the real export flows. The increase of consumption in the main export partners positively affects the real GDP growth in the CEECs, however, a negative impact of consumption on the real export flows to the main export partners is observed. The empirical results also suggest about positive impact of import growth in the main export partners. The empirical results on the vulnerability of CEECs to the external macroeconomic shocks suggest that the more divergent export structure of a country from world structure is, the higher volatility of country's real GDP is and trade openness of country also increases the volatility of country's real GDP.","[Deltuvaite, Vilma] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 20, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Deltuvaitè, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 20, Kaunas, Lithuania.",vilma.deltuvaite@ktu.lt,,,Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-016/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. MIP-016/2015) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,40,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,705,717,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_48,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400048,0

In the context of the existence of a large portfolio of projects in different phases of implementation, the public investment budgeting process has led to an exclusive focus on quantitative indicators, to the detriment of those in the qualitative area. Retrospective research on public investment budgets has identified a significant number of non-performing but funded projects. This paper propose a methodology for rationalizing the public investment program (PIP) and implicitly eliminating non-performing projects.

In theory, gamma-neutral portfolios should be immune even to significant changes of underlying assets' price but real markets may not support this fact. We find trading strategy similar to protective collar. Since our strategy is intended for decreasing price of an underlying asset, we test the hypothesis that alternative collar strategy is profitable for decreasing shares and losing for increasing shares. We test it on three kinds of shares-decreasing BMW, increasing Adidas and stagnating Telekom.

In order to develop the reflections, a comparison between two emblematic cases seem to be particularly effective: the Euskalduna Conference Centre in Bilbao (1999) and the new Conference Center, in Rome (2016). The other Italian events of the unfinished works, the issue of the executive phases in the design process and the fragmentation of the responsibilities, in addition to the continuing absence of a culture of the project management, allow to underline the important role that the Appraisal and Evaluation disciplines are called upon to play in the production of works for the transformation of the contemporary city, also in the perspective of the new Italian Procurement Code.","[Forte, Fabiana] Univ Naples 2, Dept Architecture & Ind Design Luigi Vanvitelli, Via S Lorenzo Ad Septimum, Aversa, CE, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Forte, F (通讯作者)，Univ Naples 2, Dept Architecture & Ind Design Luigi Vanvitelli, Via S Lorenzo Ad Septimum, Aversa, CE, Italy.",fabiana.forte@unina2.it,,,,,,,21,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,129,139,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_10,0.0,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600010,0

The purpose of the article is to identify the economic factors which diversify the level of loans taken by households in selected European Union countries. To achieve the purpose of the article, the correlation analysis was applied to verify the statistical interdependences between the main economic indicators and the value of housing and consumer loans granted to households.

As there is no general consensus on which marketing quality factors really matter in assessing the quality of the dining experience in the previous literature, this paper describes and tests the development of a marketing-oriented Restaurant Quality Model (RQM 7P). In addition, this study tests whether guests' perceive overall restaurant quality offerings as coherent. Special attention was devoted to a marketing perspective (7P). Following the discussion of the conceptualization and operationalization of the restaurant quality construct, the procedures used in constructing and refining a multiple-item scale to measure restaurant quality are described. Evidence of the scale's reliability, factor structure and validity on the basis of analysing data is presented next. A sample of 1,998 valid questionnaires obtained by domestic guests in different restaurant facilities in Slovenia is analysed. Results show that guests perceive restaurant quality according to three marketing quality dimensions - (1) people, (2) placement, and (3) product (food) and physical evidences, while other marketing factors are not statistically significant in determining restaurant quality. In addition, the results indicate that guests perceive restaurant quality offerings as highly incoherent. From a theoretical point of view, this study contributes by developing a restaurant quality model based on marketing factors. In addition, it is the first study to test the perception of all seven marketing dimensions in the restaurant industry, and it provides insights regarding how guests perceive restaurant offering coherency. This research has thrown up many questions in need of further investigation. Future research should include a cross-national study involving different segments of guests in different types of food and beverage facilities.","[Kukanja, Marko] Univ Primorska, Fac Tourism Studies Turistica, Koper, Slovenia; [Omerzel, Doris Gomezelj] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia; [Bukovec, Boris] Fac Org Studies, Novo Mesto, Slovenia",University of Primorska; University of Primorska,"Kukanja, M (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Tourism Studies Turistica, Koper, Slovenia.",Marko.Kukanja@fts.upr.si; Doris.Gomezelj@fm-kp.si; Boris.Bukovec@fos.unm.si,,"KUKANJA, MARKO/0000-0003-0637-3337",,,,,65,1,4,0,32,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

As statistical evidence and rigorous studies conducted by researchers and non-governmental organizations suggested gender inequalities in employment, education and income distributions still prevails in Georgia. Not all groups in society have equal access to employability and entrepreneurial opportunities. Majority in Georgia formally shares the idea of gender equality. Certain percentage of population is in favor of traditional distribution of the gender roles. To overcome the disparity gap between men and women in social life effective mechanism such a quoting is needed. In many developed countries quoting usually is the standard in modern society. Unfortunately the gender hierarchy is still top issue in Georgian families, in political as well as in business space. Women's Entrepreneurship is effected by existing stereotypes as entrepreneurship is a largely a product of environment rat.

This study examines the changing nature of countryside and farming from the Soviet period till nowadays, aiming to find out the main factors, which shape the trends of rural development in transition economies and compose the demand for socially responsible provision of public goods. Main objectives of the study are: to analyze common rural development features of Soviet period since 1990s; to define the key features of rural development in Lithuania as a country of transition just after the regained independence and in recent years, which affected the general provision of public goods and to project the main factors for its demand. Statistical data analysis, generalization, systematization and projection methods were applied. Research results show that the demographic and environmental issues are the top concerns, and these will probably form major groups of factors for the demand of socially responsible provision of public goods in the nearest future.","[Pareigiene, Lina; Vilke, Rita] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Dept Rural Dev, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Stalgiene, Aldona] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Dept Farm & Enterprises Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics,"Pareigiene, L (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Dept Rural Dev, Vilnius, Lithuania.",lina.pareigiene@laei.lt; aldona.stalgiene@laei.lt; rita.vilke@gmail.com,,"Stalgiene, Aldona/0000-0002-9791-7864",Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-098/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. MIP-098/2015) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,53,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-54112-9; 978-3-319-54111-2,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,7,,,,,,335,355,,10.1007/978-3-319-54112-9_22,0.0,,,21,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ4CE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424822700022,0

To do so, we test for abnormal excess returns using classic and modern asset pricing models. We document that size, investment, and momentum effects are not unequivocal enough to advertise them as trading opportunities. Abnormal returns of profitability and value anomalies are statistically and economically significant and they are persistent throughout different investment climates. Further, we report higher degree of mispricing at an aggregated level, and thus higher abnormal investment opportunities, in the period of bear market and stable macro-conditions (2000-2006) than during and after the recent global financial crisis (2007-2013). We advocate that in emerging stock markets, like the Warsaw Stock Exchange, investors' asset pricing skills outweigh the effect of international portfolio rebalancing in the process of asset pricing. Investors might benefit from acknowledging these findings in formulating their investment policies. For instance, they may consider switching towards less aggressive portfolio allocations during bear markets.","[Roszkowska, Paulina] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Roszkowska, Paulina] Hult Int Business Sch, San Francisco, CA USA; [Roszkowska, Paulina; Langer, Lukasz K.] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Warsaw School of Economics,"Roszkowska, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Roszkowska, P (通讯作者)，Hult Int Business Sch, San Francisco, CA USA.;Roszkowska, P (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",proszkowska@gmail.com,"Roszkowska, Paulina/AAQ-7096-2020","Roszkowska, Paulina/0000-0001-6929-1764",,,,,17,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,113,122,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_11,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500011,0

Despite these reforms, there has not been a corresponding increase in demand for health services, as only about 30% of the sick use modern care (NISR in Preliminary results of interim demographic and health survey 2010. NISR, Kigali, 2011). The objective of this paper was to examine the factors influencing the demand for outpatient care in Rwanda and suggesting appropriate measures to improve utilization of health services. The data are from the Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey (EICV2) conducted in 2005 by the National Institute of Statistics Rwanda (NISR). A structural model of demand for health care is estimated to measure the demand effects of covariates. The findings indicate that health insurance is a significant determinant of outpatient medical care. In addition, the price of health care and household income are among the main drivers of utilization of health care. Women are more likely to seek outpatient health care as compared to men. Two main policy recommendations emerge from these findings. First, the government should reduce out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures (OOPE) through subsidies for public health facilities. Second, the government should reduce the premiums for community-based health insurance schemes (CBHIs) to increase coverage rates.","[Ruhara, Charles Mulindabigwi] Univ Rwanda, Butare, Rwanda; [Kioko, Urbanus Mutuku] Univ Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Rwanda; University of Nairobi,"Ruhara, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Rwanda, Butare, Rwanda.",ruharamch@yahoo.fr; urbanusmutukukioko@gmail.com,"Kioko, Urbanus/GYJ-0777-2022",,,,,,65,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,41,60,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_3,0.0,,,20,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900003,0

With the purpose to fulfill the aim, we examine existence and character of relationship between selected financial factors (debt equity ratio, return on equity, share of fixed assets to total assets, share of earnings before interest and taxes to total assets) and liquidity of the companies in sectors such as mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction, service sector and energy sector. The existence of relationship between financial factors and liquidity of companies is tested by correlation analysis and regression analysis. The results show that there is the negative impact of share of fixed assets to total assets on liquidity of companies in service sector in the Czech Republic. The liquidity of companies was positively influenced by the return on equity and negatively influenced by debt equity ratio in energy sector in the Czech Republic.","[Seligova, Marketa] Silesian Univ Opava, Fac Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Seligová, M (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Fac Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",seligova@opf.slu.cz,"Seligova, Marketa/AAB-5075-2021","Seligova, Marketa/0000-0001-5034-0044","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government)",", This paper was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2017.",,14,0,0,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,774,784,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200080,0

In this paper exogenous explanatory variable that indicates the level of financialization is presented by the value added of the finance sector as a percentage of total value added, and by the employment in the finance sector as a percentage of total employment. In a process of deindustrialization, the industrial activity is usually replaced by service activities. However, situations where the service sector has not been able to absorb the additional supply of labour and to produce additional values that would compensate the reduction in the industrial sector, could have led to higher unemployment and lower economic growth. In this paper, deindustrialization is measured by the value added of industry sector as a percentage of total value added, and by the employment in industry as a percentage of total employment. Using latest panel data from EUROSTAT and ILO for the period from 1995 to 2015 author detects the significant and negative impacts of the process of financialization on value added of industry sector, as well as on the employment in the industry sector. This supports the conclusion that the process of deindustrialization of the EU countries can be characterized as a financializationled process.","[Svilokos, Tonci] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik, Croatia; Airport Dubrovnik, Dobrota 24, Miocici 20213, Cilipi, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik,"Svilokos, T (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",tonci.svilokos@unidu.hr; ivanburin@yahoo.com,"Svilokos, Tonći/JTS-6609-2023","Svilokos, Tonci/0000-0003-4159-7918",,,,,23,6,6,0,2,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The proposed model is constructed by incorporating all potential predictors in a time-varying HAR framework, and giving the independent normal-gamma autoregressive (NGAR) process priors to the regression coefficients. The out-of-sample forecast results show that the proposed HAR model with time-varying sparsity improves the forecast performances substantially relative to both the simple HAR model and more sophisticated HAR-type models in almost all cases.

In a system of heterogeneous cities, we show that the second-best land use policy constrains city creation, while subsidizing (taxing) urban development in cities in which the marginal-average productivity gap is above (below) average. This policy cannot be decentralized to competitive urban developers, yet competition among urban developers does result in a lower-best outcome in which development is subsidized everywhere if city creation is unconstrained. A numerical application indicates that a substantial share of the welfare gains from implementing a second-best land use policy may then still be attained, although the aggregate amount of land in urban use is considerably larger.","[Vermeulen, Wouter] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Vermeulen, Wouter] London Sch Econ, SERC, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Vermeulen, W (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",w.vermeulen@cpb.nl,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,37,4,5,3,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

One of the methods currently used in practice applies the generalized linear model (GLM). In the literature one can find the justified extension of the GLM to the hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM) for loss reserving. A limitation in the use of the HGLM is the fact that the mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) is expressed by a complex analytical formula. An alternative to the analytical formula is to use the bootstrap procedure approximating the sampling distribution of the MSEP. This paper study two ways of bootstrap. The first one is the parametric bootstrap in which one simulates from fitted values of the HGLM. This approach is sensitive to incorrect fit of the model. Therefore the alternative is the simulation by resampling residuals and adding them back to the fitted values. The paper contains the comparison of this two approaches applying the loss triangle investigated by several authors.

However safe or efficient these vehicles are touted to be, media portrayal has the potential to dramatically affect consumer perceptions. Consumer perceptions will ultimately determine the success or failure of driverless vehicles, and potentially drive policy changes as driverless vehicles become more common. Methods: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of different types of information (positive or negative) on consumer perceptions of driverless vehicles, and how individuals of different genders and nationalities may feel influenced differently by the same information. The current research used a two-study approach. Results: In the first study, results showed that individuals are more willing to ride in driverless vehicles after hearing positive information about them, and less willing to ride after hearing negative information about the vehicles. In study two, our results were similar to those found in study one regarding information type and willingness to ride. Additionally, there was a main effect of nationality because Indians were significantly more willing to ride in driverless vehicles compared to Americans. This main effect of nationality was qualified by significant interactions between nationality and gender as well as nationality and information type. Conclusions: Overall, Indian females were the group with highest willingness to ride scores. The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings, theoretical contributions, practical applications, development of policy, and potential avenues of future study.","[Anania, Emily C.; Rice, Stephen; Walters, Nathan W.; Pierce, Matthew; Winter, Scott R.; Milner, Mattie N.] Embry Riddle Aeronaut Univ, 600 South Clyde Morris Blvd, Daytona Beach, FL 32114 USA",Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University,"Winter, SR (通讯作者)，Embry Riddle Aeronaut Univ, 600 South Clyde Morris Blvd, Daytona Beach, FL 32114 USA.",scott.winter@mac.com,,,,,,,40,81,93,2,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

I use specialized survey data to estimate the effect of additional reports to the police for poor women who experienced spousal abuse prior to participating in Oportunidades. The identification strategy for this paper consists of two instrumental variables that are based on institutional characteristics of Oportunidades: i) drop out variation caused by the type of hospital available in any given locality (e.g. federal versus state-run) and ii) the roll-out in the densification process. Findings indicate an increase of 30.2% in the reporting rates as a consequence of receiving Oportunidades. I propose several channels through which treatment might work into the final outcome: i) assimilation of women's rights; ii) an increase of trust in the police; and iii) a new equilibrium in the marriage market in which more future dissolutions and fewer reconciliations occur among abused beneficiary women.

While some of our findings support previous work, others challenge previous research and general expectations about race and crime. Contrary to victimization patterns observed in the aggregate data, our panel data models identify consistent patterns of reported violence committed by White individuals against Blacks and Hispanics across neighborhoods. Specifically, in the presence of controls for neighborhood and time effects, Whites are more likely to assault and use weapons against Blacks and Hispanics than Blacks and Hispanics are to assault or use weapons against Whites. On the other hand, Blacks and Hispanics are typically more likely to commit robbery (crimes which we characterize as being often related to economic motives) against Whites than the reverse. We estimate these effects across the racial composition and earnings distribution of neighborhoods in Los Angeles County and find significant heterogeneity in the propensity for certain types of crimes to occur as a function of the race/ethnic match of suspect and victim.

This paper examines how the fire affected housing prices in vulnerable neighboring areas that were not directly impacted by the fire, controlling for the property's level of risk. This damaging fire may have increased home owners' perceptions about the risk of living in forested areas subject to wildfires to a significant degree adding to the total direct economic losses from the fire. Utilizing a unique fire risk data set and a difference-indifference approach, we test whether buyers of houses in areas with different risk levels prior to the fire adjust expectations differently. We find buyers in the highest risk area are most likely to change their perceptions in response to a fire with houses in these areas experiencing a statistically significant 21.7% decline in sale price compared to houses in non-risky areas.","[Kiel, Katherine A.; Matheson, Victor A.] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, Box 17A, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",College of the Holy Cross,"Kiel, KA (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, Box 17A, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",kkiel@holycross.edu; vmatheso@holycross.edu,"Chen, Wei Han/J-5735-2018",,Weiss Summer Research Program in Economics; Committe on Faculty Scholarship at the College of the Holy Cross,Weiss Summer Research Program in Economics; Committe on Faculty Scholarship at the College of the Holy Cross,"We thank Charles Cunningham, Gregory Joyce, Brendan Perra, and Matthew Zakrewski for excellent research assistance, and anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

If shipping is to limit its greenhouse gas emissions so that global warming is maintained below 2 degrees C as agreed by the IMO in April 2018 and in line with 2015 Paris Agreement, urgent action is needed in terms of environmentally friendly technologies uptake, operational measures and new forms of propulsion based on alternative fuels. While some research has appeared in the last decade on operational and technological measures aimed at reducing emissions for shipping, limited focus has been put on the economic and environmental impacts of a fuel shift. This research aims at analysing the alternative fuel options available for shipping and assess the emission reductions obtainable through a fuel shift. The paper also provides insights on the costs associated with such fuel transition. Through the development of a simulation based on existing information of alternative fuel costs and availability, the paper shows that a maximum of 24% greenhouse gas emission reduction can be achieved by using alternative fuels. Such reduction, however, can be obtained at varying cost levels. An optimal fleet mix is provided for 2050 as guidance for policy makers and the shipping sector.","[Nair, Abhishek] Erasmus Univ, Ctr Maritime Econ & Logist, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Acciaro, Michele] KLU, Dept Logist, Hamburg, Germany; [Acciaro, Michele] KLU, Hapag Lloyd Ctr Shipping & Global Logist, Hamburg, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Kuhne Logistics University; Kuhne Logistics University,"Acciaro, M (通讯作者)，KLU, Dept Logist, Hamburg, Germany.;Acciaro, M (通讯作者)，KLU, Hapag Lloyd Ctr Shipping & Global Logist, Hamburg, Germany.",Michele.Acciaro@the-klu.org,"Acciaro, Michele/J-7669-2018","Acciaro, Michele/0000-0003-0144-3033",,,,,29,7,7,4,39,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

I test this using executive contracts from S&P 500 firms. I find that firms pay severance in discretionary installments to induce their executives to comply with noncompete agreements-but only in California, where noncompetes are void. Outside California, noncompetes are valid and these same firms pay non-discretionary severance upfront.

From the perspective of operators, most works analyze a limited set of policies or only focus on the benefits of companies. In this work, a decision-making process is used to evaluate a large set of UFT policies, through different attributes representing the advantages and limitations of each policy over promoter companies and the society. To do so, an ex-ante procedure in five steps is proposed to classify the policies : (1) attributes definition, (2) attributes weighting, (3) policy-attribute assessment, (4) policy ranking, and (5) feasibility threshold satisfaction. The whole process is supported on consultations to 26 experts regarding shop supply and restocking activities within complex urban environments.

J,"Zolciak, O",,,,"Zolciak, Olivia",,,"Sublimating an Apocalypse: An Exploration of Anxiety, Authorship, and Feminist Theory in Mary Shelley's The Last Man",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MEMORY,"Mary Shelley was an early feminist writer, but she has not been recognized as such because of profound misinterpretation of her final novel, The Last Man. Set in the years 2090-2100, the novel is about a plague that obliterates humanity aside from the protagonist, Lionel Verney. As his family and friends perish, Verney journeys alone, and begins to experience psychological and literary anxiety. The novel failed within the conventions of female romance novels of the early 19(th) century, a category in which it is still often pigeon-holed. But as the first modern work of apocalyptic fiction, which created a genre now dominated by Stephen King, it was a huge success, for which Mary Shelley is seldom credited. By critically analyzing the novel's treatment of anxiety of illness and authorship in terms of psychoanalytic theory and juxtaposing these concepts with a long-standing feminist approach, this article suggests that Mary Shelley's literary innovations will remain influential in the continuously growing genre of post-apocalyptic literature in the 20(th) and 21(st) centuries. Thematically, the novel also presents a new feminist vision of history, a millennial conflict that requires us to look forward and backward simultaneously. It is also about new ways of recognizing the authority of the female voice in that history, which is normally displaced by the insistence on male authority that comes from historical lineage. The Last Man contests that lineage by showing how apocalyptic narratives can reframe our sense of time and authority.","[Zolciak, Olivia] Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Zolciak, Olivia] BGSU, Literary & Textual Studies, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA",University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University,"Zolciak, O (通讯作者)，Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.;Zolciak, O (通讯作者)，BGSU, Literary & Textual Studies, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",obiggin@yahoo.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Although this legislation was implemented in May 2011, statistics indicate that the success rate for business rescues is only approximately 12%. A feature of the business rescue environment in South Africa is the lack of knowledge, necessitating more research in the field. Aim: This study focused on changes required to ensure the survival and increased success of the business rescue legislation. Setting: This research was undertaken in South Africa between 2015 and 2017. Methods: A mixed-methods research approach was utilised for the study. The approach entailed interviews with 7 of the top 10 business rescue practitioners to diagnose reasons for business rescue failure and establish factors that would contribute to successful business rescues. A survey was conducted with the membership of the Turnaround Management Association of Southern Africa. Results: The survey was mailed to 130 members and the response rate was 54%. This study found that the causes of business rescue failures are mainly attributable to the skills deficit of the business rescue practitioner or the practitioner's abuse of legislation. There is also a negative impact of appointing a liquidator as a business rescue practitioner. Other factors contributing to the failure of business rescues are management's delay in filing for business rescue, either due to the resistance of filing or their lack of awareness of their distressed status. This study also provided the ranking order for business rescue success factors with the accreditation of a business rescue practitioner being ranked as first. Conclusion: The study chiefly focused on diagnosing and understanding the reasons for business rescue failure. The original contribution of this study to knowledge is the ranking of an accreditation framework for practitioners as the most important factor that would contribute to a successful business rescue. This study not only explains the low success rate of business rescue but ways to improve and succeed in rescuing ailing businesses.","[Rajaram, Rajendra; Sewpersadh, Navitha S.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa; [Singh, Anesh M.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Grad Sch Business, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Rajaram, R (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa.",rajaramr@ukzn.ac.za,"Sewpersadh, Navitha Singh/N-5063-2013","Sewpersadh, Navitha Singh/0000-0002-3219-7974; Singh, Anesh Maniraj/0000-0001-9834-3172; Rajaram, Rajendra/0000-0003-1734-2448",,,,,52,4,5,0,4,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Using a unique data set collected for the EAC, this paper investigates how liberalisation has affected fares and service quality, and how further liberalisation may affect the aviation sector and benefit regional economies. The main results provide robust evidence that liberalisation leads to lower fares and higher frequencies, which in turn stimulate passenger demand. Fully liberalising restricted routes reduces average fares by 9 per cent and increases frequencies by 41 per cent. Furthermore, the results show that partial liberalisation is not effective in achieving equivalent impacts.","[Abate, Megersa] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Kincaid, Ian] InterVISTAS Consulting Inc, Vancouver, BC, Canada",The World Bank,"Abate, M (通讯作者)，1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mabate@worldbank.org,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,1,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

The HSR is faster than those modes, but also more expensive to ride. The pricing of HSR tickets has gained limited public acceptance because it lacks justification, indicating the need for a theoretical method for objectively justifying the ticket prices. With continuing improvements in data analytics, the computational capacity of computers, and visualization techniques, constructing a time space model of a long-distance transportation system has become increasingly feasible, and such a model can be used to examine the time space compression of the HSR. The first part of this investigation uses multidimensional scaling to obtain fitting coordinates based on travel times for various combinations of departure/destination HSR stations, and a geographic information system to generate time-space maps of the relative locations of those stations. Through these maps, we can directly estimate the traveling time between pairs of stations. The second part constructs a floating ticket-pricing model that accounts for the riding costs of the HSR. The model's power to explain the prices of HSR tickets is evaluated. Based on the analytical results, suggestions to the current HSR ticket fare were proposed to set the feasible rate concerning the operating, passenger-perceived, and time-space compression costs. Recommendations for future research are made.","[Chou, Jui-Sheng; Chien, Ya-Ling; Ngoc-Mai Nguyen; Dinh-Nhat Truong] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Chou, JS (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.",jschou@mail.ntust.edu.tw; andreachien0517@grnail.com; nnmai264@gmail.com; D10605806@mail.ntust.edu.tw,"Chou, Jui-Sheng/C-8795-2009; Truong, Nhat/HTL-6180-2023; Truong, Nhat/AAC-8549-2022","Chou, Jui-Sheng/0000-0002-8372-9934; Truong, Nhat/0000-0002-8889-0778; Truong, Nhat/0000-0002-8889-0778; Nguyen, Ngoc-Mai/0000-0002-0465-7021",,,,,77,12,13,3,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Variation in the timing of the joint custody reform across states provides a natural experimental framework to study the causal effect of shared custody on mothers' economic outcomes. The results show that only single mothers experience a decrease in earnings as a consequence of the adoption of the joint custody law, exposing them to a higher risk of poverty. The paper discusses a possible explanation for these findings, namely that the higher child support payment the mother receives from the non-custodial father in case of joint custody might discourage her from looking for high paid jobs or investing in her career.","[Vuri, Daniela] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, CESIfo, CEIS, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Vuri, Daniela] IZA, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Vuri, D (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, CESIfo, CEIS, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.;Vuri, D (通讯作者)，IZA, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",daniela.vuri@uniroma2.it,,"vuri, daniela/0000-0001-8693-3845",,,,,60,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Based on Internet technology and customer-oriented services some new entrants are diversifying the options for the travelers. For instance, High Speed Rail (HSR or TGV in French) services are challenged by low cost airlines but also by BlaBlaCar, the world leader in ride-sharing, and since 2015 by the deregulated long distance coach services. At the end of the first quarter of 2017, 8 million passengers have already experienced long distance coaches in France. But is it enough? The aim of our paper is to analyze the development of coach services in France as a case study and their lack of profitability. Until now, coach operators are suffering huge losses. Is it transitory or can we consider that the high degree of competition between HSR, ride-sharing and coach services will structurally limit the development of the latter? How will the structure of this market evolve if the demand remains at a rather low level, in comparison with United Kingdom for instance? To conclude, it is a dynamic market as far as passengers are concerned but it can be a lose-lose game for operators such as coach operators or ride-sharing platforms.","[Crozet, Yves] Univ Lyon, IEP Lyon, Lyon, France; [Guihery, Laurent] Univ Cergy Pontoise, MRTE, Cergy Pontoise, France",CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Guihéry, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, MRTE, Cergy Pontoise, France.",yves.crozetl@wanadoo.fr; laurent.guihery@u-cergy.fr,,,,,,,11,8,8,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Previous research on pictographs has focused on single rather than multiple-risk options. The present research conducts a behavioral experiment to assess the effects of pictographs on probability comprehension and risk perception for single and multiple-risk options. The creation of the experimental stimuli is informed by a review of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine information sheets. The results suggest that, in the context of childhood vaccines, the inclusion of pictographs alongside numeric (e.g. 1/5) probability information can result in higher probability comprehension and lower risk perception for multiple-risk options; however, these effects are not observed for single-risk options. These findings have implications for how health-related risks are communicated to the public.","[Leonhardt, James M.] Univ Nevada, Mkt, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Keller, L.

Legacy carriers allocate a larger share of their operations to an independent regional airline partner compared to their own fleet or a wholly owned regional airline on routes that experience stronger competition, particularly from low-cost carriers. Moreover, legacy carriers' airfares are lower on routes that they outsource more prominently to an independent regional airline. The results suggest that increased route competition is a motivation for the growing use of independent regional airlines by legacy carriers.","[Tan, Kerry M.] Loyola Univ Maryland, 4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA",Loyola University Maryland,"Tan, KM (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Maryland, 4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA.",kmtan@loyola.edu,,,,,,,24,6,7,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

An analysis of the informational content of filter-based business cycles,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOUTH-AFRICA; MACROECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS; AGGREGATE DEMAND; CO-MOVEMENT; COINTEGRATION; GERMANY; JAPAN,"Background: Empirical business cycle research typically commences with the extraction of a so-called deviation cycle using a time-series smoothing filter. This methodology is appealing for its pragmatism; it is easy to implement, and the output it produces is conveniently interpreted as percentage deviations from the natural level of output. However, recent literature offers staunch criticism of deviation cycle analysis, especially with regards to the assumption implicitly underlying it - that business cycle fluctuations are restricted to distinct intervals on the frequency domain. Aim: Despite its lack of a basis in theory, the analysis of deviation cycles over particular frequency ranges may still yield useful stylised business cycle facts. This, however, hinges on whether the information that a frequency filter captures consistently aligns with relevant theory-based business cycle concepts. Whether this is the case is an empirical matter, and herein lies the rationale for our research. Setting: We investigate the informational content of South Africa's output deviation cycles. Methods: We extract deviation cycles at standard high-and medium-frequency ranges (denoted as short- and medium-term deviation cycles respectively) and analyse their informational overlap with the components of an alternative theory-based estimate of the business cycle, decomposed into demand, supply, domestic and foreign sources of business cycle dynamics. Results: Our findings suggest that the contents of deviation cycles extracted over a high-frequency range do not neatly correspond to the transitory 'demand-driven' business cycle, while cycles extracted over a medium-frequency range correspond closely to the combined path of permanent output shocks. Conclusion: One should thus be cautious of drawing strong conclusions about the nature of business cycles from filter-based deviation cycle estimates, particularly if the objective of the study relies on assuming that high-frequency deviation cycles correspond to transitory demand shocks.","[Boshoff, Willem H.; McLean, Lewis] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Boshoff, WH (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",wimpie2@sun.ac.za,"Boshoff, Willem H./D-7182-2012","Boshoff, Willem/0000-0003-1520-3997; Mclean, Lewis/0000-0003-4866-8678",Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),"Willem Boshoff would like to acknowledge financial support from Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA) for an earlier version of the paper, which appeared as a working paper: ERSA Working Paper 200.

Specifically, we first investigate the impact of an asymmetric policy that recognizes carbon emissions from fossil fuels while fully ignoring forest carbon. Next, we investigate the relative importance of not recognizing emissions from a reduction in the stock of forest biomass compared to not recognizing sequestration from the growth of forest biomass. We show that asymmetric carbon policies lead to lower levels of welfare, as well as higher emissions and carbon prices. This occurs because the forest resource will be allocated inefficiently under these carbon policies. Broadly, we find that when the social planner does not account for emissions or sequestration from the forest, the planner will set bioenergy levels that are too high and afforestation and avoided deforestation levels that are too low. Our results further reveal that not recognizing forest emissions leads to larger welfare losses than not recognizing sequestration.","[Eriksson, Mathilda] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Brannlund, Runar; Lundgren, Tommy] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business Econ & Stat, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, Umea, Sweden",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Umea University,"Eriksson, M (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",meriksson@gsu.edu,,,,,,,47,4,4,1,25,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1104-6899,1618-1530,,J FOREST ECON,J.

This behavior varies nonmonotonically with the number of firms in the downstream market. Corresponding deviations from profit maximization are larger if the upstream monopolist makes a price precommitment.

Peak oil emerged as a widely discussed 'storyline' advocated by a globally connected discourse coalition. This study explores the effects of the peak oil discourse in influencing urban transport policy. Two distinct cases are examined in this paper: high density and public transport dominant Hong Kong; and, low density and car dependent Brisbane. Data was obtained from interviews with stakeholders, public documents and media concerning the period between 2003 and 2015 when oil prices were high. This study combines analytical tools from Kingdon's multiple streams framework and Hajer's discourse analysis to assess the effects of the peak oil discourse in Brisbane and Hong Kong. While different urban settings are likely to be major differentiators in the responses of participants from the two cities, higher oil prices have bolstered the voice of 'affordability' storylines that have emerged in both cities. Yet only Brisbane exhibited official usage of 'peak oil' storylines. Counter storylines are found to have been adopted by opposing discourse coalitions, either focusing on the need to develop and deploy technical solutions which can resolve 'peak oil' or to simply 'wait-and-see'. The framing of the issue of heightened oil prices can be seen as acting as a political catalyst, as evidenced by the rise of fall of the response to 'peak oil' and 'oil vulnerability' in Brisbane. As oil prices crashed after 2015, the affordability pressure on urban transport also reduced. When oil prices are low, policy makers or interested stakeholders should expect to adapt other storylines that feature climate and economic resilience which promote sustainable transport and measures to reduce oil vulnerability, no matter how car, or oil, dependent a local environment is.","[Leung, Abraham; Burke, Matthew] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Perl, Anthony] Simon Fraser Univ, Urban Studies Program, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Cui, Jianqiang] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Simon Fraser University; Griffith University,"Leung, A (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",abraham.leung@griffithuni.edu.au,"Leung, Abraham/S-9823-2018; Burke, Matthew I/C-3587-2008","Leung, Abraham/0000-0002-3895-8762; Burke, Matthew I/0000-0002-9148-5917; Perl, Anthony/0000-0002-7786-0266",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Australian Government Endeavour Research Fellowship; Australian Research Council Discovery Future Fellowship [FT120100976]; Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads; Motor Accident and Insurance Commission; Australian Research Council [FT120100976] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Australian Government Endeavour Research Fellowship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Australian Research Council Discovery Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads; Motor Accident and Insurance Commission; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)",The authors would like to thank the interview participants in this research.

Prior to enslavement, Africans lived in agricultural settings. Despite the horrors of slavery, their cultural attachment to the land in their homelands would prove beneficial after emancipation. Developing an agrarian spirit and accumulating land at a rate beyond that of whites in the first few decades of freedom, despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles, black land ownership peaked in the early 1900s. Thereafter, African Americans began to lose their land faster than whites. This article explores the larger context of the South, the creativity African Americans showed in resistance and in declaring themselves human, the movement toward land ownership, and the ways and means by which African Americans lost their land. Narrative and data reveal the complexities and the lived experience of African Americans.","[Hinson, Waymon R.] Abilene Christian Univ, Marriage & Family Therapy, Abilene, TX 79699 USA; [Hinson, Waymon R.] Ohio Valley Univ, Social Sci, Vienna, WV 26105 USA; [Hinson, Waymon R.] Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Assoc, Tillery, NC 27887 USA",Abilene Christian University,"Hinson, WR (通讯作者)，Ohio Valley Univ, Social Sci, Vienna, WV 26105 USA.;Hinson, WR (通讯作者)，Black Farmers & Agriculturalists Assoc, Tillery, NC 27887 USA.",,,,,,,,84,6,13,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This is in contrast to the official U.S. CPI, which is compiled monthly and released with an average of a three-week delay following the end of the reference month. A recent body of research contended that the movements of online prices are representative of those of offline retail prices, making the BPP CPI a natural candidate for accurately improving the timeliness of the official CPI. We assess the predictive content of the BPP CPI using a variety of MIDAS models that accommodate data sampled at different frequencies. These models generate estimates that remain robust to the variety of time periods considered and, by the standard of the existing literature, contribute to a significant upgrade in the forecast accuracy of official consumer price inflation figures. The paper then sketches the broad implications of BPP CPI for the consumer price statistics maintained by national statistics offices and discusses how the proposed improvement in the timeliness of the official CPI fits in this perspective.

By examining the German-Polish border context and the historical and regional particularities of this shopping destination, our qualitative analysis reveals differences in place image formation between two groups of German border crossers: locals from Frankfurt-Oder and visitors from other parts of the borderland. It turns out that the locals regarded the border-crossing town as part of daily life and had lost interest in the bazaar, while cross-border shoppers from further afield visited the bazaar regularly, were motivated by leisure, and assessed the bazaar more positively. These differences in place image formation between the two groups resulted from differences in mind-set and motivation, influencing not only the knowledge and experiences of the border crossers, but also the likelihood of visiting this specific shopping destination again.","[Szytniewski, Bianca B.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Szytniewski, Bianca B.; Spierings, Bas] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Utrecht University,"Szytniewski, BB (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Border Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.;Szytniewski, BB (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",b.szytniewski@fm.ru.nl; B.Spierings@uu.nl,,,Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [231-50-002]; European Science Foundation (ESF) [09-EuroCORECODE-FP-009],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); European Science Foundation (ESF)(European Science Foundation (ESF)),We would like to thank the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO [grant number 231-50-002]) and the European Science Foundation (ESF [grant number 09-EuroCORECODE-FP-009]) for providing the financial support for the research.,,53,8,8,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Yet Priest's (1989) congestion-equilibrium theory states that reforms aimed at reducing court delays are offset by an increased tendency to litigate. To test the congestion-equilibrium hypothesis, we use biennial panel data from 36 European countries over the period 2006-2012. Specifically, we estimate (i) a repeated cross-section model using conventional (pooled) OLS, (ii) a standard (static) random-effects panel data model, and (iii) a (static) random effects model using the new method of unconditional quantile regression (UQR) to examine the country-level relationship between litigation rates and court backlogs (measured by the number of pending cases per judge in each country). In accordance with the congestion equilibrium hypothesis, the UQR estimates suggest a negative impact of court backlogs on litigation rates but only in highly litigious countries, insofar as the latter experience a high degree of judicial independence. This shows the need for custom-tailored policy approaches to tackling court delay based on countries' existing litigation rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The study analyzes the effect on patent quality of the Patent Law Amendment Act of 1982, which resulted in a substantial increase in patenting fees at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Results from a series of difference-in-differences regressions suggest that the increase in fees led to a weeding out of low-quality patents. About 10% of patents in the lowest quality decile were filtered out, with the effect concentrated in the patents of firms whose overall patent portfolio was medium to large (more than 20 patents). The study has strong policy implications in the current context of concerns about declines in patent quality.","[de Rassenfosse, Gaetan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Chair Innovat & IP Policy, Coll Management Technol, Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Jaffe, Adam B.] Queensland Univ Technol, Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, Level 1,97 Cuba St,POB 24390, Wellington 6142, New Zealand; [Jaffe, Adam B.] Brandeis Univ, Level 1,97 Cuba St,POB 24390, Wellington 6142, New Zealand",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Brandeis University,"de Rassenfosse, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Chair Innovat & IP Policy, Coll Management Technol, Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",gaetan.derassenfosse@epfl.ch; adam.jaffe@motu.org.nz,"Jaffe, Adam/R-8313-2019; de Rassenfosse, Gaétan/A-3051-2009; de Rassenfosse, Gaétan/HJB-1549-2022; 胡, 巧爱/GXZ-8730-2022","Jaffe, Adam/0000-0003-1337-1751; de Rassenfosse, Gaétan/0000-0002-7862-0918;",Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne,Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne,"The research was supported by an Early Career Researcher grant from the Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne.

With smaller- and larger-revenue departments, revenue maximization predicts conference competitive imbalance. The larger the revenue dispersion, the greater the imbalance. Pooled revenue sharing increases the absolute level of talent and reduces competitive imbalance. That national championships are determined across conferences may explain the widespread adoption of nearly complete revenue sharing. The model also explains the form of the amateur requirement and predicts that competitive imbalance is invariant with respect to that amateur specification. This has obvious implications for balance-based arguments for or against increasing compensation to athletes.","[Fort, Rodney] Univ Michigan, Sport Management, 1402 Washington Hts,Rm 3150, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Fort, R (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sport Management, 1402 Washington Hts,Rm 3150, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",rodfort@umich.edu,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2016S1A2A2912186],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2016S1A2A2912186).,,40,2,4,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

J,"Lando, H; Mungan, MC",,,,"Lando, Henrik; Mungan, Murat C.",,,The effect of type-1 error on deterrence,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Type-1 errors; Wrongful convictions; Judicial errors; Crime and deterrence; Torts; Accuracy,LEGAL ERROR; PROOF; LITIGATION; PREPONDERANCE; STANDARDS; TRIALS; BURDEN; CRIME,"According to a conventional view, type-1 error (wrongful conviction) is as detrimental to deterrence as type-2 error (wrongful acquittal), because type-1 error lowers the pay-off from acting within the law. This view has led to the claim that the pro-defendant bias of criminal procedure, and its high standards of evidence, can be explained by the negative effect on deterrence of type-1 error. Adding new insights to some points made in the literature, we present a different view of the effect of type-1 error on deterrence, which seems incompatible with the claim. We thereby show that type-1 errors may not only lead to over deterrence or to the chilling of socially benign acts, rather than to under-deterrence, but also to a socially desirable increase in deterrence or to a socially desirable lowering of activity levels. Moreover, since type-1 and type-2 errors are defined as court errors, i.e. as conditional on deterrence, their effects on deterrence depend on the likelihood of adjudication. For harm-based sanctions, harm is a condition for adjudication, and so for tortious acts or for certain criminal acts, the effect of type-1 error is proportional to the likelihood of harm. Since harm occurs more rarely and for some crimes not at all when the lawful act is chosen, type-1 error conditional on adjudication affects deterrence less than type-2 error, and for some crimes not at all. For the latter crimes, type-1 errors concerning the identity of the offender may still be thought to either affect deterrence or to chill socially benign activities. However, we show, contrary to claims in the literature, that type-1 errors concerning identity do not in themselves lower deterrence and we argue that chilling of socially benign activities is not a general phenomenon and so cannot explain the high evidentiary standards of criminal law that apply uniformly.

This article reviews the development of Chinese modern corporations and corresponding policy changes. The development and expansion of modern corporations as a result of reforms that occurred after 1978 reveals the government's decision not to fully withdraw from the market. When private companies are allowed to pursue maximum profits, especially in areas of public resources and services, society and the environment suffer severe negative consequences. Case studies of corporate control of seed companies and water utilities demonstrate in detail the damage caused by privatization. In order to protect the interests of society from corruption, government must concentrate onreducing the rent-seeking behavior of corporations and collusionbetween businesses and government officials. The Chinese government's fight against corruption in recent years has been based on its market involvement, as well as on its determination to confine the power of corporations, which is a tough game.","[Zhang, Lanying] Southwest Univ, Inst Rural Reconstruct, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Li, Guanqi] Liangshuming Rural Reconstruct Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Huili] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China",Southwest University - China; China Agricultural University,"He, HL (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"Zhang, Lanying/I-1097-2014; wang, yixuan/JGM-3893-2023",,,,,,40,1,2,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

It applies the Net Present Value (NPV)-at-risk model tool which uses Monte Carlo Simulation taking into account the probability distributions for different input parameters, and gives uncertainty associated with NPV. Further, the model is applied to 30 real-world BOT highway projects to identify critical risks and discuss mitigation strategies. The critical contribution of the paper is towards applying a standard risk-analysis model (NPV-at-risk tool supported by Monte Carlo Simulation) to the real-world PPP based highway infrastructure projects. The application of the developed model can be used as a decision tool to judge the profitability of a project and make investment decisions in the bidding phase by the private investors. It also helps in identifying which source of uncertainty has the most influence on the project's financial returns and what is the actual relationship between the critical influencing parameters and associated NPV; this will be helpful to government agencies and public authorities to identify the factors that have largest impacts and consider the corresponding mitigation strategies.","[Kumar, Lakshya; Jindal, Apurva] Indian Inst Technol IIT Bombay, Civil Engn Dept, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Velaga, Nagendra R.] Indian Inst Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Transportat Syst Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Velaga, NR (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Transportat Syst Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.",n.r.velaga@iitb.ac.in,"Velaga, Nagendra R/D-2550-2012",,,,,,25,81,85,10,141,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The main controversy, however, is the fact that the ongoing empirical evidences on the relationship between innovation and economic growth are still mixed. The aim of this paper is to provide further evidence on the relationship between the NIS and economic growth using consistent and reliable data from a sample of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa [BRICS]). The research has a BRICS focus and constructs NIS using historical panel data set for the main variables, that is, university enrolment rate for science and engineering students, government research and development expenditure, high-tech export and the enclosure of control variables covering the period 2000Q1-2013Q4. The study employed a dynamic panel estimation technique with a view of evaluating the relative impact of the NIS on economic growth in BRICS. The results revealed that the NIS as a whole has a positive effect on economic growth in BRICS economies. An important policy implication emerging from this study is that extra efforts are needed by emerging economies to promote the development of a NIS so as to explore the potential growth-inducing effects of a well-functioning NIS. Consequently, findings from this study have offered some persuading indicators for BRICS economies to explore the development of a NIS as a potential opportunity to speed up their economic growth.","[Sesay, Brima; Zhao Yulin; Wang, Fang] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Sesay, B (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",brimasesay30@gmail.com,"Zhang, Bo/JVD-9890-2024; Sesay, Brima/AFL-4231-2022; García, Francisco/AAJ-5004-2021","Sesay, Brima/0000-0002-1353-1383;",China National Social Science Fund [11AzD081]; China National Natural Science Fund [71203172],China National Social Science Fund; China National Natural Science Fund(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge Professor Wei Long, Dean, School of Economics, Wuhan University of Technology, for his brilliant research assistance, and all anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

This behavior has provoked traditional market tenants that have been put at huge disadvantage. In response to that conflict, the municipal government of Bandung City decided to revitalize Kiaracondong market in 2017. Unexpectedly, this plan even adds more conflict between the three parties: municipal government, street vendors, and market tenants. This study aims to seek for stable solution for conflicts that rose from the revitalization plan of Kiaracondong market. The data used in the analysis are collected by interviewing the representative of street vendors, market tenants, and the municipal government of Bandung City. Then, the results are analyzed by using Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR). The results of stability and sensitivity analysis are also being discussed. Based on the analysis of the first phase of conflict, the stable solution found on which market tenants are suggested to hold the protest to municipal government about the behavior of street vendors. Meanwhile the street vendors are advised to continue to trade around Kiaracondong Market. In respect to stable solution for the second frame, market tenants are suggested to demand for free kiosk and approve market revitalization as planned by The Government of Bandung City.","[Alamanda, Dini Turipanam] Garut Univ, Fac Econ, Garut, Indonesia; [Wijoyo, Rahman W.; Prabowo, Fajar S.

It also explains the continuum between tacit and explicit knowledge throughout the innovation process. Symbolic knowledge has instilled Haute Cuisine and culinary tendencies, is a key element in its marketing and has allowed local cuisine to be branded internationally. The article aims to fill a research gap that has recently arisen on the existing tensions between idea creation and exploitation in Haute Cuisine innovation. The role of science appears as a tool that supports a chef's creativity but does not substitute or drive it. This paper fulfills an identified need to study the innovation processes of Haute Cuisine to which academia has dedicated scarce attention.

Advertising in the 21st century has become highly sophisticated. Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and mobile marketing have created seemingly unlimited opportunities for brands to reach customers and prospects with product information. Advertising and marketing messages are constantly delivered on mobile devices and people can be reached anywhere and at any time. The vast potentials of the Internet have, unfortunately, allowed brands to multiply the amount of messages targeting the consumers. Consequently, consumers tend to screen their exposure to promotional messages and ignore as much as possible unsolicited messages. There is a major need for brands to begin to engage the consumers and give them the opportunity of voluntarily participating in the conversation about a brand. This research, therefore, examines Coca-Cola's Taste the Feeling campaign. A survey was carried out among 357 students from six departments randomly selected from the three colleges in the Bells University of Technology. The respondents were purposively selected based on their participation in the campaign. The result reveals that there was a correlation between respondents' interest in the Taste the Feeling campaign due to social media engagement and their purchase of the Coca-Cola product.","[Amodu, Lanre; Archibong, Bright; Aririguzoh, Stella; Odiboh, Oscar] Covenant Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Coll Business & Social Sci, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University,"Amodu, L (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Coll Business & Social Sci, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria.",Lanre.amodu@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; archibright10@gmail.com; stella.aririguzoh@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; odion.odiboh@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"Odiboh, Oscar/AAS-6265-2021; ARIRIGUZOH, STELLA/M-7326-2019","ARIRIGUZOH, STELLA/0000-0002-7309-1519","Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria","Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria","We like to acknowledge Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria for sponsoring our participation in this conference.",,12,0,0,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7578,7584,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208057,0

Although innovation complementarity has been extensively tested in the empirical literature, it has not been analysed in conjunction with innovation persistence. This fact is mainly due to the lack of data sets able to provide adequate longitudinal information. The capacities to develop market-oriented behaviour and introduce new organisational innovations, together with technological innovation, are the drivers of a firm's productivity and profitability. We find that these activities complement technological innovation and that their impact is greater when they persist over time, thus introducing a more general concept of innovation persistence. We present an empirical model based on a large new panel of Italian manufacturing firms covering the period 2000-2012 which enables us to determine the precise impacts of a firm's innovative attitude, in a broad definition that incorporates non-technological innovation and persistence, on its productivity and profitability.","[Bartoloni, Eleonora] Italian Natl Inst Stat, ISTAT, Milan, Italy; [Bartoloni, Eleonora] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali, Parma, Italy; [Baussola, Maurizio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Sociali, Piacenza, Italy",University of Parma; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Bartoloni, E (通讯作者)，Italian Natl Inst Stat, ISTAT, Milan, Italy.;Bartoloni, E (通讯作者)，Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali, Parma, Italy.",bartolon@istat.it,"BARTOLONI, Eleonora/ABI-8204-2020","BARTOLONI, Eleonora/0000-0001-7720-4309; Baussola, MAURIZIO/0000-0003-2037-7836",,,,,61,18,19,3,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

While, in particular, low-educated Muslims became more geographically segregated and unemployed after the attacks, high-educated Muslims were affected most negatively in terms of their perceived integration.

As the practice of organizing interbudgetary relations shows, the share of interbudgetary transfers in the total volume of revenues, both budgets of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, and local budgets is constantly increasing.

However, while researchers have discussed large jumps theoretically, empirical evidence is lacking. Based on the gaps in the literature, this study examines how low-growth firms achieve large jumps and how such firms become high-growth firms by sustaining their growth momentum thereafter. By constructing a unique merged dataset of Korean manufacturing firms, we find that 24% of low-growth firms achieved large jumps and 27.4% of these maintained their growth momentum, becoming high-growth firms. The results show that R&D investment and R&D collaboration increase the probability of achieving large jumps. However, becoming a high-growth firm by sustaining the growth momentum after large jumps requires persistency of R&D investment and internal capabilities instead of collaboration. Our findings suggest management and policy implications to escape from the low-growth trap.","[Kang, Taewon; Lee, Jeong-Dong] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul, South Korea; [Baek, Chulwoo] Duksung Womens Univ, Dept Int Trade, 33 Samyangro,144 Gil, Seoul 132714, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Duksung Women's University,"Baek, C (通讯作者)，Duksung Womens Univ, Dept Int Trade, 33 Samyangro,144 Gil, Seoul 132714, South Korea.",chulwoo100@duksung.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A8016839],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2015S1A5A8016839).,,75,6,6,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This article supplements these accounts with insights from the work of post-structural geographers oriented toward the site. To this end, the article introduces the notion of the marketsite. Marketsites are points where heterogeneous elements are brought together and assembled in an effort to realize the conditions required for the performance of model markets and market subjectivities. Using the example of smart disclosure, the article argues that the use of disclosure labels to improve consumer decision making has transformed the point of sale and other transactional junctures into incipient marketsites-niches where various behavioral techniques are deployed to summon into being subjects who behave as if they were Homines economici. The behavioral turn in economics has focused the market-making efforts of a variety of actors on the market subject and strategic sites in people's everyday lives where they can be guided and nudged into alignment with market models. Together such marketsites delineate a new, and largely uncharted, geography of encounter between (behavioral) economic theory and actually existing markets. Drawing on fieldwork developing and testing a fee disclosure box for a prepaid debit card, I show that the production of marketsites, where Homo economicus can survive, is a messy process that rarely succeeds. Regardless, such efforts reveal valuable insights into how the behavioral turn in economics is reshaping the spatiality of market-making processes.","[Kear, Mark] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Kear, M (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",mkear@email.arizona.edu,,"Kear, Mark/0000-0003-3998-3481",Mission Asset Fund (MAF); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [752-2011-2326],Mission Asset Fund (MAF); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Thanks first go to the Mission Asset Fund (MAF) and its staff whom I worked with on the prepaid disclosure project.

The magnitudes I find suggest that a ten-percentage-point increase in the share of the non-White population (approximately one half of a standard deviation) is associated with 0.006 and 0.007 points reduction in life satisfaction on a four-point scale for White men and White women, respectively. For White men, this effect appears to be driven by the percentage of the population that is Black. I also find that a ten-percentage-point increase in the percentage of the immigrant population (approximately 2 standard deviations) is associated with 0.009 and 0.021 points reduction in life satisfaction for White men and White women, respectively. The percentage of the non-White population seems to reduce older Whites' life satisfaction more than that of younger Whites. Though the scale of the findings relating to the impact of local racial compositions and immigrant population is relatively modest, the findings may pose a challenge in the coming years as the percentage of the population that is non-White rises in the USA.","[Kuroki, Masanori] Arkansas Tech Univ, 106 West O St, Russellville, AR 72801 USA",Arkansas Tech University,"Kuroki, M (通讯作者)，Arkansas Tech Univ, 106 West O St, Russellville, AR 72801 USA.",mkuroki@atu.edu,,,,,,,51,5,6,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

We contribute to the literature by analyzing the market value of one of the world's most well defined fishing rights: the ownership of Swedish property where the fishing rights are an inseparable part of the real estate that can be traded in an open market. The fishing rights are primarily used for recreational fishing. For real estate that includes dwellings and vacation homes, the estimated value of these rights is about SEK 60,000 (about 6300), in 2016 prices. This corresponds to 4.5% of the average real estate value. However, the values are heterogeneous, and for real estate with agricultural and/or forestry land the value of the rights is less than SEK 10,000. This could be due to forest owners (as opposed to vacation home owners) primarily view the real estate as a means of generating economic returns, and the potential for this is low for fishing. The valuation of the right is expected to be a determinant of engagement in resource management and is thus important in the development of public policies for both the fish resource and recreational fisheries.

This article embarks on a critique of critique, whose aim is not to question this argument in general, but first, to reflect on its prerogatives, and second, to acknowledge that the relationship between a political-economic script and the techniques of governance into which it is translated are often more polymorphous than is assumed in much critical economic geographic work. I use the establishment of an agency for the procurement of studios and offices in Frankfurt, Germany, as an empirical example, and the four heuristic dimensions of articulation, representation, practices, and effects/projects as perspectives from which to grasp and map the heterogeneous effects of technologies of governance in the field of creativity policy. Reflecting on this example, I argue that market assemblages that aim to incorporate neoliberalism's Other can paradoxically conserve it and create grounds for new forms and positions of critique from the inside. This surely holds particularly true for the creative industries, with their peculiar forms of work organization, but it is also a general and often neglected implication of assemblage thinking that is becoming increasingly important in economic geography more broadly.","[Lindner, Peter] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Human Geog, PEG Gebaude Frankfurt Main, D-60329 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Lindner, P (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Human Geog, PEG Gebaude Frankfurt Main, D-60329 Frankfurt, Germany.",plindner@uni-frankfurt.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I want to thank the German Research Foundation (DFG) for its generous support, Iris Dzudzek for so many inspiring discussions, and the referees as well as the editor for their valuable comments!

Who were the people getting jobs in this expanding sector? And, how were their skills valued by employers as the sector evolved? Our findings suggest that sectoral evolution was not reflected in how the skills of incoming workers were valued, but rather in who was hired into the sector. The paper suggests that the analysis of worker inflows is a tool for investigating the evolution of both sectors and their knowledge bases. It provides some lessons for industrial and educational policies regarding technologically turbulent industries, and takes the first step towards developing an approach that integrates industry dynamics with labour force sourcing and evolution.","[Martynovich, Mikhail] Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Fac Social Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Henning, Martin] Gothenburg Univ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Ctr Reg Anal Econ Geog, Gothenburg, Sweden",Lund University; University of Gothenburg,"Martynovich, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Fac Social Sci, Lund, Sweden.",mikhail.martynovich@keg.lu.se,"Martynovich, Mikhail/AAZ-4092-2021","Martynovich, Mikhail/0000-0002-0776-480X",,,,,56,9,9,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

In connection with the objectives of this paper, the following research question was formulated: What is the organizational culture at organizations in the Czech Republic, and are there any significant differences in the evaluation of organizational culture that depend on the gender or age of the respondents? To determine the organizational culture at organizations in the Czech Republic, an extensive study (approximately 1,500 respondents) was carried out twice, in 2013 and 2015, in the form of a questionnaire survey - the Czech translation of Wallach's questionnaire (1983). Ellen J. Wallach has divided organizational cultures into three dimensions bureaucratic, supportive and innovative. According to the findings, the respondents understand and perceive the culture at organizations as rather bureaucratic and supportive. From their perspective, the characteristics of an innovative culture are not so noticeable. Based on the findings, we can conclude that gender differences did not prove to be significant for the individual dimensions of organizational cultures. By contrast, for most formulated hypotheses, age differences are significant for all three variables describing the given culture.","[Mohelska, Hana; Sokolova, Marcela] Univ Hradec Kralove, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003 3, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Mohelska, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003 3, Czech Republic.",hana.mohelska@uhk.cz; marcela.sokolova@uhk.cz,"Sokolová, Marcela/B-3452-2012","Sokolová, Marcela/0000-0002-0641-7750","Determinants Affecting Job Satisfaction - University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic [6/2017]","Determinants Affecting Job Satisfaction - University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic","The paper was written with the support of the specific project 6/2017 grant Determinants Affecting Job Satisfaction granted by the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic and thanks to the help of student Veronika Domtova.",,30,4,4,1,13,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

However, price remains a large barrier on zero emissions buses. The transition to use of such buses is expensive, and it must be driven by several stakeholders, thus motivating service providers to make efforts into the zero emissions buses implementation strategies. In this study, citizens from a Russian district capital city were questioned on their potential role as contributors for the zero emissions buses transition, by studying their willingness and attitudes to pay premium for the bus fares, in order to supplement the public transport agencies revenues. It was found that environmental concern and air pollution concern can be critical factors driving consumers into paying premium, but not noise pollution. In this article we seek to investigate how the consumers' attitudes and concerns over the environment and city pollution could influence the willingness to play a role as supporters for the introduction of zero emissions buses in the public transportation fleet, as understanding the consumer attitudes is essential to perform and run an efficient public system.","[Pedrosa, Gabriel] Univ Aveiro, Lisbon, Portugal; [Leontyeva, Yulia; Mayburov, Igor] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Universidade de Aveiro; Ural Federal University,"Pedrosa, G (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, Lisbon, Portugal.",gabriel.alp.ch@gmail.com; uv.leonteva@mail.ru; mayburov.home@gmail.com,"Mayburov, Igor/AAQ-4302-2020; Leontyeva, Yulia/AAS-8060-2020","Mayburov, Igor/0000-0001-8791-665X; Leontyeva, Yulia/0000-0003-4676-9926; Pedrosa, Gabriel/0000-0001-8463-7962",,,,,15,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,3665,3671,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525490800078,0

Moreover, this theme proves to be extremely representative for the accounting field, due to the fact that is stresses that differences do exist between accounting-based performance and market-based performance when addressing intellectual capital performance and organizational performance. At the same time, we believe that our scientific research has a primary role in understanding the mechanisms of intellectual capital generation at the level of organizations, but also in identifying and analyzing the role and influence of intellectual capital at the level of organizational performance, especially as the intellectual capital is one of the most important sources of organizational performance, in the new context of competitiveness development and competitive advantage of organizations. In addition, nowadays it turns out to be critical to be able to recognize and to measure intellectual capital in the accounting specific patterns and trends, which, in turn, might be the beginning of the process of revolutionizing the economy. Equally, it should be noted that in recent years it has been concluded that the tangible assets of an organization are only a part of its wealth or, if an extrapolation is desired, tangible assets of organizations are only a part of the wealth of the countries. In other words, it seems that the accounting value of the organizations was mistakenly perceived (or, if it is not desired to use that term, then incompletely, inaccurately), if it is to take into account the number of organizations that are no longer are today on the market (for example, as a result of their bankruptcy and the failure to anticipate their bankruptcy, so that action can be taken), or the number of organizations that are going through a period of economic and financial decline today. Therefore, it can be noted that the representation of accounting value at the level of organizations needs to be rethought, because some mistakes have been made between concepts such as the accounting value of organizations; the economic and financial strength of organizations; the power of organizations in general, in the sense of the future potential of organizations; medium-term and long-term continuity of organizational production processes, with direct reference to the potential of organizations to adapt to market demand and the ability to diversify their offer in real time in line with the new society-based approach on knowledge. In this context, the problems arising from the knowledge and the role of the intangible assets at the level of the organizations, and hence the importance of our approach, intervene in the debate and analysis.","[Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh.] Univ Craiova, Fac Econ & Business Adm, AI Cuza St 13, Craiova, Romania; [Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh.] Univ Bucharest, Dept Econ & Adm Sci, Fac Business & Adm, Regina Elisabeta Blvd 4-12,Sect 3, Bucharest, Romania; [Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh.] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Econ, Ion N Angelescu Bldg,Piata Romana 6,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania; [Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh.] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Management, Ion N Angelescu Bldg,Piata Romana 6,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania; [Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh.] Natl Inst Res & Dev Environm Protect INCDPM, Dept Nat & Technol Hazards, Splaiul Independentei 294,Sect 6, Bucharest, Romania",University of Craiova; University of Bucharest; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; National Institute Research & Development Environmental Protection INCDPM,"Popescu, CRG (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Fac Econ & Business Adm, AI Cuza St 13, Craiova, Romania.;Popescu, CRG (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Dept Econ & Adm Sci, Fac Business & Adm, Regina Elisabeta Blvd 4-12,Sect 3, Bucharest, Romania.;Popescu, CRG (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Econ, Ion N Angelescu Bldg,Piata Romana 6,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.;Popescu, CRG (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Management, Ion N Angelescu Bldg,Piata Romana 6,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.;Popescu, CRG (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Res & Dev Environm Protect INCDPM, Dept Nat & Technol Hazards, Splaiul Independentei 294,Sect 6, Bucharest, Romania.",popescu_cr@yahoo.com,"Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh./T-8658-2019","Popescu, Cristina Raluca Gh./0000-0002-5876-0550",,,,,35,2,2,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7045,7059,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208003,0

This paper examines the impact of (lack of) productivity growth, union bargaining power, and contracting out on cost escalation. We draw from a 17-year (1997-2014) and a 415-bus transit agency panel with 5780 observations by type of operation (directly operated by the agency or contracted out). We have three main findings: first, the unit cost increase in the transit sector is far worse than what economic theory predicts for industries with low productivity growth. Second, contracting out tends to reduce unit costs, and the results suggest that the costs savings from private operations can be only partly explained by lower wages in the private sector. Interestingly, we find that the cost savings from contracting out are larger when the transit agency also directly operates part of the total transit service. However, while overall unit costs are lower in contracted services, cost growth in large private bus operators is no different than cost growth in large public transit operators. Third, unique transit labor laws that lead to union bargaining power are a likely driver of the unit cost growth above inflation. Overall, these factors reflect inherent characteristics of the bus transit sector, such as the nature of low productivity growth and union legislative power related to the need for public subsidy. They drive increases in both transit fares and public subsidy at rates higher than inflation, and play an important role in the deterioration of transit agencies' financial sustainability.","[Sarriera, Javier Morales; Salvucci, Frederick P.; Zhao, Jinhua] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Zhao, JH (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",javierms@mit.edu; salvucci@mit.edu; jinhua@mit.edu,"Zhao, Jinhua/GYV-4433-2022","Zhao, Jinhua/0000-0002-1929-7583",US Department of Transportation New England University Transportation Center,US Department of Transportation New England University Transportation Center,We would like to thank the US Department of Transportation New England University Transportation Center for partially funding this research.,,21,5,6,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Marketers will have to acknowledge the new directives and they just cannot afford to ignore any part of it. As a first step for an ampler empirical research, in which we intend to find out how GDPR affects the customer relationship management (CRM), this paper aims to identify which are the main marketing topics that can be related to GDPR. We considered specific activities from marketing practices and tried to figure out if there are any correlations between these activities and GDPR in the online environment. In order to do so, we used some instruments for measuring the frequencies a marketing topic is related to GDPR, instruments such as Google trends and qualitative data analysis tools. The main marketing topics we proposed to analyze in correlation to GDPR were: branding, sales, marketing research, marketing strategy, social media, databases and, of course, CRM. Research findings proved that there are a series of marketing topics correlating to GDPR. Besides our search list of supposed words correlating to GDPR, we noted some other topics such as: MailChimp, WordPress and/or Amazon. We analyzed the GDPR searches on the Internet and considered to extract a general feeling regarding the specialists' attitude regarding the potential effects of GDPR on marketing, using sentimental analysis. The results of this research will be a foundation for our academic future research and a starting point for marketing practitioners preoccupied with respecting the personal data of their clients.","[Tarcza, Teodora-Mihaela; Popa, Adela-Laura] Univ Oradea, Oradea, Romania; [Nemteanu, Sefora Marcela] Babes Bolyai Univ, Cluj Napoca, Romania",University of Oradea; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Tarcza, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, Oradea, Romania.",ttarcza@uoradea.ro; apopa@uoradea.ro; sefora.sana@gmail.com,"TARCZA, Teodora Mihaela/AFK-6298-2022; Popa, Adela Laura/AAL-2397-2021; Nemteanu, Sefora/AAL-6527-2021","TARCZA, Teodora Mihaela/0000-0003-2138-4763; Popa, Adela Laura/0000-0001-6477-5778; Nemteanu, Sefora/0000-0002-7831-9041","Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI within PNCDI III [PN-III-P1-1.1-MC-2018-3247]","Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI within PNCDI III(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","This work was supported by a mobility grant of the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P1-1.1-MC-2018-3247, within PNCDI III.",,23,0,0,0,10,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2511,2521,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203056,0

As private enterprises have grown in China, private sector worker protests have been common. Three key factors have shaped this activism: (i) a disjuncture between benevolent and protective national laws and the lived experience of workers; (ii) fluctuations in the labour market; and (iii) generational shifts and learning among workers, employers and political authorities. The interplay of these factors has led protesting private sector workers to focus their ire on their employers and on occasion local political authorities, while viewing national political leaders as sources of worker support. These dynamics have had both positive and negative consequences for private sector workers and political authorities. Making comparisons with other authoritarian and communist states, this study adds to current understandings of how specific economic and political configurations engender particular characteristics of labour activism- and how these change over time.","[Wright, Teresa] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Polit Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Wright, T (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Polit Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",Teresa.wright@csulb.edu,,,,,,,47,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

For our study we employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The findings from our study show that in financial reporting there are 3 main financial figures that in conjunction describe a company's market position and it's ways of operating in the market. The results illustrate that the analysis of the company's financial reporting is the fastest and the most accurate indicator for realistic industry ranking and competitors market shares as well.","[Zaytseva, Irina A.] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Dept Mkt, Moscow, Russia",Plekhanov Russian University of Economics,"Zaytseva, IA (通讯作者)，Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Stremyanny Lane 36, Moscow 117997, Russia.",chaleurish@yandex.ru,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,UNIV MINHO,GUIMARAES,"CAMPUS AZUREM, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL",2183-3974,,978-989-97050-8-1,ICOPEV INT C PROJ EC,,,2018,,,,,,,221,224,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN0TO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000473533800037,0

Setting: The study was conducted in South Africa among farmer clients of a commercial financial organisation. Methods: The financial performance of the farmers was calculated by means of financial ratios which were used to compile a single performance indicator: operating efficiency. The operating efficiency indicator was calculated using a financial-based data envelopment analysis. An entrepreneurial competencies instrument was used to measure the entrepreneurial competencies of the farmers. Ordinary least squares regression was used within the principal component regression framework to explore the relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and financial performance. Results: The results indicate there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and financial performance of farmers. Each of the individual competencies also indicated positive correlation between the entrepreneurial competencies and financial performance. Conclusion: An increase in specific entrepreneurial competencies behaviour may increase the operating efficiency of the farm. Educational opportunities exist to educate farmers on the potential benefits of using entrepreneurial behaviour to their advantage (to benefit their operating efficiency). Sectors involved with agriculture, for example agricultural advisors, financial advisors and educational institutes, should emphasise the importance of utilising the competencies of farmers.","[Nieuwoudt, Simone; Henning, Johannes I.

It is clear that employers would thus look for employees who are capable of proactive adjustment and action-oriented behaviours. Aim: The aim of the study was to determine whether significant differences exist in the employability attributes of individuals from different gender, race and age groups and if so, how should such a diverse workforce should be managed. Setting: This study was conducted at a distance education institution. The sample of respondents consisted of adult learners who are pursuing further distance learning studies in the economic and management sciences field in South Africa. Methods: Correlational and inferential statistical analyses were used. A stratified random sample of 1102 mainly black and female adult learners participated in the study. Results: The employability attributes framework identified three categories of employability: interpersonal, intrapersonal and career attributes. The research indicated that significant differences exist between gender, race and age groups with regard to employability. Male and female participants differed significantly with regard to entrepreneurial orientation, proactivity and career resilience. The various race groups differed considerably regarding cultural competence and sociability of individuals. Participants older than 50 years scored the highest on self-efficacy. Conclusion and implications: The findings of this research could ensure that previously disadvantaged individuals are not further marginalised because of a lack of employability attributes and that the required employability attributes can be cultivated to ensure advancement and success in the work place.","[Botha, Jo-Anne; Coetzee, Mariette] Univ South Africa, Coll Econ & Management Sci, Dept Human Resource Management, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Coetzee, M (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Coll Econ & Management Sci, Dept Human Resource Management, Pretoria, South Africa.",coetzm@unisa.ac.za,"Botha, Jo-Anne/G-9035-2019","Botha, Jo-Anne/0000-0003-3718-2269",,,,,58,0,0,1,12,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Using data from a mixed-methods longitudinal study on special classes, we examine if special classes are operating as a form of segregation or inclusion for children with special educational needs. The findings suggest that special classes only operate as a unit of inclusion where children have severe needs. For children with moderate or mild needs, the findings are less clear with some classes operating as a segregated setting or low stream class with no official sanction resulting in issues around teacher competency and stigma among students.","[Banks, Joanne; Mccoy, Selina] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Banks, J; Mccoy, S (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",joanne.banks@esri.ie; Selina.McCoy@esri.ie,"McCoy, Selina/ABC-9817-2020; Banks, Joanne/B-1073-2019","McCoy, Selina/0000-0001-8774-4018; Banks, Joanne/0000-0003-2322-662X",National Council for Special Education (NCSE),National Council for Special Education (NCSE),The paper draws on data collected as part of the National Study of Special Classes funded by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).,,47,12,13,1,7,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Using U.S. patent data, I show that firm headquarters disproportionately source knowledge from third parties in remote locations where they have an R&D satellite. This satellite effect on knowledge flow is economically significant, representing up to 60% of the knowledge-flow premium associated with collocation. Furthermore, the effect seems to be stronger for recent knowledge, as well as in areas of satellite technological specialization, suggesting that firms can target cutting-edge knowledge in specific sectors. In addition, the results show that firms with stronger internal linkages between headquarters and satellites, and those that staff satellites with inventors that previously patented while at other local firms, experience a larger satellite effect on knowledge acquisition.","[Blit, Joel] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Blit, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",jblit@uwaterloo.ca,,,"NBER Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship Program; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Martin Prosperity Institute's Program on Innovation and Creative Industries","NBER Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship Program; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Martin Prosperity Institute's Program on Innovation and Creative Industries","I am grateful to Ajay Agrawal, Ignatius Horstmann, Joanne Oxley, and Daniel Trefler for their indispensable guidance.

We discuss in detail an important question that so far has not received attention in the literature on port governance : how can the public shareholders use their influence as shareholders of port authorities to achieve public policy goals. We advance the theoretical body of knowledge by applying insights from regulatory economics to the port industry. As an empirical illustration, we analyse the current practices of the public shareholders of the four large Dutch port authorities, based on policy documents and interviews. All of them have explicit shareholder policies. However, some of these policies are too broad to provide sufficient direction for the management team and supervisory board of the port authority involved.","[de Langen, Peter W.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [de Langen, Peter W.] Port & Logist Advisory, Copenhagen, Denmark; [van der Lugt, Larissa M.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus UPT, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Copenhagen Business School; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"de Langen, PW (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark.;de Langen, PW (通讯作者)，Port & Logist Advisory, Copenhagen, Denmark.",peter@pl-advisory.com; vanderlugt@ese.eur.nl,"de langen, peter w/U-3588-2018; langen, peter d/G-3823-2011","de langen, peter w/0000-0002-7703-5370;",,,,,48,4,4,1,9,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

One important change, known as price impact, relates to how trading affects prices. Price impact represents the largest cost associated with trading. Forecasting price impact is very important as it can provide estimates of trading profits after costs and also suggest optimal execution strategies. Although several models have recently been developed which may forecast the immediate price impact of individual trades, limited work has been done to compare their relative performance. We provide a comprehensive performance evaluation of these models and test for statistically significant outperformance amongst candidate models using out-of-sample forecasts. We find that normalizing price impact by its average value significantly enhances the performance of traditional non-normalized models as the normalization factor captures some of the dynamics of price impact.

An individual may avail of several platform-based amenities at a railway station, satisfaction out of which is assumed to be of paramount significance. Hence this study measures satisfaction that passengers gain out of such amenities through a survey conducted at Kanpur Central station of North Central Railway in India. Regression analysis has been applied to determine a model of passenger satisfaction, following which, a service quality performance matrix (SQPM) is constructed to demarcate between amenities that need to be improved and those that may be maintained. Finally a User Satisfaction Index (USI) is built based on Customer Satisfaction Index to define a priority order for improving amenities. Regression results show 5 out of 7 factors significant in predicting passenger satisfaction. Out of the 26 amenities under improvement zone of SQPM, the top 5 that need to be improved as per USI include 3 related to cleanliness and hygiene. Findings point towards abysmal condition of Kanpur Central, which falls in the prestigious Al category of stations of Indian Railways. The validated model as an outcome of this paper is expected to be useful for policy makers in defining policies and strategies for improving platform-based amenities. Further, the CSI we have constructed would provide a framework to formulate improvement action plans on priority basis by Indian Railways.","[Ghosh, Piyali] Indian Inst Management Ranchi, Jharkhand 834008, India; [Ojha, Mohit Kr.; Geetika] Motilal Nehru Natl Inst Technol Allahabad, Sch Management Studies, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ranchi; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology,"Ghosh, P (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Ranchi, Jharkhand 834008, India.",piyali.ghosh@iimranchi.ac.in,"Ojha, Mohit/GRX-7893-2022","Ojha, Mohit/0000-0002-7793-6953",,,,,95,14,15,4,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We investigate the route-level impact of low-cost carrier (LCC) entries on air travel demand and incumbents' strategic responses. We use a panel of airline-level data for each of the three Jeju Island routes, covering the 2006-2010 period, and find evidence for a common sensitivity to price across routes, but a route-specific response to flight characteristics. Air passengers favor frequent flights and larger aircraft. Moreover, departure flight schedules that are more spread out throughout the day provide higher utility for air passengers on high-volume routes. In the post-deregulation period, both legacy carriers lost sales on high-volume routes to emerging independent LCCs, but partly recouped those losses through their own subsidiary LCCs (dependent LCCs), by either replacing their previous services with their own LCCs or flying under a two-brand strategy. We empirically divide the price-cost markups into an own product-specific effect and a multiproduct firm-specific effect. This expansion of independent LCCs accounts for a substantial proportion of the two legacy carriers' profit reductions, whereas the magnitude of the estimated profit losses varies widely depending on their strategic responses. In summary, the legacy carriers' post-deregulation competitive behavior is far from collusive.","[Sun, Joo Yeon] Yonsei Univ, Global Leadership Div, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Sun, JY (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Global Leadership Div, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",jysun@yonsei.ac.kr,,"Sun, Joo Yeon/0000-0002-7368-0129",,,,,25,2,3,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

For the top 101 largest US urban centers, congestion generated 4.8 billion hours of travel delays in 2011, up from 1.1 billion hours in 1982. Congestion also required 8.419 million cubic meters of excess fuel consumption in 2011, up from 1.73 million cubic meters in 1982. Filially, the excess CO2 emitted from congestion amounted to 19.524 billion kilograms in 2011, up from 3.94 billion kilograms in 1982. We examined the scaling relationships between the population sizes of urban centers and traffic congestion for four subgroups of urban centers with varying population sizes. We found that scaling relationships were superlinear for most subgroups. However, for the subgroup comprising mega cities with populations of over 3 million people, the relationship was linear. The varying scaling relationships we found for cities with different population sizes may resolve the contradictory scaling results reported in the extant literature. Several other implications from our findings are also discussed.","[Chang, Yu Sang; Lee, Yong Joo; Choi, Sung Sup Brian] Gachon Univ, Dept Global Business, Seongnam, South Korea",Gachon University,"Lee, YJ (通讯作者)，Gachon Univ, Dept Global Business, Seongnam, South Korea.",yjlee5702@gachon.ac.kr,,,,,,,27,41,45,1,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We estimate Bayesian structured time series models (STM) fully and recursively for 34 countries and evaluate whether these state components and related indicators can anticipate crises over the following three years. Using an early warning framework similar to the original BCBS one, we find leading indicators that outperform the credit-to-GDP gap in anticipating banking crises, with lower noise-to-signal (NS) ratios and similar sensitivities to threshold variation (assessed using receiver operational characteristics (ROC)). Moreover, the credit-to-GDP gap fails an exercise using limited information, suggesting that the 10% anchor on this indicator that was put forward by the BCBS can be misleading in countries with short credit series.

The impact of the current financial crisis on the Greek automobile market was also taken into account. The results show that fuel prices Granger cause total car sales. The results also indicate the absence of long run cointegrating relationships among the variables. The full blown model shows that demand for new automobiles depends on the existing social, financial and political conditions of the local economy and that the various shocks observed have a temporary medium-run character on car sales, whereas the system is found to be stable.","[Konstantakis, Konstantinos N.; Milioti, Christina; Michaelides, Panayotis G.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Michaelides, Panayotis G.] London Sch Econ, System Risk Ctr, London, England",National Technical University of Athens; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Michaelides, PG (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Theoret & Appl Econ, Sch Appl Math & Phys, Heroon Polytechneiou 9, Athens 15780, Greece.",pmichael@central.ntua.gr,"Konstantakis, Konstantinos/F-1726-2019; Konstantakis, Konstantinos N./AED-3089-2022; Milioti, Christina/AAS-5074-2021","Konstantakis, Konstantinos N./0000-0001-6837-332X;",ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,35,8,9,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

For connecting passengers, we find that antitrust immune alliances (ATIs) generate fare reductions (relative to interline or simple codeshare itineraries), although these reductions are not significantly larger than those generated by alliances without antitrust immunity. In contrast, metal neutral joint ventures (JVs) lead to substantially larger fare reductions, similar to those associated with online service in which a single carrier serves the entire connecting itinerary. For nonstop passengers we find that the formation of an ATI or JV between two or more airlines serving a route does not generate higher fares. Finally, we find that ATIs and JVs are associated with increased segment traffic and net entry on routes. Our results collectively demonstrate that, on the whole, ATI grants-particularly when coupled with the formation of JVs-have been strongly procompetitive, generating lower fares on connecting routes and increased traffic on segments served by multiple alliance partners, with no associated increase in nonstop fares where partner airlines overlap operations.","[Calzaretta, Robert J., Jr.; Israel, Mark A.] Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC 20004 USA; [Eilat, Yair] Israeli Antitrust Author, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Calzaretta, RJ (通讯作者)，Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC 20004 USA.",bcalzaretta@compasslexecon.com; eilatyair@gmail.com; misrael@compasslexecon.com,,,"American Airlines, Inc.","American Airlines, Inc.","Senior Managing Director, Compass Lexecon.

We find that more targeting increases competition and reduces the web sites' profits, but yet in equilibrium web sites choose maximum targeting as they cannot credibly commit to low targeting. A privacy protection policy can be beneficial for both consumers and web sites. If consumers are heterogeneous in their concerns for privacy, a policy that allows choice between two levels of privacy will be better. Optimal privacy protection takes into account that the more intense competition on the high-targeting market segment also benefits consumers on the less competitive segment.

The New Economic Geography (NEG) suggests that the concentration of economic activities is determined by 'centripetal' and 'centrifugal' forces which in turn determine the balance between the economic and geographical core and periphery regions. Transport can, and should be, understood as the balancing factor between these forces. In order to take a snapshot of core-periphery relation in a country, travel patterns between centre and periphery in Israel in 2007 are analysed using Mobile Phone signal tracking. Results show that despite Israel being a very small country the level of inter-regional travel as a proportion of overall travel is small. Furthermore, despite the clear economic core in Israel (the Metropolitan area of Tel Aviv), the periphery regions seem to remain independent. Yet, analysis of the inter-regional travel that does take place suggests a greater dependence of (travel from) the periphery to the centre than vice versa. This in turn suggests that investments in more long-distance transport infrastructure in Israel would further increase the dependency of the periphery on the centre and could increase core-periphery disparities.

The novelty of the study lies in the comparison of the estimates between seasons, and the inclusion of delay costs when assessing the total social costs of accidents for private motor vehicles and heavy vehicles. Increasing congestion in urban areas has motivated researchers' interest in studying the cost of delays due to accidents. However, still many countries, such as Norway, do not include delay costs when estimating the social costs of road accidents. In this study, we show that these costs can constitute a significant proportion of the social costs of accidents in rural, areas, particularly during winter in regions with strong seasonal variations. The delay costs on the studied road section constituted on average 10% of total annual social costs of accidents, and were nearly 70% higher than the accidents' material costs. By including these inconvenience costs, we would achieve better estimates of the social costs of accidents, which would in turn give rise to more accurate assessments of the costs and benefits of accident reduction measures, as well as measures reducing the response time when accidents happen. Many road safety measures have been aimed at reducing accidents involving death and serious injury. This analysis shows that it can also be beneficial to take measures to reduce the number of less severe accidents, particularly in rural areas where delay costs can be high when the roads are closed because of accidents. It is thus, particularly important that such costs are included in project assessment tools to ensure that rural areas do not lose the fight for road investments.","[Bardal, Kjersti Granas; Jorgensen, Finn] Nord Univ, Business Sch, N-8049 Bodo, Norway",Nord University,"Bardal, KG (通讯作者)，Nord Univ, Business Sch, N-8049 Bodo, Norway.",kjersti.g.bardal@nord.no,,,County Administration of Nordland [273/09]; Norwegian Public Roads Administration,County Administration of Nordland; Norwegian Public Roads Administration,This work has partly been funded by the County Administration of Nordland (273/09) and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration.

It makes this argument by describing and analysing some of the authors' emotional experiences in the process of becoming a geographer of sexuality during PhD research. Taking felt embeddedness seriously in our writings moves us away from simply describing how research made us feel, to examining how these feelings and our negotiations of them generate more complex understandings of the impact of positionalities, political commitments and institutional situatedness on the conduct and indeed the feel of research processes. In this way, emotion does not simply liven up how we report our research, but is itself treated as a key ingredient in the production of geographical knowledge.","[Catungal, John Paul] Univ British Columbia, Inst Gender Race Sexual & Social Justice, 038-2080 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Catungal, JP (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Inst Gender Race Sexual & Social Justice, 038-2080 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",catungal@mail.ubc.ca,,,,,,,37,10,12,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The reform strived toward facilitating the patent system. But soon it was also blamed for facilitating immoral third party profits. Urges for revision of the America Invents Act became even louder since hedge fund manager Kyle Bass had publicly outlined his questionable investment strategy: he challenges the validity of important drug patents, while shorting the owner's shares in order to eventually cash out on negative stock movements. The following questions aroused public interest the most: Does the mere filing of a patent opposition already result in negative stock returns? And is it really possible to earn money following such a strategy? The paper on hand is the first to empirically answer these questions. Event study methodology using three years of data from the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board was employed. Findings were that the mere filing of a patent opposition in fact produces statistically significant negative returns. The result is robust with the abnormal return being 30 base points. In addition, multiple linear regression results confirm the conjecture that the higher the importance of the disputed patent, the higher the negative abnormal return on the filing date will be. However, transaction cost simulations prove that this strategy is still highly speculative and cannot be considered a real threat to patent holders or the US intellectual property system. The only ones who should start worrying are the few patent owners who really rely on absolutely unjustified and tenuous patent protection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The selected manager's effort improves the project's potential environment, and is a hidden action. The realized project environment is the entrepreneur's private information. A manager's utility has two components-(i) loyalty, with which the manager values the organization's profit, and (ii) selfishness, with which the manager values the monetary transfer he receives from the entrepreneur. We find that if the manager's task is easy enough, it is optimal to use a purely loyal manager. Otherwise, it can be optimal to use a manager with mixture of loyalty and selfishness- the manager's mixed motivation alleviates the entrepreneur's misrepresenting incentive, and as a result, the output distortion in the optimal contract can be reduced. In addition, when it is optimal to use a manager with mixed motivations, the entrepreneur selects someone who is more selfish than loyal.","[Shin, Dongsoo] Santa Clara Univ, Leavey Sch Business, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Santa Clara University,"Shin, D (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Leavey Sch Business, Dept Econ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",dshin@scu.edu,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

While the goals of these transfers are to alleviate current poverty as well as to improve human capital capacity, they also have unintended effects, positive or negative, on beneficiary households. A question that has not been adequately addressed in the literature is the role that social grants play in the efforts to commercialise smallholder farming. Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of social grant dependency on the incentives of smallholder maize producers to participate in the market. Setting: The study was done in the rural areas of four districts (Harry Gwala, Umzinyathi, Umkhanyakude and Uthukela) in the KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Methods: The study adopted a quantitative research design. A total of 984 households were randomly selected from the four districts, of which 774 had planted maize in the previous season. The analysis was done on the 774 farmers who had planted maize. The double-hurdle model was used for statistical analysis. Results: The results show a negative association between social grant dependency and market participation, suggesting that social grant-dependent households are more subsistent, producing less marketable surplus. Moreover, households with access to social grants sold less quantities of maize in the market, indicating reduced selling incentives. Conclusion: The study indicates that social grants reduce the incentives of smallholder farmers to commercialise their production activities. The results suggest that, while policies aimed at reducing transaction costs would increase smallholder market participation, attention should be paid on how to reduce social grants' dis-incentive effects. To reduce spill over effects to unintended household members, the study recommends offering part of the grant as ` in-kind support', which is specific to the intended individual beneficiary.","[Sinyolo, Sikhulumile] Human Sci Res Council, Econ Performance & Dev, Pretoria, South Africa; [Mudhara, Maxwell; Wale, Edilegnaw] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Discipline Agr Econ, Durban, South Africa",Human Sciences Research Council-South Africa; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Sinyolo, S (通讯作者)，Human Sci Res Council, Econ Performance & Dev, Pretoria, South Africa.",sksinyolo@gmail.com,"Wale, Edilegnaw/AAC-9048-2021; Wale, Edilegnaw/N-5292-2013; Zegeye, Edilegnaw Wale/JXY-0016-2024; Sinyolo, Sikhulumile/F-8769-2018","Wale, Edilegnaw/0000-0003-4705-7971; Wale, Edilegnaw/0000-0003-4705-7971; Sinyolo, Sikhulumile/0000-0001-9324-081X; Mudhara, Maxwell/0000-0001-8739-0811",,,,,68,14,15,1,6,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Natural conditions that were favorable for the development of civilization have been degraded. Climate change has begun to disrupt ecosystems and is likely to undermine agricultural and industrial production, reducing the ability of the global economy to support a growing population. Under these dire conditions, it is imperative that colleges and universities transform themselves into institutions organized around transdisciplinary programs in sustainability science. The curriculum should be oriented around training the future workforce in skills that will be needed in new institutions that seek to adapt proactively to natural systems as they are transformed. Those skills will involve learning to address the dynamic changes of the biosphere rather simply attempting to preserve and restore natural systems to some desired previous condition. Every institutionpolitical, legal, economic, medical, and scientificwill need to be re-aligned to achieve sustainability. Higher education is currently failing to meet this mandate. Sustainability science remains on the margins of academic life, with few resources and little prestige. Faculty are still primarily oriented toward the questions raised within their disciplinary specialties, not toward tasks associated with transdisciplinary problem solving. Reframing higher education to meet the challenges of the environmental century is going to require a revolution in the purposes and structures of the university.","[Mulkey, Stephen] Unity Coll, Unity, ME 04988 USA",,"Mulkey, S (通讯作者)，Unity Coll, Unity, ME 04988 USA.",,,,Unity College Board of Trustees; Board of Directors of the American Association for Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education; University of Idaho Environmental Sciences Program; School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Florida,Unity College Board of Trustees; Board of Directors of the American Association for Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education; University of Idaho Environmental Sciences Program; School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Florida,"The author acknowledges the support and engagement of the Unity College Board of Trustees, the Board of Directors of the American Association for Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, the University of Idaho Environmental Sciences Program, and the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Florida.",,34,1,2,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The analysis is based on a shop survey of 475 products with N&H claims, conducted in six Western Balkan countries (WBC). Statistical inference is derived from the results of the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests as well as the Dunn post-test for all pairwise comparisons as a form of simultaneous nonparametric inference.

So that policy makers can be benefited from this research. Thus, this research will also evaluate the performance of ARMA, and Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) forecasting models for KIBOR in case of Pakistan. Karachi Inter Bank Offer Rates (KIBOR) is the average interest rate at which banks want to lend money to other banks. KIBOR as a benchmark, to encourage transparency, to promote consistency in market based pricing and to improve management of the market risk undertaken by banks. Researchers have used 6-month rates of KIBOR; data is of 4 years from 2012 to 2015. Therefore, keeping in view of the importance of KIBOR, the objective of this research is to forecast, Karachi Inter Bank Offer Rates (KIBOR) using time series autoregressive moving average (ARMA), Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) model. The study is significant at 1%, the forecasting of rates shows that the rates are very close to the actual one and it further concluded that the applied model Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) is perfect for the forecasting. The results of AIC revealed that there is no evidence of autocorrelation and there is no sample error and the model is useful and robust. It is finally concluded that the forecasting of KIBOR rates by ARIMA (Box-Jenkins) model is very helpful for policy makers. The results extracted from this model are reliable for making any forecasting and also beneficial for government functionaries, financial experts and policy makers of financial institutions in order to device their future strategies.","[Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem] Indus Univ, Fac Management Sci, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Vveinhardt, Jolita; Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ahmad, Nawaz] Fac Management Sci, Inst Business Management, Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University,"Ahmed, RR (通讯作者)，Indus Univ, Fac Management Sci, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.",rizwanraheemahmed@gmail.com; jolita.vveinhardt@gmail.com; nawazahmad_pk@hotmail.com; dalia.streimikiene@lei.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Ahmad, Dr Nawaz/J-5017-2019; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912; Ahmad, Dr Nawaz/0000-0002-6029-7868; Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502",,,,,33,2,2,3,15,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Our finding is robust to alternative definitions of ethnic diversity and to the non-random selection of natives and immigrants into regions. The positive effect of ethnic diversity is stronger for immigrant groups that are culturally and economically closer to Germany. Consistent with this result, we document the existence of two mechanisms explaining the influence of ethnic diversity on well-being: productivity-as captured by immigrants' skills and assimilation-and social capital-particularly in relation to the creation of a multicultural environment.","[Akay, Alpaslan] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Constant, Amelie] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Giulietti, Corrado] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Guzi, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic",University of Gothenburg; Princeton University; University of Southampton; Masaryk University Brno,"Giulietti, C (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England.",alpaslan.akay@gu.se; afconstant299@gmail.com; c.giulietti@soton.ac.uk; martin.guzi@econ.muni.cz,"Guzi, Martin/P-2662-2014","Guzi, Martin/0000-0001-9936-3175",,,,,62,53,55,3,70,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

According to Knapkova, Homolka and Pavelkova (2014), this model is used only by 13% of the enterprises in the Czech Republic. BSC monitors business performance from four perspectives: Financial, Customer, Internal Process, Learning and Growth. The main aim of this paper is to verify whether there is a correlation between Learning and Growth and Financial perspective. Data were obtained from the database Albertina Gold and from quantitative research in companies in 2015. As sample small and medium enterprises in Czech Republic were chosen by random selection. Data were analysed by using regression analysis. Based on the analysis the dependence of some financial indicators on the attitude of the company to the risk and on long-term or short-term orientation was proved. BSC is spread in 30-50% companies all over the word, in Australia this method is used even in 88% companies (Al Sawalqa, Holloway and Alam, 2011).

An earlier and more pronounced effect lies in the lower number of transactions resulting in the scarcity of sales that characterizes several sub-markets, including the one concerning the manufacturing buildings. Within the real-estate appraisal discipline, the aforementioned framework entails growing difficulties-if not even the inability-to find an appropriate number of so-called comparables, to implement the market-value estimation process. This condition involves the need to identify alternative estimation procedures. Some specific features of manufacturing buildings pave the way to the adoption of the Depreciated Replacement Cost method. Indeed, due to the evolution of the construction techniques, the old factory buildings are frequently classed as 'out of production'. Meanwhile, the poor market conditions make them prone to be treated as out of the market. The depreciated replacement cost procedure has been debated occasionally within the literature, both national and international. Nonetheless, its application still deserves further research due to the fact that it entails several relevant issues. This study focuses on three of them. The first concerns the estimation of the useful life and the residual life of the buildings characterized by heterogeneous structures, finishes, and installations, due to their realization or replacement during different time periods. The second topic refers to the distinction between land value and improvement value. Finally, the third issue relates to the relationships among the results of the estimation procedure, the real-estate appraisal discipline as a whole, and the accounting principles, on which companies' balance sheets rely.","[Copiello, Sergio; Stanghellini, Stefano] Univ IUAV Venice, Dept Design & Planning, Dorsoduro 2206, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Cosmi, Valentina] Univ Ferrara, Dept Architecture, Via Ghiara 36, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy",IUAV University Venice; University of Ferrara,"Copiello, S (通讯作者)，Univ IUAV Venice, Dept Design & Planning, Dorsoduro 2206, I-30123 Venice, Italy.",copiello@iuav.it,"Copiello, Sergio/P-4237-2014","Copiello, Sergio/0000-0002-1975-6620",,,,,29,3,4,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,15,26,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_2,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600002,0

A recent study by Mather Communications among Czech managers shows that such Green marketing mainly helps to build trust in a brand, to increase the overall value of the company on the market and to increase its success among consumers. Further, Green marketing may result in a reduction of operating costs and an improvement of brand image and can increase sales and the company's market share. This paper deals with the application of green marketing at Tchibo GmbH, which has offices in Germany and in the Czech Republic. It describes the green marketing mix, which differs in some aspects on each of the two markets. Tchibo GmbH has made efforts to make its coffee capsules environmentally friendlier. At the moment, Tchibo now offers capsules that are 100 % recyclable, but unfortunately these are still only available in Germany. The paper discusses further differences in the use of the green marketing mix in the Czech Republic and Germany.","[Dedkova, Jaroslava] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Dedková, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",jaroslava.dedkova@tul.cz,"Dědková, Jaroslava/HLP-4960-2023","Dědková, Jaroslava/0000-0002-1560-9973",Faculty of Economics of the Technical University of Liberec,Faculty of Economics of the Technical University of Liberec,"This article was written as part of a project to support research teams of excellence at the Faculty of Economics of the Technical University of Liberec, which is financed by institutional support for long-term conceptual development at the Faculty of Economics of the Technical University of Liberec.",,29,0,0,1,4,VERLAG GUC-GESELLSCHAFT UNTERNEHMENSRECHNUNG CONTROLLING M B H,LOBNITZ,"STEINWEG 32, LOBNITZ, D-08294, GERMANY",,,978-3-86367-051-1,GUC FACHB,,,2017,33,,,,,,31,38,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6KP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426794300003,0

The object of the paper is to contribute to the discussion about the Chinese economy and to find out how China fulfilled its WTO trade commitments in the area of state regulation in the period 2001-2015, i.e. after 15 years since its entrance into the WTO. The intention of this paper is to point out the fact that although China made trade commitments in the WTO and gradually liberalised its trade regime, some sensitive areas of the Chinese economy remained under the influence of the state and local organs. However, the research carried out in the area of state trading, price controls and state enterprises in China showed that the realisation of these forms of state influence is in principle in compliance with China's commitments in the WTO, with the exception of the government support of state-owned enterprises. A qualitative research was carried out through the logical methods using official documents and data published by the WTO and the Chinese authorities.","[Fojtikova, Lenka] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Havlickovonab 38a, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Fojtíková, L (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Havlickovonab 38a, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.",lenka.fojtikova@vsb.cz,"Fojtikova, Lenka/JCD-8885-2023",,Czech Science Foundation [17-22426S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation, project No. [17-22426S] Law Aspects of China's Incorporation into the Global Trade System.",,18,1,1,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,241,250,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200026,0

It argues that both of these markers of malnutrition were interpreted under the Conservative-led governments of David Cameron (2010-2016) as failings of personal responsibility and identified primarily with the working class, advancing the assumption that poor people make poor choices. Based on a critique of this account, our wider contribution is two-fold. First, we identify the Hayekian lineage of the discourse of personal responsibility, highlighting its utility in facilitating a form of neoliberal market consent through its insistence on self-reliance. Second, we stake out an alternative to this conceptualization through a discussion of Adam Smith's notion of self-command, which we call interpersonal responsibility.","[Glaze, Simon] Univ Warwick, Ctr Lifelong Learning, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Richardson, Ben] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick; University of Warwick,"Glaze, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Ctr Lifelong Learning, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",s.glaze@warwick.ac.uk; b.j.richardson@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,96,11,11,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The U-shaped relationship between age and happiness held in 44 of the 46 countries, and a reverse U held for stress in almost as many.

Instead of focusing on the potential rights of the unborn, politically powerful pro-natalist activists and their less influential neo-Malthusian adversaries debated the need for larger populations, the role of abortion in facilitating sexual immorality, and the economics of single motherhood. The fetus was largely ignored as most French people continued to hold pre-modern views of abortion prior to fetal movement as the morally neutral act of restoring delayed menstruation.

The concept of region has been defined in a number of ways, depending on the perspective, e.g., geographic, economic, social, statistical, etc. The European Union has established a common classification of territorial units for statistics, known as 'NUTS' (based on which Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics of the Central Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Croatia, i.e. NUTS:HR was developed). 'The NUTS nomenclature, which subdivides national territory into regions, facilitates the use of structural funds, on which this paper focuses. Croatia has undergone the regionalisation process several times, having been divided into five NUTS regions initially; it now has two, i.e. three. In order to achieve a more equitable distribution of available funds, increase regional competitiveness and promote development, it is important to adequately subdivide the Croatian territory into NUTS regions. The current subdivision has enabled Osijek-Baranja County, which forms part o Pannonian Croatia, to absorb a signi cant amount of pre-accession funds. Upon accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union, it continued to withdraw consid- erable funds, thus giving an example of good practice that other counties in Croatia should follow. The European Union offers Slavonia new opportunities for development, as coOrmed by the official data of the Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds on the availability of EUR 10.7 billion from EU funds, Opportunities for withdrawal of funds are ample; however, in order to facilitate cooperation between the EU and Croatia, it is necessary to raise the level of expertise and professional skills for the staff dealing with these issues in Croatia.","[Medic, Mane; Hadrovic Zekic, Blazenka] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Medic, M (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",medic.mane@gmail.com; hadrovic@efos.hr; vedrana.sabljo@gmail.com,"Zekic, Blazenka Hadrovic/L-5472-2013","Zekic, Blazenka Hadrovic/0000-0001-6016-2990",,,,,3,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13,,,,,,1060,1077,,,,,,18,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000068,0

The aim of this study was to determine the role and importance of managerial education of governing structures of the university and its constituent units in the field of quality assurance in higher education. This study was constituted as a cross-sectional study and was carried out at 25% of Croatian public universities, from June to September 2015 by means of a specially designed questionnaire, and through the analysis of the results of external evaluation in the field of governance and quality assurance in higher education for every single constituent unit of the mentioned universities. The study showed that there is a connection between the formal education in the field of organization and governance of the management board members of Croatian universities and their success in governance and establishing of an adequate system of quality assurance in higher education at the universities they are employed at, this interrelation being very complex ant influenced by a wide range of other factors which are yet to be determined. Thus, further consideration of the issue which is of utmost importance in Croatia is necessary, taking into consideration that contemporary Croatian universities have to not only develop a sufficient number of good and precisely elaborated ideas for changes, but also ensure that these are put into practice in a consistent and sustainable manner, because only by using this approach will these universities become distinctive as serious candidates in the global field of science and higher education.","[Miskulin, Ivan] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Med Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Legcevic, Jelena] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Crnkovic, Boris] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Miskulin, I (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Med Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",ivan.miskulin@mefos.hr; legcevic@pravos.hr; bcrnko@efos.hr,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13,,,,,,367,378,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000024,0

The first subset direct administrative costs are the direct costs of the public sector. The second subset the compliance costs of taxation are the indirect expenses of the private sector connected with paying taxes. This paper focuses on the compliance costs of taxation with the goal to assess the level of compliance costs of the private sector for income taxation and compliance costs for employers connected with the administration of salaries and social contributions in Slovakia. The results, based on 2011 data show that Slovak businesses have very high costs connected with paying the taxes - compared to other developed countries and also to Slovakia's neighbours. The estimates for physical persons are particularly high, even using the most cautious assumptions. The situation deserves attention and motivates a search for some explanations and reactions. We argue that both the low level of tax compliance, because of a large shadow economy, and a too complicated tax system are the key factors determining the situation. However, neither a simplification of the tax system or real measures to cut tax evasion are on the agenda of the current left wing government. One specific factor that may have had an impact on the government's limited willingness to enact necessary radical changes, uncovered by our research, is tax illusion.

The relationships between managers and employees are essential motivating factors and research demonstrate that the personality of a manager enhance or inhibit engagement (Howell, 2017) finally contributing to teams development. As leaders are influential in determining the fate of their organizations through their decisions, strategies, and influence on others, this research is a quantitative leadership study conducted to draw the personality profile of Romanian leaders and to verify if if there are differences among industries. It explores the values, day-to-day characteristic and stress reactions on a sample of 870 to 1116 top, middle managers and high potentials using Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI) (Hogan, 1992), Hogan Development Survey (HDS) (Hogan, 1997) and Hogan Motives, Values and Preferences Inventory (HMVI)(Hogan, 1996). The results showed that Romanian leaders displayed average scores for most of their personality characteristics. Their top 3 motivational drivers are power, science and affiliation. They are motivated to get ambitious results, they are interested in learning and being up to date and making decisions based on data and they enjoy networking. In terms of usual working style, their top 3 scores are for ambition, prudence and learning approach. They are competitive and energetic, committed to get things done, they do display good planning and organizing skills, and they are well-informed and value education. Under stress, their top 3 derails are bold, diligent and colourful. They become overconfident and arrogant, they micromanage their teams being too much controlling and details oriented, and they are keen for self-display and getting others' attention. Looking for difference between professional services and pharma, we found that leaders and high potentials working in professional services showed higher drivers (status, social, and business interests) compared with the ones working in pharma.","[Noaghea, Cosmina Ioana; Balan, Madalina] HART Consulting, Bucharest, Romania; [Marinas, Cristian-Virgil; Igret, Ramona Stefania] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Noaghea, CI (通讯作者)，HART Consulting, Bucharest, Romania.",cosmina.noaghea@hart.ro; madalina.balan@hart.ro; cristian.marinas@man.ase.ro; ramona.igret@man.ase.ro,"IGRET, Ramona/JFJ-3288-2023; marinas, Cristian/IQT-0772-2023","marinas, Cristian/0009-0008-6716-3089",,,,,9,0,0,1,5,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,794,801,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100082,0

To achieve this objective, various initiatives have been undertaken which include the establishment of the Halal Master Plan, Halal Industry Development Corporation, appointment of Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) as the halal certification authority and development of a number of halal standards. This paper conceptually discusses the current legal and regulatory framework for the halal industry in Malaysia with special reference made to the Muslim Friendly Hotel sector. Reviews of various related documents demonstrate that there is a lacuna in the existence of a governance framework for the halal industry, which includes the absence of a halal standard for the Muslim Friendly Hotel sector. Another serious drawback identified in this regulatory framework is the lack of a clear and proper shari'ah governance framework for the halal industry. This paper therefore proposes that there is an urgent need for the policy makers to develop such a comprehensive halal standard for Muslim Friendly Hotels in this country. Establishing a comprehensive shari'ah governance framework for the halal Industry is inadvertently another crucial part that needs to be addressed by the relevant authorities to ensure further development of the halal industry in Malaysia. It is hoped that this paper will create alarm among the policymakers, key hotel operators, and regulatory bodies so that a more comprehensive and updated piece of shari'ah framework that governs the formation of the Muslim Friendly Hotels sector will be formulated.","[Samori, Zakiah; Abd Rahman, Fadilah] Univ Teknol MARA, ACIS, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; [Zahari, Mohd Salehuddin Mohd] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Tourism & Hotel Management, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Samori, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, ACIS, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.",zakiahsamori@salam.uitm.edu.my; dilah091@salam.uitm.edu.my; salehuddinm@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Mohd Zahari, Mohd Salehuddin/M-5569-2017","Mohd Zahari, Mohd Salehuddin/0000-0001-9485-301X; Abd Rahman, Fadilah/0000-0002-3366-2583",FRGS Grant [600-RMI/FRGS 5/3 (14/2014)]; Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM),FRGS Grant; Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM),"The authors would like to take the opportunity to thank the Dean of the Academy Of Contemporary Islamic Studies (ACIS), Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia Prof. Dr. Hj.

In 2006, Porter and Kramer developed the notion that corporations could and should pursue a higher goal of capitalism including creating shared value (CSV) as a means to improve performance and bridging the gap that developed between corporations and society (Porter and Kramer 2011). The concept was welcomed within both academia and the corporate world for the amount of energy it has generated, its potential to improve capitalism and repair what Brigley referred to as the fractured contract (Brigley 1995: 225). However, it is being equally critiqued for lacking in definitional clarity causing inconsistent strategy, and lacking in originality vis-a-vis existing concepts such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This paper proposes corporate virtue as a form of CSV, by identifying two theories which demonstrate how corporate virtue meets the definitional requirements of CSV and helps both the corporation and society fulfil unmet needs.","[Shanahan, Ford] Franklin Univ Switzerland, Lugano, Switzerland; [Seele, Peter] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland",Franklin University Switzerland; Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Shanahan, F (通讯作者)，Franklin Univ Switzerland, Lugano, Switzerland.",fshanahan@yahoo.com; peter.seele@usi.ch,,"Seele, Peter/0000-0002-6456-4003",,,,,29,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-48802-8; 978-3-319-48801-1,ETHICAL ECON,,,2017,52,,,,,,141,151,,10.1007/978-3-319-48802-8_8,0.0,,,11,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI6HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413288200008,0

According to available data, the small and medium-sized enterprises represent 99% of all businesses in the European Union. Additionally, the sector of S1vIEs is a key generator of new employment, economic growth, innovation and social integration across the EU and its member states. In order to provide adequate support for development and growth of the SMEs, the EL/ has created a number of policies and business support programs targeted specificall), at these enterprises. Member states are implementing respective E Upolicies on a national level, as well as they are creating additional regulations, programs and instruments targeting SMEs. The adopted policies and measures are primarily aimed at simplifying the administrative and regulatory framework regarding the establishment and operations of SMEs, as well as at creating financing schemes that provide needed sources of funding for SMEs operations and development. Available data on SMEs in the EL/ and its member states show that insufficient financing and complex administrative procedures are the main barriers to S1vIEs business operations. In order to improve access to finance, the European Commission cooperates with local, regional and national authorities and local financial institutions in member states, thus securing needed funding through different financial instruments. Additionally, direct funding for SMEs is available through different funds and fu nding programs administered by the EU or its member states. Similar as in the EU, the sector of SMEs is of great importance Jr economic activities in the Republic of Croatia. It is also suffering from similar problems such as complex administrative procedures and inadequate access to sources offinancing. In the same time, the sector has an opportunity to participate in many business-support and financing programs for SMEs both on the EU and national level, as well as to benefit from experiences shared by others. Therefore, the main objective of the paper is to present importance and determinants of the SMEs in the Republic of Croatia in relation to the EU. In the first part, the basic regulatory and institutional framework of SMEs will be presented. Also, the structure of SMEs and its importance with regard to main economic variables on the EU, national and regional level will be introduced.

The non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method was used as the main assessment tool. The text is divided into three interrelated parts. In the first part, the literature review was conducted focusing particularly on the use of the DEA method in assessing public transport performance and the inputs and outputs used in such assessment. The second part of the paper presents the research methodology. DEA CCR and BCC models were used to assess 19 most important urban public transport operators of the Czech Republic. The main data sources were the annual report of the Association of Transport Companies (SDP) and the Magnus Web database of companies from which the financial indicators of transport companies were obtained. The companies were assessed both in terms of the transport process (technical efficiency) and in terms of the consumer process (service effectiveness) as well as the business process (cost efficiency). The results of the research (the third part of the article) showed that the companies had room for improvement at all three levels of performance. This was mainly due to their low scale efficiency. It was also found that both efficiency and effectiveness were influenced by the size of the population that was served by urban transport and the history and tradition of transport in the given city or town.","[Zizka, Miroslav] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Studentska 2, CZ-46117 Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Zizka, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Studentska 2, CZ-46117 Liberec, Czech Republic.",miroslay.zizka@tul.cz,"Zizka, Miroslav/I-5624-2016","Zizka, Miroslav/0000-0002-7804-3954",,,,,36,5,5,0,15,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In countries which are forerunners of the demographic transition, depopulation is mainly driven by out-migration of youth. Through a case study of students from small Russian cities, this paper explores the nature of the association between local identity (LI) and migration intentions. The study suggests that young people with a stronger LI are on average more prone to return to their native cities after graduation. This 'traditional' relationship may be related to the difficulties in maintaining strong ties to a place of personal significance when not residing there in the Russian context. However, overall, youth tend towards a negative association with their cities and LI is formed as an opposition: the denial of place validity. Therefore, both way associations are possible. While a strong LI may influence the intention to migrate, it may also develop as an adaptation mechanism for those forced to return.","[Gunko, Maria; Medvedev, Andrey] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Staromonetny Pereulok 29, Moscow 119017, Russia","Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences","Gunko, M (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Staromonetny Pereulok 29, Moscow 119017, Russia.",msgunko@igras.ru; medvedev@igras.ru,"Gunko, Maria/T-5461-2019; Medvedev, Andrey A/M-2676-2015","Gunko, Maria/0000-0001-5994-6368; Medvedev, Andrey/0000-0002-3701-0208","Russian Science Foundation ('Geography of Recurrent Population Mobility within the Rural-Urban Continuum') [14-18-00083]; Russian Science Foundation [14-18-00083, 17-18-00040] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation",Russian Science Foundation ('Geography of Recurrent Population Mobility within the Rural-Urban Continuum'); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"Working on the manuscript Maria Gunko benefited from an excellent research environment and support of the ira. urban 'Urban Reconfigurations in Post-Soviet Space' project team during her stay as a guest researcher at the Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography in Leipzig in 2015.

For governments it is important to gain insight in the mobility impacts of automated vehicles. This is important as the introduction of automated vehicles affects current investment decisions about infrastructure projects and other policy measures like road pricing. Quantitative literature with respect to the impact of automated vehicles focuses mostly on capacity implications. Literature about large scale mobility impacts is mainly qualitative. This paper introduces a System Dynamics model (SD-model) to quantitatively explore the impacts of early forms of automated vehicles (level 1, 2 and 3) on mobility. The model is explorative and can be used to evaluate different scenarios in a short time. This model is applied in a case study for the Netherlands to assess the impact of automated vehicles on mode choice, time of day choice and travel times on characteristic relations in the Netherlands. In contrast to other studies the SD-model is able to simulate the effects of AVs over time, can simulate mixed automated vehicle types and has a constant feedback between the assignment and the demand side of the model A scenario for autonomous driving and a scenario for cooperative driving is considered. The simulations show that car traffic will increase and the level of congestion does not necessarily decrease and might even increase on some relations, especially in the autonomous scenario. Furthermore, in the cooperative scenario the increase in number of trips by car is larger, the average speeds are higher and there is less congestion compared to the autonomous scenario.","[Puylaert, S.] Studio Bereikbaar, Stationspl 45 E1-186, NL-3013 AK Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Snelder, M.; van Nes, R.; van Arem, B.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Transport & Planning, POB 5048, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Snelder, M.] TNO, Anna van Buerenpl 1, NL-2595 DA The Hague, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research,"Puylaert, S (通讯作者)，Studio Bereikbaar, Stationspl 45 E1-186, NL-3013 AK Rotterdam, Netherlands.",steven.puylaert@studiobereikbaar.nl,,"Snelder, Maaike/0000-0001-7766-2174; van Arem, Bart/0000-0001-8316-7794; van Nes, Rob/0000-0003-1022-9661",,,,,26,22,22,3,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The focus is the commercial negotiations between airlines and airports concerning investments that affect passengers as key stakeholders, end-users, and payers. The article draws on literature on consumer representation and willingness to pay, as well as data from 21 in-depth interviews. The findings suggest that within the current arrangement, passengers are dependent on airlines as their representatives, although their interests may differ concerning investments in airport infrastructure and services. This dependency is leveraged by the current airline duopoly in the Australian domestic air transport market because passengers have no transport alternatives among which to choose. Airports charging passengers their fees (and eventually negotiating prices for improved services) directly is not deemed a suitable option because it could increase the airports' market power and affect the passenger experience negatively. Recommendations, such as involving an independent representation body and diversifying service provision at the airport, are discussed as possibilities for increasing passengers' influence.","[Kistler, Beat; Lohmann, Gui] Griffith Univ, Griffith Aviat, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Trischler, Jakob] Karlstad Univ, CTF Serv Res Ctr, Univ Gatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",Griffith University; Karlstad University,"Lohmann, G (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Aviat, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",g.lohmann@griffith.edu.au,"Lohmann, Gui/ABC-3019-2020; Lohmann, Gui/AAL-3457-2021","Lohmann, Gui/0000-0002-3374-9734; Lohmann, Gui/0000-0002-3374-9734; Trischler, Jakob/0000-0002-2887-2463",Queensland Airports Ltd (QAL),Queensland Airports Ltd (QAL),"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support received by Queensland Airports Ltd (QAL) for this research as part of a university-industry collaboration scheme grant.

Using a methodology that enables us to match airline on-time performance data to passenger itinerary data, we find that codeshare products-virtual and traditional-are consistently associated with less arrival delay.

This study developed a survey for over 1000 residents of India (or Indians) on topics of vehicle ownership and travel behavior in the key cities of Bengaluru (India's Silicon Valley), Kolkata (India's third most-populous metro area, formerly known as Calcutta) and Delhi (India's capital city). The data were then used to model vehicle ownership and use decisions, and other trip-making choices in those three regions, versus other parts of India. Covariates of personal income, household size and residence location were all found to be statistically and practically significant' in models of vehicle distances traveled. A multinomial logit model was used to predict vehicle types owned (including motorized two-wheel and four-wheel vehicles), and a Poisson model was used for vehicle ownership counts. Income and other household assets were also valuable predictors. An origin model for vehicle manufacture was also calibrated to help deliver future-year projections. The results suggest that the vehicles-per-person statistic will grow at an average annual growth rate of 5.7% over the next 20 years at least in the regions of sampled data.","[Bonsal, Prateek] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kockelman, Kara M.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Schievelbein, Will] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mech Engn, Operat Res & Ind Engn Grad Program, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Schauer-West, Scott] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Cornell University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Kockelman, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",pb422@cornell.edu; kkockelm@mail.utexas.edu; will.schievelbein@gmail.com; saschwest@gmail.com,"Kockelman, Kara/ABF-7223-2021","Bansal, Prateek/0000-0001-6851-8461",Ford Motor Company,Ford Motor Company,"The authors thank the Ford Motor Company and Dr. Michael Tamor for providing some funding and feedback to support this research effort, as well as Srikanth Sreedhar for his constructive comments.",,18,33,34,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Little is known, however, about how the dates of the weddings correlate with marriage durability. Using Dutch marriage and divorce registries from 1999 to 2013, this study compares the durations of marriages that began on unusually popular wedding dates with marriages on ordinary dates. We identify several distinct types of popular dates, including Valentine's Day and numerically special days (dates with the same or sequential number values, e.g., 9.9.99, 1.2.03), showing that on an adjusted basis, the incidence of weddings on such dates was 137-509% higher than ordinary dates. The hazard odds of divorce for these special-date weddings were 18-36% higher than ordinary-date weddings. Sorting on couples' observable characteristics accounts for some of the higher divorce risks, but even after controlling for these characteristics, special-date weddings were more vulnerable, with 10-17% higher divorce odds compared to ordinary dates. These relationships are even stronger for couples who have not married before.","[Kabatek, Jan; Ribar, David C.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kabatek, Jan; Ribar, David C.] Univ Melbourne, ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kabatek, Jan; Ribar, David C.] Inst Labor Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Kabatek, Jan] Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Kabatek, Jan] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Ribar, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Ribar, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Ribar, DC (通讯作者)，Inst Labor Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany.",david.ribar@unimelb.edu.au,"; Ribar, David/H-8719-2015","Kabatek, Jan/0000-0002-5947-7941; Ribar, David/0000-0002-0465-4875",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course,Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course(Australian Research Council),Both authors were supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course.,,32,5,5,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The public sector is required to provide special transport services (STS) for those who are unable to use regular public transport or private car. Between 1999 and 2014, the yearly cost per STS trip increased by 66%. This is problematic, considering the fact that the population is growing older and an increased demand for STS may be expected in the future. It is therefore important to understand the cost structure of STS operations. Although STS has been organised in various ways in Sweden, the trend is to transfer responsibility from the municipal level to the regional level. This paper examines the cost structure of STS in Sweden to determine whether the transfer of responsibility has had an impact on costs. It is concluded that transferring the procurement of STS from the local to the regional level decreases marginal cost but increases fixed cost, thus lowering costs for municipalities with high levels of production and increasing costs for municipalities with low production levels. Transferring the administration of STS permits is found to have the opposite effect: it lowers fixed costs but increases marginal costs.","[Hansson, Lisa; Holmgren, Johan] Specialized Univ Logist, Molde Univ Coll, Britvegen 2, N-6410 Molde, Norway",Molde University College,"Hansson, L (通讯作者)，Specialized Univ Logist, Molde Univ Coll, Britvegen 2, N-6410 Molde, Norway.",lisa.hansson@himolde.no; johan.holmgren@himolde.no,,"Holmgren, Johan/0000-0002-2566-4183",,,,,82,2,2,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

At the same time, they appeal to the conscience of individual subjects and place individual (consumer) choices into the broader context of socio-ecological discourses of responsibility. Starting from this observation, the paper investigates governmentality and the concept of counter-conduct as promising analytical tools. By re-tracing the complex interplay of discourses of responsibility and processes of subjectivation, even practices of resistance are shown to always remain embedded in modes of domination and self-conduct.","[Linnemann, Kirsten] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Geog, Heisenbergstr 2, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Linnemann, K (通讯作者)，Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Geog, Heisenbergstr 2, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",k.linnemann@uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,81,3,3,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Due to differential treatment in the labor market, teenage undocumented immigrants face low returns to schooling. To measure the effect of legal status on the educational choices of Hispanic teenagers, we compare siblings who differ in their legal status due to their birth country. We find that teenagers who were born in Mexico are 2.7 percentage points more likely to be out of school than their U.S.-born siblings. Alternative explanations, such as differences in prenatal or childhood environment, appear largely unable to explain this result, suggesting that legal status has a significant impact on schooling decisions. After accounting for these alternative explanations to the extent possible and using proxies for legal status in the U.S. Census, our results suggest that being undocumented roughly doubles high school students' dropout rate relative to their U.S.-born siblings, with substantial wage decreases implied by back-of-the-envelope calculations.","[Liscow, Zachary] Yale Law Sch, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Woolston, William Gui] Nuna Hlth, San Francisco, CA USA",Yale University,"Liscow, Z (通讯作者)，Yale Law Sch, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",zachary.liscow@yale.edu,,,,,,,77,4,4,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

How subsidiaries expand their technological scope is determined by the nature of changes in dual contexts, within their organizations and within their geographies. Using the concepts of local search and communities of practice, we propose that changes in these contexts have differential effects on new technology development. Increased technology creation in the organizational context, in areas specific to the subsidiary's expertise, leads to the development of focused, competence-exploiting technologies, while increased host country innovation in the broad technological spectrum is conducive to expansive, competence-creating technologies in the subsidiary. Subsidiary embeddedness in these dual contexts enhances the effects of the organizational and locational contexts on the scope of subsidiary new technology development.","[Phene, Anupama] George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Tallman, Stephen] Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",George Washington University; University of Richmond,"Phene, A (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",anuphene@gwu.edu,"Tallman, Stephen B/H-5236-2011","Tallman, Stephen B/0000-0001-9696-3351",,,,,67,12,13,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

It provides a range of powers, mostly permissive rather than mandatory. The general emphasis of the Act displays marked shift from the previous focus on competition as a major policy aim, to one in which partnerships between operators and local transport authorities are encouraged. Procedures for franchising are simplified, in contrast to those under the 2000 and 2008 Acts, which did not result in any franchising scheme outside London being introduced. The changes relate to a number of themes examined in previous Thredbo conferences, including aspects of competition law, service tendering, data disclosure and network planning. This paper begins by examining the historical background to the Act, then discusses its main provisions. Data requirements for research to monitor the possible effects of its implementation are outlined. It is concluded that the Act has the potential to encourage greater bus use, but the extent of this is highly uncertain.","[White, Peter] Univ Westminster, Dept Planning & Transport, London NW1 5LS, England",University of Westminster,"White, P (通讯作者)，Univ Westminster, Dept Planning & Transport, London NW1 5LS, England.",whitep1@westminster.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,9,9,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Operational funds are derived from a range of sources, including fare and toll revenues, taxes, and fees. In cities with aging infrastructure, traditional funding mechanisms are falling short of actual need, even as many cities experience record ridership levels. Therefore, new funding streams are necessary to safely, efficiently, and equitably operate and maintain an aging rail infrastructure in the face of growing demand. This paper presents a socio-spatial model of rail transit ridership demand to develop a computational method for value capture funding mechanisms that link existing commercial properties and transit infrastructure operations. Using a diverse range of large-scale data for New York City (NYC) and the surrounding region, our methodology provides a data-driven approach to address fundamental issues of horizontal and vertical equity in value-capture fees, including (1) the magnitude of the special assessment, (2) the property types to include, and (3) the boundaries of the special assessment district. We find that a marginal special assessment of $0.50 to $1.00 per square foot on commercial properties, proportionate to the lost wages and output associated with system delays, within 1/4-mile of a subway station in NYC's core commercial district could yield between $332 and $664 million annually to support the Metropolitan Transit Authority's operating budget. This is equivalent to the revenue generated by an average, system-wide per ride fare increase of $0.22, and significantly less than the estimated implicit transit subsidy for these buildings of $4.58 per square foot per year.","[Falcocchio, John C.

In optimizations soil expectation value (SEV) with a 3% discount rate was maximized and picking costs and mushroom prices were included in calculations. The optimal two-thinning management schedule for timber only consisted of a rotation length of 96 years and heavy thinnings from above. The optimal stand management schedules for joint production were very similar to that of timber, because mushroom yields are at their highest just before the first commercial thinning. When management was optimized for mushroom production only, the optimal rotation lengths were shorter, and for B. edulis the thinnings were lighter. Management optimal for Lactarius spp. did not include thinning treatments.

We examined the question using data on more than 17,000 parked vehicles and their drivers from SFpark, a federally funded market-priced parking experiment in San Francisco. But we found that lower-income parkers are more likely to use street parking and meter rates had small effects on usage. Raising prices did not increase sorting across blocks by income. Controlled analysis yielded mixed and weak evidence that lower-income parkers may be less sensitive to price increases.

It reveals that Chinese investment in Germany is mainly driven by the desire to explore markets and to search for strategic resources. It favours location rich in network resources. Guanxi acts as an important channel of knowledge acquisition, but it is not as important as contractual linkage because of the limited professional and industry-related knowledge in the local Chinese community. Chinese capitalism has been shaped into a hybrid form that incorporates both modern corporate management and traditional guanxi utilisation.

Our results suggest that this reform did not lead to higher unemployment in Indonesia, but it increased the proportion of workers employed in informal jobs and in agriculture. No detectable change in the consumption patterns of Indonesian households appears from our analysis, suggesting that rural areas in Indonesia could absorb the sudden increase in the availability of workforce.

J,"Silver, M",,,,"Silver, Morris",,,Bondage by contract in the late Roman empire,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Colonate; Patrocinium; Origo; Peculium; Tax collective; Economic efficiency; Barbarians,ECONOMY,"Legal codes and other documents of the late Roman Empire reveal a system, the colonate or sometimes (redundantly) the bound colonate in which farmers (coloni) had their (head and land) taxes paid by estate owners in whose census rolls they were registered. If the land changed ownership coloni were entitled to stay and were registered in the tax roll of the new owner. However, coloni and their offspring lacked the right to migrate. Developing some previously advanced ideas about putrocinium patronage, this article argues that the pristine or original form of the colonate is a voluntary contractual arrangement among free farmers, estate owners, and the imperial Fiscus which acquired a public law dimension because it required a change in the personal status of the farmer. By means of this bondage contract the contractors expected to share in the aggregate gains from reducing tax-collection costs and from stabilizing tax revenues. The paper goes on to consider the implications of the colonate for economic efficiency and concludes with some observations on the reasons for changes over time in its importance.

Despite this, conflicting views appear to emerge from the extant literature over the link between strategic planning and financial performance. Notably, within a South African context, a few studies have been conducted ascertaining this relationship especially within small, medium and micro-enterprises (SMMEs). Aim and setting: The study aimed to determine this relationship using survey responses from a sample of 225 respondents classified as owners or managers of SMMEs operating within the Buffalo City Metropolitan in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Method: Data were analysed through regression and correlation analysis. Results: Findings reveal strategic planning to have a positive relationship with the financial performance of the SMMEs. Furthermore, aspects of strategic planning (formulation, implementation, evaluation and control) were also found to have a positive relationship with financial performance. Conclusion: Suggestions for theory and practice are made based on these findings, including how the adoption and usage of strategic planning cannot only be an important organisational capability but also a basis for attaining a competitive advantage within the SMME.","[Gomera, Shingirai; Chinyamurindi, Willie T.] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Business Management, Alice, South Africa; [Mishi, Syden] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Econ, Govan Mbeki Res & Dev Ctr, Alice, South Africa",University of Fort Hare; University of Fort Hare,"Chinyamurindi, WT (通讯作者)，Univ Ft Hare, Dept Business Management, Alice, South Africa.",wchinyamurindi@ufh.ac.za,"MISHI, SYDEN/AAT-2567-2021","MISHI, SYDEN/0000-0002-7727-8946; Chinyamurindi, Willie/0000-0002-4139-4224",Govan Mbeki Research Development Centre at the University of Fort Hare,Govan Mbeki Research Development Centre at the University of Fort Hare,The research was funded by the Govan Mbeki Research Development Centre at the University of Fort Hare.,,59,8,14,3,20,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

A major PT disruption removing all service can have a considerable impact on travel and increase traffic congestion. This paper investigates the behavioural reactions of PT users in Melbourne to removal of PT service using self-reported responses and an online questionnaire. Of the 640 respondents, 52% would switch from PT to become a car driver, 11% would switch to car as a passenger and 5% would shift to taxi/Uber. Mode shift to cars would directly contribute to an increase in congestion. By contrast, only 31% in total would switch to either non-motorised modes (cycle and walk) or trip cancellation. In order to explore factors affecting changes in travel behaviour among PT users, a multinomial logit regression model was adopted. The analysis indicates that users with a driver's license or a car were found to prefer using a car should PT be unavailable. Work trips were more likely to be undertaken by car as a driver. Users who had trips to the CBD were more likely to cancel their trips and those who accessed PT stations by car were more willing to shift to being a car driver. This paper provides new insights into how PT users change their travel behaviour in the event of major PT disruptions. Based on the findings, potential measures can be proposed to mitigate the increase in traffic congestion.","[Nguyen-Phuoc, Duy Q.; Currie, Graham; De Gruyter, Chris] Monash Univ Victoria, Monash Inst Transport Studies, Publ Transport Res Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Nguyen-Phuoc, Duy Q.] Univ Danang, Univ Sci & Technol, 54 Nguyen Luong Bang, Danang, Vietnam; [Young, William] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Wellington Rd & Blackburn Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University; University of Danang; Monash University,"Nguyen-Phuoc, DQ (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Victoria, Monash Inst Transport Studies, Publ Transport Res Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",nguyen.duy@monash.edu; graham.currie@monash.edu; chris.degruyter@monash.edu; bill.young@monash.edu,"Currie, Graham/P-5431-2019; Duy, Nguyen-Phuoc Q./AAD-9598-2020; Currie, Graham/ABC-6611-2020","Currie, Graham/0000-0001-7190-7548; Duy, Nguyen-Phuoc Q./0000-0002-2299-2368; De Gruyter, Chris/0000-0001-5069-3018",,,,,24,18,19,3,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

In 1910, Baltimore was the first city to adopt an ordinance banning African Americans from white neighborhoods. In part, this law was justified as a means to restrain the violent behavior of white citizens who might otherwise act as vigilantes against their black neighbors. Other cities followed suit. These racial zones were declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. However, for 31 years this Court sanctioned the adoption of private restrictive covenants that were effective at blocking African Americans from buying or renting a house in a white neighborhood. In the 1930s, the insertion of racially restrictive covenants became both a protective mechanism and a prerequisite for federal mortgage lending, insurance, and guarantees by a variety of national housing agencies. In effect, the federal government enforced racial segregation even though local governments were not allowed to. The net effect of three decades of federal housing programs was to drive an economic wedge between federally subsidized housing for whites and federally enforced denial of housing loans in African American neighborhoods. Those policies made whites wealthy at the expense of African Americans, a condition that still persists and will continue to do so in the absence of federal intervention to reverse the wealth gap it helped to create.","[Woods, Louis Lee, II] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA",Middle Tennessee State University,"Woods, LL (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA.",,,,,,,,93,4,14,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Considering the transportation factors and economic factors, a topological network of Yangtze River Economic Belt was constructed. Based on this network, the relocation patterns of manufacturing industry both at present and in the planning period were analyzed by percolation theory. And results show that: first, percolation transitions exists during the process of industry relocation. Cities located in border regions are the bottlenecks for industry relocation. Second, both improvements in transport accessibilities and increase of production costs accelerate the process of industrial relocation in fly in mode. Finally, preferential policies are needed for provinces in the upper reaches Yangtze River Economic Belt to attract industrial relocation.","[Jiang, Yonglei] Dalian Maritime Univ, Transportat Management Coll, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China; [Timmermans, Harry J.

Interestingly, women likewise tend to be more satisfied with younger husbands and less satisfied with older husbands. Marital satisfaction declines with marital duration for both men and women in differently aged couples relative to those in similarly aged couples. These relative declines erase the initial higher levels of marital satisfaction experienced by men married to younger wives and women married to younger husbands within 6 to 10 years of marriage.

Under current regimes, firms must observe such compliance requirements as internal monitoring mechanisms, the purpose of which is inducing firms to detect the wrongful conduct of their agents. We develop an analytical framework for identifying when, and to what extent, firms may find it beneficial to adopt these regulatory devices. We conclude that more productive firms, those operating in sectors with more market power, and firms whose managers have more opportunities for criminal activity are more likely to prevent wrongful conduct-either through monitoring or the payment of efficiency wages. When the potential returns to illegal activities are high or the firm is large, internal monitoring is probably the optimal strategy of crime prevention; in contrast, smaller firms typically proceed by paying efficiency wages (or ignoring crime). This paper also analyzes the role of the State's legal capacity as well as the effects of interactions between the structure of reputational losses and the firm's market power.","[Polidori, Paolo; Teobaldelli, Desiree] Univ Urbino, Dept Law, Via Matteotti 1, I-61029 Urbino, Italy",University of Urbino,"Teobaldelli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Urbino, Dept Law, Via Matteotti 1, I-61029 Urbino, Italy.",paolo.polidori@uniurb.it; desiree.teobaldelli@uniurb.it,,"TEOBALDELLI, Desiree/0000-0002-4264-5021",,,,,41,2,2,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

One commonly accepted phenomena in a market where a network externality arises is the first-mover advantage, in which the first entrant into a market can earn a higher profit than later entrants. However, in some recent online services markets, we see that the second mover earns a higher profit than the first mover. This occurs because the second mover strengthens its variety of available functions and services markedly, thereby facilitating consumers' work and communication with its main product, which we call network externality intensity. Based on this observation, we analyze sequential positioning in Hotelling's framework by incorporating an asymmetric network externality intensity between firms. We show that unlike the results of previous related studies, both first- and second-mover advantages can appear in the equilibrium depending on the relationship of the network externality intensity between firms; further, they do not change monotonically with the level of network externality intensity.","[Saito, Ryoichi; Matsubayashi, Nobuo] Keio Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Adm Engn, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Keio University,"Matsubayashi, N (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Adm Engn, Kohoku Ku, Hiyoshi 3-14-1, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan.",nobuo-m@pa2.so-net.ne.jp,"Matsubayashi, Nobuo/D-7743-2014","Matsubayashi, Nobuo/0000-0001-7743-362X","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; [15K01202]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K01202] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C), Grant/Award Number: 15K01202; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan",,15,4,4,0,17,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

Both recurrent and vector forecasting algorithms of horizontal MSSA (HMSSA) are considered. The results from the proposed multivariate approach are compared with those obtained via the optimized univariate singular spectrum analysis (SSA) forecasting algorithm to determine the statistical significance of each outcome. The data are rigorously tested for normality, seasonal unit root hypothesis, and structural breaks. The results are presented such that users can not only identify the most appropriate model based on the aim of the analysis, but also easily identify the leading indicators for each IP variable in each country. Our findings show that, for all three countries, forecasts from the proposed MSSA algorithm outperform the optimized SSA algorithm in over 70% of cases. Accordingly, this new approach succeeds in identifying leading indicators and is a viable option for selecting the SSA choices L and r, which minimizes a loss function.","[Silva, Emmanuel Sirimal] Univ Arts London, London Coll Fash, Fash Business Sch, 272 High Holborn, London WC1V 7EY, England; [Hassani, Hossein] Univ Tehran, Res Inst Energy Management & Planning, Tehran, Iran; [Heravi, Saeed] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of Arts London; University of Tehran; Cardiff University,"Silva, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Arts London, London Coll Fash, Fash Business Sch, 272 High Holborn, London WC1V 7EY, England.",e.silva@fashion.arts.ac.uk,"Hassani, Hossein/A-1712-2012","Silva, Emmanuel Sirimal/0000-0003-3851-9230",,,,,34,18,19,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Based on earlier literature, the future growth prospects for the rise of WMC are rooted in the concerns regarding environmental issues, as witnessed in a plethora of studies focusing on carbon footprinting. But do new (performance-based) regulations 'favor' WMC or do they give a more 'just' comparison of alternative building concepts? Therefore, more information is needed on the role of growing environmental awareness and preferences for wood as a renewable and recyclable material in the markets. Our paper presents results from a two-round Delphi study focusing on the relative strength and perceived interplay between likelihood and the desirability of environmental concerns in driving WMC in Finland and Sweden. Using qualitative analysis of expert interviews in the first Delphi round, the issues related to sustainable development appear to have growing importance in the marketplace. However, the panelists perceive that the emphasis on sustainability is mainly driven by the changing regulation reflecting societal needs, and only few experts saw it as echoing directly from changing individual consumer needs. In the second Delphi round, implemented with an online survey, the likelihood and desirability of sustainability as a megatrend in housing was perceived to gain further impetus toward 2030, both in the form of consumer demand for sustainable living and wood construction as a modern way of living. However, future research is needed to get a better understanding on the strength and scope of these drivers.

To do so, we propose a theoretical model in which regional political orientations along the Left vs. Right cleavage dates back to the end of the nineteenth century or even before, related to the land tenure, the familial structure, the time of the industrial take off or the impact of religion. Specifically, we show that the current electoral map is still partly related to such old structures, long after they vanish. To explain this hysteresis, we refer to the role of social networks and institutions embedded in places, allowing the transmission of electoral behaviour from one generation to the other. However, the West European electoral map has not been frozen, and, in the last part of the paper, we explain how major political and socio-economic changes alter political behaviour of places.","[Van Hamme, Gilles; Vandermotten, Christian; Lockhart, Pablo Medina] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IGEAT, 50 Ave Franklin Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Van Hamme, G (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, IGEAT, 50 Ave Franklin Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",gvhamme@ulb.ac.be; cvdmotte@ulb.ac.be; pmedinal@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,,45,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The positive effect of customer satisfaction on customer commitment is also undisputed within the relationship marketing literature. Aim: It was the aim of this study to examine the extent to which customer commitment mediates and strengthens the relationship between customers' perceived satisfaction and their citizenship behaviour. In the context of Internet banking, the study aimed to examine the extent to which customer's commitment towards the service provider (the bank) strengthens the relationship between satisfaction with the service provided (Internet banking) and customer citizenship behaviour (consumer advocacy and the helping of other customers). Setting: The study was conducted in the South African Internet banking environment, which could benefit from a model of factors contributing to customer citizenship behaviour, specifically the sub-dimensions of consumer advocacy and helping behaviour. Methods: A descriptive and quantitative research design was followed and the survey responses obtained from 491 existing users of Internet banking services were used in the analysis. Results: Following the structural equation model results, the direct relationships between all constructs were confirmed. Customer commitment, however, has only a partial mediating effect on the relationships between customer satisfaction and the sub-dimensions of consumer advocacy and helping behaviour. Conclusions: From a theoretical perspective, the research findings provide more insight into the role of customer satisfaction and commitment in contributing to customer citizenship behaviour and the extent to which both relationship quality factors are needed in order to do so. From a practical perspective, banks should adapt their marketing strategies to facilitate greater relationships with customers responsible for citizenship behaviours. Customers promoting the benefits of the service to other customers and helping them to use the service may ultimately contribute to greater adoption and use of Internet banking services.","[van Tonder, Estelle] North West Univ, Sch Management Sci, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [de Beer, Leon T.] North West Univ, WorkWell Res Unit, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa,"van Tonder, E (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Management Sci, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",25621610@nwu.ac.za,"De Beer, Leon T./AAH-8146-2021","De Beer, Leon T./0000-0001-6900-2192; van Tonder, Estelle/0000-0002-6285-7582",,,,,88,7,15,6,51,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Into a standard model of vertical differentiation, we incorporate a repositioning cost that is proportional to the quality differences between firms' current and new products. By varying the levels of quality positions, we analyze the impact of this cost on the equilibrium outcomes. Our results show that the presence of repositioning costs restricts firms' abilities to improve profitability and differentiate themselves vertically. As a result, a high-positioned firm does not necessarily have a competitive advantage over a low-positioned firm, even if the former offers a superior new product in equilibrium. In addition, if a low-positioned firm is significantly cost-efficient compared with its rival with regard to repositioning, then that firm can earn higher profits than those of a high-positioned firm by strategically offering its low-end product. These results contrast sharply with those based on the standard vertical differentiation model.","[Kurokawa, Shogo; Matsubayashi, Nobuo] Keio Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Adm Engn, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Keio University,"Kurokawa, S (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Adm Engn, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",scarletcurio@gmail.com; nobuo-m@pa2.so-net.ne.jp,"Matsubayashi, Nobuo/D-7743-2014","Matsubayashi, Nobuo/0000-0001-7743-362X","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [15K01202]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K01202] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank the editor, the coeditor, and anonymous referees for helpful comments.

This Heart Intelligence module enhances the beliefs and understanding of spiritual, emotional and social skills of the educators. The purpose of this study is to examine how this module gives impact to the educators and how it helps the educators to have more control on their job engagement. A qualitative research design was employed to collect data through an open-ended questionnaire from 26 educators who voluntarily participated in this study. Participants were required to apply the elements of Islamic teaching during English Communication Module and apply them to their students when they get back to their workplace. They provided positive feedback especially after they have implemented the Heart Intelligence Module (Anita, 2016). From the responses, there were positive changes in the educators especially when dealing with their students at school. The module helps them to decrease stress at workplace, work better with the students and feel satisfied with their job. They also suggested some new ideas for the module throughout the teaching and learning session as to introduce the concept of human and 'caliph'.","[Abdulghani, Airin] Fac Ind Management, Kuantan, Malaysia; [Hashim, Haslinda; Abd Rani, Anita; Mohd Radzuan, Noor Raha; Ali, Fatimah; Fauzi, Wan Jumani; Zainal Abidin, Noor Azlinda; Ngah, Ezihaslinda] Ctr Modern Languages & Human Sci, Kuantan, Malaysia; [Haron, Siti Farhana] Fac Chem & Nat Resources Engn, Kuantan, Malaysia",,"Abdulghani, A (通讯作者)，Fac Ind Management, Kuantan, Malaysia.",airin@ump.edu.my; haslinda@ump.edu.my; anita@ump.edu.my; nraha@ump.edu.my; tym@ump.edu.my; jumani@ump.edu.my; azlinda@ump.edu.my; ezi@ump.edu.my; sitifarhana.haron@gmail.com,"Fauzi, Wan Jumani/L-9453-2016; Mohd Radzuan, Noor Raha/ACU-6542-2022","Mohd Radzuan, Noor Raha/0000-0001-7418-6360",Universiti Malaysia Pahang [RDU160376],Universiti Malaysia Pahang,Authors would like to express gratitude to all early childhood educators who participated in the study and Universiti Malaysia Pahang for the support given under RDU160376.,,23,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4669,4678,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205070,0

As a result, territorial marketing today takes a broader and more in-depth, more strategic and more versatile approach, drawing on sources as diverse as anthropology, sociology, culture, etc. Identity marketing is part of the new practices of territorial marketing and draws from the reservoir of the territory's intrinsic strengths and weaknesses to develop its territorial marketing approach. This paper has two main objectives; the first one is to explore and present the major new marketing practices, the result of observations at the level of several territories - Some of these practices have already been formalized and have proved their worth in terms of results; others have reached in the improvement phase or are going through the experimental stage.

However, such systems have in many occasions failed fully or partially, to realize sought business gains, for reasons of technical or business nature, or due to end-users resistance (Scott and Vessey, 2000; Ginzberg, 1981). Investigations of such failures have led to a general belief that although things could go wrong in any stage of the system life-cycle (selection, implementation and support stages), the lack of 'fit-to purpose' seems to be the common factor among most of the failed cases (Heeks, 2002). This suggests that such systems are not selected, implemented, conFigd or supported based on a proper analysis, and understanding of the organization structure and hierarchy, business functions, business processes and business environment. (Issa-Salwe et al, 2010). Evidently, majority of organizations tend to emphasize system specifications that match their operational and tactical requirements, with little attention given to strategic requirements, culminating in issues with strategic planning and decision-making (Hing and Kim, 2002). This study uses a survey and simple model, based on the characteristics and competitiveness indicators of a category of information systems that is referred to as Strategic Information Systems (SIS), to examine the impact of such systems on the business performance, in 16 medium to large organizations, in different Arab regions, and from different industry sectors (Oil & Gas, Utility, Health, Banking, and Manufacturing). The study concludes with an emphasis of the importance of SIS, to help organizations achieve excellence and competitive advantage, and to ensure alignment to business strategy and focus on realizing business objectives and goals.","[Albadri, Fayez A.] Middle East Univ, Amman, Jordan",Middle East University,"Albadri, FA (通讯作者)，Middle East Univ, Amman, Jordan.",falbadri@meu.edu.jo,,"Albadri, Fayez/0000-0002-6546-0361","Middle East University, Amman, Jordan","Middle East University, Amman, Jordan","The author is grateful to the Middle East University, Amman, Jordan for the financial support granted to cover the participation in the conference and the publication fee of this research article.",,27,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6032,6046,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207002,0

It does so through an innovative engagement with recent literatures on forced labour, unfreedom and hyper-precarity, particularly amongst irregular migrants. We advance two key arguments in this paper. First, that the available data on labour within immigration detention indicate that detainees should legally be considered employees and granted access to labour protections, including the national minimum wage. Second, that work in immigration detention is an example of state-sanctioned exploitative, coercive and unfree labour amongst a hyper-precarious group of the population.

The paper proposes an analysis on the evolution of the phenomenon of agricultural producer's association in Romania, after the change of the 1990 political regime, with emphasis on agricultural cooperatives. The data on the association of producers in the form of agricultural cooperatives were collected from national statistics and relevant organisations. The information found is relatively scarce, it is necessary to complete the bibliographic resources with media information from the literature. During the analysed period the tradition of agricultural cooperatives, successful associations in the interwar period, was re-established. If in 2004-2005 the phenomenon was at its inception, by the middle of 2018 there were over 1000 agricultural cooperatives in Romania, and three associations were established in the field. Although the figures for the establishment of cooperatives in the last years indicate a spectacular growth, the small number of employees or the lack of economic activity show that small Romanian farmers are not yet ready for this form of organisation. On the national level, additional information and financial support measures are needed for the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, which can be a solution for the small agricultural producers in Romania.","[Bichescu, Cezar Ionut; Stanciu, Silvius] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,"Bichescu, CI (通讯作者)，Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania.",Cezar.Bichescu@ugal.ro; sstanciu@ugal.ro,"STANCIU, SILVIUS/R-8246-2017","STANCIU, SILVIUS/0000-0001-7697-0968",,,,,18,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5910,5917,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206096,0

The chosen research model is based on the multivariate comparative analysis of influence factors evolution, using data for the chosen period. The study uses the regression method to assess the contribution of tourism to the economic growth in Eastern European countries. For Estonia and Romania, the hypothesis of economic growth influenced by the tourism industry is confirmed, as evidenced by the evolution of the factors considered. As for Latvia, the economic growth is not dependent on the two factors considered, but only on tourism infrastructure, while in Lithuania and Poland, the factor with direct influence on economic growth is the receipts from tourism. In the case of Slovakia, the results show that tourism development and economic growth do not seem to be sensitive to each other, even if the statistical data indicate a better position in terms of the weight of tourism receipts in GDP over 2005-2016, an average of 2,7% compared to 1,2% for Romania and 2,2% for Latvia. One possible explanation could be the economic structure and contribution of the tourism industry to the GDP of these countries.

Scholars have focused on these regarding networking phenomena: the effects of national and sectoral factors. In spite of their theoretical contributions, attempts have been neglected in identifying and/or linking the factors from both national and sectoral innovation systems within the networks. This paper examines the cross-country differences within a sector, and the cross-sectoral differences within a country, as the consequences of sectoral-national intersections. Longitudinal patent citation networks in two emerging sectors, the hydrogen energy sector and nano-tech sector have been analysed for a time period from 2004 to 2012, in four diverse developed countries. The results convey that the two sectors demonstrate significantly varied networking activities, notably influenced by national capability orientations. On the other hand, cross-country differences in networking activities are also varied by technological path dependence.","[Choi, Hyundo] Chosun Univ, Coll Business, Gwangju, South Korea; [Choi, Hyundo] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Sci Technol & Publ Policy Program, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Park, Sangook] Soongsil Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Chosun University; Harvard University; Soongsil University,"Choi, H (通讯作者)，Chosun Univ, Coll Business, Gwangju, South Korea.;Choi, H (通讯作者)，Harvard Kennedy Sch, Sci Technol & Publ Policy Program, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hyundo_choi@chosun.ac.kr,,,"Science, Technology, and Public Policy program at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School; BP IL on 'Energy, Climate, and Security Policy'","Science, Technology, and Public Policy program at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School; BP IL on 'Energy, Climate, and Security Policy'","Hyundo Choi acknowledges support from the Science, Technology, and Public Policy program at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School, a gift from Shell, and a grant from BP IL on 'Energy, Climate, and Security Policy'.",,81,11,11,4,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

On the grounds that each type of R&D activity differs in terms of salability in disembodied form and growth potential due to innovation, a distinction between product vs. process, and new vs. incremental R&D is made. Empirical tests show that the firm size is significantly associated with both the new and incremental R&D. Moreover, firm size is found to be significantly associated with other types of R&D compositions such as the share of R&D devoted to incremental innovation and multidimensional combinations of product, process, new and incremental R&D. These findings support the idea that large firms possess innovative advantages over smaller firms and firm size is an important determinant for firms' heterogeneous R&D activities.

Confirmatory factor analysis, along with SPSS 24.0 for windows, were used in this study. There were factors that influenced people to select a restaurant, which were service quality, price, trustworthiness, brand, tangible, product quality, location, atmosphere, cleanliness, staff cooperation and quick service. After confirmatory factor analysis had been done, there were 6 factors influenced decision to select a restaurant. Those were service quality, atmosphere, trustworthiness, price, food and beverages selection, and brand. It is important for the businesses to consider these factors while formulating their strategic decisions so that it could help to increase visitors coming to their restaurants.","[Gaffar, Vanessa; Hendrayati, Heny; Bahtiar, Vemi Purwadi] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Management Study Program, Bandung, Indonesia",Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia,"Gaffar, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Management Study Program, Bandung, Indonesia.",vanessa@upi.edu; henyhendrayati@upi.edu; vemi.purwadi.bahtiar@gmail.com,"Gaffar, Vanessa/N-5129-2019; Hendrayati, Heny/GOJ-9897-2022","Gaffar, Vanessa/0000-0003-3304-8679;",,,,,31,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-723-2,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,65,,,,,,123,127,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN2FA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000476673700030,0

This paper analyses how the tensions between the humanitarian imperatives of disease control and the epistemic conventions of bioscientific inquiry played out in the accelerated development, testing and licensure of Ebola vaccines. Beginning with the epidemiological projections of the disease's spread, the paper develops the notion of evidentiary charisma to capture the power of experimental designs and data packages to marshal public health salience, recruit moral legitimacy and short-circuit scientific contestation. Attention to the charismatic dimensions of Ebola vaccine R&D helps to unpick the simultaneous appeals to exception and convention in the unfolding of a global health crisis, and to trace the normative and technical contours of the emerging paradigm of emergency research.","[Kelly, Ann H.] Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, Fac Social Sci & Publ Policy, Sch Global Affairs, Strand Campus, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Kelly, AH (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, Fac Social Sci & Publ Policy, Sch Global Affairs, Strand Campus, London WC2R 2LS, England.",ann.kelly@kcl.ac.uk,,"Kelly, Ann/0000-0003-4658-2133",Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) Programme [MN090415]; U.K. Economic and Social Research Council Urgency Research Grant Scheme [ES/M009203/1]; ESRC [ES/M009203/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) Programme; U.K. Economic and Social Research Council Urgency Research Grant Scheme; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper draws insight from research and policy work undertaken in the context of the Ebola Response Anthropology Platform, funded by the Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) Programme, which is managed by Enhancing Learning and Research for Humanitarian Assistance (ELRHA) [grant no.

Saudi Arabia has been a promising market for global brands owing to high purchasing power of Saudi consumers. However, it is quite challenging to market these brands in Saudi Arabia because of the conservative culture and strict monitoring by religious and governmental authorities. Therefore, having a brand personality scale particularly applicable for the Saudi market will be beneficial in formulating unique marketing and brand communication strategy appropriate for the Saudi customer. Also, brands can reflect on their brand image and brand associations under the light of these brand personality dimensions which can eventually strengthen the brand equity of the company in the Saudi market and increase its market share in Saudi Arabia. For this purpose, twenty-four international brands and four Saudi brands were chosen and 723 Saudi consumers were asked to rate these brand on a list of 104 personality traits. The responses were analysed using factor analysis which resulted in six unique dimensions of brand personality in the context of Saudi Arabia namely; Morality, Religiousness, Competence, Ruggedness, Sophistication and Excitement.","[Khan, Saima; Ahmed, Manzar] Effat Univ, Dept Mkt, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Effat University,"Khan, S (通讯作者)，Effat Univ, Dept Mkt, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",sakhan@effatuniversity.edu.sa; mahmed@effatuniversity.edu.sa,"Khan, Saima/JCE-8123-2023","Khan, Saima/0000-0002-9305-6382",,,,,44,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2558,2563,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203060,0

For ease of calculation the simulation involves a corporate structure without capital ties. Even simplified modelling with transfer pricing is relatively complicated.

We show that Anonymized data (ANNA) software can be integrated with Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness (NORA) to encrypt data before mining. Understanding the types of users in the process of data mining can help determine privacy concerns of every user and thus develop appropriate measures to ensure privacy is preserved.

Glamping emerges as an innovative concept, capable of combining the advantages of camping, making up for the negative issues traditionally associated with it. This topic is justified by the growing trend around the world, which may serve to withdraw camping from the stagnation stage where it is. The present study aims to fill a significant lack of scientific material about glamping in Portugal and to identify the importance given to the attributes that define this concept: Nature, Accommodation, Gastronomy, Service and Experience. This way, focusing on the campsites in Porto's Metropolitan Area (PMA), in the North of Portugal, data was collected through an original questionnaire, obtaining a convenient sample of 201 campers. The overall goal of this study is to identify the attributes that define the concept of glamping. The partial objectives are: to assess which of the attributes of glamping collects the greatest importance by the campers at Porto's Metropolitan Area and to draw the profile of the potential user of the glamping in Porto's Metropolitan Area. The elaboration of these objectives was supported in the understanding of the comments made by users of glamping experiences on the web that helped to identify the key attributes which define the scope and dimensions to this new concept (Brochado & Brochado, 2016). The studies of Gursoy & Chen (2012) had already addressed the reasons that influence the choice of a campsite, where they found some of these coincidental arguments with the concept of glamping. Regarding the analysed attributes, the one which collected the highest value of importance was the attribute related to the questions about Nature, followed by the attributes Service and Accommodation_Amenities. This finding confirms the basis of glamping concept. The profile of the user of this concept was suggested through descriptive analysis. It was also concluded that the importance attributed to the service increases according to the amount willing to pay by the camper, per night in a glamping unit.","[Liberato, Pedro; Liberato, Dalia] Polytech Inst Porto, Sch Hospitality & Tourism, Vila Do Conde, Portugal; [Liberato, Pedro; Liberato, Dalia] CiTUR, Ctr Tourism Res Dev & Innovat, Porto, Portugal; [Coelho, Jose] Polytech Inst Porto, Porto Accounting & Business Sch, Porto, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto,"Liberato, D (通讯作者)，Polytech Inst Porto, Sch Hospitality & Tourism, Vila Do Conde, Portugal.;Liberato, D (通讯作者)，CiTUR, Ctr Tourism Res Dev & Innovat, Porto, Portugal.",pedrolib@esht.ipp.pt; joseantoniodeoliveiracoelho@gmail.com; dalialib@esht.ipp.pt,"Liberato, Dália Filipa/Q-2209-2018; Liberato, Pedro/AAB-9166-2021; Liberato, Pedro/Q-3596-2018","Liberato, Dália Filipa/0000-0003-0513-6444; Liberato, Pedro/0000-0003-2908-1599; Liberato, Pedro/0000-0003-2908-1599",,,,,31,0,0,2,14,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1942,1956,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203002,0

Based on the results of this study, it is expected that student's industrial work experience and career guidance is really a concern from the school to increase the readiness of students to enter the work world. Career Motivation as a variable that has a greater influence must always be improved in order to be aligned with the objectives of SMK.","[Mulyani, Lili Indra; Evanita, Susi; Dwita, Sany] Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Padang,"Mulyani, LI (通讯作者)，Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia.",lili.imulyani2@gmail.com; susievanita@gmail.com; sanydwita@gmail.com,"Dwita, Sany/AAW-4183-2020",,,,,,14,0,0,1,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-703-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,64,,,,,,334,342,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9GP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470910100039,0

Tourism dynamics and structural aspects were determined using the classical methods. In the new member states, tourism plays an important role in the economy, contributing by 6.5 % to GDP, compared to 0.8 % in the EU. Croatia, Cyprus and Malta have over 13% contribution to GDP, keeping the 1st positions in the EU. Tourist arrivals increased by 60.5%, and night stays by 55 % in the analyzed period. Poland, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania are the most visited countries. Tourism growth led to a positive balance (Euro million 21,389). In the future, the development of sustainable tourism will depend on the use of the competitive advantages, the creation of the unique brands, the integration of the tourism strategy in the general strategy, co-operation, capital and labor mobility, innovation, and adaptation to climate change.

In this study, we introduce the concept of general purpose technologies (GPTs) and examine the role of GPTs in the internationalisation of innovation activities. Based on an U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database covering patents granted in the U.S. to large MNCs between 1969 and 1995, our empirical findings suggest that the development of GPTs is closely linked to the internationalisation of corporate innovations. Moreover, the internationalisation of GPTs is significantly associated with the level of centrality of GPTs within an industry. GPTs are more likely to be generated in an innovating firm's foreign countries when they serve as the non-primary technologies in an industry. More importantly, a shift in the creations of GPTs to foreign countries is accompanied with increasingly more innovations in an industry's primary technology areas being moved to host countries.","[Qiu, Ranfeng] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Management Dept, Jack Brown Coll Business & Publ Adm, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA; [Cantwell, John] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch, Dept Management & Global Business, Newark, NJ USA",California State University System; California State University San Bernardino; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Newark,"Qiu, RF (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Management Dept, Jack Brown Coll Business & Publ Adm, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA.",rqiu@csusb.edu,,,,,,,65,8,9,4,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Application of the MIMIC model has allowed to identify the following causal factors of the shadow economy in the Eurozone: employment rate, gender wage gap and income inequalities (expressed as the GINI index). All of these causal factors of the shadow economy in the Eurozone are attributable to the group of labour market determinants, which proposes that a reasonably arranged labour market mechanism can substantially diminish the probability of the shadow economy emergence. On the other hand, it has been found that the level of the shadow economy determines a positive/negative degree of the public trust in the EU authorities. The novelty of the research lies in the disclosure of the main causal factors of the shadow economy in the geographical area that covers different countries with a single currency.

This paper uses panel data on 86 sectors of the Czech economy in 1993-2015, which offer more variation in price changes and display frequent observations of deflation. Our goal is to test the hypothesis whether deflation negatively affects output growth as is commonly thought - and whether central banks should counter all deflation that appears. The most common argument against deflation is that decreasing prices lead consumers and firms to postpone purchases, which in turn depresses output. We find that (1) sectors with output price deflation and below-average inflation have higher growth rate of output, and that (2) these sectors also tend to show quicker growth in gross value added. This evidence contradicts the often held notion that deflation is linked with recession or subpar growth. It also shows that firms with deflating output prices do not have trouble preserving their profits. Deflation observed in the Czech economy in 1993-2015 is likely to be the result of falling unit costs enabled by firms' investment rather than the result of falling demand. This might have policy implications. Our results highlight that monetary policy should differentiate among sources of deflation and that deflation observed in the Czech Republic has been rather of the 'good' type. We believe that our approach using sector data is novel because it uncovers more variation in prices and output than the more common approach that uses macroeconomic aggregates.","[Ryska, Pavel] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Ryska, Pavel] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Sklenar, Petr] J&T Banka As, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Charles University Prague,"Ryska, P (通讯作者)，Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.;Ryska, P (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",pavel_ryska@volny.cz; sklenar@jtbank.cz,,"Ryska, Pavel/0000-0001-5464-1194",,,,,19,0,0,0,4,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This study examines this question from three dimensions: (1) top management team (TMT) leadership, (2) knowledge links and (3) organizational size. Our model is tested using a sample of 250 MNC subsidiaries located in Korea. We found that non-expatriate or entrepreneurship-oriented TMT leadership generally enhances subsidiary-driven innovation. We also found that the level of networking with local knowledge sources is associated positively with subsidiary-driven innovation. In addition, the relative size of the subsidiary shows an inverted U-shaped relationship with subsidiary-driven innovation. Finally, the relationship between subsidiary-driven innovation and subsidiary performance is positively moderated by environmental dynamism. The results suggest that as foreign subsidiaries gain autonomy, the likelihood of subsidiary-driven innovation increases.","[Song, Yunah] Chosun Univ, Dept Int Trade, Coll Business, Gwangju, South Korea; [Park, Young-Ryeol; Kwak, Jooyoung] Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, Int Business, Seoul, South Korea",Chosun University; Yonsei University,"Park, YR (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, 134 Shinchon Dong, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",yrpark@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Chosun University,Chosun University,"This study was supported by research fund from Chosun University, 2017.",,60,5,5,3,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Drawing upon nearly four years of work as a tenant organizer, I address this issue by examining how the social relations of landed property have been integral to the formation, transformation, and deterioration of ethnic ties among Polish migrants in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Specifically, I argue that the social relations of property among Polish migrantswhat I call enclave propertyhave enabled the acquisition, maintenance, and improvement of landed property in and through the production of ethnicity. With the gentrification of the neighborhood, however, the social relations of immigrant housing that helped produce the enclave in the 1980s and 1990s have been strained, and rising property values have transformed relations of ethnicity among Polish migrants into mechanisms for property accumulation by dispossession. The upshot has been the hollowing out of the enclave, as Polish migrant tenants have been displaced from Greenpoint, leaving behind a co-ethnic landlord class and their wealthier American tenants.","[Stabrowski, Filip] CUNY, LaGuardia Community Coll, Anthropol, Long Isl City, NY 11101 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Stabrowski, F (通讯作者)，CUNY, LaGuardia Community Coll, Anthropol, Long Isl City, NY 11101 USA.",,,,,,,,43,1,1,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This way, economic base is created for starting the rise of productive services' branches. Prolonging the zenith and horizon of productive employment of those people that help to increase the innovation potential of society does not limit the employment of younger generations, actually the opposite is true - it significantly contributes to the creation of qualified jobs. Socioeconomic schemes, that are included in this article, have significant advantage in their orientation to accumulation and following effective allocation of available resources of economically active people. This is given the parameters of Czech economy (lower wages, low human capital investment, existing space for slight increase of health expenditure) suitable approach which can overcome a lot of systemic limitations. The majority of current models of financing productive services' branches has outcome either from a principle of central financing of public service, or simple realization of market demand of an individual. Both of these approaches are not enough for this development phase and it is necessary to supplement them with emphasis on individual or community (group) investment strategies into human abilities' development including appropriate construction of financial schemes.","[Valencik, Radim; Bedretidnov, Rafik; Sochrova, Helena; Bohinsky, Petr] Vysoka Skola Financni Spravni, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Valencik, R (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Financni Spravni, Prague, Czech Republic.",radim.valencik@seznam.cz; bolingbroke@seznam.cz; helena.sochrova@gmail.com; 31480@mail.vsfs.cz,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,2,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2238-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,475,490,,,,,,16,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2QE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507522000045,0

Three hypotheses were selected in this research: the first, there are correlations between the team's cohesion scales, selfconfidence, the place and the number of goals achieved by the team; the second, the place of the team in competitions is affected by self-confidence and the indicators of the team cohesion scale content; the third, the number of goals achieved by the team in competitions is affected by self-confidence as well as the indicators of the team cohesion scale content. The place won by the team weakly correlates with two cohesion scales of the team ATG-T, GI T and self-confidence. The number of goals correlates weakly with GI -T and self-confidence. In the case of the games won there is a positive correlation between the three cohesion scales of the team and the indicators of self-confidence (p<0.05). Linear regression models are not appropriate to describe the researched effect of psychological variables on the place won in the competitions (p>0.05). In our research, the effect of psychological factors on the number of goals shot by the team varies from 19.1% (if the model includes only self-confidence indicators) up to 59.7% (if the model includes four researched psychological factors: three team cohesion scales and self-confidence). Applying the backward regression method, the ATG-S scale was eliminated from the model. Only the first and the third hypotheses proved to be true (p<0.05).","[Vazne, Zermena] Latvian Acad Sport Educ, Dept Theory, Brivibas 333, LV-1006 Riga, Latvia; [Zidens, Janis] Latvian Acad Sport Educ, Dept Sport Games, Brivibas 333, LV-1006 Riga, Latvia; [Grants, Juris] Latvian Acad Sport Educ, Dept Skiing, Brivibas 333, LV-1006 Riga, Latvia; [Svagzdiene, Biruta] Lithuanian Acad Phys Educ, Sport Management, Dept Econ & Sociol, Fac Sports Educ, Sporto Str 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania",Latvian Academy of Sport Education; Latvian Academy of Sport Education; Latvian Academy of Sport Education; Lithuanian Sports University,"Vazne, Z (通讯作者)，Latvian Acad Sport Educ, Dept Theory, Brivibas 333, LV-1006 Riga, Latvia.",zermena.vazne@lspa.lv; janis.zidens@lspa.lv; juris.grants@lspa.lv,,,,,,,14,6,6,0,15,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

This article discusses an issue that has fundamental significance both for the economy's prospects and in its practical usefulness, as the art of managing in contemporary conditions. The research addresses issues related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in enterprises operating in the Pomerania Euroregion (The Pomerania Euroregion is a border region of particular significance. It connects German and Polish territory, and since February 1998, Swedish communities as well. In light of its location, the Pomerania Euroregion is a link connecting Central Europe with Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. From the point of view of further European integration, the east-west and north-south connections formed throughout history on the territory of Pomerania are growing in relevance today, making it possible to gradually achieve the EU's dream of harmonisation of living conditions in the member countries of the Pomerania Euroregion) (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany and Poland's Zachodniopomorskie Province). Entities operating in the tourism sector, offering accommodation, are analysed in this publication. The purpose of the article is to present the results of research concerning the implementation of CSR principles in the area of investment in employee development by Polish and German micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the Pomerania Euroregion and to indicate cultural differences in this sphere and their influence on the employer-employee relationship. Taking as the paper's starting point the problem's relationship to investment in employee development, the following research hypothesis was formulated: Inspiring employees to develop their skills and to engage in long-term career planning contributes to the intensification of cooperation in regional relations.","[Wolska, Grazyna; Bretyn, Agnieszka] Univ Szczecin, Fac Management & Econ Serv, Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Bretyn, A (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Management & Econ Serv, Szczecin, Poland.",grazyna.wolska@wzieu.pl; agnieszka.bretyn@wzieu.pl,"Wolska, Grazyna/M-3004-2018","Wolska, Grazyna/0000-0002-7289-5179",Polsko-Niemiecka Fundacja na Rzecz Nauki [2015-24],Polsko-Niemiecka Fundacja na Rzecz Nauki,This paper is part of a project titled: Spoleczna odpowiedzialnosc biznesu narzedziem innowacyjnosci i integracji polskich i niemieckich przedsiebiorstw.

Public transport models are commonly applied to predict ridership due to structural network changes, using a calibrated parameter set. Predicting the impact of planned disturbances, like temporary track closures, on public transport ridership is however an unexplored area. In the Netherlands, this area becomes increasingly important, given the many track closures operators are confronted with the last and upcoming years. We investigated the passenger impact of four planned disturbances on the public transport network of The Hague, the Netherlands, by comparing predicted and realized public transport ridership using smart card data. A three-step search procedure is applied to find a parameter set resulting in higher prediction accuracy. We found that in-vehicle time in rail-replacing bus services is perceived times more negatively compared to in-vehicle time perception in the initial tram line. Waiting time for temporary rail-replacement bus services is found to be perceived approximate to 1.3 times higher, compared to waiting time perception for regular tram and bus services. Besides, passengers do not seem to perceive the theoretical benefit of the usually higher frequency of rail-replacement bus services compared to the frequency of the replaced tram line. For the different case studies, the new parameter set results in 3% up to 13% higher prediction accuracy compared to the default parameter set. It supports public transport operators to better predict the required supply of rail-replacement services and to predict the impact on their revenues.","[Yap, M.

Notably, it acts as a fee or penalty to the landowners for not developing the land. This study is motivated to provide some evidence by discovering how the market reacts to the announcement of white land tax during the short-run period. Using the market-adjusted return model, evidence indicates that real estate development and construction companies significantly underperformed both equal-weighted and value-weighted market benchmarks during few days surrounding the announcement date. The results imply that investors show less favourable reactions to such event. The results also contribute to evident that indication of size effects are seen in difference results when this study switches from equal-weighted to value weighting.","[Zakaria, Nadisah; Ali, Zaiton] Prince Sultan Univ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Awang, Mohd Zamri] Taqeem Acad, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Prince Sultan University,"Zakaria, N (通讯作者)，Prince Sultan Univ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",nzakaria@psu.edu.sa; zali@psu.edu.sa; mawang@taqeem.gov.sa,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,31,40,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553200003,0

The management practices of the supply chain and environmental and economic performance were analyzed. The results showed that cooperation strategies have not been widely used by the companies and that in practice internal management differs in relation to the postulates of the environmental policy and the expressed strategic objectives. In relation to the concept of sustainable production, there is a great concern to adhere to ecological practices either internally or with suppliers. Furthermore, the variables involving clients and reverse logistics have not presented enlightening results. The companies studied showed to use more prominently the practices of internal environmental management, sustainable manufacturing and ecodesign.

The paper characterizes the land value function and the optimum rotations, highlighting the differences between this non-autonomous problem and the traditional Faustmann problem. We show that, from one harvest to the next until the switch, rotations can be constant and equal to the Faustmann rotation, or increasingly higher than the Faustmann rotation, or decreasingly lower. In the last two situations, the higher the number of previous harvests of the currently planted species before the switch to the alternative use, the closer the last rotation is to the Faustmann rotation.

The authors have found that little work has been undertaken to understand the general nature of criminal activity by intra-EU migrant populations. Data on localised offending by foreign nationals can be used to inform intelligence by national and international police agencies, to generate effective cross-border information exchange, aid investigatory techniques and significantly inform crime reduction activity and policies. However, where such information is not collected and available for analysis within member states, informed knowledge within and between member states is difficult to achieve.

Yet a growing body of research indicates that by building interfranchisee relationships, franchisees can form advice networks in the chain. Such networks offer privileged access to resources such as knowledge, information, and best practices that help individual franchisees to become more productive. In this context, we study linkages between a franchisee's centrality in franchisee relationships and various individual performance outcomes, using comprehensive data from franchisees in 3 different chains in the largest European franchise market, France. We find that conditional on the specific governance structure of each chain, the results document a strong impact of centrality in advice networks on franchisee performance. Accordingly, we offer theoretical contributions concerning knowledge-sharing processes in franchise chains, and managerial implications as regards more effective cooperation management in practice, from the perspective of both a franchisee and a franchisor.","[Meiseberg, Brinja] Westfal Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Strateg Management, Leonardo Campus 18, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Mignonac, Karim; El Akremi, Assaad] Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, Toulouse, France; [Perrigot, Rozenn] Univ Rennes 1, Grad Sch Management IGR IAE Rennes, Rennes 7, France; [Perrigot, Rozenn] Univ Rennes 1, CREM UMR CNRS 6211, Rennes 7, France",University of Munster; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Universite de Rennes; Universite de Rennes,"Meiseberg, B (通讯作者)，Westfal Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Strateg Management, Leonardo Campus 18, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",meiseberg@ism.uni-muenster,,,French National Research Agency [FRANBLE - ANR-12-BSH1-0011-01],French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"French National Research Agency, Grant/Award Number: FRANBLE - ANR-12-BSH1-0011-01",,90,10,10,0,20,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

A number of recent Dutch urban extension projects offer interesting case studies on the integration of heritage into planning. The projects were part of a large housing programme, known as the Vinex programme, which was initiated by the Dutch national government but executed by local authorities. They therefore provide interesting cases for comparison. This paper presents a number of these projects, focusing on the use of heritage, which allows us to classify different ways of incorporating heritage into plans: integration, embeddedness and isolation. Another classification involves different views and interpretations about heritage, and describes diminishing degrees of authenticity entailed in preservation, transformation and inspiration. Combining both types of classification may offer a framework for further research on the relationship between heritage and planning.","[Renes, J.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Renes, J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Humanities, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Renes, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.;Renes, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Humanities, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.renes@uu.nl,,"Renes, Hans/0000-0001-7624-1212",,,,,63,0,0,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We select a set of variables that are monitored by market participants, track their release calendar, and use vintages of real-time data to reproduce the information sets that were available at the time when the forecasts would have been made. The accuracy of the forecasts produced by the model is comparable to those of the forecasts made by the market participants and institutional forecasters. We show that including U.S. data in a now-casting model for Canada improves its predictive accuracy dramatically, mainly because of the absence of timely production data for Canada.

We adopt an Oaxaca-Blinder approach and decompose the gender gap in educational achievement into endowment and response components. Our estimation relies on unusually rich panel data from the Longitudinal Survey of Australian Children in which information on child development reported by parents and teachers is linked to each child's results on a national, standardized achievement test. We find that girls in low- and middle-socio-economic-status (SES) families have an advantage in reading, while boys in high-SES families have an advantage in numeracy. Girls score higher on their third-grade reading tests in large part because they were more ready for school at age 4 and had better teacher-assessed literacy skills in kindergarten. Boys' advantage in numeracy occurs because they achieve higher numeracy test scores than girls with the same education-related characteristics.","[Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.; Moschion, Julie] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.; Moschion, Julie] ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Moschion, Julie] Univ Nanterre, EconomiX, Nanterre, France",University of Melbourne; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Moschion, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.;Moschion, J (通讯作者)，ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;Moschion, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nanterre, EconomiX, Nanterre, France.",moschion@unimelb.edu.au,"Moschion, Julie/L-1668-2013; Cobb-Clark, Deborah/H-1153-2013","Moschion, Julie/0000-0002-7064-7366; Cobb-Clark, Deborah/0000-0003-2895-7886",Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course [CE140100027],Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course(Australian Research Council),"The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

While surveys regularly point out a demand by citizens for harsher punishment, the differences between surveys' and real decisions' conditions are large enough to cast a doubt on the results. The introduction of two jurors into a court composed of three professional judges in two French regions and for a subsample of crimes during sixteen months offers a good natural experiment. Difference-in-differences or triple-difference methods do not permit me to identify any major change in the probability of being convicted or in sentences given by a court including jurors. If some characteristics of the reform could partly explain those null results, they clearly go against the hypothesis of a major disagreement between professional judges and citizens when they have to make real decisions in criminal cases.

The results show that the incumbent's prices decreased by 12.6 percent on average between March 2015 and June 2016. The price level of the competitor is well below the average price that was offered in the pre-entry period. Further, the largest price reduction, in percentage terms, was found on tickets booked 13 days before departure date.

J,"Ettmayr, C; Lloyd, H",,,,"Ettmayr, Christopher; Lloyd, Hendrik",,,Local content requirements and the impact on the South African renewable energy sector: A survey-based analysis,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: Economies aim to grow over time, which usually implies the need for increased energy availability. Governments can use their procurement of energy to increase benefits in their economies via certain policy tools. One such tool is local content requirements (LCRs), where the purchase of goods prescribes that a certain value has to be sourced locally. The argument for this tool is that spending is localised and manufacturing, as well as job creation, can be stimulated because industry will need to establish in the host economy. However, this practice is distortionary in effect and does not create a fair playing ground for global trade. Furthermore, if the local content definition is weak, or open to manipulation, the goals of such a policy may not be achieved at all. Aim: The objective of this study was to determine how LCRs would ultimately impact on the overall procurement programme. Setting: This study took place as South Africa commenced with large scale development of the renewable energy sector. This was largely achieved via the State run Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP). Method: This study utilised opinion-based surveys to look into the LCRs of South Africa's REIPPPP and measure the impact of this policy on the renewable energy sector in general. The mixed method approach was utilised to analyse qualitative and quantitative data and this was then triangulated with an international peer group to arrive at certain conclusions. The Delphi Technique was then employed to achieve population consensus on the findings. Results and conclusion: It was found that, in order to implement a policy such as local content without any negative welfare effects, the host economy had to show certain pre-existing conditions. Because South Africa does not hold all supportive pre-conditions, the impact and effect of LCRs have not been optimal, and it has not been found to be a sustainable mechanism to continue using indefinitely. The pricing of renewable energy was also found to be higher due to local content and such pricing is passed on to the energy consumer. The welfare created for South Africa, which should be in a trade-off for the creation of jobs and manufacturing, is therefore diminished and coupled with unsustainability and potential manipulation of the system, the country does not seem to be benefitting as it should be from this specific application of a local content policy.","[Ettmayr, Christopher; Lloyd, Hendrik] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Sch Econ Dev & Tourism, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University,"Lloyd, H (通讯作者)，Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Sch Econ Dev & Tourism, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",hendrik.lloyd@nmmu.ac.za,"Lloyd, Hendrik/R-9834-2019",,,,,,25,13,16,0,2,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We analyzed the optimal management strategy at the stand level in even-aged pine stands in the case where stems are valued based on the prices and predicted quantities of the end products of the sawing process at the stand level (QualityPremiumCase). The QPC was then compared to the base case (BC) in which quality indifferent unit prices are used. We used a simulation-optimization system OptiFor in which a process-based growth model PipeQual provides growth predictions that include input variables for models that predict the lumber grades and by-products percentages of the total volume of stems. Growth model predictions, harvesting cost function, and models for predicting the yield of various sawn wood grades and by-products of the sawing process, in addition to exogenous unit prices and processing costs were used for calculation of the bare land value as a function of the decision variables. Numerical optimization, by Osyczka's direct and random search algorithm was used to determine the management regime that maximized the bare land value for both cases. Fewer thinnings in the QPC were optimal compared to the BC. Thinnings were heavier, and time intervals between thinnings were longer in the QPC than in the BC. The yield of sawn wood was significantly higher and the quality distribution of sawn wood better in the QPC.

With increased public concerns about intercity bus safety, effectively managing travel risk has become critical for both intercity bus operators and road safety policy makers. Intercity bus drivers are generally at a higher risk for crashes due to long hours of driving and exposure to different road conditions. Therefore, understanding and quantifying their risks and taking steps to manage them could improve intercity bus safety. The aim of this study is to establish a safety performance index for each risk domain to measure and compare intercity bus safety in terms of risk factors. The risk domains considered in this study were road environment conditions, bus driver driving behaviors and bus safety conditions. The weighted indicators were aggregated into the safety performance index for each risk domain was done using the Exploratory Factor Analysis method. The paired sample t-test was then applied to determine which safety performance indices were significantly different from each other. The results indicate that road environment conditions have contributed more to intercity bus safety risks on the east coast than on the west coast of peninsular Malaysia. The evidence presented in this study shows that different intercity bus companies showed mixed safety performance in different risk domains. Therefore, we suggest the development of targeted road safety programs for each intercity bus company to address intercity bus safety problems.","[Law, Teik Hua; Daud, Mohd Shazwan; Hamid, Hussain; Haron, Nuzul Azarn] Univ Putra Malaysia, Rd Safety Res Ctr, Civil Engn Dept, Fac Engn, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Law, TH (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Rd Safety Res Ctr, Civil Engn Dept, Fac Engn, Serdang 43400, Malaysia.",lawteik@upm.edu.my; Shazwan_daud@yahoo.com; hushamid@upm.edu.my; nuzul@upm.edu.my,"Law, Teik-Hua/AAO-9999-2021","Law, Teik-Hua/0000-0002-1560-1672; Haron, Nuzul Azam/0000-0002-4745-8970",Ministry of Education Malaysia [ERGS/1-2013/5527146],Ministry of Education Malaysia,"This research was funded by Ministry of Education Malaysia (Grant no.

J,"Brink, SM",,,,"Brink, Sophia M.",,,An investigation into the future of discretionary trusts in South Africa: An income tax perspective: Part 2,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: Trusts have long been used as an estate planning mechanism, including the avoidance of estate duty and donations tax. In the 2016 National Budget the Minister of Finance indicated that Government was proposing several legislative measures during 2016/2017 to prevent individuals from using a trust to avoid estate duty (and donations tax to a certain extent). Unexpectedly, the 2016 draft Taxation Laws Amendment Bill and the final Amendment Bill did not give effect to any of these proposals, but introduced other less drastic measures to control the abuse of trusts for tax purposes, albeit with the same stated purpose. Aim: The main aim of the study was to clarify the reform proposals (albeit unclear and consequently based on certain assumptions) and to compare the reform proposals with the final amendments. This comparison will shed some light on the fairness and appropriateness of the final amendments and, more importantly, on the possibility that the reform proposals published by National Treasury in February 2016 not included in the final amendments will be enacted in the future. This investigation will assist tax practitioners and taxpayers in effective tax and estate planning, given that the reform proposals and final amendments have a possible impact on the future of discretionary trusts in South Africa. Setting: This article examines existing literature in a South African income tax environment. Methods: In order to meet this objective a qualitative approach based on a literature study of pure theoretical aspects was used. Results and conclusion: It was found that should the reform proposals become law, many trusts would become ineffective from a tax-planning perspective and these changes might erode other benefits trusts offer, jeopardising the future of discretionary trusts in South Africa.","[Brink, Sophia M.] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Brink, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",sophiabrink@sun.ac.za,,"Brink, SOPHIA/0000-0003-2716-7102",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The observations presented within this paper reveal that traffic dynamics are potentially different when a prolonged and unexpected network disruption occurs rather than a preplanned closure. Following the disruption from the I-35W Bridge's unexpected collapse, we witnessed a unique trend: an avoidance phenomenon after the disruption. More specifically, drivers are observed to drastically avoid areas near the disruption site, but gradually return after a period of time following the collapse. This trend is not observed in preplanned closures studied to date. To model avoidance, it is proposed that the tragedy generated a perceived travel cost that discouraged commuters from using these sections. These perceived costs are estimated for the Twin Cities network and found to be best described as an exponential decay cost curve with respect to time. After reinstituting this calibrated cost curve into a mesoscopic simulator, the simulated traffic into the discouraged areas are found to be within acceptable limits of the observed traffic on a week-by-week basis. The proposed model is applicable to both practitioners and researchers in many traffic-related fields by providing an understanding of how traffic dynamics will evolve after a long-term, unexpected network disruption.","[Danczyk, Adam; Levinson, David M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil Environm & Geo Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Di, Xuan] Columbia Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Engn Mech, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Liu, Henry X.] Univ Michigan, Transportat Res Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Levinson, David M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Civil Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Columbia University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Sydney,"Liu, HX (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Transportat Res Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",henryliu@umich.edu,"Liu, Henry/HHN-7290-2022; Liu, Henry/ABE-6544-2020; Levinson, David Matthew/A-8554-2012","Liu, Henry/0000-0002-3685-9920; Levinson, David Matthew/0000-0002-4563-2963",National Science Foundation [CMMI 0825768],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was partially funded by the National Science Foundation (CMMI 0825768).

I position the themed issue at the intersection of geographies of sexualities, embodied geographies and emotional geographies, and suggest how the papers collectively contribute to geographies of sexualities and to human geography more broadly. The themed issue entwines the themes of the body' and emotions' to advance understandings of embodied emotions in geographies of sexualities and beyond. I identify three ways in which embodied emotions are taken forward in geographical thinking. First, the capacity for emotionally embodied fieldwork generates insights into collective embodiment and communities of practice, at the same time contesting masculinist objectivity and detachment in knowledge production. Second, new spaces of encounter - such as online forums and social media - are not distinct from everyday geographies, but instead are part of a virtual-physical emotional landscape that extends embodiment across material and digital environments. Third, the innovative combination of different elements of feminist geographical thinking - such as intersectionality, the body and emotion and affect - generates new understandings of inequality across and between social identities.","[Gorman-Murray, Andrew] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Urban Res Program, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Gorman-Murray, A (通讯作者)，Western Sydney Univ, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Urban Res Program, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",a.gorman-murray@westernsydney.edu.au,,"Gorman-Murray, Andrew/0000-0001-7479-8172",,,,,28,4,6,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

It further suggests that childcare services are an important determinant for the transition to a second child to occur. The theoretical framework we propose suggests that (i) in countries where childcare coverage is low, there is a U-shaped relationship between a couple's probability of having a second child and the woman's potential wage, whereas (ii) in countries with easy access to childcare, this probability is positively related with the woman's potential wage. Data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) confirm these implications when estimating a woman's probability of having a second child as a function of education. This implies that middle-income women are the most affected ones by the lack of access to formal and subsidized childcare.","[D'Albis, Hippolyte] CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Gobbi, Paula E.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium; [Greulich, Angela] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & Ined, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Catholique Louvain,"Greulich, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & Ined, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75013 Paris, France.",angela.greulich@univ-paris1.fr,,"d'Albis, Hippolyte/0000-0002-6409-4320","European Research Council (ERC) [DU 283953]; Chaire Transitions demographiques, Transitions economiques","European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Chaire Transitions demographiques, Transitions economiques","This research was supported by the European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant DU 283953) and the Chaire Transitions demographiques, Transitions economiques.",,41,15,16,2,27,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

Among his many contributions, Posner offered an early conjecture that remains fascinating and controversial to this day: the idea that common law rules are more likely than legislative codes to be concerned with efficiency. In this paper, I compare the efficiency of a common law rule of contracting to the efficiency of a civil law rule. In common law jurisdictions, claimants must have knowledge of a reward in order to recover. In civil law jurisdictions, however, no such knowledge is required. I analyze the efficiency of each rule by examining the incentives created by each rule. In a finding that agrees with Posner's hypothesis, I argue that the common law rule is more efficient. The model has a number of applications beyond contract default laws. I use the model to discuss three legal questions previously analyzed by Richard Posner: (1) incentivizing innovation; (2) the finders-keepers rule in property law; and (3) salvage rights in maritime law.","[Niblett, Anthony] Univ Toronto, Fac Law, 84 Queens Pk Cres W, Toronto, ON M5S 2C5, Canada",University of Toronto,"Niblett, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Fac Law, 84 Queens Pk Cres W, Toronto, ON M5S 2C5, Canada.",anthony.niblett@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,48,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Within the framework of the autocontour-based tests proposed by Gonzalez-Rivera et al.

These tests have asymptotic distributions that are nuisance-parameter free and they are correctly sized and very powerful for detecting breaks in the parameters of the conditional mean and conditional variance. A power comparison with the tests of Rossi and Sekhposyan (2013) shows that our tests are more powerful across the models considered in their work. We analyze the stability of a dynamic Phillips curve and find that the best one-step-ahead density forecast of changes in inflation is generated by a Markov switching model that allows state shifts in the mean and variance of inflation changes as well as in the coefficient that links inflation and unemployment.

Return predictability can be assessed via a variety of random walk statistical tests or via the application of mechanical trading rules. Findings of return predictability and state of market efficiency are compared by applying a battery of popular random walk statistical tests and a large set of mechanical trading rules to a family of equity indexes in Asia-Pacific equity markets over a 20-year period of time. Inferences drawn from different random walk based econometric tests of market efficiency often disagree among themselves and tend to exaggerate the extent of predictability in returns. Testing of return predictability via a set of mechanical trading rules allows one to account for a possible data snooping bias, error measurements due to nonsynchronous trading and market frictions such as trading costs.

However, the relationship between them and the implications of their combination remain largely unexplored. This article examines both the instrumental and normative dimensions of the relationship. It concludes that, on the current evidence, the case for criminalization on the grounds of enhancing leniency effectiveness is weak and that a leniency policy may undermine the normative function and force of the criminal law. The clear overarching implication of these conclusions is that the cartel criminalization-leniency combination is to be approached with considerable caution.","[Beaton-Wells, Caron] Univ Melbourne, Law Sch, Competit Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Beaton-Wells, Caron] Univ Melbourne, Law Sch, Global Competit & Consumer Law Program, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Beaton-Wells, C (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Law Sch, Competit Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Beaton-Wells, C (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Law Sch, Global Competit & Consumer Law Program, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",c.beaton-wells@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,80,5,5,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

I begin by introducing switcher's curse, a trap in which a decision maker systematically switches too often. Decision makers suffer from switcher's curse if they forget the reason that they maintained incumbent policies in the past and if they naively compare rival and incumbent policies with no bias for incumbent policies. Conservatism emerges as a heuristic to avoid switcher's curse. The longer a process or policy has been in place, the more conservative one should be. On the other hand, the more conservative were past decision makers, the more progressive one should be today.","[Edlin, Aaron] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Edlin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",edlin@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

The article arrives at two main conclusions (assuming that the cost of enforcement is linear, criminal's type is uniformly distributed, and the society is wealthy enough): (1) electoral competition entails no loss of efficiency at equilibrium for both minor and major offenses (e.g., minor offenses are not enforced, while major ones are fully deterred); (2) distortions arises at equilibrium only in the range of intermediate offenses: enforcement expenditure for small offenses is lower than at optimal level, such that the issue of under-deterrence is exacerbated; in contrast, for more serious offenses, enforcement measures are higher, and there is more (possibly, over) deterrence as compared to what efficiency requires. We show that these results also generalize under more general assumptions, except that full deterrence of major offenses is no longer achievable (a less wealthy society), or enforcement expenditure is bounded above (under convex enforcement costs).","[Langlais, Eric] CNRS, EconomiX, Paris, France; [Langlais, Eric] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre, Paris, France; [Obidzinski, Marie] CRED, 21 Rue Valette, F-75005 Paris, France; [Obidzinski, Marie] Univ Paris II, 21 Rue Valette, F-75005 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Nanterre; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Obidzinski, M (通讯作者)，CRED, 21 Rue Valette, F-75005 Paris, France.;Obidzinski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris II, 21 Rue Valette, F-75005 Paris, France.",marie.obidzinski@u-paris2.fr,"Obidzinski, Marie/HGB-7775-2022","Obidzinski, Marie/0000-0002-7769-3795",COMUE Universite Paris Lumieres,COMUE Universite Paris Lumieres,"We are thankful to the editor, Abraham Wickelgren, and two referees for their comments and suggestions.

Empirical analysis of such a question is difficult because of the joint determination of entrepreneurship and economic growth. This article uses two different sets of variables-the homestead exemption levels in state bankruptcy laws from 1975 and the share of metropolitan statistical area (MSA) overlaying aquifers-to instrument for entrepreneurship and examine urban employment and wage growth between 1993 and 2002. Despite using different sets of instrumental variables, the ranges of twostage least squares estimates are surprisingly similar. A 10% increase in the birth of small businesses increases MSA employment by 1.3-2.2%, annual payroll by 2.44.0%, and wages by 1.2-2.0% after 10 years. Furthermore, an accounting exercise shows that the employment and payroll growth from entrepreneurship are not confined to the initially created businesses but spillover to the aggregate urban economy.","[Lee, Yong Suk] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, 616 Serra St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Lee, YS (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, 616 Serra St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",yongslee@stanford.edu,,,,,,,22,17,21,1,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Most of these innovations are driven by alternative fuels. Subsidies for buyers and governmental investment in service infrastructure are widely used. This paper investigates the question of efficient market intervention by considering the two-sided market character of the automobile market. This study shows that network effects, competitive effects triggered by an increase in automobile users, decreasing marginal utilities of additional service stations and, in the case of governmental support, environmental externalities determine the welfare-efficient extent of platform intermediation. Regarding green technologies, the results of the analysis indicate that governmental promotion of service infrastructure is reasonable, although governments should be cautious about subsidizing buyers.

In recent years, increasing importance has been given to better regulation, namely the improvement of the quality of legislation with regards to state functioning. The purpose of this article is to examine the contribution of better regulation in the compliance of public entities with budgetary laws and regulations. The survey was the first such study to be conducted in Greece, and distributed questionnaires to auditors of the Hellenic Court of Audit, which is the Supreme Audit Institution charged with the authority to conduct external auditing of public entities and their executives. The survey results have confirmed the sense of weakness mentioned above, as most respondents considered the existing legislative framework of public financial management to be unclear, a situation that deterred compliance. Improved law design is expected to ameliorate compliance by public sector bodies, which apparently violate the law more due to its ambiguity and complexity rather than to any deliberate intention. Therefore, non-compliance should be better addressed through simplification of regulations rather than coercive enforcement.","[Kontogeorga, Georgia N.] Univ Patras, Hellen Court Audit, Commissioner Serv Achaia 1, Campus Rio Patras, Patras 26500, Greece",University of Patras,"Kontogeorga, GN (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Hellen Court Audit, Commissioner Serv Achaia 1, Campus Rio Patras, Patras 26500, Greece.",kont_georgia@yahoo.gr,"KONTOGEORGA, GEORGIA/M-5548-2019","KONTOGEORGA, GEORGIA/0000-0002-9830-324X",,,,,35,1,1,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We collected 2013, 2012 and 2011 data for Investments, Intangible Assets, Total Assets, Net Assets, Total Revenues, Own Revenues (of sales), Sponsorships, Public Grants, Total Expenses, Advertising Expense, Gain or Loss. We calculated 2013-2012 and 2012-2011 variations in order to understand the strategic choice and how increasing or decreasing promotion effort affect the latest performances. Clusters in time series analysis show that, there is a strategic shift (increase vs. decrease) for Italian Performing Arts from 2011 to 2013. Most of theatres are concentrated in one cluster both for the analysis with 2013-2012 variations and with 2012-2011 ones. When theatres have increased Advertising Expense and Intangible Assets, Revenues and especially, Own Revenues, they both increase. The positive impact of the marketing effort is on Revenues and at a lesser extent, on Net Assets and Gains.","[Besana, Angela; Calzolari, Alessia] Univ IULM, Dept Business, Econ, Law, Milan, Italy",IULM International University Languages & Media,"Besana, A (通讯作者)，Univ IULM, Dept Business, Econ, Law, Milan, Italy.",angela.besana@iulm.it; alessia.calzolari001@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5,,,,,,915,924,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_59,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000059,0

The paper is the result of a collaborative process among several OI scholars - having a common basis in the recurrent Professional Development Workshop on Researching Open Innovation' at the Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management. In this paper, we present opportunities for future research on OI, organised at different levels of analysis. We discuss some of the contingencies at these different levels, and argue that future research needs to study OI - originally an organisational-level phenomenon - across multiple levels of analysis. While our integrative framework allows comparing, contrasting and integrating various perspectives at different levels of analysis, further theorising will be needed to advance OI research. On this basis, we propose some new research categories as well as questions for future research - particularly those that span across research domains that have so far developed in isolation.","[Bogers, Marcel] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zobel, Ann-Kristin; Ter Wal, Anne L.

Globally, the number of older people is expected to more than double, from 841 million people in 2013 to more than two billion in 2050. Processes associated with the ageing population will result in a steady increase of interest in long-term care services, such us residential care. On the other hand, the increasing demand for services of residential care will be caused by the fact that globally only 40% of older people live independently.

The model is tested on a large sample based on CIS survey for Spain. The empirical analysis confirms the U-inverted relationship between outsourcing breadth and innovation and also reveals an interesting result: the complementary effect of R&D cooperation varies with the level of R&D outsourcing breadth and it is not confirmed for low and medium levels of R&D outsourcing breadth. The results have important implications for theory on the selection of different modes of inbound open innovation and for managers and their cooperation and outsourcing strategies.","[Gimenez-Fernandez, Elena M.; Sandulli, Francesco D.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Gimenez-Fernandez, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Madrid, Spain.",elegimen@ucm.es,"sandulli, francesco/AAA-8103-2019; Gimenez-Fernandez, Elena M/G-8900-2017","Gimenez-Fernandez, Elena M/0000-0002-7234-0296; sandulli, francesco domenico/0000-0003-0831-9959",Spanish Ministry of Education [FPU 2013/01259]; Spanish Ministry of Economy [ECO2013-44816-R],Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy(Spanish Government),The authors would like to thank the National Programs FPU from the Spanish Ministry of Education (Ref.

It empirically analyzes the impact of institutional quality proxied by control for corruption, government effectiveness, and protection of the property right index among others on economic growth in sub-Saharan African countries during the sample period 1996-2012. The sample consisted of 21 sub-Saharan African countries. The methodology is based on first-differenced GMM estimator proposed by Arellano and Bond (Rev Econ Stud 58(2):277-297, 1991) for dynamic panel data, which is robust for taking care of individual fixed effects, heteroskedasticity, and auto-correlation in the presence of endogenous covariates. The results of this study indicate that improving institutional quality, specifically protecting property rights on average had a positive contribution to growth in output per capita in the sampled countries though its effect was small. However, institutional variables such as control for corruption and government effectiveness had a positive effect on growth though they were statistically insignificant. These findings agree with some of the studies conducted so far on the effect of institutions on growth.","[Giorgis, Kokeb G.] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Giorgis, KG (通讯作者)，Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",kokebgg@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,63,78,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_4,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900004,0

In a democratic state of law, activities of national regulatory authorities are coherently coupled with the duty of compliance and implementation by those authorities of fundamental principles relating to freedom of economic activity. These rules oblige the authorities to behaviors which are a sign of respect for the fundamental rights of economic operators. It must be remembered that such rules should include fair competition. The Member States of the European Union are required to guarantee the independence of national regulatory authorities that should be legally separate from any other public or private entity. In turn, the independence contributes to the development of the economy of the country concerned and market efficiency. In the countries of the European Union, the legislators should introduce juridical mechanisms concerning greater transparency in the activities of national regulatory authorities that eliminate the conflict of interest which jeopardizes the independence.

Porter and Mark R. Kramer have been very successful, in terms of impact in the business community, in introducing a new management framework whose programmatic title points to the creation of shared value. However, their impact is due not to the scientific merit of their classic 2011 paper, which is indeed low, as many scholarly commentators have already pointed out. In my paper, I will explain the surprising discrepancy between impact and scientific quality and then draw a lesson from it that we as theoreticians of business ethics may find hard to swallow: modesty in the face of the real conditions of communicative propagation, uptake, and success of conceptual management frames. Alluding to Nelson Goodman, it seems that a good conceptual management frame should provide managers with a new way of symbolic worldmaking; it should help managers with their world disclosure; its bearing is primarily practical. I explain the successful propagation of the CVS notion by reference to a number of factors: (1) a cultural dynamics of fame very similar to the contemporary pop star system, (2) a strategy of reducing complexity by deflecting attention from precursors, (3) entrepreneurial self-promotion, (4) club building mechanisms, (5) tactical devaluation of alternative management frames, (6) the creation of a peer group around a buzzword, (7) the attractiveness of the hip and the en vogue, and finally and most importantly, (8) the strength of a rhetoric that permits us (if we buy this rhetoric) to do two incongruous things at once: understand ourselves as change-agents contributing to nothing less than the glorious reinvention of capitalism, and stay firmly within today's capitalism's comfort zone without essentially changing anything. I go on to point out three massive shortcomings of the CSV framework: Its poor axiology, its inability to quantify polyvalues, and its conventional rationality assumptions. In the final part of my paper, I suggest a discourse ethical alternative concerning the really important issue that Porter and Kramer 2011 take as their starting point, namely the problem of a legitimation crisis of present-day capitalism.","[Kettner, Matthias] Univ Witten Herdecke, Witten, Germany",Witten Herdecke University,"Kettner, M (通讯作者)，Univ Witten Herdecke, Witten, Germany.",Matthias.Kettner@uni-wh.de,,,,,,,30,1,1,2,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-48802-8; 978-3-319-48801-1,ETHICAL ECON,,,2017,52,,,,,,153,168,,10.1007/978-3-319-48802-8_9,0.0,,,16,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI6HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413288200009,0

The results further show that this positive effect is more pronounced for firms with less growth opportunities or a high cost of capital. This would include those firms with low market-to-book ratios, young and small firms, or firms in more competitive industries. Overall, this study argues that customer satisfaction is an important factor affecting the firm's investment policy.

We test this hypothesis by using a sample of 36 European economies in the period 2006-2012 based on dynamic panel regression (system GMM) approach. The strength of auditing and reporting standards (SARS) is used as a measure of financial information quality, while the stock market capitalization relative to GDP measures the stock market development. The estimated results demonstrate positive and significant relationship between financial information quality and capital market development after controlling for the standard macroeconomic and financial specific stock market determinants, suggesting that financial reporting quality is one of the most important determinants of stock market development in European economies. The effects of financial reporting to stock market development are much more significant in the case of non-EU countries. Additionally, the results suggest that growth rate, foreign direct investment, banking sector and corporate governance quality are positively and significantly associated with stock market development, while inflation rate and stock price volatility as measures of macroeconomic and stock price instability have negative influence on stock market activity.","[Lazarov, Darko; Kacarski, Emilija Miteva] Univ Goce Delchev, Fac Econ, Stip, Macedonia; [Lakovic, Tanja] Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Podgorica, Montenegro",Goce Delcev University of Stip; University of Montenegro,"Lazarov, D (通讯作者)，Univ Goce Delchev, Fac Econ, Stip, Macedonia.",darko.lazarov@ugd.edu.mk; tanjavu@ac.me; emilija.miteva@ugd.edu.mk,"lakovic, tanja/HKW-7161-2023; Lazarov, Darko/HNJ-6350-2023; Miteva-Kacarski, Emilija/P-8475-2014","lakovic, tanja/0000-0002-6882-4677; Lazarov, Darko/0009-0000-1796-6627; Miteva-Kacarski, Emilija/0000-0002-8373-7942",,,,,16,0,0,1,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,145,153,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_14,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500014,0

In particular, the systematic scanning of external expert opinions has been shown to be effective for the early detection of emerging threats and opportunities in an organization's environment. However, organizations tend to focus on internal advice more than on advice from external experts. This can be critical for organizations if it leads to an inertia in internal judgment, resulting in blind spots or a failure to see weak signals in the firm's periphery. In this article, we introduce a structured framework for the collection and structuring of internal and external expert judgment. This so-called 360 degrees Stakeholder Feedback tool provides a structured and quantitative approach for the detection and discussion of blind spots and weak signals in scenario planning processes. Thus, it can contribute to a better and more holistic judgment in the strategic process. We demonstrate the methodology based on a case from the German construction industry, in which we aggregate and analyze expert judgments from different stakeholder groups regarding the future of the industry.

This study examines the effectiveness of using a rolling training approach, based on feedback, to improve the accuracy of forecasts elicited from people with such knowledge. In an experiment, forecasters were asked to make multiple judgmental extrapolations for a set of time series from different time origins. For each series in turn, the participants were either unaided or provided with feedback. In the latter case, the true outcomes and performance feedback were provided following the submission of each set of forecasts. The objective was to provide a training scheme that would enable forecasters to understand the underlying pattern of the data better by learning from their forecast errors directly. An analysis of the results indicated that this rolling training approach is an effective method for enhancing the judgmental extrapolations elicited from people with technical knowledge, especially when bias feedback is provided. As such, it could be a valuable element in the design of software systems that are intended to support expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) in forecasting. (C) 2016 The Authors.

I use the New Reading of Marx', which picks up where debates in Economy and Society in the 1970s left off, to dispute this.

However, Ghana faces severe youth unemployment problem and it is estimated that about 300,000 such Ghanaians enters the labor market each year but a mere 2% find jobs with significant numbers of university graduates going to the informal sector and private sector. Green entrepreneurship therefore can be a powerful tool for tackling unemployment and capitalizing on positive economic trends in Ghana. This paper through document content analysis methodology carefully analyzes the characteristics of green entrepreneurship that distinguishes it from regular entrepreneurship and factors that might hinder or stimulate green entrepreneurship in a transition economy like Ghana. This study was undertaken to better understand how to promote green entrepreneurship in Ghana, where there is limited policy and institutional support.

This paper observes self-employed persons as part of the labor force with the aim to determine their similarity with entrepreneurs and employed persons, but also their specifics that make them a distinctive category. Self-employment is analyzed at the level of an individual based on its personal characteristics as well as a macroeconomic phenomenon. Self-employment is influenced by two groups of factors: push (self-employment as an escape from unemployment) and pull (self-employment, which resembles the entrepreneurship). The results indicate that self-employment is more common among older people, men, in agriculture and among people without the necessary qualifications for running a sustainable business. While the EU underlines self-employment as a driver of the economy and as solution for unemployment in the vulnerable groups of the labor market, the paper c). shows that self-employment decreases at the EU level, In most countries, the dynamics of self-employment is influenced by the p. ush factors, especially during the recession, which greatly affects unemployment. It is concluded that selfemployment, in most EU countries, is a result of the discrimination in the labor market and the inability to create new jobs, rather than being a voluntary decision based on a perceived business opportunity.

To do this, through the literature review the framework of balanced scorecard was utilized to structure agility factors in the supply chain of the steel industry. Then the experts were interviewed to reconcile on the factors identified. Utilizing 24 questionnaires by the use of Interpretive Structural Modeling framework, the relationship and sequence of factors were obtained from experts. The final model developed in the paper presents the agility factors for the steel industry supply chain. Also, these factors are grouped within the four perspectives of the BSC to better enhance the results and pursue action. The ISM method identifies the priority of each factor which provides a better understanding of the underlying relationship of the factors for the managers to implement the strategies more reliably.

Mass tourism as a dominant form on the tourism market is being increasingly challenged by the specific forms of tourism which are based on the platform of meeting the tourist's desires, adventures and experiences. Rural tourism, especially agritourism as its internationally fastest -growing form is gaining more and more significance in the academic, as well as the tourist circles. However, with the focus solely on the Republic of Croatia, agritourism has not gained the place nor the significance that it deserves, i.e. it is not organized as it is in the leading countries of the sector of agritourism. In an academic sense, there is a frugal base of the theoretical and empirical knowledge. On the theoretical level, this paper therefore servers to terminologically determine the key terms that will certainly contribute to a clearer and more accurate understanding of this extremely confusing terminology. On the empirical level, research will be conducted on a convenient sample in order to determine the general characteristics of the business, the comprehension of the current situation on the Croatian market, as well as the elements of the attractiveness of the destination of agritourism and its economy. The research will cover the area of five counties in Slavonia and the respondents will be the owners of agrotourism.

Many papers analyze these characteristics separately. However, according to the authors of this article, it is necessary to evaluate a wide context of workplace mobbing and single cases of harassment to determine the factors affecting the occurrence of the phenomenon. The multi-complex approach to the influencing conditions is necessary for corporate managers, making preventive and intervention decisions. The research was carried out using the validated questionnaire The occurrence of mobbing and single cases of harassment in relations between employees in the private and public sector organizations of Lithuania. 1,231 respondents, who experienced violence in mutual relations, were surveyed. 867 employees distinguished from the respondents experienced mobbing, and 364 employees experienced single cases of harassment. The results of this research explain the spread of mobbing and single cases of harassment in organizations of different sizes and types, its dynamism. They also allow showing that the unmanaged process has a tendency to intensify over time. Two largest risk zones of mobbing and single cases of harassment related to the age and length of service have been highlighted: the first and largest one is a start of professional career; the second is the pre-retirement age. Marital status doesn't have any statistically significant influence on becoming a victim of mobbing and single cases of harassment, although a slightly higher number of victims, who are divorced or haven't created a family, were found. The relationship between the size of the organization and the occurrence of mobbing and single cases of harassment was found. The position of the victim of harassment and mobbing in the organization is conditioned by systemic causes related to internal conditions determined by the organizational policy. The article presents only a part of the research results. This part of the research allows the formation of socio-demographic view of the victim of mobbing and single cases of harassment in the organization, distinguishing the influencing factors under individual characteristics. The research was conducted only in one country, so the data should be tested by the cases of other countries.","[Vveinhardt, Jolita] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Streimikiene, Dalia] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vilnius University,"Vveinhardt, J (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Kaunas, Lithuania.",jolita.vveinhardt@gmail.com; dalia.streimikiene@lsu.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912; Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402",,,,,56,2,2,0,26,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Using a sample, ranging from 2006 through 2015, this paper investigates the relationships above. Consistent with the related hypothesis, empirical results show that the increase of TMT pay gap can decrease the probability of promotion incentive, and decrease the pay equity within top management team.

A dynamic conditional multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC-MVGARCH) approach was used to calculate dynamic correlation coefficient in order to construct the volatility networks. The methods of minimum spanning tree (MST) and low pass filter were for the first time applied to analyze the variable periodicity of the comovement. The original contribution of this paper is that contrary to previous works, financial events such as Quantitative Easing (QE) and Bailouts are accounted for rather than only crisis factors such as the 2008 financial crisis and the European Debt crisis. The main findings of the paper are as follows: (1) Financial crisis promotes and strengthens global stock markets linkage in the short run; (2) Linkage cycles post crisis are significantly short, due to the effect of monetary policy spillover effects caused by QE from developed to developing countries; and (3) European stock markets are the information transmission hub for global stock market.

In order to solve this problem, this paper designed and implemented an online learning emotion detection system based on facial expression recognition technology. This system acquires students' online learning images through the webcam, analyses the focus of students' learning and their interest in teaching content through the three-dimensional learning emotion model we have established.

Concomitant with the increase in total output, private agri-food industry came to control 90 per cent of total production by 2010. Using exploratory spatial analysis and spatial regression methods, we are able to have a more detailed and spatially explicit regional study of a commodity system across Turkey. We argue that maize production in Turkey developed in the 2000s along the tenets of a corporate food regime according to demands by agri-food firms. However, small-scale farmers are not fully excluded from corporate relations of production, and low-yield traditional maize farming persists in some provinces as an important field crop for household consumption.","[Borlu, Yetkin] Univ Richmond, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 302 Weinstein Hall, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Matthews, Stephen A.] Penn State Univ, Dept Sociol & Criminol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",University of Richmond; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Borlu, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Richmond, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 302 Weinstein Hall, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",yborlu@richmond.edu,"Matthews, Stephen/AAO-6173-2020; Matthews, Stephen/GPS-9884-2022","Matthews, Stephen/0000-0002-1645-4854; Matthews, Stephen/0000-0002-1645-4854",,,,,56,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Retailer competition should have a stronger impact on the more substitutable national brands than the more differentiated store brands. However, the literature has not studied the impacts empirically. In this paper, I quantify the different impacts of retailer competition on national brands and store brands using the scanner data of a U.S. chain retailer. I estimate a structural demand and supply model that incorporates the differentiation effect and retailer competition. The results show that national brand consumers are more likely to switch stores than store brands consumers. By analyzing two counterfactual cases, I find that 1) if the retailer did not sell store brands, its profit would decrease, and the loss would be greater in markets with more competitors; and 2) if the retailer competition had increased, then the national brands' retail prices would decrease more than the store brands' prices.","[Luo, Rong] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Luo, R (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",rluo@uga.edu,,,,,,,36,2,2,2,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

In this paper, I show how such activities influence policymaking and why firms may prefer it to more traditional influence activities such as campaign contributions. What distinguishes EIA is that a firm's strategy choices affects the state of a local economy and, in turn, the evaluations that voters make of the performance of an officeholder.

Le Guin's The Dispossessed feels unfinished, its perspective blurred. But through its flawed aperture one nevertheless sees why: its subject is all that is left unsaid and undone after a revolution. In this tale of two worlds, anarchist Anarres and statist Urras are implacably opposed. Yet each is continuous with the other. For its flaws, The Dispossessed, as a sociological novel, brilliantly analyzes where emancipatory politics can go wrong, using insights that were new even to social scientists in the early 1970s: the notion that power need not be formally titled or openly hierarchical in order to be effective and oppressive. In short, this is a novel about the dangers of informal power, and how revolutionary dogma can rhetorically mask it. But it stands out among Cold War era fiction for not portraying a flawed leftist society as a dystopia. Instead, Le Guin's vision of Anarres is of a society that has become complacent, that has forgotten the permanence of revolution, where bad actors take advantage of political dogma and non-hierarchical stations to exercise power in grotesque ways. Power never goes away, and Le Guin's genius in The Dispossessed lies in showing us the myriad ways it endures.","[Cross, Katherine] Univ Washington, Sch Informat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Cross, K (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Informat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kcross1@uw.edu,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

J,"Heymans, A; Santana, L",,,,"Heymans, Andre; Santana, Leonard",,,How efficient is the Johannesburg Stock Exchange really?,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MARKET-EFFICIENCY; ADAPTIVE MARKETS; RANDOM-WALK; PERFORMANCE; HYPOTHESIS; COVERAGE; DECISION; RETURNS; PRICES; IMPACT,"Background: There are various studies that confirm the efficiency of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), implying that there are no opportunities for active portfolio managers to earn excess returns over the long run. Aim: The aim of the research is to prove that the sub-indices on the JSE go through cycles of efficiency and inefficiency even though the JSE as a whole might be considered informationally efficient. Setting: Although the JSE as a whole can be considered to be weak-form efficient, portfolio managers are not bound to investing in large liquid stocks alone. Many aggressive funds allow managers to also allocate a portion of their portfolio to smaller stocks. This has implications when considering the efficiency of the stocks being selected. Methods: Given the impact efficiency has on portfolio selection, we test for the adaptive market hypothesis using a representative sample of stock indices by means of the automatic variance ratio test, the Chow-Denning joint variance ratio and the joint sign test on the JSE. Results: Our results confirm that some of the smaller, and in some instances younger, indices are not always as efficient as the all share index, thus allowing portfolio managers with an active management approach some opportunities to profit from informational inefficiencies in the market. Conclusion: The practice of active management by portfolio managers in the South African market seems to defy logic if one considers the fact that the JSE as a whole is at the very least weak-form efficient. By proving that some of the sub-indices that make up the all share index are inefficient most of the time, this article shows that the phenomenon of active portfolio managers is less of a surprise.","[Heymans, Andre] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Santana, Leonard] North West Univ, Sch Math & Stat Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa,"Heymans, A (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",andre.heymans@nwu.ac.za,"Santana, Leonard/AHB-0478-2022; Heymans, André/W-7520-2019","Santana, Leonard/0000-0001-9395-9808; Heymans, André/0000-0003-3879-6887",,,,,54,1,4,1,1,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In this regard, one of the strategies devised by Iran's Railway Company is to increase the robustness of the system against incidents. The paper describes the state of the network and discusses that human errors are the main cause imposing significant costs. This is followed by the development of a method for the network vulnerability analysis of sparse interurban rail networks considering transportation of various goods as well as passengers. The paper examines the effects of an incident where consequent effects are substantial and propagate functionally throughout the network, to take the network closure duration into account, and to tie together both additional costs of transporting passengers/goods (due to prolongation of routes) and unsatisfied demand. The purpose is to find the most important links of the network, where failure results in serious consequences. Passenger unsatisfied demand, freight unsatisfied demand, and monetary costs are considered as the consequences of network disruptions, and a multi-objective optimization programming approach is designed to generate solutions based on these criteria.","[Khademi, Navid; Fani, Amirhossein] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Babaei, Mohsen] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Hamadan, Iran; [Schmocker, Jan-Dirk] Kyoto Univ, Dept Urban Management, Kyoto, Japan",University of Tehran; Bu Ali Sina University; Kyoto University,"Khademi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran.",navid.khademi@ut.ac.ir; m.babaei@basu.ac.ir; schmoecker@trans.kuciv.kyoto-u.ac.jp; amircall@yahoo.com,"Schmocker, Jan-Dirk/S-4477-2019; Khademi, Navid/D-9945-2018","Schmocker, Jan-Dirk/0000-0003-2219-9447; Khademi, Navid/0000-0003-2565-8194; Babaei, Mohsen/0000-0001-6635-984X",,,,,69,6,8,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

A customer satisfaction survey was conducted from January to March 2013 in Hong Kong, with the respondents invited to give specific satisfaction ratings for ten service aspects individually and a global satisfaction rating for the overall taxi service quality, as well as to rank the important aspects that influence the given global rating. The ten service aspects related to the amount of time consumed when taking taxis, services and facilities provided for finding taxis, internal environments of taxis, and personal services provided by taxi drivers. An enhanced linear regression model was developed to identify the priority areas for improvement of urban taxi service quality. Based on the numerical score of overall taxi service quality, a six-level LOS standard, similar to academic grading, is introduced accordingly to improve the general public's understanding of the current service level. This paper discusses the potential policy implications to enhance the taxi service quality in Hong Kong, which can be applied to other metropolitan cities that provide similar urban taxi services.","[Wong, R.

One major barrier to greater consumer acceptance of PEVs is the lack of home parking spaces for charging outlets. This study developed a methodology to estimate the residential parking ratios (parking spaces vs household numbers) and project the residential community-weighted parking availabilities (home parking availabilities) in China, by area and by province, through data mining from several major real estate trading network platforms. The results show that the home parking availabilities from 2015 to 2050 vary by geographic areas and building life expectancy. A method was developed to quantify the shadow values of home parking impacting on PEV ownership costs and combined with Monte Carlo simulation to address estimation uncertainty. Depending on the PEV type and all electric range, the value of home parking space to a PEV owner, measured by the reduced vehicle ownership cost, ranges from $2399 USD to $10,802 USD. The total incremental shadow value, relative to the 2015 situation, of the home parking availability for PEV owners increases over time due to both improvement in home parking availability and increase in the PEV population, and is estimated to reach over $2.51 billion USD by 2025 (U.S. dollars in 2015 level).","[Ou, Shiqi; Lin, Zhenhong] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Natl Transportat Res Ctr, Knoxville, TN 37932 USA; [He, Xin; Przesmitzki, Steven] Aramco Serv Co, Aramco Res Ctr Detroit, Novi, MI 48377 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Aramco Services Company (ASC),"Lin, ZH (通讯作者)，Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Natl Transportat Res Ctr, Knoxville, TN 37932 USA.",ous1@ornl.gov; linz@ornl.gov; xin.he@aramcoservices.com; steven.przesmitzki@aramcoservices.com,"Lin, Zhenhong/ISA-9347-2023; Ou, Shawn/AAI-4007-2021; Lin, Zhenhong/AAJ-9468-2021; He, Xin/I-4240-2012; Ou, Shawn/GXM-9183-2022","Lin, Zhenhong/0000-0002-4664-8297; Lin, Zhenhong/0000-0002-4664-8297; He, Xin/0000-0003-2492-4454",Aramco Services Company,Aramco Services Company,"The authors would like to thank the Aramco Services Company for their generous financial support for this study, and the China Automotive Technology and Research Center for their data support.

A tri-modal transportation network equilibrium model is developed to analyze the effects of EBLs under three different policies: (i) no EBLs (called Policy 1); (ii) EBLs can only be used by bus (called Policy 2); and (iii) EBLs can be used by both bus and carpooling modes (called Policy 3). By taking into account both Ens setting scheme and bus frequencies, a combinatorial optimization model is proposed to test the performance of the tri-modal transportation system. In a traffic corridor case with single O-D pair, numerical results show that travel demand levels will remarkably influence the total system costs under different policies. The effects of average carpooling occupancy and mode choice parameters on travelers' choice behavior are analyzed. Finally, a tri-modal network with nineteen links is used to illustrate that the system could be more efficient when different EBLs policies are adopted on different links.","[Yao, Jia; Cheng, Zhanhong; An, Shi; Wang, Jian] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Transportat Sci & Engn, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Yao, Jia; Shi, Feng] Cent S Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Changsha 410075, Hunan, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Central South University,"Yao, J (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Transportat Sci & Engn, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",yaojia@hit.edu.cn,"YAO, JIA/A-9888-2013; Shi, Feng/G-3247-2012; Cheng, Zhanhong/HJH-2959-2023","YAO, JIA/0000-0002-4978-3611; Cheng, Zhanhong/0000-0003-4770-4702","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501053, 71390522]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M570297]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HIT.NSRIF.201661]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71501053, 71390522), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2015M570297) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (HIT.NSRIF.201661).",,44,12,12,6,59,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

By utilizing fleets of private cars and app technology, these services call into question the definitions of private and commercial transport and challenge the existing transport framework in multiple ways. By operating between commercial and private services, they are partly outside the control of governments and, to some extent, contravene current regulations. In this paper, we combine the literature on regulation and economic properties of the unscheduled passenger transport markets with scenario analyses for examining how ride-sourcing and automated vehicles affect these markets. Our main findings are that the underlying economic mechanisms faced in markets dominated by ride-sourcing and automated vehicles have similarities with traditional markets. Hence, regardless of how the services are offered, some need for regulation will remain. However, as the market segments are different and a shift in their relative importance is likely, the possible and suitable forms of regulation will change.","[Aarhaug, Jorgen; Olsen, Silvia] Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Aarhaug, J (通讯作者)，Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway.",jaa@toi.no; sjo@toi.no,,"Aarhaug, Jorgen/0000-0003-1052-0010","Strategic Research Programme (SIS) Competition in Passenger Transport: Governance, Regulation and Efficiency; SHIFT-Sustainable Horizons in Future Transport, a flagship Nordic Energy Research project; CLIMAMOB-Climate change and everyday mobility: social impacts, adaptation and mitigation strategies - Norwegian Research Council through the Climate Research Program KLIMAFORSK [244137]; DIGMOB-Digitalization and mobility: Smart and sustainable transport in urban agglomerations - Norwegian Research Council [283331]","Strategic Research Programme (SIS) Competition in Passenger Transport: Governance, Regulation and Efficiency; SHIFT-Sustainable Horizons in Future Transport, a flagship Nordic Energy Research project; CLIMAMOB-Climate change and everyday mobility: social impacts, adaptation and mitigation strategies - Norwegian Research Council through the Climate Research Program KLIMAFORSK; DIGMOB-Digitalization and mobility: Smart and sustainable transport in urban agglomerations - Norwegian Research Council","The research leading to the publication of this paper was financed in part by the Strategic Research Programme (SIS) Competition in Passenger Transport: Governance, Regulation and Efficiency and the following projects: SHIFT-Sustainable Horizons in Future Transport, a flagship Nordic Energy Research project supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers (www.nordicenergy.org/flagship/project-shift/); CLIMAMOB-Climate change and everyday mobility: social impacts, adaptation and mitigation strategies, funded by the Norwegian Research Council through the Climate Research Program KLIMAFORSK (project no. 244137); and DIGMOB-Digitalization and mobility: Smart and sustainable transport in urban agglomerations, funded by the Norwegian Research Council (project no. 283331).",,37,23,24,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

This paper focuses on how residents of super-diverse neighbourhoods identify social groups. Drawing on the concept of symbolic boundary making, it provides insights into how residents draw, enact and experience boundaries. Using the results of in-depth interviews with residents in Antwerp and Rotterdam, we show that super-diversity complexifies but does not counteract group formation. Residents draw multiple, interrelated symbolic boundaries along ethnic, class and religious lines and lines based on length of residence, which are sometimes used interchangeably. We also show that group boundaries are dynamic and constantly (re-)created. Finally, we show that discursive boundaries do not necessarily lead to less social contact across these boundaries, thus illustrating that symbolic boundaries do not always result in segregated social patterns.","[Albeda, Ympkje; Oosterlynck, Stijn; Verschraegen, Gert] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci City, Sint Jacobstr 2-4, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Tersteeg, Anouk] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Antwerp; Utrecht University,"Albeda, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci City, Sint Jacobstr 2-4, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",ympkje.albeda@uantwerpen.be; a.k.tersteeg@uu.nl; stijn.oosterlynck@uantwerpen.be; gert.verschraegen@uantwerpen.be,"Verschraegen, Gert/Z-3781-2019","Verschraegen, Gert/0000-0002-8638-1566","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [319970 - DIVERCITIES]","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration(European Union (EU))","This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant Agreement No 319970 - DIVERCITIES.

Individual wants as inherently economic practice,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGRAPHIE,,,German,Article,,,,,,consumer sovereignty; desire; food justice; globalization,NATURALNESS; GEOGRAPHIES; CONSUMERS,"Managing food insecurity through individual consumption strategies has become a relevant issue in recent years. One fundamental premise here is the sovereignty of the consumer, who is thought of as being able to steer the production and distribution of commodities in a significant way. But the assumption of the rational shopper made here misses a key feature about consumption: most desires and decisions of the consumer are tacit and non-reflective. The following paper deals with the concept of consumer sovereignty and focuses the role of individual wants. It argues, that the genesis of desires is inherently economic and that for this reason consumer-driven interventions often fail. The paper concludes by discussing the possibility of taking global responsibility on a local scale.","[Idies, Yusif] WWU Munster, Inst Geog, Heisenbergstr 2, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Idies, Y (通讯作者)，WWU Munster, Inst Geog, Heisenbergstr 2, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",idies@uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,70,2,2,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Game theory and research in behavioural economics provide ample evidence that cooperation can efficiently solve social dilemmas similar to traffic congestion in dynamic settings. Traffic theory, asserts User Equilibrium, is both a stable and equitable, albeit inefficient, network state, which is a behavioural outcome of the selfish uncoordinated decision of drivers. In contrast, the System Optimum is an efficient network state that minimizes the total travel costs but is hard to maintain due to the inherent cost inequalities drivers will incur. In this paper, we describe how the principles of game-theory in a simple 2-player game allow the emergence of a stable system optimum through cooperation. We then investigate what happens in n-player games by applying an agent-based route-choice model. The model shows how reinforced learning and different behavioural specifications regarding agents' cognition - selfish or cooperative - brings a simple road network from User Equilibrium towards the system optimum while preserving sufficient equity amongst drivers. The results suggest that a sufficient number of route alternations between drivers and a certain degree of altruism allow for a self-organizing formation of a fairness equilibrium that can maintain the network in the system optimum. The implications of future congestion management strategies that can be implemented with information and communication technologies are discussed.","[Levy, Nadav; Klein, Ido; Ben-Elia, Eran] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Geog & Environm Dev, GAMES Lab, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Ben-Elia, E (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Geog & Environm Dev, GAMES Lab, Beer Sheva, Israel.",ndvlevy@gmail.com; idokl@post.bgu.ac.il; benelia@bgu.ac.il,"Ben-Elia, Eran/R-8312-2019","Ben-Elia, Eran/0000-0002-4169-7129",Israel Science Foundation [701/2014],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"Funding for this research was provided by the Israel Science Foundation Grant No. 701/2014.

A widespread regulation limits the housing burden (defined as the share of income spent on housing), typically at 33% or so. Using the monocentric model, I show that capping the housing burden drives low-income households away from the city center toward suburban areas, where they face high transport costs. This unintended eviction effect lowers the prudential efficiency of this measure. Capping the housing plus transport burden precludes this eviction mechanism and better protects household solvency, including from strong variations in transport costs such as during fuel price spikes. Additionally, by limiting the bidding capacity of households, both prudential measures lead to a decrease in housing prices. This tends to improve the welfare of households, firstly of high-income ones (being less affected by the constraints). The effect is stronger when capping the housing burden, so that households, again firstly high income ones, are typically better off (in terms of welfare) than when one caps the housing plus transport burden, however. Considering the primary objective of prudential measures - protecting household solvency, firstly of low-income households - these findings call for the inclusion of transport costs within prudential ratios, as well as indicators of housing affordability. This would incidentally raise public awareness with regard to the high costs of private cars, which are often underestimated. A short application to the Paris region corroborates that a policy change from housing only toward comprehensive housing plus transport prudential ratios might significantly improve the situation of low-income households.","[Coulombel, Nicolas] Univ Paris Est, Lab Ville Mobilite Transport, Batiment Bienvenue,6 & 8 Ave Blaise Pascal, F-77455 Marne La Vallee 2, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Coulombel, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, Lab Ville Mobilite Transport, Batiment Bienvenue,6 & 8 Ave Blaise Pascal, F-77455 Marne La Vallee 2, France.",nicolas.coulombel@enpc.fr,"Coulombel, Nicolas/AAM-1073-2020","Coulombel, Nicolas/0000-0003-1096-2679","Fondation pour les Sciences Sociales, under the aegis of the Fondation de France; EPSRC [EP/K011723/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Fondation pour les Sciences Sociales, under the aegis of the Fondation de France; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This research was funded by the Fondation pour les Sciences Sociales, under the aegis of the Fondation de France.

In this setting, a diaspora emanating from one of the two groups can get actively involved in conflict by transferring financial resources to its origin country. We find that the diaspora influences the war outcome and, above a certain size, contributes to the escalation of violence. Given the characteristics of the conflict equilibrium, the two groups of residents prefer to negotiate a peaceful settlement if there exists a sharing rule that makes both of them better off than war. We then identify the characteristics of the economy such that the diaspora acts as a peace-wrecking force or triggers a transition towards peace. Finally, we develop two extensions of the model, respectively, accounting for endogenous migration and the possibility of migration from both groups.

It argues that travel behaviour and the choice of residence may be considered two intertwined decision frameworks made by individuals/households that in turn can be understood within the broader context of mobility biographies. The interrelations between mobility biographies and transport costs are on multiple levels. Firstly, they refer to different types of cost, including user costs, costs for transport provision and external costs. Secondly, mobility biographies and, specifically, residential self-selection may be affected by transport (user) costs, while at the same time they work as input factors for transport costs on all cost levels. The paper outlines these thoughts and discusses the consequences for spatial planning and transport planning. It suggests a strong planning system in which guidelines for travel and residential choice are set by public planning organisations rather than by the market. This is likely to help spare future households increasing transport costs, and costs for transport provision and external costs will be reduced as well. Further, it argues for a shift away from the happiness debate and towards the notion of dignity in transport studies.","[Scheiner, Joachim] Tech Univ Dortmund, Fac Spatial Planning, Dept Transport Planning, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Scheiner, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dortmund, Fac Spatial Planning, Dept Transport Planning, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",joachim.scheiner@tu-dortmund.de,,"Scheiner, Joachim/0000-0002-6157-437X",German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the project 'Key Events - Travel Behaviour Changes over the Life Course: The Role of Biographical and Accessibility-Related Key Events',German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the project 'Key Events - Travel Behaviour Changes over the Life Course: The Role of Biographical and Accessibility-Related Key Events',"This research was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the project 'Key Events - Travel Behaviour Changes over the Life Course: The Role of Biographical and Accessibility-Related Key Events', 2015-2018).

Using a difference-in-difference framework and 282 municipal districts panel data over years 1998-2009, we test the pension-education theoretical link change.

Country-by-country reporting will be applicable to all MNEs with a group revenue in excess of R10 billion. Aim: The aim of the study was twofold: to identify ambiguities that might influence the filing obligation and subsequent scope of CbC reporting in South Africa and to quantitatively measure the potential impact of any identified ambiguities. Setting: This study used data from Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed companies. Methods: The study commences with a review of the relevant regulations and other applicable literature and continues with a quantitative analysis exploring alternative interpretations deduced from this review. Results: The review identified conflicting interpretations of how companies can be categorised as an MNE Group or not, as well as in measuring the revenue threshold. An analysis of the group structures and annual reports of a selected sample of 78 companies showed that the scope of CbC reporting will depend on the definitions applied to an MNE Group and revenue. Conclusion: Further guidance is needed to determine whether non-controlling entities must be considered as Constituent Entities, as well as how to measure revenue (i.e. whether only the International Financial Reporting Standards [IFRS] 15 revenue line item should be used or whether other income should also be included).","[Thiart, Cara; Nel, George F.] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Thiart, C (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",cthiart@sun.ac.za,,"Nel, George/0000-0001-5503-9883; Thiart, Cara/0000-0002-5559-6150",,,,,12,0,0,1,4,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It is therefore important for companies to ensure that they implement remuneration policies which will result in motivated employees who will execute decisions and actions which are in the best interest of the shareholders. However, it is widely acknowledged that the relationship between company performance and executive remuneration is weak. This implies that executives are still rewarded excessive remuneration regardless of the performance of their companies. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between the performance-based remuneration of executive directors and the financial performance of South African companies. Setting: The study was conducted in South Africa, specifically on companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Methods: The study design was quantitative and made use of a Pearson correlation and generalised least squares regression with bootstrapping at a 95% confidence interval to analyse the relationship between executive director remuneration and the financial performance of 42 companies in the consumer goods and services industry of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) from 2006 to 2015. Results: The study established that the remuneration policies in place for South African executive directors within the consumer goods and services industry seem to be affected by the share price of the company. Conclusion: In the South African environment, executive director remuneration is thus not directly related to profitability or company size, as was the case in some earlier studies. The link between executive director remuneration and share performance may be an indication that remuneration policies are based on the share price and are thus directly connected to the principle of shareholder wealth maximisation.","[Kirsten, Elize; du Toit, Elda] Univ Pretoria, Dept Financial Management, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"du Toit, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Financial Management, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.",elda.dutoit@up.ac.za,"du Toit, Elda/D-5304-2013","du Toit, Elda/0000-0001-8386-7969; Kirsten, Elize/0000-0002-5473-1381",,,,,87,13,17,2,16,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

However, no such study has focused on the repatriation of South African expatriates. Aim: The primary aim of this study was to determine if there is a correlation between the repatriation practices of South African multinational enterprises and their repatriation turnover rates. The secondary aim of the study was to determine why repatriated employees leave the employment of South African multinational enterprises. Method: This quantitative study surveyed 41 expatriate managers of South African multinational enterprises, with the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's correlation coefficient being used to test for correlations between the repatriation practices of South African multinational enterprises and their repatriation turnover rates. Results: The results revealed positive correlations between appointing a mentor to an expatriate to assist with the repatriation process, conducting an orientation programme prior to repatriation and supporting the expatriate with various initiatives during repatriation and lower repatriation turnover rates. Meanwhile a negative correlation was found between when a multinational enterprise starts with an orientation programme prior to repatriation and repatriation turnover rates. Conclusion: These findings provide valuable insights for South African multinational enterprises into practices they can employ to reduce their repatriation turnover rates.","[Naude, Christiaan J.; Vogel, A.

Following a thorough review of the available international literature, relevant variables are individualised using focus groups of taxi users, and a satisfaction survey is designed. The resulting data are used to estimate two types of ordered probit models, which consider systematic and random variations in taste: on the one hand, a model that provides attributes and their influence on the perceived quality of taxi service when no previous information about the system is available and, on the other hand, a model that considers their changed perception after being informed about the attributes that could affect the system's perceived quality. The results mention the attributes that the users normally value and those that they would value after being asked to reflect on them. It is worth noting that waiting time is the most important factor for frequent users, and journey time is highly valued by almost all users, along with safety, accessibility and comfort. Surprisingly, the fare is not usually as important as at the first thought. The results of this type of study are valuable because they allow us to understand and improve the system depending on user preferences, thereby improving the quality of services and increasing the demand.","[Alonso, Borja; Barreda, Rosa; dell'Olio, Luigi; Ibeas, Angel] Univ Cantabria, GIST, Av Castros 44, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"dell'Olio, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, GIST, Av Castros 44, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",delloliol@unican.es,"Barreda, Mª Rosa/A-2305-2015; Alonso, Borja/G-7438-2012; Ibeas, Angel/F-4885-2012; dell'Olio, Luigi/A-5148-2008","Alonso, Borja/0000-0003-2475-3325; dell'Olio, Luigi/0000-0003-0919-7578","MINECO (FEDER funds) [TRA2015-69903-R, TRA2013-48116-R]",MINECO (FEDER funds)(Spanish Government),"This study was supported by research funding from MINECO through the projects TRA2015-69903-R (co-financed with FEDER funds) and TRA2013-48116-R.

The payments system variables capture a broad range of spending activity and are available on a very timely basis, making them suitable current indicators. We generate nowcasts of GDP and retail sales growth for a given month on seven different dates, over a period of two and a half months preceding the first official releases, which is the period over which nowcasts would be of interest. We find statistically significant evidence that payments system data can reduce the nowcast error for both GDP and retail sales growth. Both debit transaction and cheque clearance data are of value in reducing nowcast losses for GDP growth, although the latter are of little or no value when debit data are also included. For retail sales, cheque data appear to produce no further nowcast loss reductions, regardless of whether or not debit transactions are included in the nowcasting model.

However, the air transport sector of the two countries exhibits substantial differences 30 years after deregulation. Private and low-cost airlines have become dominant players in the Indian airline market while the state-owned airlines still enjoy a dominant status in the Chinese market. The econometric analysis of this research suggests that the presence of a low-cost carrier (LCC) on a route has the effect of reducing the airfare and stimulating the demand for air travel in India, no matter the LCC presence is measured by market shares or dummies. Chinese LCCs have similar competitive effects only when the LCC entry is measured by dummy variables. Airport concentration in India could lead to cost savings and thus lower airfares, but this did not occur in China due largely to the lack of a culture of antitrust compliance. In both countries, airport concentration is positively associated with traffic demand. In India this may imply an increase in consumer welfare as airport concentration increases while in China this could mean that consumers would not be able to explore their welfare benefits to the full potential since concentration is positively associated with airfares. We also find that the absolute value of the price elasticity of the Indian market is much larger than that in the Chinese market, probably due to the high LCC penetration rates in India.","[Wang, Kun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Anming] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Zhang, Anming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Acad Financial Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yahua] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Commerce, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia",University of International Business & Economics; University of British Columbia; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Southern Queensland,"Zhang, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Commerce, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia.",yahua.zhang@usq.edu.au,"sihite, janfry/B-2951-2015; Wang, Kun/AAE-4337-2019; WANG, KUN/HDN-4021-2022","WANG, KUN/0000-0002-2137-9457; Zhang, Yahua/0000-0003-1522-3402; Zhang, Anming/0000-0002-9457-8414",Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Li and Fung Institute for Supply Chain Management and Logistics of Chinese University of Hong Kong,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Li and Fung Institute for Supply Chain Management and Logistics of Chinese University of Hong Kong,We thank two anonymous referees for their very helpful comments.

The results on the 30 insurers studied from 2005 to 2014 indicate that insurers in Ghana operate with about 53.8% average cost inefficiency. This stands to confirm the long existed low performance perception of Ghanaians about the industry.

It also examines whether any negative effect persists up to affecting the survival rate of children of higher birth order born after the mother has married. Using data from Demographic and Health Survey, we find that the mortality rate is higher for first-born boys, but not for first-born daughters, whose mother was single at the time of their birth, and lower for second-born children whose sister, but not brother, was born out of wedlock. The latter effect is actually driven by children from older cohorts of women. Therefore, strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of the stigma associated with a premarital birth seem to exist but vary with the gender of the child born premarital in Senegal. In addition, persisting negative effects appear to have decreased over time. Potential channels through which boys born from a single mother are at a higher risk of death in the country are discussed. Overall, our findings indicate that social programs targeting single mothers, especially when they gave birth to a boy, would help avoiding dramatic events as the death of a child.","[Guilbert, Nathalie] Agence Francaise Dev, Paris, France; [Guilbert, Nathalie] PSL Univ Paris Dauphine, LEDa, IRD, UMR DIAL, Paris, France; [Marazyan, Karine] Univ Paris 01, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Marazyan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, IEDES, IRD UMR Dev & Soc 201, Paris, France.",karine.marazyan@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,38,0,1,1,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

We discuss college sports broadcasting history, including the advent of cable television and new media technologies, complementary industries such as sponsorships and apparel, and public goods and winner-take-all market considerations as they relate to broadcasting. We examine the impact of these changes on the National Collegiate Athletic Association and its members as they adjust to, and compete for this new money that is on the table.

More specifically, we consider economic preferences (patience and attitudes towards risk), personality traits from psychology (Big Five and locus of control), and a self-control scale from criminology. Using survey data, we show that the various concepts complement each other in predicting self-reported norm enforcement behavior. The most significant predictors stem from all three disciplines: stronger risk aversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism as well as higher levels of self-control increase an individual's willingness to enforce norms. Taking a broader perspective, our results illustrate that integrating concepts from different disciplines may enhance our understanding of heterogeneity in individual behavior.","[Friehe, Tim] Univ Marburg, Publ Econ Grp, Plan 2, D-35037 Marburg, Germany; [Friehe, Tim] CESifo, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Friehe, Tim] EconomiX, Paris, France; [Schildberg-Hoerisch, Hannah] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Schildberg-Hoerisch, Hannah] IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; Ifo Institut; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Friehe, T (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Publ Econ Grp, Plan 2, D-35037 Marburg, Germany.;Friehe, T (通讯作者)，CESifo, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.;Friehe, T (通讯作者)，EconomiX, Paris, France.",tim.friehe@uni-marburg.de; schildberg-hoerisch@dice.hhu.de,"Friehe, Tim/ABF-4676-2020","Friehe, Tim/0000-0002-9390-3537",[SFB-TR 15],,"Financial support from SFB-TR 15 that did not influence study design, data analysis or interpretation.

This question is usually answered by conceptualizing the court's decision as the final choice of policy. But that is misleading because the court's decision merely forms the baseline from which Congress, lobbied by interest groups, enacts the final policy. I present a formal model that captures this dynamic context. The model shows that the court's optimal decision is to rule for the resource-constrained party, which is often the newcomer, even when the opposite ruling would be preferable if the court were the final policy maker. The model's logic is illustrated by case studies of Supreme Court decisions on copyright law.","[Shahshahani, Sepehr] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Shahshahani, S (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,36,4,4,3,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The study combined knowledge-based view theory (KBV), competitive value framework to develop a new original theoretical framework for investigation of factors that affect innovation. Data was gathered from a survey of 279 companies supplying automobile parts to Iran Khodro Company, an Iranian leading automobile manufacturer. Study discovered that organizational culture and knowledge management influenced organizational innovation. Besides that, organizational learning played a significant role as a mediator in that relationship. However, knowledge management was not considered as a mediator in the relationship between organizational culture and organizational innovation. As a practical contribution, the findings of the study serve as a guideline for policy makers and managers in the formulation of policies and strategies for sustainable innovation. Knowing the effectiveness of the innovation can help the government to make decisions about the continuation of this policy. Moreover, study contributes to firm management in formulation of policies and strategies for sustainability in innovation context.

They now have to face new dilemmas and tensions, which force them into showing more discernment, responsiveness as well as creativity to address the growing complexity of local issues. They must retain the territorial marketing that will not only allow their territory to develop, but first of all to survive. As a result, territorial marketing today takes a broader, more in-depth, more strategic and more versatile approach, drawing on sources as diverse as anthropology, sociology, culture, etc. Identity marketing is part of the new practices of territorial marketing and draws from the reservoir of the territory's intrinsic strengths and weaknesses to develop its territorial marketing approach. This paper has two main objectives; the first one is to explore and present the major new marketing practices, the result of observations at the level of several territories - Some of these practices have already been formalized and have proven their worth in terms of outcomes; others have reached in the improvement phase or are going through the experimental stage.

Strategic alliances reduce the opportunities for differentiation even further because of the vessel-sharing between container lines. The container shipping, therefore, is becoming a commodity-like industry. The literature on commodity markets and other business-to-business markets suggests firms can differentiate themselves through the service attributes other than core offering. With this perspective, this study aims to explore effective service differentiators of container lines against their strategic alliance partners. We conduct a survey research with container lines and freight forwarders in Turkey and perform exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. We create an inter-quartile display to illustrate differentiability and importance level of each service attribute. The results indicate that customer service and customer relations can be effective differentiators for container lines. This study suggests that more customer-focused business policies of the container lines may help them to develop and sustain their competitiveness in intra-alliance competition.","[Balci, Gokcay; Cetin, Ismail Bilge] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Maritime Fac, Tinaztepe Campus, TR-35160 Buca Izmir, Turkey; [Tanyeri, Mustafa] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Business Fac, Tinaztepe Campus, TR-35160 Buca Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University; Dokuz Eylul University,"Balci, G (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Maritime Fac, Tinaztepe Campus, TR-35160 Buca Izmir, Turkey.",gokcaybalci@gmail.com; ismail.cetin@deu.edu.tr; mustafa.tanyeri@deu.edu.tr,"TANYERI, MUSTAFA/AAD-1830-2019; cetin, ismail bilge/O-7611-2017; , Gokcay/A-9673-2018",", Gokcay/0000-0002-1306-5781",,,,,62,21,21,7,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

These business groups are often organised around a holding company. We analyse the dividend payouts of family controlled Borsa Istanbul companies, which are affiliated to holding and non-holding BGs. We investigate and quantify the effects of several control-enhancing mechanisms (CEMs) on dividend payouts. We use precise quantitative proxies for CEMs to measure the divergence between control and ownership rights. Supporting the rent extraction hypothesis, holding business group companies have lower dividend payouts as the divergence between control and ownership rights widens and the pyramid wedge increases. However, controlling foreign-family coalitions in holding business group companies curb the rent extraction problem by having a positive effect on the dividend payouts. Overall, for family controlled holding BG companies, the effects of company-specific financial control variables on dividend payouts are stronger than the effects of CEMs. For family controlled non-holding BG companies, there is no empirical support for either the rent extraction or the reputation building hypotheses. The company-specific financial control variables are the main determinants of dividend payouts for family controlled non-holding BG companies.","[Besim, Seniha; Adaoglu, Cahit] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Banking & Finance, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Adaoglu, C (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Banking & Finance, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey.",cahit.adaoglu@emu.edu.tr,"Adaoglu, Cahit/R-1795-2019; Adaoglu, Cahit/CAI-6843-2022; Besim, Seniha/JPQ-5974-2023","Adaoglu, Cahit/0000-0001-5771-9997; Adaoglu, Cahit/0000-0001-5771-9997; Besim, Seniha/0000-0002-6684-5140",,,,,80,3,3,0,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Estimated results on a quarterly data sample from the first quarter of 2000 to the second quarter of 2017 supports the main research hypothesis and reveals that that Croatian current account can be explained using the analytical framework based on the monetary and absorption approach. Domestic demand, real exchange rate index, loans to private sector and monetary aggregates M4 are tested as the determinants of Croatian current account. Monetary aggregates M4 are found to hold the highest explanatory power among tested monetary variables.

This article scrutinises this widespread assumed association, considering the ubiquitous application of rating systems that potentially reduce regional banks' local credit-granting authority and obviate the necessity of proximity to reduce information asymmetries. Novel ethnographic insights into credit-decision processes, inter alia, of a regional operating savings bank and a large nationwide bank surprisingly reveal shorter functional distance of the large bank in approximately 50% of credit decisions because of the considerable credit-granting authority of local staff. Nevertheless, observations of soft information usage and credit-decision processes indicate that the regional bank is able to consider soft information when it most strongly influences lending decisions, i.e., when deciding whether to lend to financially distressed SMEs.","[Floegel, Franz] Inst Work & Technol, Munscheidstr 14, D-45886 Gelsenkirchen, Germany",,"Flögel, F (通讯作者)，Westfal Hsch, Inst Work & Technol, Munscheidstr 14, D-45886 Gelsenkirchen, Germany.",floegel@iat.eu,"Flögel, Franz/AFV-0732-2022","Flögel, Franz/0000-0002-7874-3029",Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; Hans Bockler Stiftung [2013-677-1],Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; Hans Bockler Stiftung,This work was supported by a scholarship from the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes and the Hans Bockler Stiftung [grant number 2013-677-1].,,63,18,19,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The agency exercised by MNEs in these ways influences the 'selection' of investment locations, 'coupling' processes, and the depth and pace of host territorial institutional change.

This unique compliance is the fundamental distinguishing factor between Islamic and conventional finance The vision of Islamic finance is to avoid involving in Shari'ah prohibited elements such as interest, uncertainty, gambling and prohibited investments which are currently practiced by the conventional finance industry. These elements are prohibited clearly in the primary sources of Shari'ah, i.e. the Quran and Sunnah. Considering the prohibitions of conventional finance from Islamic perspective, Shari'ah scholars have come out with an alternative solution by introducing Islamic finance. Consequently, there is a tremendous growth of Islamic finance proven by wide-spread subscription of the Islamic finance products and services in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. However, despite its growth, Islamic finance is not totally free from criticisms that its practice does not meet the ultimate objective of its establishment, i.e. realization of benefit to mankind in this world and Hereafter. In order to achieve this objectives of Shari'ah (maqasid al-Shariah) Islamic financial institutions must aim to provide socio-economically fair products and services and avoid all the items prohibited by the Shari'ah. Ideally, it should be taking care of public interest and social justice while making profits for the shareholders and investors. If Islamic finance complies with Maqasid Al- Shari'ah, there should not be any undesirable issues against the practices of Islamic finance. However, due to the existence of unfavorable issues, it is timely to revisit the historical practices of Islamic finance so that these past events can be used as lessons for the betterment of Islamic finance in the future. Thus, the main objective of this proposed research is to examine to what extent the Islamic finance sector meets Maqasid Al- Shari'ah.","[Hassan, Rusni] IIUM, Inst Islamic Banking & Finance IIiBF, Gombak, Malaysia; [Salman, Syed Ahmed] Lincoln Univ Coll, Fac Business & Accountancy, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia; [Yusoff, Adnan] Univ Tenaga Nas, Ctr Islamic Studies & Civilizat, Kajang, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia; Lincoln University College; Universiti Tenaga Nasional,"Hassan, R (通讯作者)，IIUM, Inst Islamic Banking & Finance IIiBF, Gombak, Malaysia.",hrusni@gmail.com; salmaniium@gmail.com; adnan@uniten.edu.my,"; Syed, Ahmed Salman/T-6309-2018","salman, ahmed/0000-0002-5634-2726; Syed, Ahmed Salman/0000-0001-7101-5961",,,,,18,1,1,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7011,7014,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207099,0

These issues are mainly propagated in system properties such as readability, scalability, maintainability, sustainability, easiness of implementation, and many others. All these properties affect the general user friendliness and overall trust in the system. For these reasons, it is necessary to have a comprehensive view of complexity of the information system in the different phases of its life cycle. This paper deals with the complexity analysis of information systems, its causes and implications for users and organizations. The aim of this paper is to summarize ways of measuring complexity in different phases of its life cycle and different content dimensions of the information system. Selected complexity analysis is then showcased on a case study of a privately implemented real-world system.

First of all, these interrelationships are manifested in the division of industries by the level of manufacturability. The objective of this study is to determine key factors ensuring the sustainability of development of industrial sectors in terms of their level of manufacturability. The research methodology is based on cluster and correlation and regression analysis. The object of the study is Russian industrial sector. The official statistics on the development of Russian and world industry in open access serve as a base for the study. Cluster analysis clearly demonstrated that the distribution of industries depending on the level of their manufacturability in Russia is quite identical to the global classifications. Investigation of the factors ensuring sustainability demonstrated a clear increase in the dependence on innovation activity with an increase in the level of manufacturability, while with a decrease in this level, the dependence between the sustainability of development and the financial stability is growing. Thus, the tools for ensuring the sustainability of development for low-tech industrial enterprises should be based on the principles of increasing their financial stability, while the toolkit for ensuring the sustainability of high-tech industry representatives should be based on increasing the efficiency of generation and integration of innovative solutions (technological and non-technological).","[Konnikov, Evgenii A.] Peter Great StPetersburg Polytech Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Konnikova, Olga A.] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Negashev, Dmitry S.] St Petersburg State Autonomous Inst, Directorate management Sports Facil, St Petersburg, Russia; [Novikova, Alexandra V.] Bryansk State Tech Univ, Bryansk, Russia",Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University; Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics; Bryansk State Technical University,"Konnikov, EA (通讯作者)，Peter Great StPetersburg Polytech Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",konnikov_ea@spbstu.ru; olga.a.konnikova@gmail.com; karamzin12@gmail.com; avnovikova2010@gmail.com,"Konnikova, Olga/GQR-0361-2022; Konnikov, Evgeniy/L-7297-2017",,,,,,18,3,3,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4431,4444,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205047,0

Propensity score matching method indicates that eco-innovations can have positive impacts on firm profitability with a delay of about two years. Demand-side factors, which are represented by green procurement and advertising intensity and supply-side factors delegated by regulation intensity and subsidy, will positively moderate the eco-product innovation/profitability link. The only significant moderator for eco-process innovation/profitability association is subsidy. Panel regressions results further show that market expansion is more pronounced in the eco-product innovation firms endowed with green procurement orders or with high advertising intensity. These findings suggest that demand-side policies can emphasize on optimizing green purchasing mechanism and inducing greater green promotion, whereas supply-side policies can highlight formulating reasonable levels of environmental regulation intensity and differential subsidies.","[Ma, Ding; Ye, Jian-mu] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ya-rui] Hubei Univ Arts & Sci Xiangfan, Sch Management, Xiangyang 441053, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Ma, D (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",mading@whut.edu.cn; jianmuye@126.com; zhangmisue@hotmail.com,,,National Social Science Fund of China [17BJL031],National Social Science Fund of China,This study was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant No. 17BJL031).,,51,9,9,0,12,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The limitation of this study is measurement of commissioner competences not include experience in his field. The implications of this research; (1) Companies need to consider the proportion of women directors in maintaining the continuity of the company. (2) For investors; the proportion of high financial leverage has the potential to hinder the corporate sustainability.

The model presents the joint between static and dynamic knowledge elements that allow HEIs to generate sustained competitive advantage. Among the main results, the model shows that dynamic components of intellectual capital are strategic assets for the renewal and updating of knowledge. This management allows HEIs to obtain superior performance.

It has been verified how both company characteristics and macroeconomic factors affect adjustments toward a leverage target. This study provides a systematic analysis of the empirical literature on the leverage by conducting a meta-analysis. In particular, the problem of publication selection bias is discussed. Our results indicate that there is an evidence of such publication selection. For Polish case, we have found that the estimation of coefficient for lagged leverage is equal to 58.45%. It means that companies adjust its current level of leverage to the optimal value at a rate of 41.55% per year, so they need 1.3 years to reduce half of the distance to the optimum leverage.

The paper identifies the main problems of regional development which are characterised both for Ukraine and European countries, in particular: aging and depopulation of the population, influx of forced migrants, presence of depressed territories, unevenness in living standards of the urban and rural population, development problems of the transport infrastructure, etc. The authors proposed recommendations for overcoming unevenness of regional development, among which: definition and development of potential and already formed growth poles, formation of new functions of settlements, which will be able to give them an impetus for further evolution, support of rural population and agribusiness, development of transport infrastructure, etc. An important issue of regional policy is demographic component, in particular, regulation of the labor market and reduction of migration outflow, control over the influx of external migrants.","[Niemets, Liudmyla; Sehida, Kateryna; Peresadko, Vilina] Kharkov Natl Univ, Geog, Kharkov, Ukraine; [Niemets, Liudmyla; Peresadko, Vilina] Kharkov Natl Univ, Kharkov, Ukraine; [Niemets, Liudmyla] Kharkov Natl Univ, Dept Human Geog & Reg Studies, Kharkov, Ukraine; [Sehida, Kateryna; Kravchenko, Kateryna] Kharkov Natl Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog & Reg Studies, Kharkov, Ukraine; [Telebienieva, Ievgeniia] Kharkov Natl Univ, Dept Human Geog & Reg Studies, Educ & Res Lab Reg Human Geog Studies, Kharkov, Ukraine; [Peresadko, Vilina] Kharkov Natl Univ, Sch Geol Geog Recreat & Tourism, Kharkov, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; VN Karazin Kharkiv National University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; VN Karazin Kharkiv National University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; VN Karazin Kharkiv National University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; VN Karazin Kharkiv National University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; VN Karazin Kharkiv National University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; VN Karazin Kharkiv National University,"Niemets, L (通讯作者)，Kharkov Natl Univ, Geog, Kharkov, Ukraine.;Niemets, L (通讯作者)，Kharkov Natl Univ, Kharkov, Ukraine.;Niemets, L (通讯作者)，Kharkov Natl Univ, Dept Human Geog & Reg Studies, Kharkov, Ukraine.",ludmila.nemets@karazin.ua; kateryna.sehida@gmail.com; kate4465@gmail.com; telebenevaev@gmail.com; vilinaperesadko@gmail.com,"Sehida, Kateryna/E-8347-2019; Telebienieva, Ievgeniia/GMW-7869-2022; Peresadko, Vilina A./AHC-1636-2022; Niemets, Liudmyla/E-8259-2019; Kravchenko, Kateryna/AAX-5450-2021","Sehida, Kateryna/0000-0002-1122-8460; Peresadko, Vilina/0000-0002-2439-2788",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,362,374,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553200031,0

The aim of this study is to identify the preferences of the people using bitcoin as the most famous and valuable cryptocurrency. This paper has particularly investigated the most important factors in choosing bitcoin. In addition to the survey, the least-squares criterion in the model of multiple linear regression was applied to determine the relationship between dependent variable and independent variable. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were also used. It starts with the basic hypothesis that surveyed respondents would show a positive perception for using bitcoin currency in order to get much better satisfaction than by using traditional payment methods, given the very high costs of banking services in the observed countries due to a greater degree of security and privacy of payment transactions. Also, an auxiliary hypothesis has been defined, which reads: the establishment and faster expansion of bitcoin payments depends on the establishment of institutional infrastructure. The research conducted in the South Eastern Europe countries showed a high correlation between defined dependent variable and independent variable, i.e. a high degree of perception of meeting the needs and expectations of future users by considered bitcoin currency payment technology.","[Nikic, Vinko] Adriatic Univ Bar, Fac Metiterranean Business Studies Tivat, Ul Luke Tomanovica 1, Tivat 85320, Montenegro",,"Nikic, V (通讯作者)，Adriatic Univ Bar, Fac Metiterranean Business Studies Tivat, Ul Luke Tomanovica 1, Tivat 85320, Montenegro.",nikicv@t-com.me,,,,,,,20,2,2,1,12,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Rural youth as a successor of the family farming business prefers to go to the cities and escape from agriculture. Data shows only 4 percent of farmer's children in Central Java Indonesia eventually become a farmer. Contemporary, agriculture is been populated by the old farmer with an average age of 52 years. Indeed, agriculture always requires innovation to deal with rapid changes in the rural environment. In this concern, youth will be the principal actor to adopt those changes. This study aims to map issues of food agriculture that cause young people to abandon rural life and to formulate policy alternatives in preventing farmer regeneration crisis. Data was obtained through in-depth interviews with 150 households in rice-growing villages in Indonesia. The study reveals that rural youth face many hurdles to earn a livelihood in agriculture. Lack of land access, income uncertainty, and dependence on chemical fertilizers are reasons which cause agriculture to become unattractive for the youth. Some policy strategies have been offered to engage youth in agriculture. Examples include the provision of communal for young to conduct organic farming, involving local communities to transfer agricultural knowledge, upgrade technological youth skills to access broader markets, expand the entrepreneurship program in rural and provide farmer incentives in the form of financial assistance.","[Ningrum, Vanda] Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Populat, Jakarta, Indonesia",National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI),"Ningrum, V (通讯作者)，Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Populat, Jakarta, Indonesia.",vanda.ningrum@gmail.com,"Ningrum, Vanda/AAF-5142-2021","Ningrum, Vanda/0000-0002-7366-6175",Indonesian Institute of Sciences,Indonesian Institute of Sciences(Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEK)),This Study is part of the research entitle Modernization and Crisis of farmer Regeneration in Rural Area.

Four main indicators characterizing agro-tourism were taken into consideration: number of guest houses, number of places, tourist arrivals and overnight stays. They have been analyzed in their dynamics at the national level and also in the territory in the 8 regions of development. Herfindhal-Hirschman Index (HHI), Gini-Struck Coefficient (GSC) and Concentration Coefficient (CC) were used to evaluate the concentration in Romania's agro-tourism. The results proved that HHI values ranged between 0.2 and 03 reflecting a moderate concentration of agro-tourism in terms of guest houses, places, tourist arrivals and overnight stays. GSC values were higher than 0.3 and in a few cases over 0.4, confirming a relative concentration of agro-tourism. CC values exceeded 0.3 and in few cases 0.4, reflecting a relative concentration. As a conclusion, there is a moderate to relative concentration of agro-tourism in Romania. There are differences among the eight regions of development, the Central, North East and North West regions concentrating over 71 % of the number of guest houses and places, and over 74% of tourists and overnight stays. However, all the regions, of Romania make continuous efforts to develop agro-tourism for promoting the beauty of the landscapes, the historical and cultural heritage, for assuring the economic development of the local communities, for raising the living standard of the rural population and for better satisfying tourists' demand.","[Popescu, Agatha] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Popescu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania.",agatha_popescu@yahoo.com,"Popescu, Agatha/KBB-4359-2024","Popescu, Agatha/0000-0003-2330-7120",,,,,27,9,9,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4315,4329,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205035,0

The paper is based upon an identification of a variety of theoretical perspectives about the global education market, its trends and influences on those schools in the aspects of market orientation. Conceptual framework analysis was used to characterise the market orientation of Business Schools as an opportunity for the strategic business model of University Business Schools in transition countries. Key factors and indicators for understanding their environment were identified, structured and categorised within a theoretical framework. These factors reflect the evolving context of reformation of the existing business model of University Business Schools in transition countries in a comprehensive way, since the framework outlines the complexity of their adaptation, considering the linkages and dependencies of all the crucial global external in internal environment trends and aspects.

These Mobile devices still lack in resources compared to a conventional information-processing device such as PCs and laptops. The solution to overcome of these challenges is Mobile Cloud Computing. We propose a new elastic framework that enables transparent use of cloud resources to augment the capability of resource constrained mobile devices. The significant features of this model include the partition of a single application into multiple components. Mobile applications can be executed in the mobile device or offloaded to the cloud clone for execution. The results shows that the performance of execute application on mobile or cloud in terms of memory consumed using different distance and number of points are concluded. The most of resources consumed on mobile smartphone will decrease approximately to the half of memory consumed for running application on the mobile only. On the other side, Although Cloud Computing is a great innovation in the world of computing, there also exist downsides of cloud computing such as security of data. Therefore, there is a great need of encryption method with high levels of security and with minimal key size. There for, the main target for ensuring security is to developed new hybrid cryptography protocol. So, new hybrid cryptography protocol is developed for achieving security in Mobile Cloud Computing. The results show the superiority of new algorithm. The main contribution of our research is to develop a secure mobile-cloud infrastructure that will enable smartphone applications that are distributed both in terms of data and computation.","[Salama Abd-Elmiaam, Diaa; Alanezi, Farah T.] Benha Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Informat Syst Dept, Banha, Egypt; [Hosny, Khalid M.] Zagazig Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Informat Technol Dept, Zagazig, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Benha University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University,"Salama Abd-Elmiaam, D (通讯作者)，Benha Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Informat Syst Dept, Banha, Egypt.",diaa.salama@fci.bu.edu.eg; Alzaiin86@gmail.com; k_hosny@yahoo.com,"Hosny, Khalid M./B-1404-2008; salama, Diaa/AAM-8669-2021; Salama, Diaa/AAB-3018-2022","Hosny, Khalid M./0000-0001-8065-8977; salama, Diaa/0000-0002-1544-9906;",,,,,22,5,5,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5783,5796,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206083,0

In this context, the main aim of this paper is to assess the relation between GDP and the most important monetary variables in two countries: Romania and Czech Republic over the period of 1995: Q1 - 2015:Q4. The choice of these economies was deliberate. The selected countries are different from the viewpoint of rate and results of transformation from the centrally planned to market economy, which have influenced their current economic environment stability. Czech Republic is currently classified as middle or even developed country, whereas Romania is still considered as a developing economy. Thus, differences between these two countries make them interesting in the case of comparative studies. In the empirical part of our research the vector error correction models (VECM) were applied. The main findings of the article are the following: in Romania, there is a short-run causality from money supply (M3) to GDP and a long-run relationship between GDP, internal credit and M3. According to Granger causality test, the rate of M3 in Romania was a cause for economic. In Czech Republic, there is a short-run causality from M3 to GDP and a long-run causality between GDP, internal credit and M3. Thus, the results contradict the money neutrality hypothesis in post-transformation Central European economies.","[Simionescu, Mihaela] Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania; [Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland; [Bilan, Yuriy] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Ctr Appl Econ Res, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Kotaskova, Anna] Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Bratislava, Slovakia",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Tomas Bata University Zlin; Pan-European University,"Bilan, Y (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Ctr Appl Econ Res, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic.",yuriy_bilan@yahoo.co.uk,"Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016; Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021; Simionescu, Mihaela/AAP-7639-2021; Simionescu, Mihaela/L-1249-2016; Bilan, Yuriy/B-3119-2012; Kotaskova, Anna/AAD-8105-2019","Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373; Simionescu, Mihaela/0000-0002-6124-2172; Bilan, Yuriy/0000-0003-0268-009X; Kotaskova, Anna/0000-0002-6282-9899; Kotaskova, Anna/0000-0001-7185-6541",,,,,45,17,17,0,20,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The paper presents development of two measures: CSR Maturity Measure and Financial Sustainability Measure, which are then used to setermine: (1) CSR maturity level of the companies, (2) factors influencing CSR maturity of Polish companies, (3) the relationship between CSR maturity and company's financial sustainability. Also - strategic features of most financially sustainable companies are presented. The main findings show that Polish listed companies demonstrate low to moderate maturity of CSR practices (mostly incidental - 46% or tactical CSR - 30%), which is strongly dependant on the company's size and the industry it is in. There is no correlation between company's CSR maturity and financial sustainability, which means that company's involvement in making the world a sustainable place (through CSR practice) doesn't translate into the company's increased sustainability.","[Witek-Crabb, Anna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Witek-Crabb, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",Anna.Witek@ue.wroc.pl,,,National Science Centre [DEC-2012/07/D/HS4/00531],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)","The research project is financed with the funds of the National Science Centre, decision no.

The mental models of managers result from various thinking patterns and impact efficiency of organization. When it comes to achieving short term goals linear thinking is sufficient but there could be addressed questions how and even why should we overcome potential drawbacks of linear thinking? Having the latter in mind we applied both linear and system thinking in solving the practical problem of meeting logistics requirements of customers. We assumed hypothesis that the systems thinking is reflected with proactive adaptation whereas linear thinking manifest itself by reactive adaptation The applied methods encompass the literature review on linear and system thinking and diagnostic action research. The literature review provides the background on differentiating between linear and system thinking whereas diagnostic action research was applied to verify assumed hypothesis. Findings of our study point to interrelations between flexibility and efficiency. Although reactive adaptation stemmed from linear thinking provides quick wins, could result in unintended consequences. The latter translates into inability to adapt in the longer term. We suppose that our work brings also some impulses for thinking on methodology of action research as it outlines differences in approaching towards linear and system thinking; and provide insights on how to consciously drive causal loops in a business environment.","[Wycislak, Slawomir] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Econ Finance & Management, Fac Management & Social Commun, Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Wycislak, S (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Econ Finance & Management, Fac Management & Social Commun, Krakow, Poland.",slawomir.wycislak@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68285-3; 978-3-319-68284-6,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,243,256,,10.1007/978-3-319-68285-3_18,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1XS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448589400018,0

Two terms-sustainability reporting and integrated reporting, used in relation to reporting for sustainable development, are defined. They are discussed in the context of different, partly conflicting, approaches to business sustainability. It was shown that more and more often reporting frameworks refer to sustainability and sustainable development, but none of them supports a holistic approach to business sustainability (for which the organization has a potential to contribute to sustainable development of the world). Most of reporting standards are the manifestation of the win-win approach to business sustainability (which in reality makes the role of the organization unclear in the sustainable development). Particularly worthy of attention is the GRI's Framework. It seems to be constructed by the holistic-altruistic values that condition the organizational participation in sustainable development. However, in business practice, this standard is the manifestation of individualisticegoistic values. The GRI's Framework shows that there are conditions (other than the reporting standard itself), which have to be investigated.

Officials must regain honour through a process of self-confrontation and self-renunciation in compulsory meetings in which they are encouraged to transform their immoral thoughts and behaviours through confessional criticism and self-criticism practices. These meetings facilitate officials' redemption through a divinized, ritualistic and theatrical process. In the process of confession and penance, officials must expose themselves to a type of ritual martyrdom, which combines elements of shame, a commitment to absolute obedience and exposure to risk.

Comparing different designs for Stockholm, the paper shows that the most efficient system is the least equitable. Indeed, we show that moving towards a more efficient system design favours high-income users most. The reason is the uneven distribution of workplaces and residential areas, combined with richer socio-economic groups living in areas with more workplaces. Hence, the conflict between efficiency and equity of this policy arises from the spatial mismatch of residential areas and locations of employment, and the spatial separation between low-income and high-income groups that characterise most cities. This paper shows that these spatial patterns have a large effect on the distribution effects of the congestion charges and that the system design can have a major impact on equity.","[Kristoffersson, Ida] VTI Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, VTI Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Engelson, Leonid; Borjesson, Maria] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden",VTI; Royal Institute of Technology,"Kristoffersson, I (通讯作者)，VTI Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, VTI Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",ida.kristoffersson@vti.se; leonid.engelson@abe.kth.se; maria.borjesson@abe.kth.se,"Engelson, Leonid/K-4566-2016","Borjesson, Maria/0000-0001-9235-0232",Bisek 1 research programme; Swedish Transport Administration; Swedish Innovation Agency Vinnova; Norwegian Public Roads Administration; MOSK (Motor vehicle organizations association); NAF (Norway's automobile association),Bisek 1 research programme; Swedish Transport Administration; Swedish Innovation Agency Vinnova(Vinnova); Norwegian Public Roads Administration; MOSK (Motor vehicle organizations association); NAF (Norway's automobile association),"This research was conducted within the AVENIR project, which was funded by the Bisek 1 research programme.

However, there are other possible reform strategies and it is not clear whether European reforms actually increase railway's modal shares. Based on an analysis performed on 27 European countries in the period 1995-2013, there is no evidence that vertical separation and competition entry increase modal shares of European railways. The horizontal separation of the freight and passenger division of the incumbent and subsequent privatisation of the freight division looks like a more promising strategy.

First, we raise substantial concerns as to whether standard questions employed can be used to infer risk aversion among nascent entrepreneurs. In our work we show that the US, Canadian and Swedish panel study datasets do not offer evidence that entrepreneurs are more risk averse than non-entrepreneurs. In fact, we show that the measurements used for risk aversion in these studies are not compatible with classic expected utility theory. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that probability weighting may even counteract the respondent's risk attitude. Therefore, inferring the respondent's risk attitude from choices in the panel study datasets can be misleading in the presence of probability weighting. We therefore suggest that alternative theories of decision making under risk, like prospect theory, are relevant and should be taken into account in future studies on entrepreneurship.

This study aims to examine employers' choices of TDM program and the effectiveness based on a Seoul TDM database. Factors affecting employers' decisions on whether to participate in TDM programs and the degree of participation are identified based on regression models: binary logistic, ordinary least squares and Tobit regressions. In addition, an employers' TDM program choice model is developed using the approach of the multiple discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model, as an employer can participate in multiple TDM programs, and their individual effectiveness is represented by continuous values of traffic impact fee discount rates. The developed models consistently indicate that facilities' characteristics such as owner type and facility size, along with locational characteristics (e.g., land use and accessibility to transit) are important in choosing a TDM program. In particular, the MDCEV model shows that employers' preferences for TDM programs vary significantly by employer and characteristics of the program.","[Ko, Joonho] Seoul Inst, Dept Transportat Res, 57 Nambustmhwan Ro, Seoul 06756, South Korea; [Kim, Daejin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30318 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30318 USA.",jko@si.re.kr; daejin.kim@gatech.edu,"Kim, Daejin/AAM-8588-2020","Kim, Daejin/0000-0001-7866-7698; Ko, Joonho/0000-0002-0426-3356",,,,,32,11,13,1,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The competing models include univariate and multivariate models, fixed and time-varying parameter models, constant and stochastic volatility models, models using small and large datasets, and models with and without Bayesian variable selection. The results indicate that the forecasting performances of the different models change notably across both time and countries. Similarly to recent findings in the literature from developed countries, models that account for stochastic volatility and time-varying parameters provide more accurate forecasts for inflation than the alternatives in EMs. The results suggest that inflation predictability is correlated negatively with central bank independence. Also, institutional forecasts are superior to model-based forecasts for the majority of EMs. This suggests that the incorporation of subjective judgement can improve model-based inflation forecasts.

First, we derive the statistical properties of TSV models. Second, we demonstrate the good finite sample properties of a MCMC estimator, implemented in the software package WinBUGS, when estimating the parameters of a general specification, denoted CTSV, that nests the TSV and asymmetric autoregressive stochastic volatility (A-ARSV) models. The MCMC estimator also discriminates between the two specifications and allows us to obtain volatility forecasts. Third, we analyze daily S&P 500 and FTSE 100 returns and show that the estimated CTSV model implies plug-in moments that are slightly closer to the observed sample moments than those implied by other nested specifications. Furthermore, different asymmetric specifications generate rather different European options prices. Finally, although none of the models clearly emerge as best out of-sample, it seems that including both threshold variables and correlated errors may be a good compromise.

Differences in growth and health outcomes by birth month have been found in other studies. This paper tests whether long-term educational and health disadvantages of individuals born just before the start of school year cut-off date of July 1st exist in Northern Ireland. The analysis is based on a c. 28 per cent representative population sub-sample of young people aged 12-18 in 2001 in the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS) with linked 2001 and 2011 Census records.

The report has two main themes. First, Brexit should not jeopardise the legislative or institutional continuity of UK competition law. The main pillars of UK competition law-the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002-do not require radical reform because of Brexit, though some amendments will be needed. The second theme, however, is the problematic nature of transition to the environment post-Brexit, and of how to secure effective international coordination and cooperation within it.

Building on the systematic analysis of the socio-economic dynamics of 31 European small and medium-sized towns (SMSTs), we identified three profiles of their local economies. The first profile is defined as a dominant residential' economy that mostly relies on local activities that satisfy the needs of people in an area (residents, commuters or tourists).

To investigate this possibility among food insecure and low-income households we examined four years of data from each of the 2004 and 2008 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Among low-income and food insecure households we found no evidence that one type of assistance reduced later receipt of the second type of assistance. Rather, results from conditional logistic regression models indicated that receiving one type of assistance was associated with a higher probability of receiving the second type of assistance, or that there was no relationship between the two types of assistance. Factors informing these results are discussed in the context of household help-seeking and government assistance.","[Nielsen, Robert B.; Wilmarth, Melissa J.] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Seay, Martin C.] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Kansas State University,"Nielsen, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",rbnielsen@ches.ua.edu; mseay@k-state.edu; mwilmarth@ches.ua.edu,"Nielsen, Robert B/F-4996-2010","Nielsen, Robert/0000-0003-2282-4900; Seay, Martin/0000-0003-1630-9056","Institute for Research on Poverty RIDGE Center for National Food and Nutrition Assistance Research; RIDGE Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project [1003397]; University of Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station [GEO00731]; NIFA [1003397, 690625] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",Institute for Research on Poverty RIDGE Center for National Food and Nutrition Assistance Research; RIDGE Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project; University of Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"Robert B.

Additionally, individuals are not cognisant of how asset allocation choices ultimately impact retirement savings. Life cycle and balanced funds are popular asset allocation strategies to save towards retirement. However, recent research is questioning the efficacy of life cycle funds that switch to lower risk asset classes as retirement approaches. Aim: The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of life cycle funds with balanced funds to determine whether either dominates the other. The study compares balanced and life cycle funds with similar starting asset allocations as well as those where the starting asset allocations differ. Setting: The study has a South African focus and constructs funds using historical data for the main local asset classes; that is, equity, fixed income and cash, as well as a proxy for foreign equity covering the period 1986-2013. Method: The study makes use of Monte Carlo simulations and bootstrap with replacement, and compares the simulated outcomes using stochastic dominance as decision-making criteria. Results: The results indicate that life cycle funds fail to dominate balanced funds by first-order or almost stochastic dominance when funds have a similar starting asset allocation. It is noteworthy that there are instances where the opposite is true, that is, balanced funds dominate life cycle funds. These results highlight that while the life cycle funds provide more downside protection, they significantly supress the upside potential compared to balanced funds. When the starting asset allocations of the balanced and life cycle funds differ, the stochastic dominance results are inconsistent as to the efficacy of the life cycle fund strategies considered. Conclusion: The study shows that whether one fund is likely to dominate the other is strongly dependent on the underlying asset allocation strategies of the funds. Additionally, the length of the glide path and the risk and return characteristics of the investable universe are also likely to influence the findings.","[Louw, Elbie; van Schalkwyk, Cornelis H.; Reyers, Michelle] Univ Pretoria, Dept Financial Management, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Louw, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Financial Management, Pretoria, South Africa.",elbie@amitywealth.co.za,"Reyers, Michelle/AAA-3976-2019","Reyers, Michelle/0000-0002-7082-3470; Louw, Elbie/0000-0003-3460-4622",,,,,37,0,0,0,3,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

From a legal perspective, the no-bailout rule and the ban on monetary financing constitute the main principles governing the legality review of financial assistance and liquidity measures. Interpretation of these rules is full of empirical claims. According to conventional legal doctrine, bond spreads only depend on the country's debt position, largely ignoring other causal factors including liquidity. We test the hypotheses implicit in conventional legal reasoning. We find evidence that a significant part of the surge in the spreads of the peripheral Eurozone countries was disconnected from underlying fundamentals and particularly from a country's debt position, and was associated rather strongly with market sentiments and liquidity concerns. We apply our empirical findings to the legal principles as interpreted by recent jurisprudence arguing that application of the no-bailout principle and the ban on monetary financing should be extended to capture non-debt related factors. Also, the empirical results suggest taking recourse to alternative legal grounds for reviewing the legality of anti-crisis instruments and allowing for a lender of last resort in the euro zone.

WEI are welfare effects caused by imperfections in markets adjacent to the transport market and are additional to the transport user benefits calculated in a conventional cost benefit analysis. A multiregional Spatial Computable General Equilibrium (SCGE) model is developed on the basis of data from sources such as the Norwegian national accounts by county, the Norwegian national transport modelling system, foreign trade statistics and the Norwegian commodity flow survey. The model departs from the assumption of constant returns to scale and perfect competition, taking into consideration commodity, commuting and migration flows between regions. Based on the large number of analysed projects, we are able to draw general conclusions about project specific characteristics leading to WEI of transport infrastructure investments and the expected relative size of these effects. The paper relates to the ongoing discussion on the link between infrastructure and economic growth, and illustrates how SCGE models can be used in transport appraisal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Aim: In testing the hypotheses of the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission, the aim is to see how household credit and ultimately household consumption have evolved in South Africa: (1) before inflation targeting (1994-1999), (2) after inflation targeting (2000-2007) and (3) during the global financial crisis (2007-2012) in response to different monetary policy positioning. Setting: We focus on three periods: post transition from apartheid, during inflation targeting and during the global financial crisis, periods which saw changes in the monetary policy stance in South Africa. Methods: Quarterly data from 1994Q1 to 2012Q4, constant parameter VAR and time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) techniques are used in this study. The use of the TVP-VAR is to capture the time-varying nature of the underlying structure of the South African economy and also to investigate whether it performs better than the constant parameter VAR in so doing. Results: The results show that household credit and consumption declined and stayed negative post transition and after inflation targeting - periods of monetary tightening in South Africa - but increased during the global financial crisis, which saw expansionary monetary policy measures aimed at mitigating the negative output gap in South Africa. Conclusion: These changes in household credit and consumption across the different time periods show evidence of the cost of credit effect of monetary policy on household consumption in South Africa. They further reflect the impact of different structural changes and exogenous shocks on monetary policy conduct in South Africa and its pass through effect on household consumption in South Africa. We further conclude that the time TVP-VAR with stochastic volatility performs better than the constant parameter VAR in capturing the time-varying nature of the underlying structure of the South African economy.","[Owusu-Sekyere, Emmanuel] Human Sci Res Council, Africa Inst South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa",Human Sciences Research Council-South Africa,"Owusu-Sekyere, E (通讯作者)，Human Sci Res Council, Africa Inst South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa.",esekyere@hsrc.ac.za,,"Owusu-Sekyere, Emmanuel/0000-0001-9228-1572",,,,,45,2,4,0,3,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This paper explores the potential of an online forum for bisexuals, their partners, and people who are interested in bisexuality to function as an online safe space. To understand whether the analysed forum is successful as a bisexual safe space, as conceptualised by Jo Eadie, I focus on the practices, as manifold of doings and sayings, that create the forum as well as on the embodied experiences of the participants. I conclude that oppressive regimes that are rooted in offline practices, that is, mononormative ideals, value, and orthodoxies, are repeatedly introduced by participants in their stories, questions, and replies. At the same time, sharing experiences and empowerment are core practices and have an impact beyond the forum itself. Finally, by focusing on emotions, moods, and ends we can understand why people take part in the practices that constitute the forum.","[Maliepaard, Emiel] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Human Geog, Thomas van Aquinostr 3, NL-6525 GD Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Maliepaard, E (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Human Geog, Thomas van Aquinostr 3, NL-6525 GD Nijmegen, Netherlands.",e.maliepaard1@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,17,21,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Various industries understand inter modal transportation as a solution and feasible alternative to unimodal road transportation, as it combines the strengths of different transportation modes. Long-haul transportation that usually is carried out by rail or waterborne transportation represents a key feature of intermodal transport chains distinguishing them from unimodal transport chains. However, so far there has been no systematic analysis of the effect of long-haul transportation on the performance of an intermodal transport chain in terms of transportation time and transport time reliability. The aim of this paper is therefore to analyze and evaluate the effect of long-haul transportation on performance by proposing an analytical and a simulation model. The analysis contributes to a better understanding of impacts resulting from different modal shares as well as influencing variables and enables to derive recommendations for future transport planning.","[Erfurth, Toni; Bendul, Julia] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",Jacobs University,"Erfurth, T (通讯作者)，Jacobs Univ Bremen, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",t.erfurth@jacobs-university.de,,"Arlinghaus, Julia/0000-0002-0287-2086",,,,,31,7,7,1,37,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

After discussing the connections between this approach and Judge Posner's work, the article describes collective action theory and its implications for our understanding of the state and of relationships among states. From this perspective, supranational organizations such as the EU can be understood as institutional structures that facilitate collective action among states by reducing the transactions and enforcement costs of making and implementing collective decisions. At the same time, the delegation of authority to supranational institutions creates agency costs for states and their peoples because the interests of the state and its people diverge from the interests of the collective in some instances. Viewed in this perspective, the institutional structure of the EU-like that of other supranational organizations or federal nation states-reflects an effort to strike a balance between collective decision making and local control so as to maximize the collective gains and minimize the resulting agency costs. Understood in these terms, various features of the EU's institutional design make sense. The ordinary legislative process permits the EU to act without the unanimous consent of member states, thus reducing transactions costs in those areas where collective action is necessary, particularly in relation to the creation and regulation of the internal market. The EU reduces enforcement costs through principles of direct applicability or effects and the supremacy of EU law, which are effective legal restraints in states governed by the rule of law. The institutional structure of the EU also incorporates a representative and deliberative process for collective action that helps control the resulting agency costs for member states and their peoples through supermajority and co-decisional requirements. The collective action perspective also illuminates the function of the subsidiarity principle and the enhanced role of national parliaments in its enforcement.","[Levy, Richard E.] Univ Kansas, Sch Law, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Levy, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Sch Law, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",rlevy@ku.edu,,,,,,,86,0,0,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

With some exceptions, most national expenditure surveys are not suitable for use in detailed modelling of the direct tax and welfare system. This makes approaches that impute expenditure data into detailed income surveys of considerable interest. Using a commonly applied method of imputing expenditure data into an income survey, this paper examines the degree of sensitivity in the distribution of household expenditure, and following that the distributional impact of indirect taxes, as the analysis moves from being based on actual expenditure data as recorded in the Irish Household Budget Survey (HBS), to being based on expenditure data imputed to the Irish Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC). Most sensitivity is found in the estimation and imputation of expenditure data for the bottom income decile. Nonetheless, the imputation process is shown to produce highly comparable distributional results when compared with actual expenditure data. An application of an indirect tax microsimulation model integrated with SWITCH, the ESRI tax-benefit microsimulation model, examines the distributional effects of simultaneous reforms of the direct tax, indirect tax, and social welfare systems, illustrating the analytical capability of the approach tested here.","[Savage, Michael] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Savage, M (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,51,7,7,0,2,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Beginning with the ways in which the Pentagon has influenced the film industry in the 9/11 media environment, we go on to detail how Jurassic World enacts the current high-tech military research into biowarfareweaponizing animals and defining nature as the ultimate killing machine. In the film, the dino-stars are harnessed into battle to protect the humans, led by a former Navy soldier who takes a pack of Velociraptors, and filmgoers, on a thrilling hunt to destroy a bioengineered, genetically modified dino-monster. Though the film offers a commercial critique of designing animals purely for profit, it fails to challenge the profit-making ties between the military industries, weapons technology, and corporate entertainment media. Character depictions, narrative, and visual and filmic storytelling devices are explored in order to identify the tropes directing the film's message. Ultimately, Jurassic World presents the military's new frontier of biowarfare with enthusiasm, not skepticism, and Hollywood welcomes a brave new world in which the biological world has been harnessed for military purposes.","[Andersen, Robin] Fordham Univ, Commun & Media Studies, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",Fordham University,"Andersen, R (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Commun & Media Studies, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We analyse wage inequality in Ireland, from the height of an economic boom, through a very deep recession, to the start of a recovery. In keeping with previous work we find that the dispersion in wages increased towards the height of the boom, driven largely by rising returns to skill. However the economic crisis of 2008-2013 was accompanied by a significant reduction in wage dispersion. Although the improving characteristics of the workforce increased wages for all workers over this period, this was offset by falling returns to these skills. Only workers in the lowest decile were unaffected by declining returns, resulting in a reduction in wage inequality during the recession. Our analysis highlights the important role played by the National Minimum Wage in this process.","[Holton, Niamh] Cent Stat Off, Cork, Ireland; [O'Neill, Donal] Maynooth Univ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",Maynooth University,"O'Neill, D (通讯作者)，Maynooth Univ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",donal.oneill@nuim.ie,,"O'Neill, Donal/0000-0001-5516-2603",,,,,36,4,4,0,7,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

In this paper we evaluate nonlinear machine learning and econometric methodologies in forecasting US inflation based on autoregressive and structural models of the term structure. We employ two nonlinear methodologies: the econometric least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the machine-learning support vector regression (SVR) method. The SVR has never been used before in inflation forecasting considering the term spread as a regressor. In doing so, we use a long monthly dataset spanning the period 1871:1-2015:3 that covers the entire history of inflation in the US economy. For comparison purposes we also use ordinary least squares regression models as a benchmark. In order to evaluate the contribution of the term spread in inflation forecasting in different time periods, we measure the out-of-sample forecasting performance of all models using rolling window regressions. Considering various forecasting horizons, the empirical evidence suggests that the structural models do not outperform the autoregressive ones, regardless of the model's method. Thus we conclude that the term spread models are not more accurate than autoregressive models in inflation forecasting.

The article presents a novel approach as it relies on a newly developed risk metric entitled the Supervision Diamond introduced by the Danish FSA, which external board directors must address. It contains five thresholds for measuring a bank's exposure to credit risks i.e. the proportion of large customers, lending growth, the ratio of lending/deposits, liquidity buffer and the proportion of real estate loans. By employing quantitative governance variables the article finds that increased executive director remuneration is associated with increased credit risk posed by the bank's borrowers. On the other hand, increasing the number of executive/inside directors is associated with a lower credit risk exposure. It is argued that more inside directors on the executive board constitutes a stronger checks and balance system. The article also documents that the probability of obtaining state capital from the Danish credit bailout package is negatively related to larger boards as well as higher executive director remuneration. The policy implication is that financial authorities should be increasingly aware of insufficient corporate governance characteristics in order to prevent excessive credit risk exposure. Moreover, the article provides important insights on which corporate governance variables have a significant impact on a bank's credit risk exposure. This knowledge is valuable for financial authorities/policy makers considering future regulatory initiatives and how they should administer bank monitoring.","[Rose, Caspar] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Econ & Management, Ctr Corp Governance, Porcelaenshaven 24A,1 Sal, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Rose, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Econ & Management, Ctr Corp Governance, Porcelaenshaven 24A,1 Sal, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",car.int@cbs.dk,,,,,,,37,9,10,1,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

As the variance measures the deviation around the expected return, the introduction of EVaR in the mean-variance framework helps to control the downside risk of portfolio returns. This study utilized the squared l(2)-norm to alleviate estimation risk problems arising from the mean estimate of random returns. To adequately represent the variance-EVaR risk measure of the resulting portfolio, this study pursues rescaling by the capital accessible after payment of transaction costs. The results of this paper extend the classical Markowitz model to the case of proportional transaction costs and enhance the efficiency of portfolio selection by alleviating estimation risk and controlling the downside risk of portfolio returns. The model seeks to meet the requirements of regulators and fund managers as it represents a balance between short tails and variance. The practical implications of the findings of this study are that the model when applied, will increase the amount of capital for investment, lower transaction cost and minimize risk associated with the deviation around the expected return at the expense of a small additional risk in short tails.","[Atta Mills, Ebenezer Fiifi Emire; Yu, Bo; Yu, Jie] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,"Atta Mills, EFE (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",attamills2003@gmail.com; yubo@dlut.edu.cn; yujie@mail.dlut.edu.cn,"Atta Mills, Ebenezer Fiifi Emire/K-3984-2015; Yu, Bo/D-8431-2012","Atta Mills, Ebenezer Fiifi Emire/0000-0002-4977-7270;",National Nature Science Foundation of China [11571061],National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (11571061).,,81,3,4,0,15,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In 2015, 20.50% of the total populations obtained the social protection by Social Security Act B. E. 2533 (1990) under Article 33, 39 and 40. About 7,671 million baht was allocated annually for social protection and social welfare services by the basic rights of Thai people, especially the poor and the vulnerable. The gaps in achieving the goal of sustainable development in Goal 1, Target 1.3 were; inconsistent state policy and unsystematic measures and projects. The social protection was mostly allocated in the form of money, allowance, grant, fund and free welfare. The appropriate measures other than money from taxation should be implemented and the social protection system should be unique, relevant and sustainable in finance.","[Dechawongse, Saneh] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Fac Tourism & Hospitality, Bangkok, Thailand; [Gomaratut, Somporn] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Fac Arts, Bangkok, Thailand; [Sajjanand, Siriporn] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Dechawongse, S (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Fac Tourism & Hospitality, Bangkok, Thailand.",saneh@dpu.ac.th; somporng@dpu.ac.th; ecasssir@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,8,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-02-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,128,130,,10.26480/icemi.01.2017.128.130,0.0,,,3,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461012100046,0

The study can be used as references for the planning of marketing strategies and as the basis for future researches in the customer behavior with regard to bakery customers (another application of BOS) and specialty fats in general.","[Ha Nam Khanh Giao] Univ Finance & Mkt, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",,"Ha, NKG (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Mkt, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",khanhgiaohn@yahoo.com,"Giao, Ha Nam Khanh/AAD-4273-2020",,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",2287-478X,,,INT CONF KOREA DISTR,,,2017,,,,,,,219,221,,,,,,3,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ1UR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418104000058,0

Managing risk such as health risks may incur high cost to remain healthy. Individuals make decisions on having protection against health risks in the long run which depends on several factors. This study focused on the behavioral aspects of finance which attempts to assess factors predicting health insurance purchase among Malaysian public sector employees. The likelihood of personality and health risks factors in predicting health insurance purchase were determined. Multistage random sampling based on four zones in Peninsular Malaysia was utilized to sample 500 respondents from four states. Selected departments in the states were contacted prior to the data collection for their consent. Respondents identified by liaison officers in each department were given self-administered questionnaires resulting in 356 usable questionnaires. Apart from socioeconomic characteristics and health insurance purchase, data on investment, personality and health status were collected. Personalities measured were self-esteem, risk-averse and future-orientation, while health risks were measured through health status using SF-36. The primarily measures and the aggregate measures of health were analyzed in two separate binomial logistic regressions where both analyses revealed that income was the strongest predictor as compared to investment activity or self-esteem. None of the indicators for health risks was found to be significant in predicting health insurance purchase. Both models were justified as fit by being moderately correctly classified and were more than 25% improvement over the chance accuracy rate. It is concluded that the decision on protection against health risks using health insurance is not based on their health risks instead the decision depends more on their income. As these are employees in the public sector, it may reflect high reliance on the government health service. Nevertheless, the public sector is considered as a potential market for health insurance industry.","[Husniyah, A. R.; Amim, O.

The supporters of this trend argued that markets always behaved in a rational and effective manner. But instead of reducing poverty and promoting the development of good social welfare, these policies have partly caused an increase in social inequality, (that made by power during 1990s and 2000s.)

This study also analyzes Web analytics (Web usage and Web content analytics) to discover financial and non-financial usage and content patterns from company websites and other sources of World data. The case studies submitted in this article partly demonstrates the developed Web analytics systems. To serve this purpose, a questionnaire was distributed to five user groups (academics, students, managers, bank officers and auditors). From the survey, the analysis indicates that attracting's foreign investors, promoting the company to a wider public, attract local investors and promote wider coverage are the four most important benefits of IFR to the company. The findings revealed that three main benefits to the users who collect financial information of companies via their website are: increases timeliness and efficiency in obtaining financial information, makes investment decision process easier and faster, and provides information about a company inexpensively. Preliminary findings suggested three factors that are perceived as important by responding firms to engage in IFR: enhance corporate image, company teller with the technology development, and competitors in the industry. The findings also revealed three factors that inhibit firms from engaging in IFR: required expertise from the company, need to keep information up to date to be of use and concern over security of information. The findings also suggested increased information and analysis, and global reach and mass communication as the most important advantages from financial reporting on the internet. On the other hand, security problems, and cost and expertise are the biggest disadvantages of placing financial information on the internet. Finally, plausible implications of the findings of the study are then presented and areas for future research are also proposed. Taken together, these research outcomes make an incremental contribution to the existing financial reporting literature by providing useful insights into our knowledge of IFR especially for emerging capital markets like Malaysia.","[Khan, Mohd Noor Azli Ali] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Dept Accounting & Finance, Skudai, Malaysia; [Ismail, Noor Azizi] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch Business, Sintok, Malaysia; [Mardani, Abbas] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Dept Business Adm, Skudai, Malaysia; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Res Inst Smart Bldg Technol, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kaklauskas, Arturas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Econ & Property Management, Vilnius, Lithuania",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Utara Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Khan, MNAA (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Dept Accounting & Finance, Skudai, Malaysia.",m-nazli@utm.my; azizi833@uum.edu.my; abbas@management.utm.my; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; arturas.kaklauskas@gmail.com,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Kaklauskas, Artūras/AAC-4058-2019; Mardani, Abbas/D-5700-2015","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Mardani, Abbas/0000-0003-1010-3655; Ismail, Noor Azizi/0000-0001-8139-2971; Kaklauskas, Arturas/0000-0001-9800-9158","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia; Research Management Center (RMC), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia; Faculty of Management, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia; Research Management Center (RMC), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia; Faculty of Management, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia","The financial support for the authors' research from Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia, Research Management Center (RMC), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia and Faculty of Management, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia also appreciated.

The term of sustainable development has also increasingly been used on a micro level. For a business, these practices imply an effort to incorporate the social and environmental issues into the business model while simultaneously achieving long-term business growth and efficiency. The aim of the paper is, based on the analysis of sustainability concept implementation by businesses in selected industries, to identify the underlying motives and barriers to concept implementation in practice. The motives leading to sustainability concept implementation were found by means of comparison with foreign research. Another objective was to underline the most frequently used tools supporting business sustainability in particular areas and as a whole. By means of a hierarchical cluster analysis we provide a more comprehensive view of businesses ' approach to a sustainability concept. Through the objectives of this paper we have formulated six hypotheses. To verify the hypotheses we used the statistical method of analysis. By use of a questionnaire survey, we analyzed 455 businesses belonging to selected industries. The results indicated several options to improve the current state of sustainability implementation which would be beneficial for both businesses as well as the wider environment.

Motor cars are highly conspicuous consumption items that imbue a significant amount of symbolic meaning. Brand personality has been identified as one of the pivotal components of the symbolic attributes assigned to a brand and something that has proved as a useful tool for differentiating a brand from its competitors. The purpose of this study was to determine the Generation Y university students' brand personality perceptions of the Toyota motor car brand. For the study, a sample of 356 Generation Y students aged between 18 and 24 years, registered at the campuses of two South African public higher education institutions was taken. A self-reporting questionnaire consisting of 66 brand personality traits of symbolic products, anchored on a five-point Likert-type scale was used to collect the required data.

The Evolutionary Game of Mind and Society, social psychologist Toshio Yamagishi (2011) states that trust can be viewed as a booster rocket that provides the necessary push for the take-off from the secure ground of committed relations. This article formalizes this idea with the help of a simple game theoretic model. The article looks at a situation where networks of personalized exchange relationships provide assurance against untrustworthy behaviour but reduce the opportunity to profit from trade in larger markets. Assuming that the anonymous market contains both trust-worthy and untrustworthy types, it is demonstrated that mutual trust relations can emerge, even when there is a clear danger of opportunism and the possibility of repeated interaction is ruled out. From a more practical perspective, the model provides an insight into the role trust plays for the decision to transact in networks or markets. It is also demonstrated that networks appear as mixed blessings. Networks reduce the problems arising from incomplete contracts and behavioural risk, but they also restrict individuals' possibility to reap potential gains produced in larger markets.","[Reiersen, Jon] Univ Coll Southeast Norway, Sch Business, POB 4, N-3199 Borre, Norway",University College of Southeast Norway,"Reiersen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Southeast Norway, Sch Business, POB 4, N-3199 Borre, Norway.",jon.reiersen@usn.no,,,,,,,31,8,8,0,4,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Starting from these hypotheses and using an appropriate methodology to identify regional disparities, the authors intend to investigate, reconstitute and forecast the quantitative and qualitative evolution of the tertiary education in the post-communist Romanian system, in the context of a general dynamics disturbed by the continuously decreasing number of the population, by the effects of the selective international labour migration and the recent enforcement of some employment policies in full compliance with the European standards. Based on a set of indicators meant to highlight the degree of integration of graduates on the labour market, our study tries to emphasize not only the segregation level in the labour force market but also the mechanisms that can reduce this discrepancy, as well as the necessity of rethinking the human resource policies in order to adapt them to the new European reality.","[Serban, Raluca Ioana Horea; Istrate, Marinela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Serban, RIH (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",ralusel@yahoo.com,"Istrate, Marinela/AGJ-4476-2022; Marinela, Istrate/GVT-4199-2022",,,,,,20,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,487,501,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_32,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400032,0

With the rising focus on value-based performance measures which are derived from the long-term goal of wealth maximization as opposed to the short-term approach of profit maximization, EVA and FCF are promising indicators. Many past researches have shown that value-based performance indicators (especially EVA) are superior to traditional indicators like EPS, ROE, ROA, etc. Traditional indicators do not capture value creation and since they are accounting based, they can be manipulated by the managers. Therefore using them as firms' performance measure is not in the best interest of the shareholders. The purpose of this study is to understand the various valuebased performance measures and empirically verify the conceptual equivalence of free cash flow (FCF) and economic value added (EVA). For this, a sample of 30 firms listed in BSE SENSEX is taken and their FCF and EVA are calculated for the period of 5 years, from 2011 to 2015. The results of this calculation are analyzed using correlation and regression analysis. The descriptive analysis shows that there is a strong correlation between FCF and EVA. The regression analysis also shows that EVA and FCF are positively related which means that both EVA and FCF give similar results regarding firms' performance. The discounting of appropriately defined cash flows (FCF) is conceptually equivalent to discounting economic profits (EVA) for performance and decision-making process. This study has empirically tested the conceptual equivalence of the two measures.","[Shaikh, Imlak] Management Dev Inst, Gurgaon 122007, Haryana, India",Management Development Institute (MDI),"Shaikh, I (通讯作者)，Management Dev Inst, Gurgaon 122007, Haryana, India.",imlak786@gmail.com,"Shaikh, Imlak/U-5399-2019",,,,,,25,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,527,535,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_34,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400034,0

Using correlations and Granger causality testing we recorded existence of twin deficits in most of EU countries. In several countries we confirmed traditional causality that budget deficit implies current account deficit. In several other countries the opposite, known as current account targeting, was true. In two counties (Spain and Hungary) bi-causality was detected. We consider existence of bi-causality as the most complicated situation in practice. Then it is a real vicious cycle. Policy makers must target both imbalances at the same time, to solve this problem, which can be very difficult. Persistent macroeconomic problems in these two countries confirm our assumption. Our paper extends existing literature by determination of two thresholds for public debt-to-GDP which modify occurrence and risk of twin deficits in the EU countries. These break points were identified via threshold panel data model. Twin deficits problems are not probable for countries with public debt-to-GDP lower than 30.668%. However, risk of this phenomenon is much higher if public debt is from 30.688% to 98.126%. Countries with public debt over 98.126% suffer from high and persistent twin imbalances. Therefore we suggest reconsideration of Maastricht criterion on public debt and its reduction to 30%. Finally we observe contagion effect of twin deficits throughout EU countries regardless their economic performance or the euro area membership which is indirectly triggered also in the case of non-euro area members.","[Sinicakova, Marianna; Sulikova, Veronika] Tech Univ Kosice, Dept Finance, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia; [Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Dept Banking & Investment, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Sinicakova, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Dept Finance, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia.",marianna.sinicakova@tuke.sk; veronika.sulikova@tuke.sk; beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Siničáková, Marianna/AAA-5402-2020; Šuliková, Veronika/AAA-4269-2020","Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Siničáková, Marianna/0000-0001-7551-4231; Šuliková, Veronika/0000-0001-6286-841X",[VEGA 1/0994/15],,The paper was elaborated within the project VEGA 1/0994/15.,,33,31,32,2,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

They are explained by many factors, most important of all the intangible assets which govern the economy of the current times; and their social, economic and political importance cannot be underestimated. So, as a general conclusion we find that billionaires are a distinctive feature of the economy of the 21st century, and that they are here to stay, and, wthin a ever more interdependent world, they will survive as long as they will be considered a force of economic well being,.","[Tome, Eduardo] Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Europeia,"Tomé, E (通讯作者)，Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal.",eduardo.tome@clix.pt,"Tomé, Eduardo LCS/F-2308-2011",,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,1063,1069,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100112,0

However, recent years have witnessed consolidation, stagnation, and, sometimes, decline in the Norwegian express coach market. In this paper, we study this process of rapid growth which turned into gradual decline in Norway. Looking at factors contributing to this development, we investigate intermodal competition with local public transport, air, car and rail; and the effects of increased public-sector involvement - both as a passenger transport provider and as an infrastructure provider. This paper relies on three data sources and methods: 1) National travel survey data2) Historical market dataand 3) Case studies. Our main findings are that, following liberalization, express coach services were mainly established in markets underserved by other modes, where express coaches had lower operating costs as well as generalized costs than the available alternatives. These markets have gradually been provided with better alternative transport services: For the long-distance coach lines, competition from low-cost air carriers has been significant. For shorter lines, improved road infrastructure and rail services have increased competition by private cars and rail. Also, initiatives to increase and improve local public transport have impacted the express coach industry.","[Aarhaug, Jorgen; Farstad, Eivind; Fearnley, Nils; Halse, Askill Harkjerr] All Inst Transport Econ, Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Aarhaug, J (通讯作者)，All Inst Transport Econ, Oslo, Norway.",jaa@toi.no; efa@toi.no; naf@toi.no; ash@toi.no,"Fearnley, Nils/AAE-7449-2020","Fearnley, Nils/0000-0001-5665-0246; Aarhaug, Jorgen/0000-0003-1052-0010; Halse, Askill Harkjerr/0000-0002-0892-4158",,,,,28,7,7,1,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

This attribute-based contingent valuation study elaborated the supply side of potential payments for ecosystem services (PES) mechanism named Landscape and Recreational Values Trading (LRVT), proposed to enhance the provision of amenity values in privately owned forests located in tourism and recreation areas. Using a mail survey data set, we analyzed forest owners' willingness to participate in LRVT and the related compensation claims in the Ruka-Kuusamo area, Finland. We found that more restrictive rules regarding forest management practices decrease the probability of participating and increase forest owners' compensation claims in LRVT. Furthermore, forest owners seem to claim more compensation if, instead of private negotiations, competitive tendering is used to make contracts. Moreover, besides the protection of landscape values, biodiversity protection may be a motive for participation. This indicates that, in addition to improved landscape quality, respondents gain personal benefits from enhanced biodiversity in their own forests. The results can help in designing and implementing a future payment mechanism for the provision of forest landscape and recreational values in terms of how to proceed and whom marketing and recruiting efforts should target.","[Mantymaa, Erkki; Juutinen, Artti; Karhu, Jouni] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Paavo Havaksen Tie 3, FI-90014 Oulu 3, Finland; [Juutinen, Artti] Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Pentti Kaiteran Katu 1, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Tyrvainen, Liisa] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokortanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland; [Kurttila, Mikko] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Yliopistokatu 6, FI-80100 Joensuu, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Oulu; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Mäntymaa, E (通讯作者)，Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, POB 413, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",erkki.mantymaa@luke.fi; artti.juutinen@luke.fi; liisa.tyrvainen@luke.fi; jouni.karhu@luke.fi; mikko.kurttila@luke.fi,,"Juutinen, Artti/0000-0003-4300-5365",EU [633838],EU(European Union (EU)),The authors appreciate the helpful suggestions from anonymous reviewers and the editor.

When multiple cities are in close proximity, empty return trips occurring after taxis drive passengers from one jurisdiction to another results in inefficiency. This source of inefficiency can be eliminated by creating a combined affiliation and letting affiliated taxis pick up passengers in any jurisdiction. Under combined regulation, however, drivers may have an incentive to direct their search in a manner that leads to an allocation of taxis across locations that is not socially optimal. We develop a regulatory exchange market that maintains separate affiliations but provides drivers the ability to exchange the right to pick up passengers in each other's affiliated location. The regulatory exchange market is preferred to both exclusive cruising and combined regulation, and achieves the first-best in a large class of situations.","[Seymour, David Thomas] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Seymour, DT (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",seymour@itu.edu.tr,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0122,2212-0130,,ECON TRANSP,Econ.

The consequences for cross-border trade with Canada were swift and immediate. Following more than a decade of efforts by trade and transportation policymakers in both countries to facilitate greater economic integration and cross-border trade since 9/11, the US administration under Donald Trump may again seek to thicken its border with Canada. This systematic review evaluates 13 years of research on the consequences of post 9/11-border thickening on Canada-US trade and commercial relations. Applying rigorous methods for the conduct of systematic reviews, 19 studies were included in the final analysis and grouped into four analytic themes: aggregate trade, sector, region, and passenger flows. We find that overall bilateral trade was negatively impacted following 9/11 but Canadian economic interests were harmed more seriously than those of the US. We also find differing consequences for cross-border flows according to region, sector and firm size. In addition, efforts focused on border transport policies to mitigate these consequences were effective but underutilized, especially in regions and sectors that did not depend on cross-border integration. Our findings offer important long-term lessons for policymakers on both sides of the border.","[Smith, Matthew J.; Ray, Sayan Basu; Raymond, Aaron; Sienna, Micah; Lilly, Meredith B.] Carleton Univ, Int Affairs, Norman Paterson Sch Int Affairs, 5109 Richcraft Hall, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Lilly, MB (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Int Affairs, Norman Paterson Sch Int Affairs, 5109 Richcraft Hall, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",MattJSmith@cmail.carleton.ca; SayanBasuRay@cmail.carleton.ca; AaronRaymond@cmail.carleton.ca; micahsienna@cmail.carleton.ca; Meredith.lilly@carleton.ca,,"Lilly, Meredith/0000-0003-3012-8390",,,,,29,4,4,2,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Network carriers differentiate themselves by offering higher product quality through lower seat density and more first-class/business class seating. A network carrier's product quality response to other LCCs depends on market overlap. When a considerable overlap exists, network carriers offer higher product quality by reducing seating density and/or increasing the proportion of first-class/business class seats.","[Rupp, Nicholas G.] East Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Mail Stop 580, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Liu, Angela Nian] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University of Chicago,"Rupp, NG (通讯作者)，East Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Mail Stop 580, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.;Liu, AN (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ruppn@ecu.edu; angela.nian.liu@chicagobooth.edu,"Rupp, Nicholas/AAM-7275-2020",,,,,,33,5,5,0,5,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Although promoting competition by competitive tendering to gain efficiency and increase service quality has gradually become common around the world, the applicability of this model in weak institutional environments has some uncertainties. Drawing from new institutional economics (NIE) literature, transaction cost economics (TCE) approach presents important theoretical insights to comprehend the nature of authority and operator relations by underlining the institutional factors that make such procurements effective or not. We argue in this paper that the extent to which transaction structures are embedded in the institutional framework has a substantial impact on the long-run performance of the public transport contracts. A case study of the experience of Istanbul's public bus transport system, a hybrid regime combining the elements of direct award and tendering and composed of both formal and paratransit transport modes, is proposed to support our theoretical arguments. Our study reveals that all-encompassing contractual solutions which do not take into account the broader institutional environment (culture, norms, policy preferences, property rights etc.) may not work as intended, calling for more hybrid solutions, particularly in weak or developing institutional settings.","[Canitez, Fatih] IETT, Istanbuls Publ Bus Operator, Strategy Dev Dept, Istanbul, Turkey; [Celebi, Dilay] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Management Engn, ITU Macka Campus, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Canitez, F (通讯作者)，IETT, Istanbuls Publ Bus Operator, Strategy Dev Dept, Istanbul, Turkey.",fatihcanitez40@gmail.com; celebid@itu.edu.tr,"Çelebi, Dilay/N-9224-2013","Çelebi, Dilay/0000-0002-7103-3868; Canitez, Fatih/0000-0001-6193-3996",,,,,34,5,6,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Following implementation of a policy change in November 2000, both coverage and representativeness of the PatEx data improve substantially. We uncover specific areas that are prone to selectivity issues, by generating statistical evidence across application characteristics such as application type, age, ownership type, domestic or foreign origin, patent family status, and technology class among others. Although our exploration suggests to researchers several categories of specific concern, our findings overall show that the PatEx data are generally representative of the population of patent applications filed in the United States after November 2000 across observable characteristics.","[Graham, Smart J.

The relationship, if any, has implications for transit-oriented-development and the viability of different transit modes serving suburban areas. This paper examines pedestrian catchment areas and LOS across a light rail, a metro rail and two bus corridors in Dublin. Public transport users have been surveyed at 17 stops around the city and their trip origin identified. Catchment areas for bus services with high levels of service were found to be comparable and often greater than those for LRT or metro rail. 65% of all bus trip-origins are more than 500 m from stops. A standard distance analysis suggests natural catchment limits of over 1400 m for high quality bus, significantly greater than light rail and metro rail of similar service levels. The shape of transit catchment areas are also distinctive and appear to be most influenced by: network density, stopping patterns, urban gravity and quality of service. While further analysis is recommended, public transport users in Dublin city and suburbs appear more influenced by level-of-service than by modal type when deciding how far they are prepared to walk to public transport.","[O'Connor, David] Dublin Inst Technol, Sch Transport Engn Environm & Planning, Dublin 1, Ireland; [Caulfield, Brian] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"O'Connor, D (通讯作者)，Dublin Inst Technol, Sch Transport Engn Environm & Planning, Dublin 1, Ireland.",david.oconnor@dit.ie; brian.caulfield@tcd.ie,"Caulfield, Brian/GYU-3314-2022","Caulfield, Brian/0000-0003-3877-475X",,,,,30,9,9,2,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

These contracts employ 100 percent of payments to operators depending on the number of boarding and paying passengers. Using mostly monthly data, outcomes in E20-contracts in four areas (formerly governed by gross cost contracts) over three years are compared with outcomes in the years before the E20 contracts were implemented, and with two gross contracts running parallel to the E20 contract. Compared with gross cost operators in comparison areas, E20 operators performed better in terms of costs, customer satisfaction (initially worse but then better), punctuality, and canceled departures, but worse in number of departures and no better in number of passengers.","[Pyddoke, Roger] VTI, Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Pyddoke, Roger] K2, Bruksgatan 8, SE-22236 Lund, Sweden; [Lindgren, Hanna] Transportstyrelsen, S-17106 Solna, Sweden",VTI,"Pyddoke, R (通讯作者)，VTI, Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",roger.pyddoke@vti.se; hanna.lingren@transportstyrelsen.se,,"Pyddoke, Roger/0000-0001-7976-5628",Stockholm Region RPTA (Trafikforvaltningen Stockholms lans landsting); K2-The Swedish Knowledge Center for Public Transport,Stockholm Region RPTA (Trafikforvaltningen Stockholms lans landsting); K2-The Swedish Knowledge Center for Public Transport,"Financial support from the Stockholm Region RPTA (Trafikforvaltningen Stockholms lans landsting) and from K2-The Swedish Knowledge Center for Public Transport is gratefully acknowledged.

Further analysis reveals that, although the overall level of financial support for the public transport is very high in Switzerland, subsidies per passenger are comparatively low. It is a similar story in cities in England with very successful bus operators. Public transport in Switzerland is a public service provided mostly by companies in public ownership. Due to the lack of competitive pressure one would expect a rather moderate focus on passengers and innovations, if any at all, as well as lower levels of efficiency. The opposite is true. Based on qualitative interviews, the model developed for the explanation of this success shows that the framework conditions favour stable, intrinsic motivation on the part of management and employees in public transport. This includes the central elements of: direct democracy, decision-making and budgeting at local level, together with non-commercial, local companies directly involved in the design of the public transport system, as well as a confidence-based management culture both with respect to and within the company. The success factors of the public transport system in Innsbruck (Austria) are structurally quite similar and confirm the explanatory model.","[Schaaffkamp, Christoph] KCW GmbH Strategy & Management Consultancy, Bernburger Str 27, D-10963 Berlin, Germany",,"Schaaffkamp, C (通讯作者)，KCW GmbH Strategy & Management Consultancy, Bernburger Str 27, D-10963 Berlin, Germany.",schaaffkamp@kcw-online.de,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Whilst Thredbo has grown to encompass all topics in transport planning, policy, contracting, financing, data, as well as funding; competition and ownership remains the core focus and the 14 conferences to date constitute a unique resource to chart the conversation and state of the art as it has evolved in both developed and developing economies. Discussion is structured around three eras (the early years, turn of the century and recent developments) and six elements of contracting market arbitration, procurement mechanism, asset ownership, contract design, risk allocation and contract management. What emerges is a shift in interest from deregulated to contracted markets (and back to deregulated to some extent), a renewed focus on institutional performance in line with changing government and community expectations, and an increasing desire to place contracted services within the broader context of land use, well-being and wider economic benefits. Importantly, this paper also covers some landmark ideas which have grown to become key cornerstones of the Thredbo series including the STO (strategic/tactical/operational) framework, regulatory cycles in the bus and rail sectors, as well as trusting partnerships between transport regulators and operators. We conclude with the enduring legacy of the Thredbo series and look with optimism to the future for what the next 30 years of Thredbo may bring to the land passenger transport sector.","[Wong, Yale Z.; Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, ITLS, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Wong, YZ (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, ITLS, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",yale.wong@sydney.edu.au; david.hensher@sydney.edu.au,"Wong, Yale Z/N-9486-2019","Wong, Yale Z/0000-0001-7512-7645; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",,,,,71,16,16,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

The paper uses survey data (N = 1427) collected in eight Beijing neighborhoods. The analysis is carried out by means of principal component analysis and multinomial logistic regression analysis. The respondents were generally more positive towards continuing cycling or cycling more in the future than towards car purchasing. The perceived cycling environment was found to be associated with respondents' attitude towards future cycling and car purchasing. The higher the level of satisfaction with the clarity of cycling space allocation and the higher the agreement with pro-cycling policies, the higher the probability that the respondents will cycle in the future and the lower probability that they will buy a car. Associations with current travel behavior indicate that long everyday travel distances (e.g. 10 km to work or longer) negatively affects the respondents attitude towards their future cycling, whereas short everyday travel distances up to 2 km are positively linked to future cycling prospects. Non-car owners' attitude to future car ownership is strongly linked to socio-demographic status - low education and low income level groups seems to be most unlikely to take up driving in the future. To encourage people to cycle more and drive less, policy should direct efforts to promoting the clarity of cycling space on the street and strengthen pro-cycling policies. Attention should also be given to stabilizing the current travel modes of non-car users, including promoting the image of cycling, improving the service of walking, cycling, public transport and generally by introducing attractive alternatives to private car ownership.","[Zhao, Chunli; Olafsson, Anton Stahl; Carstensen, Trine Agervig; Fertner, Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick] Danish Rd Directorate, Sect Planning & Anal, Niels Juels Gade 13, DK-1022 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Zhao, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.;Nielsen, TAS (通讯作者)，Danish Rd Directorate, Sect Planning & Anal, Niels Juels Gade 13, DK-1022 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",zhao@ign.ku.dk; tasn@vd.dk,"Fertner, Christian/AAQ-1029-2020; Olafsson, Anton/D-1002-2015; Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick/F-1701-2016; Carstensen, Trine Agervig/C-8504-2015","Fertner, Christian/0000-0001-6112-3328; Olafsson, Anton/0000-0002-7940-8126; Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick/0000-0002-6679-4515; Carstensen, Trine Agervig/0000-0002-2133-1621",University of Copenhagen,University of Copenhagen,"This study has been possible due to PhD research grant funded by the University of Copenhagen.

The primary reason for this is that most societies do not save enough and their citizens run out of money during retirement. Aim: This study investigates whether the limitations imposed by Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act of South Africa encourage optimal asset allocation and reduce investment risk for retirement savings when contrasted with discretionary investment. Setting: The study looks at hypothetical individuals who are subject to tax and retirement consequences as administered by South African legislation. Methods: A quantitative risk and return analysis was performed while considering two hypothetical investors who are identical in all aspects other than their choice of investments. Results: The findings indicate that Regulation 28 is effective in reducing the investment risk of retirement savings; however, it may also force the investor to sacrifice wealth. Conclusion: Depending on the tax bracket in which the investor sits, discretionary investment may be preferential to investing in a retirement fund under the mandate of Regulation 28.","[Willows, Gizelle D.; Burgers, Thomas] Univ Cape Town, Coll Accounting, Rondebosch, South Africa; [West, Darron] Univ Cape Town, Dept Finance & Tax, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Willows, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Coll Accounting, Rondebosch, South Africa.",gizelle.willows@uct.ac.za,,"Willows, Gizelle/0000-0002-6922-1966",,,,,41,0,0,0,2,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This paper supplies a new notion of efficiency that allows the lessons to survive, but at the cost of reducing their practical significance.","[Broome, John] Corpus Christi Coll, Oxford OX1 4JF, England",University of Oxford,"Broome, J (通讯作者)，Corpus Christi Coll, Oxford OX1 4JF, England.",john.broome@philosophy.ox.ac.uk,,,ARC Discovery Grant [DP140102468]; ESRC [ES/N009010/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ARC Discovery Grant(Australian Research Council); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I am very grateful for comments I have received from Gustaf Arrhenius, Roger Crisp, Duncan Foley, Reyer Gerlagh, Linus Mattauch, Merritt Randall Hughes, Niko Yaakkola, the other participants at the Nottingham Workshop on Climate Ethics in April 2016, and an anonymous referee.

In recent years, numerous methods have been developed for predicting the solar irradiance or the output of solar renewables. By definition, a forecast is uncertain. Thus, the models developed predict the mean and the associated uncertainty. Comparisons are therefore necessary and useful for assessing the skill and accuracy of these new methods in the field of solar energy. The aim of this paper is to present a comparison of various models that provide probabilistic forecasts of the solar irradiance within a very strict framework. Indeed, we consider focusing on intraday forecasts, with lead times ranging from 1 to 6 h. The models selected use only endogenous inputs for generating the forecasts. In other words, the only inputs of the models are the past solar irradiance data. In this context, the most common way of generating the forecasts is to combine point forecasting methods with probabilistic approaches in order to provide prediction intervals for the solar irradiance forecasts. For this task, we selected from the literature three point forecasting models (recursive autoregressive and moving average (ARMA), coupled autoregressive and dynamical system (CARDS), and neural network (NN)), and seven methods for assessing the distribution of their error (linear model in quantile regression (LMQR), weighted quantile regression (WQR), quantile regression neural network (QRNN), recursive generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCHrls), sieve bootstrap (SB), quantile regression forest (QRF), and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT)), leading to a comparison of 20 combinations of models. None of the model combinations clearly outperform the others; nevertheless, some trends emerge from the comparison. First, the use of the clear sky index ensures the accuracy of the forecasts. This derived parameter permits time series to be deseasonalized with missing data, and is also a good explanatory variable of the distribution of the forecasting errors. Second, regardless of the point forecasting method used, linear models in quantile regression, weighted quantile regression and gradient boosting decision trees are able to forecast the prediction intervals accurately.

Variation in the stock price or the financial ratio is used as the dependent variable of either short- or long-term effectiveness to evaluate the variance both before and after asset restructuring. The result is varied. It is necessary to develop a foresight approach for the mixed situation. This work pioneers to forecast effectiveness of asset restructuring with a rebalanced and clustered support vector machine (RCS). The profitability variation 1year before and after asset restructuring is used as the dependent variable. The current financial indicators of the year of asset restructuring are used as independent variables. Specially treated listed companies are used as research samples, as they frequently adopt asset restructuring. In modeling, the skew distribution of samples achieving and failing to achieve performance improvement with asset restructuring is handled with rebalancing. The similar experienced knowledge of asset restructuring to the current asset restructuring is filtered out with clustering. With the help from rebalancing and clustering, a support vector machine is constructed for prediction, together with other forecasting models of multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, probit regression, and case-based reasoning. These models' standalone modes are used as benchmarks. The empirical results demonstrate the applicability of the RCS for forecasting effectiveness of asset restructuring.","[Li, Hui] Nankai Univ, Coll Tourism & Serv Management, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Hong, Lu-Yao] Tobacco Monopoly Adm Tiantai, Dept Business, Taizhou 317200, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Mo, Yu-Chang] Huaqiao Univ, Sch Math Sci, Quanzhou 362021, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Bang-Zhu] JiNan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chang, Pei-Chann] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Informat Management, Chunli 32026, Taiwan",Nankai University; China National Tobacco Corporation; Huaqiao University; Jinan University; Yuan Ze University,"Li, H (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Coll Tourism & Serv Management, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.",lihuihit@live.cn,"Li, Hui/G-6408-2011","Li, Hui/0000-0002-5822-2795",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571167],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 71571167",,72,6,6,3,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

I employ various waves of a longitudinal survey to construct a panel of individual migration and labour supply histories, and match them to detailed weather information, which I use to instrument agricultural productivity. For identification, I exploit the year-by-county variation in growing season rainfalls to explain within-individual changes in labour allocation. Data on days of work supplied to each sector allow to study the responses to weather shocks along both the participation and the intensive margin. Results suggest that farming is reduced by 4.5% and migration increased by about 5% in response to a 1 standard deviation negative rainfall shock. Increase in rural-urban migration derives from both longer spells in the city and from increment in the likelihood to participate in the urban sector. I find interesting heterogeneous response across generations driven by age-specific productivities in the different sectors and migration costs. Finally, land tenure insecurity seems to partially prevent households from freely reallocating labour away from farming in bad times.","[Minale, Luigi] Univ Carlos III Madrid, CReAM, IZA, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Minale, L (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, CReAM, IZA, Madrid, Spain.",lminale@eco.uc3m.es,,"MINALE, LUIGI/0000-0002-4570-7670","Ministerio Economia y Competitividad (Spain), Maria de Maeztu grant [MDM 2014-0431]; Comunidad de Madrid, MadEco-CM grant [S2015/HUM-3444]","Ministerio Economia y Competitividad (Spain), Maria de Maeztu grant; Comunidad de Madrid, MadEco-CM grant(Comunidad de Madrid)","I am grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for comments and suggestions.

Using a sample of 15 East Asian port cities from 4 East Asian economies between 2000 and 2014, this paper employs panel cointegration techniques to quantitatively investigate the co-movement relationships between seaport throughput and the economic development of port cities, shedding further light on the precise role that seaport throughput has in port city economic development. The estimation results support the cointegrated relationship and confirm the existence of co-movement between seaport throughput and port city economic growth. The panel fully modified ordinary least squares estimation and dynamic ordinary least squares also indicate that seaport throughput positively impacts economic growth. This evidence highlights the important role of marine transportation and seaport development, which is consistent with previous findings in the literature; however, relatively few studies investigate whether there exists a bi-directional relationship between economic growth and seaport throughput in East Asian port cities. Our empirical findings offer important policy implications for the sample port cities.","[Feng, Gen-Fu; Wang, Quan-Jing; Wen, Jun; Dong, Minyi] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Shih Chien University,"Chang, CP (通讯作者)，Shih Chien Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",cpchang@g2.usc.edu.tw,"Wen, Jun/N-8547-2016","Wen, Jun/0000-0002-7544-1076",,,,,62,6,6,11,56,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Then, an analysis is conducted so as to determine the effect of such a treatment on the percentage of cases ruled in favour of the dismissed worker. The data used in the research are taken from the information recorded at court level provided by the statistics kept by the General Council of the Spanish Judiciary. A total of 2888 observations were available, corresponding to the period spanning 2004 to 2012. As regards the findings, it may be concluded that there is a significant positive impact on the number of dismissal cases ruled in favour of workers when incumbent judges are not acting alone in their court, particularly when the incumbent judge solves cases together with another professional judge.","[Malo, Miguel A.] Univ Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; [Martin-Roman, Angel; Moral, Alfonso] Univ Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain",University of Salamanca; Universidad de Valladolid,"Martín-Román, A (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain.",angellm@eco.uva.es,"Martin-Roman, Angel/J-8089-2014; Moral, Alfonso/K-6776-2014; Malo, Miguel Ángel/B-5160-2017","Martin-Roman, Angel/0000-0002-4777-4324; Moral, Alfonso/0000-0001-5462-8133; Malo, Miguel Ángel/0000-0002-1057-8397",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-52343-P]; FEDER funds; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSO2015-69439-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FEDER funds(European Union (EU)); Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"The Angel Martin-Roman was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under project ECO2014-52343-P, co-financed by FEDER funds.

Employees' (i.e., the owners of the acquired skills) bargaining power depends on their skill sets, which differentiate their ability to hold up production and threaten to leave a firm. When a firm cannot meaningfully elicit skill investments through job design, it will pursue inefficient multitasking to reduce production holdups or inefficient specialization to prevent skilled employees from leaving.

Aim: The research question was how Soweto small retailers make inventory decisions to promote their income growth and age of the business. For this study, a descriptive research design was followed. Setting: The universe of the study comprised all the formal small, medium and microenterprises located in Soweto township. Methods: Using probability sampling, the sample size was set at 650 businesses. Of the 650 completed questionnaires, the responses of 297 respondents operating in the retail grocery and retail general stores sectors were analysed quantitatively using exploratory factor analyses, cluster analysis and cross-tabulation. Results: This study showed that being more inclined to proactively maintain a high level of inventory could result in positive business performance in terms of both growth in income and age. Younger businesses (less than 5 years) could grow if they decide to stock up on sale items, purchase more items for sale, provide for customers' fluctuating demands and buy more stock to save on transport costs. Purchasing less or the exact amount of stock as what can be sold within a month could be detrimental to the performance of general and grocery retailers in Soweto. Conclusions: The results also show that if retailers want to grow and exist for 5 years and more, they should consider both proactively maintaining a high level of inventory and doing so with ease. In this study, the older (5 years and older) business groups were mostly owned by older people, who showed a tendency to establish themselves in stand-alone shops or smaller shopping centres. Older businesses also tend to buy stock daily or weekly, or when stock is low. These older businesses without income growth were mostly family businesses who displayed contentment with the status quo of business performance and seemed to lack entrepreneurial skills.","[Cilliers, J.

Interesting insights are added by applying a data envelopment analysis to rank the efficiency of the rail segments considering the different standpoints of three stakeholders: infrastructure manager, rail operators and rail regulator. The results of the case study, beside showing different patterns by applying the two charges schemes, suggest that high-speed services may better respond to the needs of infrastructure manager and rail regulator while the rail operator's perspective ranks better short connections by regional trains (especially under the new regime).

We construct three scenarios: perfect enforcement, imperfect enforcement, and collusion. We show that when the local government imperfectly enforces the regulation, the firm's utility and the local government's utility are higher, whereas the degree of the firm's compliance, consumers' utility, and the level of social welfare are lower. When there is collusion between the local government and the firm, the firm's utility and the local government's utility are the highest, but the degree of the firm's compliance, consumers' utility, and the level of social welfare are the lowest among the different scenarios. This study proves that the behavior of governments and firms plays a vital role in the effectiveness of quality standards regulation.","[Pu, Xujin; Song, Zhiping] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Han, Guanghua] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Han, GH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",hanguanghua@sjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371086, 71501128]; Six Talent Peak Project of Jiangsu Province [JY-012]; Fifth Project 333 Project of Jiangsu Province [BRA2016412]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Six Talent Peak Project of Jiangsu Province; Fifth Project 333 Project of Jiangsu Province,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 71371086 and 71501128; Six Talent Peak Project of Jiangsu Province, Grant/Award Number: JY-012; Fifth Project 333 Project of Jiangsu Province, Grant/Award Number: BRA2016412",,30,1,1,2,33,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

In Argentina this is closely linked to the extraordinary boom in soybean production. Our paper critically analyses the Argentinian variant of neostructuralism, putting emphasis on the soy industry which accounts for an important part of the country's economy. After discussing the neostructuralist economic development paradigm more generally, we analyse its particular application to Argentinian agribusiness. We do so by focusing on the social contradictions that arise from the policies of the Kirchner administrations. Conceptually we approach sojicazion in terms of agricultural policy, socioeconomic development, and its ideological-discursive quality. Among the key aspects of the soy boom we identify a far-reaching reconfiguration of production, economic concentration and financialization of Argentinian agriculture. We ask for the implications for everyday economic and social life in the Argentinian countryside and emphasize the radical revaluation of agricultural land. Here, developments include a far-reaching reordering of social structures in the agrarian heartland, increasingly precarious working conditions, and processes of violent dispossession in the northwestern Chaco region. We conclude that commodity- based neostructuralism in Argentina has not been able to deliver the type of socially inclusive growth promised by political elites. Rather, dominant actors that already profit most from agribusiness were able to further expand and consolidate their position in the South American country.","[Berndt, Christian; Bernhold, Christin] Univ Zurich, Geog Inst, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Berndt, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Geog Inst, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",christian.berndt@geo.uzh.ch,,,,,,,64,2,2,0,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

To investigate causality, we exploit the event of plant closure as an exogenous trigger of job switching. In this case, we find no significantly positive effect of job changes on job satisfaction.

Three key findings arise from the research. First, life cycle and demographic characteristics, such as marital status, education, and income, continue to be strong predictors of homeownership. Married households with a college degree and children are among the most likely to own a home. Second, young adults with student loan debt are no more or less likely to own a home than someone without debt after controlling for a number of factors; however, students who have already paid off their loans are more likely to own a home. Finally, respondents who express a willingness to take risks in finances are more likely to own a home while those who are more conscientious are less likely to own a home.","[Letkiewicz, Jodi C.] York Univ, Sch Adm Studies, N York, ON, Canada; [Heckman, Stuart J.] Kansas State Univ, Sch Family Studies & Human Serv, Personal Financial Planning, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",York University - Canada; Kansas State University,"Letkiewicz, JC (通讯作者)，York Univ, Sch Adm Studies, N York, ON, Canada.",jodilet@yorku.ca; sheckman@ksu.edu,,"Letkiewicz, Jodi/0000-0001-7783-1871",,,,,63,17,35,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Despite the fluctuation in the stock prices in the market, the engagements of appropriate stock fundamentals by the investors could guarantee positive returns in the market.

In the study, the methods employed were Descriptive Statistics and Pooled Ordinary Least Square. The model measured both the Fixed and Random Effects of the variables, however, the Hausman test of 39.78 with p-value of 0.0000 is significant at 5% level, thus the coefficients of Fixed Effect (FE) models are recommended for prediction of stock prices in the NSE.

Such decision-making has been beneficial for most of the human existence, where the decision-making dilemma stood mostly between run away or fight, and it was essential to decide as quickly as possible. That's why the human brain is set to make your decision as simple as possible. However, we currently still need to make quick decisions, not as important as in the past thought, but it more depends on the quality of our decisions. Nevertheless, achieving a good understanding of people is preventing certain characteristics of our thinking, which behavioral economics calls behavioral prejudices. The aim of this paper is to introduce individual behavioral prejudices and to describe their influence on human thinking and decision making. If human capital is to develop across societies, we can not rely only on knowledge acquisition, but also on the development of our ability to understand the acquired knowledge and to derive qualified decisions from them. Thus, in the development of human capital, there is a substantial distinction between acquiring knowledge and skills or competencies.

Among the most commonly used methods to economically evaluate the environmental effects, contingent valuation is particularly frequent. Despite its wide applicability, its external validity is in many instances questioned. This paper explores the connection between preference uncertainty, risk attitudes and hypothetical bias, using a survey of Brazilian citizens concerning the local environmental impacts of a renewable energy power plant. Risk preferences were elicited on a 10-point scale controlling for context; certainty regarding stated willingness-to-pay was also measured on a 10-point scale. Results show that both risk attitudes and certainty levels are positively associated with respondents' willingness-to-pay values, and that their effect is independent. In addition, if it is assumed that certainty levels in responses expresses preference uncertainty (through different variances), then risk attitudes are no longer statistically significant. This exploratory study calls for the consideration of risk attitudes and certainty levels in valuation studies, in particular when hypothetical bias is a concern, thus suggesting future applications and replications of these results.","[Costa Pinto, Ligia M.; Valente, Marieta] Univ Minho, Escola Econ & Gestao, NIPE, Gualtar, Portugal; [Silva, Sael] Univ Minho, Escola Econ & Gestao, Gualtar, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Pinto, LMC (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Gualtar, Portugal.",Pintol@eeg.uminho.pt,"Pinto, Lígia/AAC-3057-2019; Valente, Marieta/J-8407-2016; Pinto, Lígia/R-6430-2019","Valente, Marieta/0000-0003-3332-8945; Pinto, Lígia/0000-0001-7089-2663",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,UNIV MINHO,GUIMARAES,"CAMPUS AZUREM, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL",2183-3974,,978-989-97050-8-1,ICOPEV INT C PROJ EC,,,2018,,,,,,,168,171,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN0TO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000473533800028,0

However, one limitation of current crowdfunding platforms is that it is hard for creators and backers to anticipate the success of a campaign. This paper tackles this limitation. We take a two-pronged approach to building our forecasting model. First, we explore the nature and heterogeneity of contribution dynamics in crowdfunding campaigns and compare them across two natural groups (successful and unsuccessful campaigns). We then use insights generated from our exploratory analysis and draw upon the general laws of motion for stochastic processes in order to introduce a new dynamic model for predicting crowdfunding outcomes. Our model incorporates the history and dynamics of both the focal crowdfunding campaign and other campaigns for predicting outcomes. We compare our model to other parametric and semi-parametric benchmark models, and show substantial improvements. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This research is very useful for banking sector because it is expected to be able to assess the performance of Islamic Banking that has been less examined; because more research are focusing on non-Sharia or conventional banking. Capital adequacy is one of the variables that is used as a variable in measuring banking performance as reflected in the banking valuation component. Using Capital adequacy ratio (CAR) to measure capital ratios, means the amount of own capital needed to cover the risk of losses that may arise from asset investment risk. Liquidity is one of the tools used to assess the health of banks, in order to anticipate financial obligations that are soon due by granting loans to people in need. Data collection in this study was carried out using secondary data using financial report data and annual reports of Islamic banking companies from 2011-2015. Data is obtained on the official website of the Islamic banking company. Based on the statistical test results, the capital adequacy (CAR) have a significant negative effect on the financial performance of Islamic banking (ROA) because the regression transformation coefficient value is -2.508 and the value of Sig 0.04 < 0.05. The negative effect indicates that the higher the bank's capital, the lower the profit if the risk-weighted assets are also high. Likewise, the Liquidity (FDR) variable has no significant negative effect on the financial performance of Islamic banking (ROA) because the regression coefficient value is -1.766.","[Halmawati] Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Padang,"Halmawati (通讯作者)，Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia.",titianluthan@fe.unp.ac.id,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-703-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,64,,,,,,27,35,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9GP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470910100004,0

The term Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) started its infancy stage in early 2007 when citizens have broad access to social media networks such as Twitter. In 2009, Twitter released the location service that enables its users to publish tweets with latitude and longitude. The availability of this ubiquitous and location-acquisition technology allows tagging of location information and hence, a collection of location-based Twitter data. However, noisy data from users through this media service need to go through the processes particularly text analytics and data visualization to make the data understandable and representable for scientific usages and sense-making. This paper surveys the techniques underlying the analytics processes in Twitter data by studying and comparing the techniques used in selected research papers in between 2011 and 2016, before producing the taxonomies for the techniques. Classification of the techniques is conducted by creating different sub-sets of different categorization. This taxonomy is to provide a classification of usages and its potential usages, particularly for location-based data.

To eliminate this, an attempt was made to propose a model that would eliminate the time-consuming and not always correct procedure for dividing the costs for fixed and variables. In this regard, the goal of the study is: to develop an economic and mathematical model that could include absolute characteristics of the economic activity of an enterprise taking into account the existing national taxation system. The tasks of formalizing the national taxation system were solved to achieve this goal, and restrictions were imposed on the ownership of the property used for making profit. A cost management model is developed as a result of the studies carried out in which the fixed and variable costs are replaced by the company's expenses related to the payment for services of third-party organizations and the payment for labor of employees.

This work addresses the question of how forecast-error-based estimation can be performed if there are very few errors available for the new forecast horizons. It extends the results of knuppel (2014) in order to relax the condition on the data structure that is required for the SUR estimator to be independent of unknown quantities. It turns out that the SUR estimator of the forecast uncertainty, which estimates the forecast uncertainty for all horizons jointly, tends to deliver large efficiency gains relative to the OLS estimator (i.e., the sample mean of the squared forecast errors for each individual horizon) in the case of increased forecast horizons. The SUR estimator is applied to the forecast errors of the Bank of England, the US Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the FOMC. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters.

It means that the indicators selected to measure the performance of hospitals were aggregated at the regional level (a level of 16 Polish provinces). As the hospitals are a critical part of the healthcare system, they are increasingly the subject of analyses aimed at defining, measuring, and improving their performance. Therefore, in the methodology part, we present the DEA as the method for efficiency measurement together with its advantages and limitations. The study attempts to find out which provinces can be used as models and illustrated the areas where inefficient units need to be improved. The hospital input measures included are the Average time of hospitalisation (in days), Average costs of day hospital treatment. The output measures included are the Average number of patients per bed per year, the Share of accredited hospitals as a proportion of the number of all hospitals, net profit per physician. The DEA models are solved using the computer program Frontier Analyst, Version 4. We found that five provinces were efficient and eleven were not, where the efficiency score varied from 76.2% to 100%. Provinces such as Lower Silesia Province, Lublin Province, Lubuskie Province, Swietokrzyskie Province, and Warmia-Masuria Province were the best performers in that they maximised both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. The identification of the strongest and the weakest within provinces could be beneficial in improving the efficiency and performance of the hospitals. The result identifies the inefficient provinces that can improve their efficiency by making the efficient provinces as their role model.

The study aims to extend our understanding of export performance determinants by examining the relationship between different uses of ICT and export activity of firms for a range of European countries and doing this for a sample of larger manufacturing as well as service firms. A probit regression is used to examine whether firms that have a website, support online transactions or have a higher proportion of employees with access to broadband internet are more likely to export than similar firms that do not, controlling for a wide range of firm characteristics. This study is based on harmonized firm-level data provided by statistical offices of 11 EU countries to which the same empirical model was applied, providing results that are fully comparable across countries. The findings suggest heterogeneity amongst countries and specific characteristics of service firms. Whereas in some of the countries e-sales are being positively associated with the probability of exporting for firms from both sectors, having a website is only relevant for manufacturing firms and broadband-Internet-enabled employees are only relevant for service firms.

The sample of this research is 150 employees from the total population of 227 employees. Data were extracted through questionnaires containing 42 statements then processed using IBM SPSS v. 22 for Windows and Microsoft Office Excel 2013. Data were analyzed using path analysis method. The result of the analysis is the influence value of independent variables of corporate internal communication using WhatsApp application either done vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on the dependent variable of employee performance is 35.3%. It shows that corporate internal communication done vertically, horizontally, and diagonally using WhatsApp instant messaging application as the media has simultaneously and partially significant effect on employee performance. In accordance with the research result, it is suggested that employees need to be more active to communicate the problems faced in the work clearly so knowledge sharing can occur to solve the problem and good cooperation can be improved to achieve corporate's goals. And for further research, it is recommended to explore other variables uncovered yet in this research, such as organizational culture, work environment, etc. Research on corporate internal communication toward employee performance can also be done in companies of other fields, for example in banking, mining industry, and so forth.","[Listyorini, Melinda Devyna] Telkom Univ, Sch Econ & Business, Magister Business Management Dept, Bandung, Indonesia; [Susanty, Ade Irma] Telkom Univ, Sch Commun & Business, Dept Business Adm, Bandung, Indonesia",Telkom University; Telkom University,"Listyorini, MD (通讯作者)，Telkom Univ, Sch Econ & Business, Magister Business Management Dept, Bandung, Indonesia.",melindadevyna@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id,"Susanty, Ade Irma Irma/F-3082-2019",,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-723-2,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,65,,,,,,815,819,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN2FA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000476673700170,0

The econometric analysis has shown significant results that confirm our three hypotheses which are: Innovation is affected by the knowledge intensity; Innovation is affected by the characteristics of the firm and finally Innovation is affected by the environment of the firm. The results indicate that large firms are better places for innovation. Also, the education level of the workers and their skills are inducing factors for successful innovations. The policy implications of the findings are that firms should make the significant factors their top priorities in their quest to boost innovation.","[Lv, Kangjuan; Zheng, Xiaosong] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, 20 Cheng Zhong Rd, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China; [Ndiaya, Cisse] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, 99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; Shanghai University,"Zheng, XS (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, 20 Cheng Zhong Rd, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China.",lvkangjuan@shu.edu.cn; ndiayacisse42@outlook.fr; xiaosong.zheng@shu.edu.cn,"Zheng, Xiaosong/AAN-7934-2021",,Natural Science Foundation of China [71774108],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is partly supported by the grants of the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71774108),,36,1,1,1,7,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

For this purpose, we suggest using as a starting point the so-called Combinatorial Knowledge Bases approach, which allows merging concepts about micro practices and macro contexts in an effective way. The suggested framework pays attention to different phases in the entire innovation process, characterised by different (micro) learning modes, situated in varying (macro) contexts and delineated by organisational (meso-level) choices, therefore enabling an integrated approach to the studying of firm innovation. To illustrate the potentials of applying the framework we present a process-oriented in-depth empirical case study of an innovation, following it from idea generation to market introduction by means of an innovation biography method.","[Manniche, Jesper] Ctr Reg & Tourism Res, Nexo, Denmark; [Testa, Stefania] Genova Univ, Dept Mech Energy Management & Transport Engn, Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa,"Manniche, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Reg & Tourism Res, Nexo, Denmark.",manniche@crt.dk,"testa, stefania/ISU-1321-2023","testa, stefania/0000-0002-4067-8110",,,,,111,17,17,4,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Not only do the new nobles hold the power of wealth but, through mega-giving, they generate a moral imagery akin to religious figures who ostensibly self-sacrifice for the good of everyone else. This generates a form of charismatic authority that affords the super-rich an influential space from which to spread a theodicy of privilege' - shielding growing wealth concentration from criticism and sanctifying the claim that individual mega-wealth is collectively beneficial. Through its contribution to and facilitation of the inegalitarian status quo, this theodicy engenders various forms of structural violence. Here we explore the mechanisms that enable wealthy donors to position themselves as apparent benefactors of humanity, including a reliance on metrics that appear to justify the claim that targeted philanthropic expenditures can and are reducing global wealth and health inequalities, but which raise unanswered questions surrounding the actual effects of the outcomes claimed.","[McGoey, Linsey; Thiel, Darren] Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"McGoey, L (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",lmcgoey@essex.ac.uk; djthiel@essex.ac.uk,"thiel, darren/GQZ-1552-2022","Thiel, Darren/0000-0003-4531-5420",,,,,89,29,31,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Proper financial reporting could increase the management capacity in safeguarding these valuable possessions by providing useful information for decision making and management discharge of accountability. In this study we focus on investigating the significance of financial reporting information for the HM practice. We assess how accounting standards comply with user-needs. For this purpose, a measurement tool; disclosure index is developed to identify and assess the significance of financial reporting information for HM. The index is tested quantitatively and qualitatively in Egypt for its huge bequest of heritage. Our results indicate that four financial reporting dimensions of HA; namely performance, accountability, disclosure and narrative are significant for HM, comprising 18 financial reporting items. While the recognition and measurement dimension is found insignificant to the managerial practice. On the international context, the study contributes to the current debate; determining the appropriate accounting treatment for heritage assets. This is by identifying user-needs which is the base for determining financial reporting objective. On the country context of Egypt, the results revealed that the appropriate accounting basis for HA is the modified accrual.","[Noaman, Nabiela; Christiaens, Johan] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Publ Governance Management & Finance, Ghent, Belgium; [Ouda, Hassan] German Univ Cairo, Fac Management Technol, Dept Accounting & Finance, New Cairo, Egypt",Ghent University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); German University in Cairo,"Noaman, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Publ Governance Management & Finance, Ghent, Belgium.",Nabiela.noaman@ugent.be; Hassan.ouda@guc.edu.eg; Johan.christiaens@ugent.be,"Christiaens, Johan/AAC-9962-2019; Noaman, Nabila/O-3178-2017","Noaman, Nabila/0000-0002-6397-2371",,,,,54,3,4,1,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The research substantiates the choice and algorithm for assessing the criteria for factor analysis of the European Union investment attractiveness on the basis of innovation activity, human capital, private capital, public capital, regional availability, and gross regional product. A model for formation the main features of investment clusters and stages of its calculation is proposed by the authors. The main investment peculiarities include patent activity, research and development costs, education level index, employment rate, labour force, industrial investment, budget expenditures, per capita budget expenditures, regional availability, and gross regional product per capita. In the process of calculating the clustering of the European Union regions, the mathematical and statistical methods of analysis and the applied statistical analysis package of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) have been used. As a result of the data obtained, 28 European countries have been divided into 8 clusters. For each cluster, the directions for an effective investment policy formation have been determined.","[Orlova, Nataliia; Marukhlenko, Oksana] Borys Grinchenko Kyiv Univ, Kiev, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Borys Grinchenko Kyiv Metropolitan University,"Orlova, N (通讯作者)，Borys Grinchenko Kyiv Univ, Kiev, Ukraine.",nsorlova78@gmail.com; o.marukhlenko@kubg.edu.ua,"Orlova, Nataliia/Z-1800-2018; Марухленко, Оксана В'ячеславівна/KAO-3259-2024","Orlova, Nataliia/0000-0003-0785-751X; Марухленко, Оксана В'ячеславівна/0000-0001-8050-6615",,,,,14,1,1,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,302,313,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553200026,0

The growing demand for housing was not followed by adequate supply, resulting in a dynamic increase in property prices. Currently in 2017, housing prices are once again on a long-term upswing. After the real estate buble breaks, the price falls and converges to the equilibrium price. This decline has a negative impact on the banking sector, as capital deposited in bank mortgage is seriously im paired, causing problems for the entire banking sector. Complications in the banking sector often mean serious complications and losses for the entire economic system and start of the economic crisis.

One of the main causes for this 2007-started crisis was bad risk management of credit defaults in financing real estates. This paper examines the impact of interest rates and macroeconomic indicators on credit default rates. The research proposes a model that proves that the relationship between different predictor variables such as mortgage interest rates and macroeconomic indicators on the response variable of credit defaults are strong. The method is descriptive and inferential experimental research by collecting secondary data in different markets and by analysing these data for correlations and for bivariate and multivariate linear regressions. The research gives the evidence that the macroeconomic indicators have a higher impact on credit defaults than mortgage interest rates. The scientific research on this theme led to nearly the same result in different markets. The unemployment rate is the most responsible predictor variable for the credit defaults. It is very necessary for the involved stakeholders (borrowers and lenders) to keep the view on macroeconomic indicators but especially on the unemployment rate. The lenders can avoid credit defaults when unemployment rates are growing by not increasing interest rates at these times. The borrowers should use times with personally better circumstances for increasing their repayment rates. The financial markets need more regulation and control, and it needs a change of the market culture in the points of business ethics and morality.","[Pfalz, Reimar] Univ Latvia, Fac Business Management & Econ, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Pfalz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Fac Business Management & Econ, Riga, Latvia.",plc_rem_fm@yahoo.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,2,RTU PRESS,RIGA,"RIGA TECHNICAL UNIV, KALKI ST 1-121, RIGA, LATVIA",,2661-5533,978-9934-22-141-5,RTU INT SCI CON ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,79,89,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BR6LF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000661874700010,0

Drawing on feminist critiques of biopolitics, the paper proposes reproduction as a missing link that ties Becker's homo economicus to the aggregate question of population. It argues that Becker's work challenged macroeconomic theories of fertility by figuring reproduction, and hence population patterns, as governed by the personal utility-maximizing decisions of individuals. It further examines how his approach to fertility inaugurated reproductive decision-making as a regulatory node of population quality, one also tied to a particular sex, race and class politics. Finally, the paper briefly analyses the relationship between Becker's contribution and today's focus on women's reproductive and productive decision-making in population governance in the context of development.","[Repo, Jemima] Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Repo, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",jemima.repo@ncl.ac.uk,,"Repo, Jemima/0000-0001-7598-6589","Academy of Finland [285830, 268181]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [285830, 268181] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),This research was supported by the Academy of Finland [grant numbers 285830 and 268181].,,81,12,12,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

To achieve these objectives, it was developed a quantitative, observational and cross-sectional study involving a survey conducted among the workers of a medium-sized municipality located in the northeast of Portugal. The correlations were tested by using Spearman's statistic test for a level of significance of 5%. From the 71 workers surveyed, 28 had already been absent from their workplace. The main causes stated by workers to justify their absence were sickness, short (14.1) and long-term (7%), family caregiving (12.7%), and others (8.5%). The existence of a correlation between absenteeism and job satisfaction was not proved. However, correlations were observed between job satisfaction and type of work (Sig.<.05). Although no statistically significant correlation was found between job satisfaction and absenteeism, there are some factors associated with the type of work and with workers' attitudes, behaviours and goals which showed to be correlated to job satisfaction. Therefore, it is recommendable that middle and executive managers continue to improve such conditions so as to increase the productivity, quality and efficiency of the service provided to citizens by council workers.","[Ribeiro, Maria I.

The advantageous treatment of housing is provided especially by a personal income tax if owner-occupiers do not report imputed rents as income but can deduct mortgage interest costs. This preferred tax status is justified by the existence of positive externalities and a desire to enhance housing opportunities available to citizens. However, evidence that the housing policy via the taxation achieves its objectives is still weak. Moreover the tax provisions for the homeownership benefit rather higher-income households. Furthermore there are indications that the housing taxation encourages levered property purchases and thus contributes to the household debt growth. Since the household indebtedness can have adverse effects on households and macroeconomic performance we focused on the issue whether the income tax relief for homeowners that finance their dwellings via a mortgage does affect the household leverage. We constructed the variable capturing especially the mortgage interest payments deductibility. We employed the multiple regression and data for the former 15 EU member countries (except Greece) for the period 2004-2013. We estimated two models for two representative taxpayers who vary in a family status using the panel data analysis with fixed effects. From our results we inferred that the income tax relief for the homeownership might not have influenced the mortgage leverage significantly in the selected European countries in the given period. The mortgage debt was affected rather by the economic level, price of own housing, mortgage interest payments or demographic structure.","[Slintakova, Barbora; Klazar, Stanislav] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Publ Finance, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Slintáková, B (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Publ Finance, Prague, Czech Republic.",barbora@vse.cz; klazar@vse.cz,"Klazar, Stanislav/C-4619-2008","Klazar, Stanislav/0000-0002-6655-8205; Slintakova, Barbora/0000-0002-7412-479X","Czech Science Foundation [GA14-17777S]; Faculty and Accounting, University of Economics, Prague [IP 100040]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Faculty and Accounting, University of Economics, Prague","Our research is one of outputs of the research project No. GA14-17777S, Private and Public Debt - A Balance Sheet Analysis of Economic Sectors, supported by the Czech Science Foundation.

We identify a relationship between the parks' age and tenants' performance. Further, we estimate changes in tenant performance against the age of the park. The analysis is based on firm-level data of 1812 small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms with only one factory in any given industrial park in 2016. The important findings that can be drawn from our study are as follows. First, the relationship between the park's age and patent applications filed by tenants (the proxy of firm performance) follows a U-shape. Firms located in very new or longer established parks have more patents. Second, the relationship between the age of the park and tenants' sales follows an inverted U-shape. Firms in middle-aged parks show higher sales per worker. Finally, firms that have just moved into the park or young firms moving into the park perform better. We suggest that a government body should create different approaches for improving innovation and management performance to regenerate industrial parks.","[Song, Ji-Hyun] Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, 163 Seoulsirip Daero, Seoul 02504, South Korea",University of Seoul,"Song, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Seoul, Dept Econ, 163 Seoulsirip Daero, Seoul 02504, South Korea.",urbookmark@naver.com,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The vector error correction model was used for this purpose to determine both long-term and short-term causal relationships. To create the resulting model, the econometric methodology was used, namely unit root tests, Granger causality for the determination of statistically significant relationships, information criteria and the Johansen cointegration test. The results show the validity of expected assumptions in the case of short-term relationships. There was a positive correlation between the unemployment rate and the default rate delayed by one quarter. A negative short-term relationship to the default rate was found in the case of real GDP and in the case of the Czech crown effective exchange rate index with a one-quarter delay. In the case of long-term relationships, surprising results were found regarding GDP and oil price development. As expected, it was found in the long run that the default rate is positively related to the unemployment and effective exchange rate of the Czech crown. The default rate indicator is one of the inputs of the stress testing model developed by the Czech National Bank. The model is based on the time series of the share of outstanding loans and the total amount of loans, and on selected macroeconomic indicators. Achieved empirical results are influenced by the fact that the Czech economy has undergone the period of currency crisis. The data used have the character of quarterly time series in the period from 2005Q1 to 2017Q1.

Results show that the relationship between carbon emission and economic growth in China during the recent decade has the development tendency toward an inverse U-shaped curve, approximately confirming the carbon emission's Kuznets curve hypothesis in China. There exists a significant spatial correlation between carbon emission and economic growth, implying that carbon emission in a province may be influenced by economic growth in adjacent provinces. When economic growth reaches 279.91 million Yuan/km(2) GDP (at a comparable price in 2000), the contradiction between economic growth and carbon emission begins to be gradually alleviated.

In public procurement markets, however, bid-rigging schemes are often accompanied by corruption of public officials. In the absence of coordinated forms of leniency (or rewards) for unveiling corruption, a policy offering immunity from antitrust sanctions may not be sufficient to encourage wrongdoers to blow the whistle, as the leniency recipient will then be exposed to the risk of conviction for corruption. This article assesses the extent of this problem by describing and discussing the antitrust and anti-corruption provisions present in a few selected countries, under both common law and civil law regimes. For each of these countries, we try to evaluate whether the legal system presents any solution to limiting the risk that legal provisions against corruption undermine the effectiveness of leniency programs against bid rigging in public procurement. Legal harmonization, coordination, and co-operation on procedural and substantive issues, and inter- and intra-jurisdictions, seem essential to solve this problem. Given the size of public procurement markets and their propensity for cartelization, specific improvements in legislation appear necessary in all the countries considered. Explicitly introducing leniency policies for corruption, as has been done recently in Brazil and Mexico and is being experimented in the United States, is only a first step. The antitrust experience has taught us that to achieve their goals of inducing whistleblowing, these policies must be carefully designed and sufficiently generous with (only) the first reporting party, they should not be discretional, they must be backed by robust sanctions, and they must be consistently implemented. Hence, the road ahead appears a long one. To increase the effectiveness of leniency in multiple offense cases, we suggest, besides extending automatic leniency to individual criminal sanctions, the creation of a one-stop point enabling firms and individuals to report different crimes simultaneously and receive leniency for all of them at once if they are entitled to it. As long as individual criminal charges are not covered by a coordinated and nondiscretional leniency program, there is little hope that these provisions will induce any improvement in the fight against corrupting cartels. A more effective way to fight such cartels may then be offering Qui Tam rewards to nonaccomplice whistleblowers, as is already done with apparent success by several law enforcement agencies in the United States.","[Luz, Reinaldo Diogo] Minist Finance Brazil, Sch Publ Finance Adm Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Luz, Reinaldo Diogo] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Law Sch, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Spagnolo, Giancarlo] SITE Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Spagnolo, Giancarlo] EIEF, Rome, Italy; [Spagnolo, Giancarlo] Univ Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; [Spagnolo, Giancarlo] CEPR, London, England",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Stockholm School of Economics; University of Rome Tor Vergata; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Luz, RD (通讯作者)，Minist Finance Brazil, Sch Publ Finance Adm Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.;Luz, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Law Sch, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",,,"Luz, Reinaldo/0000-0001-8915-1929",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education (CAPES Foundation); Ministry of Education of Brazil [BEX5798/14-0]; Swedish Research Council,Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education (CAPES Foundation); Ministry of Education of Brazil; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"Professor, SITE - Stockholm School of Economics, Sweden; EIEF and University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; and CEPR, London, UK.

Comparing contracts from both groups of companies, we observe, on the one hand, that (1) franchise contracts are unbalanced irrespective of the chain's success: contracts cover franchisees' obligations more than franchisors' obligations. On the other hand, we find that (2) contracts in successful franchise chains are more complete (i.e. cover a larger number of contingencies) than the less successful ones and (3) this difference lies in the contingencies regarding franchisees' obligations, which are more fully covered in the contracts of more successful chains. More specifically, within the contingencies regarding franchisees' obligations, (4) successful chains restrict the franchisee decision rights more frequently on day-to-day business operations than on financial conditions or post-contractual contingencies. These findings can be explained because successful chains are more sensitive to franchisees' opportunistic behavior, because they have learned how to manage and solve any potential conflicts, or because of differences in bargaining power. Finally (5) franchisors' obligations are not statistically different between groups, which we interpret as evidence that relational contracting mechanisms do not substitute formalization.","[Solis-Rodriguez, Vanesa; Gonzalez-Diaz, Manuel] Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Solís-Rodríguez, V (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",solisvanesa@uniovi.es; mgdiaz@uniovi.es,"Rodríguez, Vanesa Solís/ABG-2898-2020; Gonzalez-Diaz, Manuel/K-5986-2017","Rodríguez, Vanesa Solís/0000-0002-5726-4387; Gonzalez-Diaz, Manuel/0000-0001-9926-1574",,,,,65,5,7,2,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We define entrepreneur as a person who takes risks under uncertainty. Based on this definition, an entrepreneur's exit decision is modeled using real options theory to measure entrepreneur's willingness to accept uncertainty. We find that entrepreneurs who entered before a recession exit when their critical revenue stream reaches 0.16 times the average revenue stream value. The equivalent value for entrepreneurs who enter during an economic recession is 0.33 times the average revenue stream. Furthermore, when uncertainty doubles, the exit probability of entrepreneurs who enter during an economic recession is approximately 2.75 times higher than that of entrepreneurs who enter before recession. We conclude that the majority of entrepreneurs who enter during an economic recession are qualitatively disadvantaged, which leads to the overall decrease in qualitative entrepreneurship.

The expert opinions on criteria set were analyzed by applying fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS techniques to determine the significance level and ranking the alternatives. Among all criteria the economic insufficiency (C6) was received the maximum score as the most effective cause of the sea piracy whereas the least effective factor was decided as geographic location of the canals and straits that are in risky regions of the world (Cl). While the most important alternative to offer a solution to this problem was established as providing support local and regional authority in risky regions (A5), the least important alternative was confirmed as providing rehabilitations to individuals or groups which have tendency toward privateering actions (A6).","[Ozdemir, Unal] Mersin Univ, Maritime Fac, Dept Maritime Business Management, Mersin, Turkey; [Gineroglu, Abdulaziz] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Fac Marine Sci, Dept Marine Ecol, TR-61530 Trabzon, Turkey",Mersin University; Karadeniz Technical University,"Özdemir, Ü (通讯作者)，Mersin Univ, Maritime Fac, Dept Maritime Business Management, Mersin, Turkey.",unal.kaptan@hotmail.com; guneroglu@hotmail.com,"Guneroglu, Abdulaziz/AAT-4063-2020; ÖZDEMİR, Ünal/L-2593-2016; ÖZDEMİR, Ünal/A-2734-2017","OZDEMIR, Unal/0000-0001-9682-4239",,,,,82,9,10,0,20,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

This paper uses bootstrap-based methods to select time-specific conditioning information for the prediction of exchange rates. By employing measures of the predictive ability over time, along with statistical and economic evaluation criteria, we find that our approach based on pre-selecting and validating fundamentals across bootstrap replications leads to significant forecast improvements and economic gains relative to the random walk. The approach, known as bumping, selects parsimonious models that have out-of-sample predictive power at the one-month horizon; it is found to outperform various alternative methods, including Bayesian, bagging, and standard forecast combinations.

Firms either set the price of the bundle and then compete along side the bundle; or they determine a rebate that is applied to joint purchasers and then set prices. Even though the pricing structure in the joint marketing scheme is determined noncooperatively, the commitment to the joint marketing agreement allows firms to leverage their stand-alone prices leading to higher profits and lower consumer surplus in either case, compared to both uniform pricing and independent price discrimination without a joint marketing agreement. Nevertheless the two schemes differ dramatically, in that rebates increase joint purchasing, whereas bundle pricing diminishes bundle purchases.","[Jeitschko, Thomas D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Jung, Yeonjei] Korea Energy Econ Inst, Elect Policy Res Grp, Ulsan, South Korea; [Kim, Jaesoo] IUPUI, Dept Econ, Indianapolis, IN USA",Michigan State University; Korea Energy Economics Institute; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,"Jeitschko, TD (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jeitschk@msu.edu; yeonjei@keei.re.kr; jaeskim@iupui.edu,"Jeitschko, Thomas/O-7318-2019; Kim, Jaesoo/GYQ-9324-2022","Jeitschko, Thomas/0000-0001-5903-3235; Jung, Yeonjei/0009-0009-5495-9325",,,,,26,12,13,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Examining predictors, propensity to plan for money tend to be associated with higher odds of children's food insecurity. By contrast, frugal behavior, lower material deprivation, and higher subjective well-being tend to reduce the odds of children's food insecurity.

In a study that combines elements of a lab and a field experiment, we show that salient and incentivized consent options are sufficient to trigger this behavioral effect. Salient ex ante consent options may lure people into giving up their privacy and increase their compliance with social norms - even when the only immediate risk of sharing information is mere publicity on a Google website. A right to be forgotten (right to deletion), however, seems to reduce neither privacy valuations nor chilling effects. In spite of low deletion costs people tend to stick with a retention default. The study suggests that consent architectures may play out on social conformity rather than on consent choices and privacy valuations. Salient notice and consent options may not merely empower users to make an informed consent decision. Instead, they can trigger the very effects that privacy law intends to curb.

Using a novel methodology for selecting words and a vector autoregressive modeling approach, we study whether the search queries of finance-related words can have an impact on returns, volatility of returns and traded volume in four different English-speaking countries. We identify several words whose search frequency is associated with changes in the dependent variables. In particular, we find that increases in search queries including the word stock predict increased volatility and decreased index returns over the next week. On top of that, we investigate the performance of a market-timing strategy based on the search frequency of this word and benchmark it against random words from the Word-Net database and a naive buy-and-hold strategy. The results of this empirical application are positive and particularly stronger during the global crisis of 2009.

The arrival of e-commerce has accentuated the number of individual home deliveries, increasing the flows in the last-mile. Investigating how to improve the efficiency of logistics in urban areas is a major driver for the success of e-commerce, and contributes to alleviating the negative externalities of urban freight transport derived from it. By means of interviews and empirical analysis, this article targets two goals. Firstly, to conciliate different perspectives about the structure and cost drivers in the market. Secondly, within this framework, to propose a cost model for two of the most popular methods of last-mile delivery: the home delivery and delivery through pick-up points. Main findings: It is concluded that the parcel delivery market remains under a strong competition, driven by efficiency and with little space for innovations. Parcel delivery companies have been handling with failed deliveries via different solutions. While failed deliveries have an impact on the cost structure, achieving higher economies of density has a higher impact on costs reduction. Pick-up points offer a solution to failed deliveries while they increase the density of deliveries at the same time. When the number of parcels to the pick-up point is high enough, benefits for both logistics carriers and the society are achieved. This is due to the reductions in the overall number of vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT). Results show that reductions-can be obtained with a limited number of pick-up points. In this paper, a novel typology of the B2C logistics sector is presented together with the most important cost drivers for the sector. In the analysis, an original cost model incorporates cost drivers disregarded in previous modelling efforts, such as the failed deliveries, the modal choice of companies and customers and the stoppage time of a delivery. Furthermore, primary data were obtained to develop the calculations and the results were validated by companies of the sector.","[Cardenas, Ivan Dario; Dewulf, Wouter; Vanelslander, Thierry; Beckers, Joris] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Antwerp, Belgium; [Smet, Christophe] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ Sci, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp,"Cardenas, ID (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Antwerp, Belgium.",ivandario.cardenasbarbosa@uantwerpen.be,"Cardenas, Ivan/JHU-7453-2023; Vanelslander, Thierry/I-6083-2015","Cardenas, Ivan Dario/0000-0003-1204-373X; Vanelslander, Thierry/0000-0001-5213-3444; Beckers, Joris/0000-0003-1900-7037",Flemish Government,Flemish Government,"This research was supported by the Flemish Government programmes 'Richting morgen, 'Vlaanderen in Actie', 'Vlaanderen is innovatie' and 'Pact 2020' within the Urban Logistics and Mobility project (ULM).",,44,38,38,4,113,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Our study measures how people punish increased dishonesty controlling for the corresponding economic harm. We find that punishment increases with the size of the lie.

Seeking to better understand this relationship, this article tests the hypothesis that the rewards from immigrant diversity will be higher in metropolitan areas that feature more inclusive social and economic institutions. Institutions ought to matter because they regulate transaction costs, which, in principle, determine whether or not diversity offers advantages or disadvantages. We exploit longitudinal linked employer-employee data for the United States to test this idea, and we triangulate across two measures that differently capture the inclusiveness of urban institutions. Findings offer support for the hypothesis. In cities with low levels of inclusive institutions, the benefits of diversity are modest and in some cases nonexistent; in cities with high levels of inclusive institutions, the benefits of immigrant diversity are positive, significant, and substantial. We also find that weakly inclusive institutions hurt natives considerably more than foreign-born workers. These results confirm the economic significance of immigrant diversity, while suggesting the importance of local social and economic institutions.","[Kemeny, Tom] Univ Southampton, Dept Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Cooke, Abigail] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geog, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",University of Southampton; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Kemeny, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Dept Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",t.e.kemeny@soton.ac.uk,"Kemeny, Thomas/D-1544-2010","Cooke, Abigail/0000-0002-3758-6629; Kemeny, Tom/0000-0003-4984-9104","US National Science Foundation [BCS-1359768]; National Science Foundation [SES-9978093, SES-0339191, ITR-0427889]; National Institute on Aging [AG018854]; Alfred P.

J,"Royer, DJ",,,,"Royer, Daniel J.",,,Rhetorical Styles in University Accreditation: Judgmental Rules or Collaborative Creation?,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GENRE,"The university accreditation process is at a crossroads. After more than a century of allowing universities to function as self-governing institutions, legislatures are now demanding more accountability. That puts pressure on the accreditation process to impose more external rules, which are diametrically opposed to the high value placed on heterogeneity and the spirit of free and independent inquiry. However, accreditation, and the assessment practices that accompany it, need to resist this restrictive methodology. Assessment is a rhetorical social practice, and as such, the kind of rhetoric we use when we engage this practice influences how we think and feel about the work and contributes to the effectiveness of our practice. Aristotle's distinction between forensic and deliberative rhetoric provides a heuristic framework for us to think about regional accreditation and internal assessment of universities. A close look at recent accreditation guidelines reveals that the context of much regional and local assessment calls for a deliberative rhetoric (thinking together about how to create a common future) rather than forensic rhetoric (gathering evidence to judge a past event). However, habituated responses to existing assessment genres can cause those involved in accreditation and assessment to fail to move beyond a mentality of mere compliance and miss the opportunities of progressive, aspirational assessment practice, a practice that requires a deliberative rhetoric in order to set us on the open pathway of building educational community.","[Royer, Daniel J.] Grand Valley State Univ, Writing, Allendale, MI 49401 USA",Grand Valley State University,"Royer, DJ (通讯作者)，Grand Valley State Univ, Writing, Allendale, MI 49401 USA.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

These variables are used to estimate a dynamic factor model (DFM) which is updated continuously at each new data release over a historical period of 11 years. Our results show that the proposed now-casting model tracks GDP realizations well throughout the evaluation period.

There is little evidence internationally of mergers in transport companies, and most of it is focusses on mergers in the same sector. This merger was based on the need for Portugal to optimize the use of its road and railway network, and also to increase the efficiency of the large investments made. The new company no longer positions itself as an investor and constructor of infrastructures, but is rather as a provider of multimodal mobility. This merger created scope for a better service, increased revenues, the reduction of costs, all through synergies which allow for a more financially-sustainable operator. This paper describes the merger, its strategic and operational objectives, and also the changes in the management.

However, most existing work has overlooked the interrelationship between congestion and economic components. With this perspective, this study seeks to explore the interrelationship between congestion, income, and employment. To this end, we focus on 86 US metropolitan areas by utilizing a simultaneous equation model. The results show that there is an interrelationship between income growth, employment growth, and congestion growth, but their effects are somewhat different between periods of the economic boom in the 1990s and the economic recession in the 2000s. In addition, our findings clearly show that traffic congestion growth negatively affects income growth and employment growth. It is suggested that transportation policy that aims to reduce traffic congestion could provide economic benefits in terms of increasing employment growth as well as income growth.","[Jin, Jangik; Rafferty, Peter] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Wisconsin TOPS Lab, 1415 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Jin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Wisconsin TOPS Lab, 1415 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jjin8@wisc.edu; prafferty@wisc.edu,,,,,,,33,27,28,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

With a theoretical model and a coherent empirical study, the present study shows that the price floor imposed by China's price review is more likely to protect those domestic project owners against price discrimination, rather than to distort the CDM market. Nevertheless, China's price review has its own flaws. Although a regression study shows month of approval, types of projects and location of project can explain 55% of price floor designation, the operation of price review remains quite random and unpredictable in individual cases. This would bring extra bureaucratically uncertainty on its way to curb market uncertainty. Its function can be fulfilled by alternative policy tools with better economic efficiency and legal legitimacy, such as mandatory price disclosure and trading forum, which doesn't have such drawback, but still be able to alleviate possible price discrimination in individual cases.","[Zhu, Jinshan] Univ Potsdam, Chair Int Polit, Potsdam, Germany",University of Potsdam,"Zhu, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Potsdam, Chair Int Polit, Potsdam, Germany.",jzhu@uni-potsdam.de,,,,,,,60,1,1,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

I develop a new model to explain this phenomenon. My model generates an equilibrium where some, but not all, ex ante identical firms recruit strictly internally. These firms employ higher quality entry-level workers, since they hire supervisors exclusively from their lower ranks. The scarcity of high-quality workers limits the use of this strategy. I derive several testable predictions on wage-tenure profile differences across firms with varying recruitment practices and confirm these predictions using matched employer-employee data from the United Kingdom.","[Bond, Timothy N.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Bond, Timothy N.] Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 100 S Grant St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Bond, TN (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Bond, TN (通讯作者)，Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, 100 S Grant St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",tnbond@purdue.edu,,,,,,,44,2,4,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.
