The World Health Organization classifies combined hormonal contraception as an ''unacceptable health risk'' for women with thrombogenic mutations but advises against universal thrombophilia screening before prescribing COCs given the low prevalence of thrombophilia and high screening costs. Objective Through the lens of lifetime costs and benefits, this paper systematically and critically reviews all published economic evaluations of thrombophilia screening prior to prescribing COCs. Methods We searched relevant databases for economic evaluations of thrombophilia screening before prescribing COCs. After extracting the key study characteristics and economic variables, we evaluated each article using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) and the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) instruments. Results Seven economic evaluations of thrombophilia screening before prescribing COCs met our inclusion criteria. Only the two economic evaluations focusing exclusively on selective screening exceeded the 75-point threshold for high-quality economic studies based on the QHES instrument, whereas only one of these exceeded the 85% CHEERS threshold. Only three of the seven economic evaluations performed sensitivity analysis on key parameters. Most studies underestimated the benefits of thrombophilia screening by comparing one-time costs of genetic screening against benefits per person-year, thus implicitly assuming a 1-year duration of COC use, neglecting the long-term implications of VTE and/or neglecting the lifetime benefits of awareness of inherited thrombophilia. Conclusion Our review highlights the lack of methodologically rigorous economic evaluations of universal thrombophilia screening before prescribing COCs.","[Vernon, Erin; Hiedemann, Bridget] Seattle Univ, Dept Econ, 901 12th Ave, Seattle, WA 98122 USA; [Bowie, Bonnie H.] Seattle Univ, Coll Nursing, 901 12th Ave, Seattle, WA 98122 USA",Seattle University; Seattle University,"Hiedemann, B (通讯作者)，Seattle Univ, Dept Econ, 901 12th Ave, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",bgh@seattleu.edu,,"Vernon, Erin/0000-0002-9094-3226",,,,,43,11,13,0,6,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The cost-effectiveness evidence of different approaches to support is scant. Objectives: To appraise economic evidence on the cost-effectiveness of home support interventions for dementia to inform future evaluation. Methods: A systematic literature review of full and partial economic evaluations was performed using the British National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database supplemented by additional references. Study characteristics and findings, including incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, when available, were summarized narratively. Study quality was appraised using the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database critical appraisal criteria and independent ratings, agreed by two reviewers. Studies were located on a permutation matrix describing their mix of incremental costs/effects to aid decision making. Results: Of the 151 articles retrieved, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria: 8 concerning support to people with dementia and 6 to carers. Five studies were incremental cost-utility analyses, seven were cost-effectiveness analyses, and two were cost consequences analyses. Five studies expressed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (6,696- pound 207,942 pound per quality-adjusted life-year). In four studies, interventions were dominant over usual care. Two interventions were more costly but more beneficial and were favorable against current acceptability thresholds. Conclusions: Occupational therapy, home based exercise, and a carers' coping intervention emerged as cost-ffective approaches for which there was better evidence. These interventions used environmental modifications, behavior management, physical activity, and emotional support as active components. More robust evidence is needed to judge the value of these and other interventions across the dementia care pathway.","[Clarkson, Paul; Jasper, Rowan; Loynes, Niklas; Challis, David] Univ Manchester, Hlth Serv Res & Primary Care, Div Populat Hlth, PSSRU, 2nd Floor,Crawford House, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Davies, Linda] Univ Manchester, Ctr Hlth Econ, Hlth Serv Res & Primary Care, Div Populat Hlth, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Clarkson, P (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Hlth Serv Res & Primary Care, Div Populat Hlth, PSSRU, 2nd Floor,Crawford House, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",paul.clarkson@manchester.ac.uk,"Challis, David/B-9262-2008; Jasper, Rowan E/M-9752-2014","Challis, David/0000-0002-6464-2286; Clarkson, Paul/0000-0002-0778-312X; Jasper, Rowan/0000-0003-1328-2812",NIHR in England [DTC-RP-PG-0311-12003]; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [DTC-RP-PG-0311-12003] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [DTC-RP-PG-0311-12003] Funding Source: researchfish,NIHR in England; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This research was funded by the NIHR in England under its Programme Grants for Applied Research (grant reference no.

Objectives: To compare preference based weights for age-related macular degeneration treatment attributes and levels generated by two elicitation methods. The properties of both methods were assessed, including ease of instrument use. Methods: A DCE and an AHP experiment were designed on the basis of five attributes. Preference-based weights were generated using the matrix multiplication method for attributes and levels in AHP and a mixed multinomial logit model for levels in the DCE. Attribute importance was further compared using coefficient (DCE) and weight (AHP) level ranges. The questionnaire difficulty was rated on a qualitative scale. Patients were asked to think aloud while providing their judgments. Results: AHP and DCE generated similar results regarding levels, stressing a preference for visual improvement, frequent monitoring, on-demand and less frequent injection schemes, approved drugs, and mild side effects. Attribute weights derived on the basis of level ranges led to a ranking that was opposite to the AHP directly calculated attribute weights. For example, visual function ranked first in the AHP and last on the basis of level ranges. Conclusions: The results across the methods were similar, with one exception: the directly measured AHP attribute weights were different from the level-based interpretation of attribute importance in both DCE and AHP. The dependence/independence of attribute importance on level ranges in DCE and AHP, respectively, should be taken into account when choosing a method to support decision making.","[Danner, Marion; Vennedey, Vera; Gross, Christian; Stock, Stephanie] Univ Hosp Cologne AoR, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; [Hiligsmann, Mickaeel] Maastricht Univ, CAPHRI Sch Primary Care & Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Fauser, Sascha] Univ Hosp Cologne AoR, Ctr Ophthalmol, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne; Maastricht University; University of Cologne,"Danner, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Cologne AoR, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",marion.danner@uk-koeln.de,,,"Bayer Vital GmbH, Germany","Bayer Vital GmbH, Germany(Bayer AG)","This investigator-initiated study was funded by Bayer Vital GmbH, Germany.

In this paper, the clinical, economic and policy implications of drug shortages are discussed, based on data available for the EU. Research on the clinical impact is scarce. Most data describe that patients will experience more side effects or need to postpone their treatment. However, more detailed research such as case studies and the number of patients affected are lacking. Information on the economic impact is described as an estimation of the time spent by hospital pharmacies. Other stakeholders are also burdened: manufacturers loose part of their profit, patients may pay more for the alternative treatment and society pays for additional health-care costs. However, no data are available. Again more detailed and objective research is necessary to know where the problem is situated and how solutions can be proposed. Policy implications are also rather scarce. However, once more detailed and objective research has been conducted, policy changes will follow. All stakeholders should be involved in the discussions, prior to the implementation of policy measures.","[De Weerdt, Elfi; Simoens, Steven; Casteels, Minne; Huys, Isabelle] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, Herestr 49 Box 521, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"De Weerdt, E (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, Herestr 49 Box 521, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",Elfi.deweerdt@kuleuven.be,"Huys, Isabelle/M-8673-2016; De Weerdt, Elfi/H-7459-2018","De Weerdt, Elfi/0000-0002-8847-8812; Simoens, Steven/0000-0002-9512-2005",,,,,33,27,28,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Previous studies have shown that banks are redundant in this environment since it is impossible to prevent the strategic withdrawals. This paper shows that the strategic withdrawals can be prevented if the market risk, due to asset price volatility, is considered. Banks provide deterministic returns to the depositors since the aggregate withdrawals are predictable, and therefore, banks can choose the portfolio such that no asset liquidation is involved. However, an individual consumer with stochastic liquidity need is vulnerable to the price volatility if he holds the asset directly. Therefore, banks improve the consumers' welfare by providing the insurance against not only the liquidity shock but also the market risk. Banks are not redundant. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To review definitions publicly available for RWD to shed light on similarities and differences between them. Methods: A literature review and stakeholder interviews were used to compile data from eight groups of stakeholders. Data from documents and interviews were subjected to coding analysis. Definitions identified were classified into four categories: 1) data collected in a non-randomized controlled trial setting, 2) data collected in a non-interventional/non-controlled setting, 3) data collected in a non-experimental setting, and 4) others (i.e., data that do not fit into the other three categories). The frequency of definitions identified per category was recorded. Results: Fifty-three documents and 20 interviews were assessed. Thirty-eight definitions were identified: 20 out of 38 definitions (53%) were category 1 definitions, 9 (24%) were category 2 definitions, 5 (13%) were category 3 definitions, and 4 (11%) were category 4 definitions. Differences were identified between, and within, definition categories. For example, opinions differed on the aspects of intervention with which non-interventional/non-controlled settings should abide. No definitions were provided in two interviews or identified in 33 documents. Conclusions: Most of the definitions defined RWD as data collected in a non-randomized controlled trial setting. A considerable number of definitions, however, diverged from this concept. Moreover, a significant number of authors and stakeholders did not have an official, institutional definition for RWD. Persisting variability in stakeholder definitions of RWD may lead to disparities among different stakeholders when discussing RWD use in decision making.","[Makady, Amr; Goettsch, Wim] Natl Healthcare Inst, Diemen, Netherlands; [Makady, Amr; de Boer, Anthonius; Klungel, Olaf; Goettsch, Wim] Utrecht Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharmacoepidemiol & Clin Pharmacol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hillege, Hans] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Groningen, Netherlands",Utrecht University; University of Groningen,"Makady, A (通讯作者)，Natl Healthcare Inst ZIN, Eekholt 4, NL-1112 XH Diemen, Netherlands.",amakady@zinl.nl,,,European Union [115546]; European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations,European Union(European Union (EU)); European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations,"The work leading to these results has received support from the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking under grant agreement no. 115546, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations companies in kind contribution.

Methods: An economic evaluation of a multicenter randomized trial was conducted, comparing complete revascularization at index admission to IRA-only P-PCI in patients with multivessel disease (12-month follow-up). Overall hospital costs (costs for P-PCI procedure(s), hospital length of stay, and any subsequent re-admissions) were estimated. Outcomes were major adverse cardiac events (MACEs, a composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemia-driven revascularization) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) derived from the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Multiple imputation was undertaken. The mean incremental cost and effect, with associated 95% confidence intervals, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve were estimated. Results: On the basis of 296 patients, the mean incremental overall hospital cost for complete revascularization was estimated to be -215.96 pound (- pound 1390.20 to 958.29), compared with IRA only, with a per-patient mean reduction in MACEs of 0.170 (0.044 to 0.296) and a QALY gain of 0.011 (-0.019 to 0.041). According to the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, the probability of complete revascularization being cost-effective was estimated to be 72.0% at a willingness-to-pay threshold value of 20,000 per QALY. Conclusions: Complete revascularization at index admission was estimated to be more effective (in terms of MACEs and QALYs) and cost-effective (overall costs were estimated to be lower and complete revascularization thereby dominated IRA-only). There was, however, some uncertainty associated with this decision.","[Barton, Garry R.; Irvine, Lisa; Flather, Marcus] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [McCann, Gerry P.; Gershlick, Anthony H.] Univ Leicester, Dept Cardiovasc Sci, Leicester, Leics, England; [McCann, Gerry P.; Gershlick, Anthony H.] Univ Hosp Leicester NHS Trust, NIHR Leicester Cardiovasc Biomed Res Unit, Glenfield Hosp, Leicester, Leics, England; [Curzen, Nick] Univ Hosp Southampton NHS Fdn Trust, Southampton, Hants, England; [Curzen, Nick] Univ Southampton, Fac Med, Southampton, Hants, England",University of East Anglia; University of Leicester; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust; University of Leicester; Glenfield Hospital; University of Southampton; University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust; University of Southampton,"Barton, GR (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",g.barton@uea.ac.uk,"curzen, nick/AAD-8161-2020; Irvine, Lisa/ABH-5953-2020","Irvine, Lisa/0000-0003-1936-3584; Barton, Garry/0000-0001-9040-011X; McCann, Gerry/0000-0002-5542-8448; Curzen, Nick/0000-0001-9651-7829",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [PB-PG-0711-25003]; British Heart Foundation; MRC [MC_G1002675] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_G1002675] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [CDF-2014-07-045] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [PB-PG-0711-25003] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); British Heart Foundation(British Heart Foundation); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This independent research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Research for Patient Benefit Programme (grant reference no.

Classic cake-cutting procedures either allocate each agent a collection of disconnected pieces, or assume that the cake is a one-dimensional interval. In practice, however, the two-dimensional shape of the allotted pieces is important. In particular, when building a house or designing an advertisement in printed or electronic media, squares are more usable than long and narrow rectangles. We thus introduce and study the problem of fair two-dimensional division wherein the allotted pieces must be of some restricted two-dimensional geometric shape(s), particularly squares and fat rectangles. Adding such geometric constraints re-opens most questions and challenges related to cake-cutting. Indeed, even the most elementary fairness criterion-proportionality - can no longer be guaranteed. In this paper we thus examine the level of proportionality that can be guaranteed, providing both impossibility results and constructive division procedures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The values of a subset of the EQ-5D-5L-defined health states (n = 86) were elicited using the time trade-off (TTO) technique from a sample of urban residents (n = 1271) recruited from five Chinese cities. In computer-assisted personal interviews, participants each completed 10 TTO tasks. Two additive and two multiplicative regression models were evaluated for their performance in describing the relationship between TTO values and health state characteristics using a cross validation approach. Final values were generated using the best performed model and a rescaling method. Results: The 8- and 9-parameter multiplicative models unanimously outperformed the 20-parameter additive model using a random or fixed intercept in predicting values for out-of-sample health states in the cross-validation analysis and their coefficients were estimated with lower standard errors. The prediction accuracies of the two multiplicative models measured by the mean absolute error and the intraclass correlation coefficient were very similar, thus favoring the more parsimonious model. Conclusions: The 8-parameter multiplicative model performed the best in the study and therefore was used to generate the EQ-5D-5L value set for China. We recommend using rescaled values whereby 1 represents the value of instrument defined full health in economic evaluation of health technologies in China whenever the EQ-5D-5L data are available.

This paper presents model specification and proposes QMLE estimation of spatial dynamic panel data models with endogenous time varying spatial weights matrices. Asymptotic properties of the proposed QMLE are rigorously established. We extend the notion of spatial near-epoch dependence to allow time dependence. By using spatial-time LLN for near-epoch dependence process and CLT for martingale difference sequence, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of QMLE. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimators have satisfactory finite sample performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

EF serves as a framework for evaluating cost-effectiveness and indirectly for pricing and reimbursement decisions. Objectives: To calculate an EF on the basis of single multidimensional benefit by taking patient preferences and uncertainty into account; to evaluate whether EF is useful to inform decision makers about costeffectiveness of new therapies; and to find whether a treatment is efficient at given prices demonstrated through a case study on chronic hepatitis C. Methods: A single multidimensional benefit was calculated by linear additive aggregation of multiple patient-relevant end points. End points were identified and weighted by patients in a previous discrete-choice experiment (DCE). Aggregation of overall benefit was ascertained using preferences and clinical data. Monte-Carlo simulation was applied. Uncertainty was addressed by price acceptability curve (PAC) and net monetary benefit (NMB). Results: The case study illustrates that progress in benefit and efficiency of hepatitis C virus treatments could be depicted very well with the EF. On the basis of cost, effect, and preference data, the latest generations of interferon-free treatments are shown to yield a positive NMB and be efficient at current prices. Conclusions: EF was implemented taking uncertainty into account. For the first time, a DCE was used with the EF. The study shows how DCEs in combination with EF, PAC, and NMB can contribute important information in the course of reimbursement and pricing decisions.","[Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Sadler, Andrew] Hsch Neubrandenburg, Gesundheitsokon & Med Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany",,"Mühlbacher, AC (通讯作者)，Hsch Neubrandenburg, Gesundheitsokon & Med Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.",muehlbacher@hs-nb.de,"Mühlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020","Mühlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211","Gilead Sciences GmbH, Munich","Gilead Sciences GmbH, Munich(Gilead Sciences)","This research project was financed by Gilead Sciences GmbH, Munich.",,34,36,41,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2017,20.0,2.0,,,,,266,272,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.12.015,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HX,28237207.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396450400016,0

This model has two features: first, fixed effects are included to allow for correlation between individual unobserved heterogeneity and the regressors; second, it allows for cross-sectional dependence through a general spatial error dependence structure. We derive a semiparametric estimator for our model by using a modified within transformation, and then show the asymptotic and finite properties for this estimator under large N and T. The Monte Carlo study shows that our methodology works well for both large N and T, and large N and small T cases. Finally, we illustrate our model by analyzing the effects of state-level banking regulations on the returns to scale of commercial banks in the US. Our empirical results suggest that returns to scale is higher in more regulated states than in less regulated states. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to demonstrate how this type of analysis can be used in medical decision making to assess whether psychiatrists were influenced in their treatment recommendations by information on the genotype of a patient, despite knowing the patient's response to treatment as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. A patient's genetic information may be used to predict their response to therapy; such information, however, becomes redundant, and should not influence decisions, once a clinician knows the patient's actual response to treatment. Methods: Sixty-seven psychiatrists were presented with patients' pre- or post-treatment scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for two hypothetical treatments for schizophrenia. Psychiatrists were also informed whether the patient possessed a genotype linked to hyper-responsiveness to one of the treatments, and were asked to recommend one of these two treatments. Attribute nonattendance assessed whether the information on genotype influenced psychiatrists' treatment recommendations. Results: Years of experience predicted whether psychiatrists were influenced by the genetic information. Psychiatrists with 1 year or less of experience had a 46% probability of considering genetic information, whereas psychiatrists with at least 15 years of experience had a lower probability (7%). Conclusions: Psychiatrists and other clinicians should be cautious about allowing a patient's genetic information to carry unnecessary weight in their clinical decision making.","[McMichael, Alan J.; O'Neill, Francis A.; Kee, Frank] Queens Univ Belfast, Royal Victoria Hosp, Ctr Publ Hlth, Belfast BT12 6BA, Antrim, North Ireland; [Boeri, Marco] RTI Hlth Solut, Hlth Preference Assessment, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Boeri, Marco] Queens Uniuers Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Gibson Inst, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Boeri, Marco; Kee, Frank] Queens Univ Belfast, UKCRC Ctr Excellence Publ Hlth Res NI, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Rolison, Jonathan J.] Univ Essex, Dept Psychol, Colchester, Essex, England; [Kane, Joe] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Scarpa, Ric] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England; [Scarpa, Ric] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Scarpa, Ric] Univ Verona, Verona, Italy",Queens University Belfast; Research Triangle Institute; Queens University Belfast; University of Essex; Newcastle University - UK; Durham University; University of Waikato; University of Verona,"McMichael, AJ (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Royal Victoria Hosp, Ctr Publ Hlth, Belfast BT12 6BA, Antrim, North Ireland.",amcmichael01@qub.ac.uk,"Kane, Joe/ABC-2823-2020; O'Neill, Francis A/C-5582-2008; Boeri, Marco/D-9656-2011; Scarpa, Riccardo/AAF-8435-2019","Kane, Joe/0000-0002-8479-9977; O'Neill, Francis A/0000-0002-7531-7657; Scarpa, Riccardo/0000-0001-6449-5389; Boeri, Marco/0000-0001-7346-2132",Department of Education and Learning,Department of Education and Learning,"Financial support for this study was provided by a grant from the Department of Education and Learning.

For these technologies to move into mainstream health care and be reimbursed by insurers, it will be essential to have evidence that their benefits provide reasonable value relative to their costs. These technologies, however, have complex characteristics that present challenges to the assessment of their economic value. Previous studies have identified the challenges for personalized medicine and thus this work informs the more nascent topic of digital medicine. Objectives: To examine the methodological challenges and future opportunities for assessing the economic value of digital medicine, using personalized medicine as a comparison. Methods: We focused specifically on digital biomarker technologies and multigene tests. We identified similarities in these technologies that can present challenges to economic evaluation: multiple results, results with different types of utilities, secondary findings, downstream impact (including on family members), and interactive effects. Results: Using a structured review, we found that there are few economic evaluations of digital biomarker technologies, with limited results. Conclusions: We conclude that more evidence on the effectiveness of digital medicine will be needed but that the experiences with personalized medicine can inform what data will be needed and how such analyses can be conducted. Our study points out the critical need for typologies and terminology for digital medicine technologies that would enable them to be classified in ways that will facilitate research on their effectiveness and value.","[Phillips, Kathryn A.; Douglas, Michael P.; Trosman, Julia R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, Ctr Translat & Policy Res Peronalized Med TRANSPE, 3333 Calif St,Room 420,Box 0613, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Phillips, Kathryn A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Trosman, Julia R.] Ctr Business Models Healthcare, Chicago, IL USA; [Trosman, Julia R.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Marshall, Deborah A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; UCSF Medical Center; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; University of Calgary,"Phillips, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, Ctr Translat & Policy Res Peronalized Med TRANSPE, 3333 Calif St,Room 420,Box 0613, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",Kathryn.Phillips@ucsf.edu,"Nasarian, Elham/ISB-6863-2023; PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; Marshall, Deborah/J-7248-2015","Douglas, Michael/0000-0001-8517-6678; Marshall, Deborah/0000-0002-8467-8008","National Human Genome Research Institute [R01HG007063]; National Cancer Institute [5P30CA082013-15]; UCSF Mount Zion Health Fund; Canada Research Chair, Health Services and Systems Research; Arthur J.E.

This paper firstly describes the general problem of agricultural land conversion (ALC) in Jambi Province, Indonesia, in particular in connection to the smallholders' role. It is then followed by the brief explanation on factors influencing the smallholders' behaviors. Then, conceptual framework of ABMS in analyzing land conversion as one kind of the land use change/cover (LUCC) processes is presented enriched with agent topologies and the decision-making processes on the agricultural land conversion problem. Finally the proposed model is illustrated through a preliminary case study in Jambi Province, and some scenario on the effect of interaction between farmers and government is described.

Treatment failure is often a result of poor medication adherence. Imperfect adherence in clinical trials may lead to biased estimates of treatment effect and confound the results of cost-effectiveness analyses. Objectives: To estimate the impact of varying medication adherence on the cost effectiveness of lesinurad dual therapy and estimate the value-based price of lesinurad at which the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is equal to 20,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Methods: Treatment effect was simulated using published pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models and scenarios representing adherence in clinical trials, routine practice, and perfect use. The subsequent cost and health impacts, over the lifetime of a patient cohort, were estimated using a bespoke pharmacoeconomic model. Results: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing lesinurad dual ULT with monotherapy ranged from 39,184 pound to 78,350 pound/QALY gained using allopurinol and 31,901 pound to 124,212 pound/QALY gained using febuxostat, depending on the assumed medication adherence. Results assuming perfect medication adherence imply a per-quarter value-based price of lesinurad of 45.14 pound when used in dual ULT compared with allopurinol alone and 57.75 pound compared with febuxostat alone, falling to 25.41 pound and 3.49 pound, respectively, in simulations of worsening medication adherence. Conclusions: The estimated value-based prices of lesinurad only exceeded that which has been proposed in the United Kingdom when assuming both perfect drug adherence and the eradication of gout flares in sustained treatment responders.","[Hill-McManus, Daniel; Hughes, Dyfrig] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Ardudwy Bldg,Normal Site,Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales; [Marshall, Scott; Soto, Elena] Pfizer Ltd, Pharmacometr, Sandwich, Kent, England; [Lane, Steven] Univ Liverpool, Dept Biostat, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Bangor University; Pfizer; University of Liverpool,"Hughes, D (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Ardudwy Bldg,Normal Site,Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"Hill-McManus, Daniel/AAA-9305-2022; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459; Hill-McManus, Daniel/0000-0002-1936-3907","Medical Research Council (MRC) Network of Hubs for Trial Methodological Research [MR/L004933/1-Q25]; MRC North-West Hubs for Trial Methodological Research [MR/K025635/1]; MRC [MR/K025635/1, MR/L004933/1, MR/L004933/2] Funding Source: UKRI",Medical Research Council (MRC) Network of Hubs for Trial Methodological Research; MRC North-West Hubs for Trial Methodological Research; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This study was funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Network of Hubs for Trial Methodological Research (reference no.

However, the understanding of more nuanced ownership arrangements within individual facilities is limited. Utilizing the principal-agent and managerial control frameworks, we study the role of managerial ownership and its relationship to quality among for-profit nursing homes (NHs). We identify NH administrators with more than 5% ownership (owner-manager) from Ohio Medicaid Cost Reports (2005-2010) and link these data to long-stay resident records in the Minimum Data Set. Using differential distance to the nearest NHs with a salaried manager relative to an owner-manager, we address the differential selection into these two types of NHs. After instrumenting for admissions to owner-managed NHs, quality among long-stay residents at owner-managed NHs is generally better than NHs with salaried managers. We find suggestive evidence that the magnitudes of quality difference are larger when the principal-agent problem is likely more pronounced, such as when NHs that are part of a multifacility chain and located in more concentrated markets.","[Huang, Sean Shenghsiu] Georgetown Univ, Dept Hlth Syst Adm, 3700 Reservoir Rd NW,St Marys Hall, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Bowblis, John R.] Miami Univ, Farmer Sch Business, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Bowblis, John R.] Miami Univ, Scripps Gerontol Ctr, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",Georgetown University; University System of Ohio; Miami University; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Huang, SS (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Hlth Syst Adm, 3700 Reservoir Rd NW,St Marys Hall, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",sean.huang@georgetown.edu,,"Bowblis, John/0000-0003-4776-4182",,,,,61,5,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,NOV,2018,27.0,11.0,,,,,1653,1669,,10.1002/hec.3792,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GV7QD,29968263.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446323300002,0

Changes in financial markets may influence how long they remain in practice and how much they choose to work. The 2008 crisis provides a natural experiment to analyze elasticity in physician service supply in response to dramatic financial market changes. We examined quarterly fee-for-service data for specialist physicians over the period from 1999/2000 to 2013/2014 in Canada. We used segmented regression to estimate changes in the number of physicians receiving payments, per-physician service counts, and per-physician payments following the 2008 financial crisis and explored whether patterns differed by physician age. The number of specialist physicians increased more rapidly in the period since 2008 than in earlier years, but increases were largest within the youngest age group, and we observed no evidence of delayed retirement among older physicians. Where changes in service volume and payments were observed, they occurred across all ages and not immediately following the 2008 financial crisis. We conclude that any response to the financial crisis was small compared with demographic shifts in the physician population and changes in payments per service over the same time period.","[Lavergne, M.

We propose a novel three-step procedure to detect the breaks if any and then identify their locations. In the first step, we divide the whole time span into subintervals and fit a conventional factor model on each interval. In the second step, we apply the adaptive fused group Lasso to identify intervals containing a break. In the third step, we devise a grid search method to estimate the location of the break on each identified interval. We show that with probability approaching one our method can identify the correct number of changes and estimate the break locations.

I distinguish two types of addiction: sophisticated and naive. Individuals with sophisticated addiction perfectly control their addiction. Individuals with naive addiction, though otherwise rational and forward looking, fail to fully understand how their addiction develops. I argue that the life cycle consumption pattern predicted for naive addiction is more suitable for motivating empirically observable patterns of addictive goods consumption. I take the case of smoking as unhealthy behavior, calibrate the model with U.S. data, and apply it in order to investigate the life cycle patterns of smoking and quitting smoking and the socioeconomic gradients of unhealthy consumption and longevity.

However, in many settings, a medication and its substitutes and complements face simultaneous differential changes in prices that affect the observed composite PED. We exploit an implementation of a value-based formulary (VBF) that utilized drug-specific incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) to inform drug copayments, resulting in increases in copayments for some medications and decreases in copayments for others. We first show theoretically that by changing the price of a medication and its substitute in opposite directions, VBF designs can leverage cross-price effects to increase the range of composite PEDs. We then empirically estimate PED and welfare effects using a consumer surplus approach. Overall PED was -0.16, similar to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment estimate. However, there was substantial dispersion of PED across the VBF copayment tiers ranging from -0.09 to -0.87 with a statistically significant trend aligned with the levels of value as reflected by the ICER estimates (p<0.001). The net welfare increase was $147,000 for the cohort or $28 per member over the postpolicy year. Further experimentations of VBF designs with alternative cost-effectiveness thresholds, copayment levels and value definitions could be quite promising for improving welfare.","[Yeung, Kai; Basu, Anirban; Hansen, Ryan N.; Sullivan, Sean D.] Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ Inst, 1959 NE Pacific St,Hlth Sci Bldg,Room H-375, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Basu, Anirban] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Yeung, K (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ Inst, 1959 NE Pacific St,Hlth Sci Bldg,Room H-375, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kaiy@u.washington.edu,,"Basu, Anirban/0000-0003-4238-7402",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [R36-11639393]; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [TL1-TR000422],Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)),"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Grant/Award Number: R36-11639393; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, Grant/Award Number: TL1-TR000422",,29,11,11,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,NOV,2018,27.0,11.0,,,,,1788,1804,,10.1002/hec.3801,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GV7QD,30028050.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446323300010,0

The test statistic is a weighted version of the integrated squared difference between the restricted and unrestricted estimators of the joint characteristic function of nonparametric residuals and explanatory variables, whose critical values are estimated with the assistance of a bootstrap technique. The test is sensitive to local alternatives converging to the null at the parametric rate T-1/2, with T the sample size. We investigate the finite sample performance of the test by means of Monte Carlo experiments and two empirical applications to test whether losses are more likely than gains in financial markets, and whether expansions and contractions are equally likely in business cycles, given the relevant information.

Bariatric surgery is cost-effective for severe and resistant obesity. Most economic evaluations of bariatric surgery use administrative data and narrowly defined direct medical costs in their quantitative analyses. Demand far outstrips supply for bariatric surgery. Further allocation of health care resources to bariatric surgery (particularly public) could be stimulated by new health economic evidence that supports the provision of bariatric surgery. We postulated that qualitative research methods would elicit important health economic dimensions of bariatric surgery that would typically be omitted from the current economic evaluation framework, nor be reported and therefore not considered by policymakers with sufficient priority. We listened to patients: Focus group data were analysed thematically with software assistance. Key themes were identified inductively through a dialogue between the qualitative data and pre-existing economic theory (perspective, externalities, and emotional capital). We identified the concept of emotional capital where participants described life-changing desires to be productive and participate in their communities postoperatively. After self-funding bariatric surgery, some participants experienced financial distress. We recommend a mixed-methods approach to the economic evaluation of bariatric surgery. This could be operationalised in health economic model conceptualisation and construction, through to the separate reporting of qualitative results to supplement quantitative results.","[Campbell, Julie A.; Neil, Amanda; Venn, Alison; Sharman, Melanie J.; Palmer, Andrew J.] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Ezzy, Douglas] Univ Tasmania, Sch Sociol, Fac Arts, Sandy Bay, Tas, Australia; [Hensher, Martin] Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; University of Tasmania,"Palmer, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hlth Econ, Med Sci 2 Bldg,17 Liverpool St, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia.",andrew.palmer@utas.edu.au,"Neil, Amanda Louise/K-1212-2019; Ezzy, Douglas/M-6941-2019; Campbell, Julie/IVH-1988-2023; Palmer, Andrew/J-7289-2014; Hensher, Martin/N-4635-2017","Neil, Amanda Louise/0000-0002-1344-6672; Ezzy, Douglas/0000-0002-5078-2288; Palmer, Andrew/0000-0002-9703-7891; Hensher, Martin/0000-0001-6444-6827",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [APP1076899],National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Grant/Award Number: APP1076899",,88,8,8,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,AUG,2018,27.0,8.0,,,,,1300,1318,,10.1002/hec.3776,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL4IN,29855095.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437114300011,0

Currently, treatment costs between 20,000 and 80,000 Australian dollars ($ A) per patient. The Australian Federal Government provided $ A1 billion over 5 years to subsidise these drugs. Objective The aim of this paper was to evaluate the uptake and financial impact of DAA prescribing in Australia. Methods We undertook a retrospective analysis of Medicare prescription and expenditure data for March 2016 to August 2017. Prescription numbers and expenditure data were extracted from the Medicare Statistical Reports website. Numbers of prescriptions were converted to per capita rates. HCV prevalence measures were used to provide context to prescription rates. All costs were reported in $A, year 2017 values. Results Nationally, 211,184 DAA prescriptions were reimbursed. Whilst $A3.6 billion was expended through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, confidential pricing agreements precluded calculation of the precise cost. In 18 months, estimated expenditure greatly exceeded the $A1 billion in funding for 5 years. Nationally, the rate of prescriptions was 872/100,000 individuals. Prescription rates were highest in the Australian Capital Territory (1087/100,000) and lowest in Western Australia (625/ 100,000) despite HCV prevalence being comparable to the national rate in both regions. Conclusions Uptake of DAAs has been enthusiastic in the first 18 months of this funding agreement. However, the lack of transparency due to the confidential special pricing agreements means actual government expenditure is unknown. Post-marketing review by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee may enable renegotiation of DAA prices with the sponsors.","[de Graaff, Barbara; Palmer, Andrew] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Yee, Kwang Chien] Univ Tasmania, Sch Med, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Clarke, Philip] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; University of Tasmania; University of Melbourne,"de Graaff, B (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",Barbara.degraaff@utas.edu.au,"Palmer, Andrew/J-7289-2014","Palmer, Andrew/0000-0002-9703-7891",,,,,27,8,8,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Methods: The AQoL-4D was completed by 1613 individuals with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, psychotic illness in the 2010 Australian National Survey of Psychosis. Utilities were assessed for this sample and 20 subgroups, and were compared with general population norms. Modified Cohen d was used as an index of effect size. Utilities were collapsed into 10 health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) bands or decades. Results: HRQOL in people with psychotic illness was half of the maximum achievable utility (half-full health) with a mean utility of 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-0.51), and showing substantial variability across subgroups. Participants with essentially normal functioning had the highest mean utility (0.72; 95% CI 0.68-0.77), and those with very poor perceived mental health had the lowest (0.22; 95% CI 0.18-0.26). These subgroups showed the most variability. Negative symptoms also gave rise to substantial variation. Among diagnostic categories, only depressive psychosis had a large effect relative to delusional disorders. The distribution of utilities in people with psychotic illness differed markedly from that in the general population, with 6.8% versus 47.2% having values in the highest decade (>0.90-1.00). Utilities were lower in every age group in people with psychosis. Conclusions: Profound HRQOL impacts are revealed by the AQoL-4D in people with psychotic illness, and marked variations in utilities were observed for key subjective and objective measures. We provide a suite of utility values for economic modeling studies and recommend the AQoL-4D for assessing HRQOL in people with psychotic illness.","[Neil, Amanda L.; Morgan, Vera A.] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Private Bag 23, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Carr, Vaughan J.] Univ New South Wales, Res Unit Schizophrenia Epidemiol, Sch Psychiat, St Vincents Hosp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Carr, Vaughan J.] Neurosci Res Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Carr, Vaughan J.] Monash Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sch Clin Sci, Monash Med Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Mackinnon, Andrew] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Mental Hlth, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Mackinnon, Andrew] Black Dog Inst, Randwick, NSW, Australia; [Mackinnon, Andrew] Univ New South Wales, Randwick, NSW, Australia; [Foley, Debra L.] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Epidemiol & Biostat, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Morgan, Vera A.] Univ Western Australia, Neuropsychiat Epidemiol Res Unit, Div Psychiat, Sch Med, Crawley, WA, Australia",University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; NSW Health; St Vincents Hospital Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Neuroscience Research Australia; Monash University; University of Melbourne; Black Dog Institute; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Melbourne; University of Western Australia,"Neil, AL (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Private Bag 23, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",amanda.neil@utas.edu.au,"Neil, Amanda Louise/K-1212-2019; Morgan, Vera/U-4851-2019","Neil, Amanda Louise/0000-0002-1344-6672;",Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing,Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Health & Ageing),"This survey was funded by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing under a contract to The University of Western Australia.

Contemporary economics vilifies monopolies and praises the 'magic wand' of perfect competition without much debate on the merits of these assumptions. The problems with the perfect competition model as applied to healthcare insurance are well established, but exploration of other possible economic models (i.e. monopoly and oligopoly) as a replacement for Obamacare is non-existent.

In other disciplines, a Bayesian approach known as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is far more popular. This paper connects these two seemingly related approaches to likelihood-free estimation by means of a Reverse Sampler that uses both optimization and importance weighting to target the posterior distribution. Its hybrid features enable us to analyze an ABC estimate from the perspective of SMD. We show that an ideal ABC estimate can be obtained as a weighted average of a sequence of SMD modes, each being the minimizer of the deviations between the data and the model. This contrasts with the SMD, which is the mode of the average deviations. Using stochastic expansions, we provide a general characterization of frequentist estimators and those based on Bayesian computations including Laplace-type estimators. Their differences are illustrated using analytical examples and a simulation study of the dynamic panel model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the substantial resources involved in providing these programmes, there is evidence that routine follow-up programmes do not affect survival or the likelihood of detecting recurrence and may not meet patient needs. Alternative follow-up modalities may offer the same outcomes at lower cost. We examined the costs of using telephone-based routine follow-up of women treated for endometrial cancer undertaken by specialist gynaecology oncology nurses in comparison to routine hospital-based follow-up. Methods The ENDCAT trial randomised 259 women at five centres in the north west of England with a known diagnosis of Stage I endometrial cancer who had completed primary treatment on a 1:1 basis to receive either standard hospital outpatient follow-up or a telephone follow-up intervention administered by specialist nurses. A cost-consequence analysis was undertaken in which we compared costs to the health system and to individuals with the trial's co-primary outcomes of psychological morbidity and participant satisfaction with information received. Results Psychological morbidity, psychosocial needs, patient satisfaction and quality of life did not differ between arms. Patients randomised to telephone follow-up underwent more and longer consultations. There was no difference in total health service mean per patient costs at 6 months (mean difference 8 pound, 95% percentile confidence interval: - 147 pound to 141) pound or 12 months (mean difference: - 77 pound, 95% percentile confidence interval: - 334 pound to 154) pound. Estimated return journey costs per patient for hospital consultations were 11.47 pound. Productivity costs were approximately twice as high under hospital follow-up. Conclusion Telephone follow-up was estimated to be cost-neutral for the NHS and may free up clinic time for other patients. There was some evidence that telephone follow-up may be more efficient for patients and wider society, and is not associated with additional psychological morbidity, lower patient satisfaction or reduced quality of life.","[Dixon, Padraig; Hollingworth, William] Univ Bristol, Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol Med Sch, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Dixon, Padraig] Univ Bristol, MRC Integrat Epidemiol Unit, Oakfield House, Bristol BS8 2BN, Avon, England; [Beaver, Kinta; Williamson, Susan; Sutton, Chris; Martin-Hirsch, Pierre] Univ Cent Lancashire, Fac Hlth & Wellbeing, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England; [Martin-Hirsch, Pierre] Lancashire Teaching Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Preston PR2 9HT, Lancs, England",University of Bristol; University of Bristol; University of Central Lancashire,"Dixon, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol Med Sch, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.;Dixon, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, MRC Integrat Epidemiol Unit, Oakfield House, Bristol BS8 2BN, Avon, England.",Padraig.Dixon@bristol.ac.uk; KBeaver@uclan.ac.uk; SWilliamson2@uclan.ac.uk; CJSutton@uclan.ac.uk; Martin.Hirsch@mac.com; William.Hollingworth@bristol.ac.uk,,"Beaver, Kinta/0000-0002-6552-2323; Hollingworth, William/0000-0002-0840-6254; Sutton, Christopher/0000-0002-6406-1318; Dixon, Padraig/0000-0001-5285-409X","National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) under the Research for Patient Benefit programme [PB-PG-0610-22123, 11016, 75220876]; Medical Research Council; University of Bristol [MC_UU_12013/1, MC_UU_12013/9]; Medical Research Council Skills Development Fellowship [MR/P014259/1]; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [PB-PG-0610-22123] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)",National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) under the Research for Patient Benefit programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); University of Bristol; Medical Research Council Skills Development Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"The study was funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) under the Research for Patient Benefit programme (Grant Reference: PB-PG-0610-22123) (UKCRN ID: 11016; ISRCTN: 75220876).

However, reviews of economic evaluations of telemedicine have identified methodological problems in many studies as they do not comply with guidelines. The aim of this study was to examine economic evaluations alongside randomised controlled trials of home monitoring in chronic disease management and hereby to explore the resources included in the programme costs, the types of health-care utilisation that change as a result of home monitoring and discuss the value of economic evaluation alongside randomised controlled trials of home monitoring on the basis of the studies identified. A scoping review of economic evaluations of home monitoring of patients with chronic disease based on randomised controlled trials and including information on the programme costs and the costs of equipment was carried out based on a Medline (PubMed) search. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies include both costs of equipment and use of staff, but there is large variation in the types of equipment and types of tasks for the staff included in the costs. Equipment costs constituted 16-73% of the total programme costs. In six of the nine studies, home monitoring resulted in a reduction in primary care or emergency contacts. However, in total, home monitoring resulted in increased average costs per patient in six studies and reduced costs in three of the nine studies. The review is limited by the small number of studies found and the restriction to randomised controlled trials, which can be problematic in this area due to lack of blinding of patients and healthcare professionals and the difficulty of implementing organisational changes in hospital departments for the limited period of a trial. Furthermore, our results may be based on assessments of older telemedicine interventions.","[Kidholm, Kristian] Odense Univ Hosp, Ctr Innovat Med Technol, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Kristensen, Mie Borch Dahl] MedCom, Forskerpk 10, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; Odense University Hospital,"Kidholm, K (通讯作者)，Odense Univ Hosp, Ctr Innovat Med Technol, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark.",kristian.kidholm@rsyd.dk,,"Kidholm, Kristian/0000-0003-1037-6514",Research Council at Odense University Hospital,Research Council at Odense University Hospital,The review was funded by the Research Council at Odense University Hospital.,,34,10,10,0,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

J,"Carmona, G",,,,"Carmona, Guilherme",,,On the generic robustness of solution concepts to incomplete information,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Robustness; Generic property; Rationalizability; Nash equilibrium,STRUCTURE THEOREM; DYNAMIC-GAMES; RATIONALIZABILITY,"We consider the generic robustness of an upper hemi-continuous solution concept on a class of games of interest which has been embedded in a larger space of games. We show that generic robustness follows if the class of games of interest is large relative to the class of games in which it has been embedded. This result is used to show why interim correlated rationalizable actions are generically robust to players' hierarchies of beliefs as established by Weinstein and Yildiz (2007) even without their richness condition. It is also used to provide a formal sense according to which, in the setting of Kajii and Morris (1997b), the set of representations of a complete information game is small in the space of incomplete information games in which it is embedded.

For stationary random fields on a regular spatial lattice, we propose an autoregressive nonparametric spectral density estimate that is guaranteed positive even when suitable edge-effect correction is employed and is simple to compute using least squares. Our estimate is based on truncating a true half-plane infinite autoregressive representation, while also allowing the truncation length to diverge in all dimensions to avoid the potential bias due to truncation at a fixed lag-length. Uniform consistency of the proposed estimate is established, and new criteria for order selection are also suggested and studied in practical settings. The asymptotic distribution of the estimate is shown to be zero-mean normal and independent at fixed distinct frequencies, mirroring the behaviour for time series. A small Monte Carlo experiment examines finite sample performance. Technically the key to the results is the covariance structure of stationary random fields defined on regularly spaced lattices. We show the covariance matrix to satisfy a generalization of the Toeplitz property familiar from time series analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Since the integrated volatility matrix often has entries with a wide range of variability, universal thresholding estimators do not take the varying entries into consideration and may have unsatisfactory performances. This paper investigates adaptive thresholding estimation of the large integrated volatility matrix. We first construct an estimator for the asymptotic variance of the pre-averaging realized volatility estimator and then use the two estimators to develop an adaptive thresholding estimator of the large volatility matrix. It is shown that the adaptive thresholding estimator can achieve the optimal rate of convergence over the class of the sparse integrated volatility matrix when both the number of assets and sample size are allowed to go to infinity, while the universal thresholding estimator can achieve only the sub-optimal convergence rate. Also we discuss how to harness the adaptive thresholding scheme in the approximate factor model. The simulation study is conducted to check the finite sample performance of the adaptive thresholding estimators. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Methods A Markov model was developed to simulate the therapeutic management, the in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) courses, and the effects of complications in hypothetical cohorts of 30,000 patients undergoing IVF/ICSI with fresh embryo transfer (up to four attempts) using data from the MERIT and MEGASET clinical trials or from French routine ART practice. Results The cost per LB was estimated at (sic)12,145 and at (sic) 14,247 with HP-hMG and rFSH, respectively, using efficacy data from published clinical trials. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was - (sic)11,616 per LB. HP-hMG was less expensive by around (sic)15.0 million and more effective by 1289 additional LBs. Using French clinical data, the cost per LB was (sic)16,415 and (sic)18,7531 with HP-hMG and rFSH, respectively. The ICER for HP-hMG versus rFSH was estimated at - (sic)7,719 per LB with a saving of about (sic)8.54 million and 1097 additional LBs. Deterministic sensitivity analyses showed that the main ICER drivers were the LB rate, followed by the total gonadotropin doses. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that HP-hMG was the dominant strategy in 71.2% of cases using the clinical trial data and in 50.2% of cases using the French data. Conclusion This analysis indicates that compared with rFSH, HP-hMG is less costly for IVF/ICSI management from the French healthcare payer's viewpoint. The results of the present Markov model analysis are consistent with previous findings in other European countries.","[Barriere, Paul] Univ Hosp Nantes, 38 Blvd Jean Monnet, F-44093 Nantes, France; [Porcu-Buisson, Geraldine] Reprod Med Inst IMR, 345 Ave Prado, F-13008 Marseille, France; [Hamamah, Samir] Univ Hosp Montpellier, INSERM, U1203, 371 Av Doyen Gaston Giraud, F-34295 Montpellier, France",Nantes Universite; CHU de Nantes; Universite de Montpellier; CHU de Montpellier; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm),"Hamamah, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Montpellier, INSERM, U1203, 371 Av Doyen Gaston Giraud, F-34295 Montpellier, France.",s-hamamah@chu-montpellier.fr,"HAMAMAH, Samir/AAC-4156-2019",,Ferring SAS France,Ferring SAS France(Ferring Pharmaceuticals),"This study was funded by Ferring SAS France, the manufacturer of Menopur.",,18,7,8,1,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The literature on forecasting has evolved rapidly in the last few years. Several papers have been focused on the use of variable selection methods on large dataset of economic indicators that can potentially improve the forecasting of the main macroeconomic variables. The variable selection methods implemented anyway are always based on economic indicator (soft or hard) released by the Statistical Offices. More recently given the presence of several sources of data on real-time economic activity available from Google, MasterCard, Facebook and many others, the use of Big data for macroeconomic forecasting has started to be exploited. With respect to Official Statistics Big data could provide potentially important complementary information based on different information sets. Moreover, compared to economic indicators, Big data are timely available and, generally, not subject to any revision process. Between different Big data possible sources, data on payment instruments (cheques, credit transfers, direct debits, payment cards) represent a relevant source of information for short-term forecasting of the main macroeconomic variables. Concerning consumption, they capture a wide range of spending activities and are available on a very timely basis. One of the issue of Big data anyway is to structure them in a statistical form. To reach this aim data needs to be controlled for outliers and then seasonally adjusted. The ability of retail payment data to forecast the short-term development of household consumption (both for durable and non-durable goods) has been tested compared to traditional benchmark.","[Bacchini, Fabio; Iannaccone, Roberto; Zurlo, Davide] Istat, Econometr Studies & Econ Forecasting Div, Rome, Italy",,"Bacchini, F (通讯作者)，Istat, Econometr Studies & Econ Forecasting Div, Rome, Italy.",,"Bacchini, Fabio/ACA-1674-2022",,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA,VALENCIA,"CAMINO VERA S-N, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",,,978-84-9048-689-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,268,268,,,,,,1,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN2ZN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000477974500050,0

As the healthcare sector's use of antibiotics is an important contributor to the development of resistance, it is crucial that physicians only prescribe antibiotics when needed and that they choose narrow-spectrum antibiotics, which act on fewer bacteria types, when possible. Inappropriate use of antibiotics is nonetheless widespread, not least for respiratory tract infections (RTI), a common reason for antibiotics prescriptions. We examine if pay-for-performance (P4P) presents a way to influence primary care physicians' choice of antibiotics. During 2006-2013, 8 Swedish healthcare authorities adopted P4P to make physicians select narrow-spectrum antibiotics more often in the treatment of children with RTI. Exploiting register data on all purchases of RTI antibiotics in a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that P4P significantly increased the share of narrow-spectrum antibiotics. There are no signs that physicians gamed the system by issuing more prescriptions overall.","[Ellegard, Lina Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Dietrichson, Jens] SFI, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Anell, Anders] Lund Univ, Dept Business Adm, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Ellegård, LM (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",linamaria.ellegard@nek.lu.se,,"Dietrichson, Jens/0000-0003-4178-7682; Ellegard, Lina Maria/0000-0003-1311-9927",,,,,62,26,26,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JAN,2018,27.0,1.0,,,,,e39,e54,,10.1002/hec.3535,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FV1VI,28685902.0,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424352500004,0

The result is a special +/- statistic which is adjusted to a single player's performance, thus we call it adjusted plus-minus (APM). The goal of this papers is to decide whether a selected NHL player performs well (or at least well enough) and then use the information to estimate team's performance. Therefore, a logistic regression model which aggregates player performances is created. This model allows us to estimate which team is supposed to be well performing.

The concept of metalearning is becoming popular in statistical learning and there is an increasing number of metalearning applications also in the analysis of economic data sets. Still, not much attention has been paid to its limitations and disadvantages. For this purpose, we use various linear regression estimators (including highly robust ones) over a set of 30 data sets with economic background and perform a metalearning study over them as well as over the same data sets after an artificial contamination. We focus on comparing the prediction performance of the least weighted squares estimator with various weighting schemes. A broader spectrum of classification methods is applied and a support vector machine turns out to yield the best results. While results of a leave-1-out cross validation are very different from results of autovalidation, we realize that metalearning is highly unstable and its results should be interpreted with care. We also focus on discussing all possible limitations of the metalearning methodology in general.","[Kalina, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 8, Czech Republic; [Kalina, Jan; Pitra, Zbynek] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Comp Sci, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 8, Czech Republic.;Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Comp Sci, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 8, Czech Republic.",kalina@utia.cas.cz; pitra@cs.cas.cz,"Pitra, Zbyněk/N-9591-2018; Kalina, Jan/E-4287-2012","Kalina, Jan/0000-0002-8491-0364","Czech Science Foundation [17-07384S, 17-01251S]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The research was supported by grants 17-07384S and 17-01251S of the Czech Science Foundation.,,16,0,0,0,0,"MATFYZPRESS PUBL HOUSE, FAC MATH & PHYSICS",PRAHA 8,"CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, SOKOLOVSKA 83, PRAHA 8, 186 75, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7378-372-3,,,,2018,,,,,,,204,209,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO2PI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507455300036,0

METHODS: Study groups included patients randomized to adalimumab or placebo (REVEAL and CHAMPION trials) and those randomized to etanercept or placebo (M10-114 and M10-315 trials). Week 12 outcomes were compared between patients receiving adalimumab and those receiving etanercept after adjusting for cross-trial differences in patient characteristics using propensity score weighting and after subtracting effects of placebo. Outcomes included proportion of patients achieving 75% or more, 90% or more, and 100% reductions from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75, PASI90, PASI100, respectively), symptom resolution (pruritus = 0; psoriatic pain = 0), lesion resolution (minimal scores for plaque signs erythema, desquamation, and induration, and by body regions head, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs), absence of skin-related quality-of-life impact (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] = 0), complete disease control (patient's global assessment [PtGA] = 0), and adverse events. RESULTS: After adjustment, baseline characteristics were balanced among study groups (adalimumab = 875 vs. placebo = 427; etanercept = 260 vs. placebo = 130). Compared with etanercept, adalimumab was associated with significantly better placebo-adjusted outcomes (PASI75: 62.3% vs. 42.6%; PASI90: 35.9% vs. 12.1%; PASI100: 13.1% vs. 4.9%; pruritus: 24.7% vs. 13.0%; psoriatic pain: 27.4% vs. 8.7%; DLQI: 27.7% vs. 11.7%; and PtGA: 16.4% vs. 10.6%; all P < 0.05), except for similar rates of adverse events and head-specific lesion resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with etanercept, adalimumab treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was associated with greater PASI reduction, higher rates of resolution of skin signs and symptoms, and greater improvements in dermatological life quality.

The new fuzzified consistency and coverage measures (denoted by the F-2 and F-3 indices in the paper by Stoklasa et al.) were introduced in 2017 as a reaction to the inability of the original consistency and coverage fuzzified by Ragin in 2008 to deal with ambivalent information present in the data. More specifically, the F-2 and F-3 measures try to remove the ambivalent information inherent in the fuzzy observations i.e. observations with fuzzy values of some or all of the relevant variables. We analyse the performance of all three consistency and coverage measures, assess the ability of the new ones to deal with the ambivalent information and propose a modification of the F-3 consistency and coverage which increases its distinguishing power.

Our main goal is to analyse the conditional structure of the correlation on the European insurance market and to compare systemic risk in different regimes of this market. These regimes are identified by monitoring the weekly rates of returns of eight of the largest insurers (five from Europe and the biggest insurers from the USA, Canada and China) during the period February 2006 to March 2017. To this aim we use statistical clustering methods for time units (weeks) to which we assigned the conditional variances obtained from the estimated copula-DCC-GARCH model. In each of the identified market regimes we determined the commonly used today CoVaR systemic risk measure. From the analysis performed we conclude that all the considered insurance companies are positively correlated and this correlation is stronger in times of turbulences on global markets which shows an increased exposure of the European insurance sector to systemic risk during crisis. Moreover, in times of turbulences on global markets the value level of the CoVaR systemic risk index is much higher than in normal conditions.","[Wanat, Stanislaw; Denkowska, Anna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Math, 27 Rakowicka St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Wanat, S (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Math, 27 Rakowicka St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",wanats@uek.krakow.pl; denkowsa@uek.krakow.pl,,,Faculty of Finance and Law at the Cracow University of Economics by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education,Faculty of Finance and Law at the Cracow University of Economics by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education,The study is supported with subsidies for maintaining research capacity granted to the Faculty of Finance and Law at the Cracow University of Economics by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education.,,22,0,0,0,2,"MATFYZPRESS PUBL HOUSE, FAC MATH & PHYSICS",PRAHA 8,"CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, SOKOLOVSKA 83, PRAHA 8, 186 75, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7378-372-3,,,,2018,,,,,,,630,635,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO2PI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507455300109,0

The number of users who can detect various errors changes dynamically: for instance, there may be new adopters of the software over time. It may also happen that an old user might upgrade and thus run into new incompatibility errors. Allowing new users and errors to enter dynamically poses considerable modeling and estimation difficulties. In the era of Big Data, methods for dynamically updating as new observations arise are important. Traditional models for detecting errors have generally assumed a finite number of errors.

The model can be thought as a generalization of the multivariate regression where the regression coefficient is now an unknown operator Pi. We propose to estimate the operator Pi by Tikhonov regularization, which amounts to apply a penalty on the L-2 norm of Pi. We derive the rate of convergence of the mean square error, the asymptotic distribution of the estimator, and develop tests on Pi. As trajectories are often not fully observed, we consider the scenario where the data become more and more frequent (infill asymptotics). We also address the case where Z is endogenous and instrumental variables are used to estimate Pi. An application to the electricity consumption completes the paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that the LTCI introduction has significant and positive spillover effects on family caregivers' labor force participation and the effects vary by gender and age. In contrast, the LTCI amendment is found to have generally negative spillover effects on their labor force participation.

Both are highly subsidized but in different ways. Medicare pays for most of costs directly in TM, and subsidizes MA plans based on a benchmark for each beneficiary choosing a private plan. The level of this benchmark is arguably the most important policy decision Medicare makes about the MA program. Many analysts recommend equalizing Medicare's subsidy across the options - referred to in policy circles as a level playing field. This paper studies the normative question of how to set the level of the benchmark, applying the versatile model developed by Einav and Finkelstein (EF) to Medicare. The EF framework implies unequal subsidies to counteract risk selection across plan types. We also study other reasons to tilt the field: the relative efficiency of MA vs. TM, market power of MA plans, and institutional features of the way Medicare determines subsidies and premiums. After review of the empirical and policy literature, we conclude that in areas where the MA market is competitive, the benchmark should be set below average costs in TM, but in areas characterized by imperfect competition in MA, it should be raised in order to offset output (enrollment) restrictions by plans with market power. We also recommend specific modifications of Medicare rules to make demand for MA more price elastic.

Although a large number of studies examine the effect of maternal employment on children's adiposity in developed countries, only a few studies investigate the issue in developing countries. Moreover, existing studies tend to suffer from a potential endogeneity issue. AimsWe provide new evidence on the causal effect of maternal employment on children's adiposity in China. Materials and methodsWe employ a difference-in-difference strategy that takes advantage of China's 1995 legislative change to labor regulations, which reduced the number of workdays from 6 to 5 days per week. Using longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), we compare children whose mothers are wage-earning employees to those whose mothers are self-employed because the reform only affected the former. ResultsAlthough maternal employment and childhood obesity in China exhibits the same positive association as in the United States, our difference-in-difference estimates present a different picture. We find that a reduction in the maternal labor supply led to children's weight gain. Further investigation reveals that the effect was stronger among children who were male, younger, in urban areas, and from households with low socioeconomic status. DiscussionOur evidence suggests that a change in maternal behaviors was likely responsible for children's weight gain. In particular, a greater proportion of treatment group mothers cooked and also devoted more time to cooking after the reform, which led to an increased caloric intake by their children. Such weight gain was beneficial for children who were previously underweight but harmful to those who became overweight. ConclusionThe finding implies that additional maternal time at home likely has a different effect in China compared to the United States.","[Wang, Qing] Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, RM 731 PHBS Bldg, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jo, Young] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA",Peking University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Wang, Q (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, RM 731 PHBS Bldg, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",qingwang@phbs.pku.edu.cn,,"Jo, Young A/0000-0003-3019-227X; Wang, Qing/0000-0003-3997-6767","National Institute for Nutrition and Health, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Carolina Population Center [P2C HD050924, T32 HD007168]; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH [R01-HD30880, DK056350, R24 HD050924, R01-HD38700]; NIH Fogarty International Center [D43 TW009077, D43 TW007709]; China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health","National Institute for Nutrition and Health, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Carolina Population Center; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH Fogarty International Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health","We thank Darren Lubotsky, Craig Gundersen, Elizabeth Powers, Julian Reif, and seminar participants at the USDA Economic Research Service, Peking University HSBC Business School, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Various HTA tools and metrics have been developed and refined over the years, including systematic literature reviews (Cochrane), economic modelling, and cost-effectiveness ratios and acceptability curves. However, while the cost-effectiveness ratio is faithfully reported in most full economic evaluations, it is viewed by many as an insufficient basis for reimbursement decisions. Emotional debates about the reimbursement of cancer drugs, orphan drugs, and end-of-life treatments have revealed fundamental disagreements about what should and should not be considered in reimbursement decisions. Part of this disagreement seems related to the equity-efficiency tradeoff, which reflects fundamental differences in priorities. All in all, it is clear that countries aiming to improve UHC policies will have to go beyond the capacity building needed to utilize the available HTA toolbox. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) offers a more comprehensive tool for reimbursement decisions where different weights of different factors/attributes can give policymakers important insights to consider. Sooner or later, every country will have to develop their own way to carefully combine the results of those tools with their own priorities. In the end, all policymaking is based on a mix of facts and values.","[Paolucci, Francesco] Murdoch Univ, Perth, WA, Australia; [Paolucci, Francesco; Fouda, Ayman; Fiorentini, Gianluca] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Redekop, Ken] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Redekop, Ken; Fouda, Ayman] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Murdoch University; University of Bologna; National University of Singapore; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Fouda, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy.;Fouda, A (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",aymanmfouda@gmail.com,"Redekop, Ken/AAA-2423-2020; Fouda, Ayman/AAF-3657-2019; Fouda, Ayman/HGC-3700-2022","Fouda, Ayman/0000-0002-7511-3662; Redekop, Ken/0000-0001-9538-4083; PAOLUCCI, FRANCESCO/0000-0002-6585-7190; Fiorentini, Gianluca/0000-0003-4197-9924; Paolucci, Francesco/0000-0001-6173-5324",,,,,32,8,8,0,16,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Methods: We adapted a UK model to reflect the societal perspective in the Netherlands by including travel expenses, productivity loss, informal care costs, and indirect medical costs during the life-years gained and performed a preliminary value-of-information analysis. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio obtained was (sic)17,600 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. This was robust to changes in most structural assumptions and across different subgroups of patients. Probability sensitivity analysis results showed that the probability that LCZ696 is cost-effective at a (sic)50,000 per QALY threshold is 99.8%, with a population expected value of perfect information of (sic)297,128. On including indirect medical costs of life-years gained, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was (sic)26,491 per QALY gained, and LCZ696 was 99.46% cost effective at (sic)50,000 per QALY, with a population expected value of perfect information of (sic)2,849,647. Conclusions: LCZ696 is cost effective compared with enalapril under the former and current Dutch guidelines. However, the (monetary) consequences of making a wrong decision were considerably different in both scenarios.

Candidates understand the political and economic differences that exist across states and voters care about candidates' policies relative to their ideals, about the frequency of candidates' advertising messages relative to their ideal message frequency, their campaign tolerance level, and vote taking into account their perceptions of candidates' traits and competencies with their vote also depending on their sociodemographic characteristics. In the local Nash equilibrium, candidates give maximal weight to undecided voters and swing states and little weight to committed voters and states. These endogenous weights pin down candidates' campaign and depend on the probability with which voters choose each candidate which depends on candidates' policies and advertising campaigns. Weights vary across candidates' policy and ad campaigns, reflecting the importance voters in each state give to the two dimensions and the variation in voters' preferences across states.

Unlike New Keynesian models that show similar price stickiness results, the market game model does not require enforcing menu costs or other additional restraints on price adjustment mechanisms in order to generate price stickiness. As such, we suggest that the market game model can provide a good micro-foundation for macroeconomic analysis. We then explicitly show the relationship between a typical firm's markup of price over marginal cost and its market share. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The Assessment of the Geographical Spillover Effects of Emergency Contraception on Abortions",HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,emergency contraception; Plan B; abortion; pregnancy; border-hopping; distance; spillover,PARENTAL CONSENT; INCREASED ACCESS; IMPACT; STATE; LAWS; RESTRICTIONS; PREGNANCY; PHARMACIES; FERTILITY; POLICIES,"Washington was the first state to ease the prescription requirements making emergency contraception (EC) available behind-the-counter at pharmacies to women of any age in 1998. Using county-level vital statistics data in conjunction with the pharmacy specific location data from the Not-2-Late Hotline database, I study whether the increased access to EC affects fertility rates within the state and beyond the borders of the state that allows it. Unlike other studies that rely on geographic variations in access, I show that increased availability of EC in Washington, measured by the distance to the closest no-prescription EC pharmacy', is associated with a statistically significant albeit economically moderate decrease in abortion rates in Washington counties where women had access to no-prescription EC'. These effects are localized (i.e., decrease with travel distance) and robust in a number of specifications. Finally, I find some evidence in support of geographical spillover effects in Idaho, but not in Oregon. However, after accounting for the availability of abortion services, the decrease in treated' Idaho counties is rather small.

(2014) which is the mirror image of the conventional nested lottery contest of Clark and Riis (1996). We show that under the reverse-lottery technology, a single-stage winner-take-all grand contest dominates all other feasible designs when the contest is sufficiently noisy. This result is in dramatic contrast to the conventional wisdom on the optimality of multistage elimination contests that is grounded under the conventional nested lottery contest technology in the literature. In the framework of a noisy-performance ranking model, the conventional and reverse models differ only in the noise on players' performance. Our study therefore reveals the important role that the noise term plays in modeling imperfectly discriminatory contests. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We apply this new model to a dataset composed by 133 Italian hospitals during the period 2008-2013. We show that average total inefficiency is about 23%, higher than previous estimates; hence, a model where the different types of inefficiency and hospital unobserved characteristics are not confounded allows us to get less biased estimates of hospital inefficiency. Moreover, we find that transient efficiency is more important than persistent efficiency, as it accounts for 60% of the total one. Last, we find that ownership (for-profit hospitals are more transiently inefficient and less persistently inefficient than not-for-profit ones, whereas public hospitals are less transiently inefficient than not-for-profit ones), specialization (specialized hospitals are more transiently inefficient than general ones; i.e., there is evidence of scope economies in short-run efficiency), and size (large-sized hospitals are better than medium and small ones in terms of transient inefficiency) are determinants of both types of inefficiency, although we do not find any statistically significant effect of multihospital systems and teaching hospitals.","[Colombi, Roberto; Martini, Gianmaria] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Bergamo, Italy; [Vittadini, Giorgio] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Stat & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy",University of Bergamo; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Martini, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Bergamo, Italy.",gianmaria.martini@unibg.it,"Martini, Gianmaria/N-6165-2016; Vittadini, Giorgio/J-8543-2016","Martini, Gianmaria/0000-0001-9503-4999; Vittadini, Giorgio/0000-0002-0375-9763",,,,,82,39,39,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,SEP,2017,26.0,,,2,,,5,22,,10.1002/hec.3557,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FH7GV,28940917.0,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411353600002,0

The focus of the paper is on investigating the properties of the model. More specifically, upon presentation of the logic behind the model, the discussion goes on to investigate the effects of social structural conditions (i.e., margins of an association matrix) on the model parameters especially those referring to the strength of the homophily bias. This investigation leads to a reformulation of the problem of salience of a characteristic for association, defined, after Blau (1977) and Skvoretz (1983), in terms of the difference between the actual frequency of intra-group ties and the frequency expected under randomness. The attraction model is then compared with the log-linear model of quasi-independence. The objective of this comparisons is a precise specification of the attraction model's explanatory scope. The paper ends with an illustrative application of the model to GSS data on confiding relations along ethnicity and religious affiliation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The model contains statistical noise, potentially endogenous regressors, and technical inefficiency that follows the scaling property, in the sense that it is the product of a basic (half-normal) inefficiency term and a parametric function of the environmental variables. The environmental variables may be endogenous because they are correlated with the statistical noise or with the basic inefficiency term. Several previous papers have considered the case of inputs that are endogenous because they are correlated with statistical noise, and if they contain environmental variables these are exogenous. One recent paper allows the environmental variables to be correlated with statistical noise. Our paper is the first to allow both the inputs and the environmental variables to be endogenous in the sense that they are correlated either with statistical noise or with the basic inefficiency term. Correlation of inputs or environmental variables with the basic inefficiency term raises non-trivial conceptual issues about the meaning of exogeneity, and technical issues of estimation of the model.

This yields a representation result where ambiguous distributions of objective beliefs are first aggregated into equivalent unambiguous beliefs and then risk preferences are used to compute the utility of these equivalent unambiguous beliefs. Such an approach makes it possible to disentangle uncertainty aversion, related to the processing of information, from risk aversion, related to the evaluation of the equivalent unambiguous beliefs. An application to portfolio choice shows the tractability of the framework and its intuitive appeal. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although no side payments or commitments are allowed, there exists a family of equilibria in which sellers use communication to collude on a subset of participants and/or reveal information about their cost. Cheap talk matters in the sense that it strictly enlarges the set of Nash equilibria (symmetric and asymmetric) and the set of public correlated equilibria of the game. I show that the buyer may benefit from cheap talk between sellers and that the surplus increases in the amount of information revealed in equilibrium under one fairly general condition. This is because when communication is cheap, sellers cannot directly collude on higher prices. Rather, communication leads to competition between fewer, but more aggressive bidders, which entails greater allocative efficiency and a decrease in the total wasteful entry cost.

Integrating insurers' activities for risk selection into a discrete choice model of individuals' health insurance choice shows that DRS has the structure of a contest. For the contest success function (csf) used in most of the contest literature (the Tullock-csf), optimal transfers for a risk adjustment scheme have to be determined by means of a restricted quantile regression, irrespective of whether insurers are primarily engaged in positive DRS (attracting low risks) or negative DRS (repelling high risks). This is at odds with the common practice of determining transfers by means of a least squares regression. However, this common practice can be rationalized for a new csf, but only if positive and negative DRSs are equally important; if they are not, optimal transfers have to be calculated by means of a restricted asymmetric least squares regression. Using data from German and Swiss health insurers, we find considerable differences between the three types of regressions. Optimal transfers therefore critically depend on which csf represents insurers' incentives for DRS and, if it is not the Tullock-csf, whether insurers are primarily engaged in positive or negative DRS.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study identified the first pharmacy or medical claim for ADA or IFX (from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2014) in patients with continuous enrollment for 6 months or more preindex and 12 months or more postindex, with one or more UC diagnosis claim 6 months pre- or postindex. TNFi discontinuation was defined as a therapy gap of 56 days or more for ADA and 112 days or more for IFX. TNFi switch was defined as nonindex TNFi initiation. Health care resource utilization and costs were characterized quarterly according to treatment patterns. Results: The study population comprised 295 patients: mean age 50.9 years, 50.5% females, and 61.7% in southern United States. At the index date, 17% of patients received ADA and 83% received IFX. Treatment discontinuation was observed in 52% of ADA and 45% of IFX users through 12 months postindex (mean time 19 and 22 weeks, respectively). Among discontinuers, 46% of ADA and 68% of IFX users did not restart/switch TNFi. ADA and IFX showed mean times to switch of 18 and 30 weeks, respectively. TNFi discontinuers had the lowest mean quarterly total health care cost ($3,935) versus patients who initiated/switched TNFi ($15,004).

Lessons Learned from European Countries,APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY,,,English,Review,,,,,,,RISK-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS; GENERIC MEDICINES; MANAGED ENTRY; ORPHAN DRUGS; PRIMARY-CARE; PHARMACEUTICALS; PRICES; IMPLEMENTATION; IMPACT; MARKET,"This article discusses pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement policies in European countries with regard to their ability to ensure affordable access to medicines. A frequently applied pricing policy is external price referencing. While it provides some benchmark for policy-makers and has been shown to be able to generate savings, it may also contribute to delay in product launch in countries where medicine prices are low. Value-based pricing has been proposed as a policy that promotes access while rewarding useful innovation; however, implementing it has proven quite challenging. For high-priced medicines, managed-entry agreements are increasingly used. These agreements allow policymakers to manage uncertainty and obtain lower prices. They can also facilitate earlier market access in case of limited evidence about added therapeutic value of the medicine. However, these agreements raise transparency concerns due to the confidentiality clause. Tendering as used in the hospital and offpatent outpatient sectors has been proven to reduce medicine prices but it requires a robust framework and appropriate design with clear strategic goals in order to prevent shortages. These pricing and reimbursement policies are supplemented by the widespread use of Health Technology Assessment to inform decision-making, and by strategies to improve the uptake of generics, and also biosimilars. While European countries have been implementing a set of policy options, there is a lack of thorough impact assessments of several pricing and reimbursement policies on affordable access. Increased cooperation between authorities, experience sharing and improving transparency on price information, including the disclosure of confidential discounts, are opportunities to address current challenges.","[Vogler, Sabine; Schneider, Peter] Gesundheit Osterreich GmbH, WHO Collaborating Ctr Pharmaceut Pricing & Reimbu, Pharmacoecon Dept, Austrian Publ Hlth Inst, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Paris, Valerie] OECD, Hlth Div, F-75116 Paris, France; [Ferrario, Alessandra] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ferrario, Alessandra] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Wirtz, Veronika J.] Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [de Joncheere, Kees] WHO, Essential Med & Hlth Prod Dept EMP, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland; [Pedersen, Hanne Bak; Dedet, Guillaume] WHO, Reg Off Europe, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Babar, Zaheer-Ud-Din] Univ Auckland, Sch Pharm, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Auckland 92019, New Zealand",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Boston University; World Health Organization; World Health Organization; University of Auckland,"Vogler, S (通讯作者)，Gesundheit Osterreich GmbH, WHO Collaborating Ctr Pharmaceut Pricing & Reimbu, Pharmacoecon Dept, Austrian Publ Hlth Inst, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",sabine.vogler@goeg.at,"MUSARAJ, ADANELA/IWD-9628-2023; Babar, Zaheer-Ud-Din/AFQ-8221-2022; Musaraj, Adanela/J-7536-2012; Wirtz, Veornika/AAG-9712-2019","MUSARAJ, ADANELA/0000-0002-4112-470X; Babar, Zaheer-Ud-Din/0000-0003-1051-3240; Ferrario, Alessandra/0000-0002-1572-3581; Vogler, Sabine/0000-0003-4853-4397; Wirtz, Veronika J./0000-0002-0863-8768; Bak Pedersen, Hanne/0000-0002-1251-0716",,,,,152,90,93,5,45,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Whether insurance status influences a patient's hospital charge has not been explored. Objective The objective of this study was to determine whether hospitals charge patients differently based on their insurance status. Methods This was an analysis of the Florida Hospital Inpatient Data File for fiscal years 2011-2012 (N = 4.7 million). Multivariable regression analysis was used to adjust for patients' age, sex, length of stay, priority of admission, principal ICD-9-CM diagnosis, and All Payer Refined Diagnosis-Related Group subdivided by Severity of Illness subclass. Hospital fixed effects were included to account for differences in hospitals' markups. Results Compared with those with no insurance, patients with private insurance received hospital bills that were an average of 10.7% higher and patients with Medicare received bills that were an average of 8.9% higher. The impact of Medicaid coverage was imprecisely estimated, but the magnitude of the point-estimate was consistent with 3.5% higher charges to Medicaid patients, relative to the uninsured. Conclusion Conditional on patient characteristics, length of stay, and expected intensity of resource utilization, patients with private insurance and patients with Medicare were charged more (before discounting) than their uninsured counterparts within the same hospital.","[Woodworth, Lindsey] Univ South Carolina, Dept Econ, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Romano, Patrick S.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Div Gen Med, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Holmes, James F.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Emergency Med, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Woodworth, L (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Dept Econ, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",lindsey.woodworth@moore.sc.edu,"Romano, Patrick S/N-4225-2014",,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [T32HS022236],Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),"This study was supported by a Grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) through the Quality, Safety, and Comparative Effectiveness Research Training (QSCERT) Program (T32HS022236).",,26,14,15,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

In 2011, Brandt proposed a new tournament solution called the minimal extending set (ME) and an associated graph-theoretic conjecture. If the conjecture had been true, ME would have satisfied a number of desirable properties that are usually considered in the literature on tournament solutions. However, in 2013, the existence of an enormous counter-example to the conjecture was shown using a non-constructive proof. This left open which of the properties are actually satisfied by ME. It turns out that ME satisfies idempotency, irregularity, and inclusion in the iterated Banks set (and hence the Banks set, the uncovered set, and the top cycle). Most of the other standard properties (including monotonicity, stability, and computational tractability) are violated, but have been shown to hold for all tournaments on up to 12 alternatives and all random tournaments encountered in computer experiments.

We first extend existing results in the literature, developed for conditional sum-of-squares estimators in the context of parametric fractional time series models driven by conditionally homoskedastic shocks, to allow for conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity both of a quite general and unknown form. Global consistency and asymptotic normality are shown to still obtain; however, the covariance matrix of the limiting distribution of the estimator now depends on nuisance parameters derived both from the weak dependence and heteroskedasticity present in the shocks. We then investigate classical methods of inference based on the Wald, likelihood ratio and Lagrange multiplier tests for linear hypotheses on either or both of the long and short memory parameters of the model. The limiting null distributions of these test statistics are shown to be non-pivotal under heteroskedasticity, while that of a robust Wald statistic (based around a sandwich estimator of the variance) is pivotal. We show that wild bootstrap implementations of the tests deliver asymptotically pivotal inference under the null. We demonstrate the consistency and asymptotic normality of the bootstrap estimators, and further establish the global consistency of the asymptotic and bootstrap tests under fixed alternatives. Monte Carlo simulations highlight significant improvements in finite sample behavior using the bootstrap in both heteroskedastic and homoskedastic environments. Our theoretical developments and Monte Carlo simulations include two bootstrap algorithms which are based on model estimates obtained either under the null hypothesis or unrestrictedly. Our simulation results suggest that the former is preferable to the latter, displaying superior size control yet largely comparable power. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We provide the first comprehensive assessment of these provisions' effects, using the 2012-2015 American Community Survey and a triple difference estimation strategy that exploits variation by income, geography, and time. Overall, our model explains 60% of the coverage gains in 2014-2015. We find that coverage was moderately responsive to price subsidies, with larger gains in state-based insurance exchanges than the federal exchange. The individual mandate's exemptions and penalties had little impact on coverage rates. The law increased Medicaid among individuals gaining eligibility under the ACA and among previously-eligible populations (woodwork effect) even in non-expansion states, with no resulting reductions in private insurance. Overall, exchange premium subsidies produced 40% of the coverage gains explained by our ACA policy measures, and Medicaid the other 60%, of which 1/2 occurred among previously-eligible individuals.

Methods A deterministic, age-structured, dynamic transmission model was used to simulate the transmission of influenza in the French population, using the current vaccination coverage with trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) in at-risk/elderly individuals (current strategy) or gradually extending the vaccination to healthy children (aged 2-17 years) with intranasal, quadrivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (QLAIV) from current uptake up to 50% (evaluated strategy). Epidemiological, medical resource use and cost data were taken from international literature and country-specific information. The model was calibrated to the observed numbers of influenza-like illness visits/year. The 10-year number of symptomatic cases of confirmed influenza and direct medical costs ('all-payer') were calculated for the 0-17-(direct and indirect effects) and >= 18-year-old (indirect effect). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated for the total population, using a 4% discount rate/year. Results Assuming 2.3 million visits/year and 1960 deaths/year, the model calibration yielded an all-year average basic reproduction number (R-0) of 1.27. In the population aged 0-17 years, QLAIV prevented 865,000 influenza cases/year (58.4%), preventing 10-year direct medical expenses of (sic)374 million. In those aged >= 18 years with unchanged TIV coverage, 1.2 million cases/year were averted (27.6%) via indirect effects (additionally prevented expenses, (sic)457 million). On average, 613 influenza-related deaths were averted annually overall. The ICER was (sic)18,001/life-year gained. The evaluated strategy had a 98% probability of being cost-effective at a (sic)31,000/life-year gained threshold. Conclusions The model demonstrated strong direct and indirect benefits of protecting healthy children against influenza with QLAIV on public health and economic outcomes in France.","[Gerlier, L.; Lamotte, M.] QuintilesIMS Real World Evidence Solut, Davos Bldg,Da Vincilaan 7, B-1935 Zaventem, Belgium; [Greneche, S.] AstraZeneca, Rueil Malmaison, France; [Lenne, X.] Univ Lille Nord France, Dept Med Informat, Lille, France; [Carrat, F.] UPMC Univ Paris 06, INSERM, Sorbonne Univ, IPLESP,UMRS 1136, Paris, France; [Carrat, F.] St Antoine Hosp, AP HP, Dept Publ Hlth, Paris, France; [Weil-Olivier, C.] Univ Paris VII, Dept Pediat, Paris, France; [Damm, O.] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Bielefeld, Germany; [Schwehm, M.] ExploSYS GmbH, Leinfelden Echterdingen, Germany; [Eichner, M.] Univ Tubingen, Inst Clin Epidemiol & Appl Biometry, Tubingen, Germany; [Eichner, M.] Epimos GmbH, Dusslingen, Germany",IQVIA; AstraZeneca; Universite de Lille; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Sorbonne Universite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Saint-Antoine - APHP; Universite Paris Cite; University of Bielefeld; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Gerlier, L (通讯作者)，QuintilesIMS Real World Evidence Solut, Davos Bldg,Da Vincilaan 7, B-1935 Zaventem, Belgium.",Laetitia.Gerlier@quintilesims.com,"Carrat, Fabrice/AAU-8480-2020","Carrat, Fabrice/0000-0002-8672-7918",AstraZeneca France,AstraZeneca France(AstraZeneca),This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from AstraZeneca France.,,48,9,13,1,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

This paper points to a problem with the CCE approach that appears in the empirically relevant case when the number of factors is strictly less than the number of observables used in their estimation. Specifically, the use of too many observables causes the second moment matrix of the estimated factors to become asymptotically singular, an issue that has not yet been appropriately accounted for.

Unfortunately, data quality issues and interviewer effects were observed in the first few EQ-5D-5L valuation studies. To prevent these issues from occurring in later studies, the EuroQol Group established a cyclic quality control (QC) process. Objectives: To describe this QC process and show its impact on data quality. Methods: A newly developed QC tool provided information about protocol compliance, interviewer effects, and mean values by health state severity. In a cyclic process, this information is initially used to evaluate whether new interviewers meet minimal quality requirements and later to provide feedback about how their performance may be improved. To investigate the impact of this cyclic process, we compared the quality of the data in Dutch and Spanish valuation studies that did not have this QC process with that in the follow-up studies in the same countries that used the QC process. Data quality was measured using protocol violations, variability between interviewers, the proportion of inconsistent responders, and clustering of composite time trade-off values. Results: In Spain, protocol violations were reduced from 87% in the valuation study to 5% in the followup study and in the Netherlands from 20% to 8%. In both countries, interviewers performed more homogeneously in the follow-up studies. The number of inconsistent respondents was reduced by 23.2% in Spain and 23.6% in the Netherlands. Values were less clustered in the follow-up studies. Conclusions: The implementation of a strict QC process in EQ-5D-5L valuation studies increases interviewer protocol compliance and promotes data quality.","[Ramos-Goni, Juan M.; Oppe, Mark; Slaap, Bernhard; Stolk, Elly] EuroQol Res Fdn, Execut Off, Marten Meesweg 107, NL-3068 AV Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Busschbach, Jan J.

Population health is not only fundamental to economic growth but also affects short-term and long-term government expenditure on health care, disability, and other social programs and influences direct and indirect tax receipts. Fiscal transfers between citizen and state are mostly ignored in conventional welfare economics analyses based on the hypothesis that there are no winners or losers through transference of wealth. However, from the government perspective, this position is flawed, as disability costs and lost taxes attributed to poor health and reduced productive output represent real costs that pose budgetary and growth implications. To address the value of health and health care investments for government, we have developed a fiscal health analytic framework that captures how changes in morbidity and mortality influence tax revenue and transfer costs (e.g., disability, allowances, ongoing health costs). The framework can be used to evaluate the marginal impact of discrete investments or a mix of interventions in health care to inform governmental budgetary consequences. In this context, the framework can be considered as a fiscal budget impact and/or cost benefit analysis model that accounts for how morbidity and mortality linked to specific programs represent both ongoing costs and tax revenue for government. Mathematical models identical to those used in cost-effectiveness analyses can be employed in fiscal analysis to reflect how disease progression influences public accounts (e.g., tax revenue and transfers).","[Connolly, Mark P.; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon, Groningen, Netherlands; [Connolly, Mark P.; Kotsopoulos, Nikolaos] Global Market Access Solut, St Prex, Switzerland; [Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Inst Sci Hlth Aging & healthcaRE SHARE, Groningen, Netherlands; [Bhatt, Aomesh] John Radcliffe Hosp, Oxford, Oxon, England",University of Groningen; University of Groningen; University of Oxford,"Connolly, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm PharmacoEcon & PharmacoEpidemiol, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.connolly@rug.nl,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; Bhatt, Aomesh/0000-0001-6206-0576; KOTSOPOULOS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0002-8248-7697",,,,,22,31,32,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2017,20.0,2.0,,,,,273,277,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.11.018,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HX,28237208.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396450400017,0

Regulators at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the US Food and Drug Administration make a clinical benefit-risk assessment to determine whether to approve a new drug. Benefits of a drug are typically quantified directly, as an assessment of efficacy. CDER defines risk as the intersection of the severity of possible harm and the probability of that harm.

In the U.S., the largest such system is under Workers' Compensation (WC), where the treatment workers with injuries that are not definitively tied to a work accident may be billed either under group health insurance plans or under WC. We document that there is significant reclassification of injuries from group health plans into WC, or claims shifting, when the financial incentives to do so are strongest. In particular, we find that injuries to workers enrolled in capitated group health plans (such as HMOs) see a higher incidence of their claims for soft-tissue injuries (which are hard to classify specifically as work related) under WC than under group health, relative to those in non-capitated plans. Such a pattern is not evident for workers with traumatic injuries. Moreover, we find that such reclassification is more common in states with higher WC fees, once again for soft tissue but not traumatic injuries. Our results imply that a significant shift towards capitated reimbursement, or reimbursement reductions, under GH could lead to a large rise in the cost of WC plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Agents first form their partnerships and then choose their investment in the contest. While a link improves the strength of an agent, it also improves the position of her rival. It is thus not obvious that they decide to cooperate. We characterize all pairwise equilibrium networks and find that the network formation process can act as a barrier to entry to the contest. We then analyze the impact of network formation on total surplus and find that a social planner can increase total surplus by creating more asymmetry between agents, as long as this does not reduce the number of participating agents. We show that barriers to entry may either hurt total surplus, as the winner of the prize does not exploit all the possible network benefits, or improve total surplus since less rent is dissipated when competition becomes less fierce. Finally, when networking acts as an endogenous barrier to entry, no pairwise equilibrium network is efficient. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study employs a desk research over secondary data, including the Corruption Perception Index, Ease of Doing Business, Global Competitiveness Index, and government reports. It suggests that failing supports of the transparency to eradicate the corruption deal with certain problems as follows: inappropriate transparency, deficiency of complaint mechanism, the misuse of authority by local leader, the low awareness and permissiveness of the society that meet the moral hazard of the bureaucrats and the institutional problems within One Stop Service agency. To solve these problems, it should be considered to strengthen the capacity of the society through a building awareness to complain and to increase the capability of the bureaucrats to translate the transparency into concrete and workable implementation.","[Holidin, Defny; Hariyati, Desy] Univ Indonesia, Fac Adm Sci, Depok, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Holidin, D (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Fac Adm Sci, Depok, Indonesia.",defny@ui.ac.id; desy.hariyati@gmail.com,"Holidin, Defny/AAG-1995-2020","Holidin, Defny/0000-0002-1076-8318",,,,,21,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-427-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,167.0,,,,,,117,127,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Political Science; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Government & Law,BJ6IT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426719600018,0

To carry out this tremendous challenge, Suharto appointed a group of talented economist from the University of Indonesia who mostly were graduated from the United States best known as the Technocrats. The Technocrats were able to assist Suharto in restoring and even delivering an unprecedented economic growth of more than 5% with full support from the international community during the late 1960s to the early 1990s. However, in the next stage, the Technocrats had to face even more challenges as they confronted vested interest groups when they tried to push for substantial economic governance reform, like the so called 'financial generals', conglomerates and nationalist bureaucrats. This article will provide an analysis on the political aspects of the Technocrats embarking on this economic governance reform and identifying the extent of the progress of this reform. This article reveals how the Technocrats were eventually overwhelmed by their political adversary, thus was only able to deliver limited economic governance reform.

Our approach is fully nonparametric in the way that it handles differences in circumstances and provides decompositions of both a rank-dependent relative (the Gini coefficient) and a rank-independent absolute inequality index (the variance). The decompositions distinguish the contribution of effort from the direct and indirect (through effort) contribution of circumstances to the total inequality. Our approach is illustrated by an empirical application that uses objectively measured biomarkers as health outcomes and as proxies for relevant effort variables. Using data from the Health Survey for England from 2003 to 2012, we find that circumstances are the leading determinant of inequality in cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin, and in a combined ill-health index whereas effort plays a substantial role in explaining inequality in fibrinogen only.","[Carrieri, Vincenzo] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Fisciano, Italy; [Carrieri, Vincenzo] Univ York, Hlth Econometr & Data Grp, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Carrieri, Vincenzo] RWI Res Network, Essen, Germany; [Jones, Andrew M.] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Jones, Andrew M.] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Salerno; University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Monash University,"Carrieri, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo II, I-84084 Salerno, Italy.",vcarrieri@unisa.it,"Carrieri, Vincenzo/AAS-9319-2021; Jones, Andrew/C-3402-2008","Carrieri, Vincenzo/0000-0001-8742-3820; Jones, Andrew/0000-0003-4114-1785",Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship [MRF-2016-004],Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship(Leverhulme Trust),"Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: MRF-2016-004",,51,24,24,10,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2018,27.0,12.0,,,,,1981,1995,,10.1002/hec.3814,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GZ7PM,30091293.0,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449674000006,0

The mean age of the interviewees was 43.9 16.3 years, and 326 (50.1%) of them were male. To each interviewee, we presented one of the hypothetical health scenarios that were used in the European value of a QALY project. Questionnaires, which were validated for the Persian language, were administered in digitally-assisted format, and a gray block questionnaire was used for special cases. The data were then analyzed using STATA and SPSS.ResultsThe overall mean value of payment for one QALY of respondents who expressed WTP was US$2847, which is equal to 0.57 of the GDP per capita of Iran's population. Under the end-of-life (terminal illness) scenario, this value was 13% higher than health-gain scenarios. WTP was also associated with high educational level, household income, and household expenditure.Conclusion Our results provided a threshold range of WTP and insights into rigorous scientific decision making about healthcare technology for the future.","[Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri; Ghahramani, Sulmaz; Honarvar, Behnam] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Inst Hlth, Hlth Policy Res Ctr, Shiraz, Iran; [Moradi, Najmeh] Iran Univ Med Sci, Hlth Management & Econ Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Shahraki, Hadi Raeisi] Shahrekord Univ Med Sci, Fac Hlth, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Shahrekord, Iran; [Lotfi, Farhad] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth Management & Informat Sci, Hlth Human Resources Res Ctr, Shiraz, Iran",Shiraz University of Medical Science; Iran University of Medical Sciences; Shahrekord University Medical Sciences; Shiraz University of Medical Science,"Ghahramani, S (通讯作者)，Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Inst Hlth, Hlth Policy Res Ctr, Shiraz, Iran.",Suli.ghahraman@gmail.com,"Moradi, Najmeh/S-9485-2019; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri/P-2066-2017; Lankarani, Kamran B/P-5336-2019; lankarani, kamran b/D-5901-2012; Raeisi Shahraki, hadi/AAL-9981-2020; Moradi, Najmeh/ABB-3402-2020; Ghahramani, Sulmaz/S-3942-2019; Honarvar, Behnam/K-1623-2013","Lankarani, Kamran B/0000-0002-7524-9017; Raeisi Shahraki, hadi/0000-0003-3071-5587; Moradi, Najmeh/0000-0003-4172-4411; Ghahramani, Sulmaz/0000-0002-4161-5146; Honarvar, Behnam/0000-0002-1081-5778",Deputy of Research of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences [94-01-62-10923],Deputy of Research of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences,This study was funded by Deputy of Research of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Research ID: 94-01-62-10923).,,24,12,12,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Although most programs incentivize formal health providers, some constraints to utilization might be better alleviated by incentivizing other actors in the health care system. This paper presents results from a randomized controlled trial set to evaluate the effects of two incentive schemes that were introduced on top of Rwanda's national Performance-Based Financing program at the health facility level. One scheme rewarded community health worker cooperatives for the utilization of five services by their communities. The second scheme provided in-kind transfers to users of three services. The analysis finds no impact of the cooperative performance payments on coverage of the targeted services, behaviors of community health workers, or outcomes at the cooperative level. Although health centers experienced frequent stock outs of the gifts, the demand-side intervention significantly increased timely antenatal care by 9.3 percentage points and timely postnatal care by 8.6 percentage points. This study shows that demand-side incentives can increase service utilization also when provided in addition to a supply-side pay-for-performance scheme.","[Shapira, Gil] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Mailstop MC 3-311,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Kalisa, Ina; Humuza, James] Univ Rwanda, Sch Publ Hlth, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Kigali, Rwanda; [Condo, Jeanine] Rwanda Biomed Ctr, Kigali, Rwanda; [Mugeni, Cathy; Nkunda, Denis] Minist Hlth, Kigali, Rwanda; [Walldorf, Jeanette] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",The World Bank; University of Rwanda; Rwanda Biomedical Center; Copenhagen Business School,"Shapira, G (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Mailstop MC 3-311,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gshapira@worldbank.org,,,Health Results Innovation Trust Fund,Health Results Innovation Trust Fund,Health Results Innovation Trust Fund,,36,12,12,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2018,27.0,12.0,,,,,2087,2106,,10.1002/hec.3822,0.0,,,20,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GZ7PM,30159944.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449674000012,0

However, the types and magnitude of measurement error that relate to different recall periods are not well understood. This study assessed the accuracy of recalled doctor visits over 2-week, 3-month, and 12-month periods by comparing self-report with routine administrative Australian Medicare data. Approximately 5,000 patients enrolled in an Australian study were pseudo-randomised using birth dates to report visits to a doctor over three separate recall periods. When comparing patient recall with visits recorded in administrative information from Medicare Australia, both bias and variance were minimised for the 12-month recall period. This may reflect telescoping that occurs with shorter recall periods (participants pulling in important events that fall outside the period). Using shorter recall periods scaled to represent longer periods is likely to bias results. There were associations between recall error and patient characteristics. The impact of recall error is demonstrated with a cost-effectiveness analysis using costs of doctor visits and a regression example predicting number of doctor visits. The findings have important implications for surveying health service utilisation for use in economic evaluation, econometric analyses, and routine national health surveys.","[Dalziel, Kim; Clarke, Philip] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Global & Populat Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Li, Jinhu; Scott, Anthony] Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Dalziel, K (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Global & Populat Hlth, Ctr Hlth Policy, Level 4,207 Bouverie St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",kim.dalziel@unimelb.edu.au,"Scott, Anthony/E-6636-2010; Li, Jinhu/N-8954-2014","Scott, Anthony/0000-0002-2851-5378; Dalziel, Kim/0000-0003-4972-8871; Li, Jinhu/0000-0002-6896-9518",Diabetes Care Project; University of Melbourne,Diabetes Care Project; University of Melbourne(University of Melbourne),The Diabetes Care Project; The University of Melbourne,,24,27,27,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,NOV,2018,27.0,11.0,,,,,1684,1698,,10.1002/hec.3794,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GV7QD,29968290.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446323300004,0

We investigate whether providers' uncertainty about the relationship between effort and measured performance leads to financially unrewarded performance in such schemes. Using data from the British Quality and Outcomes Framework, we proxy general practitioners' uncertainty about the effort-performance relationship by their experience with the scheme and their span of control. We find evidence that providers respond to uncertainty by exerting financially unrewarded performance, suggesting that uncertainty may be a mechanism by which payers can extract unrewarded performance.

Weak identification leads to nonstandard null limiting distributions, and alternative to the usual chi-squared critical value is needed. We first investigate the bootstrap validity for the subset AR test based on various plug-in estimators, and show that the bootstrap provides asymptotic refinement when the nuisance structural parameter is strongly identified, but is inconsistent when it is weakly identified. This is in contrast to the result of bootstrap validity in Moreira et al. (2009). Then, we propose a Bonferroni-based size-correction method that yields correct asymptotic size for all the test statistics considered. The power performance of size-corrected tests can be further improved by applying the mapping between structural and endogenous parameters in the model. Monte Carlo experiments confirm the bootstrap inconsistency and demonstrate that all the subset tests based on our correction technique control the size. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A systematic literature review identified randomized controlled trials comparing enzalutamide, abiraterone/prednisone, radium-223, sipuleucel-T, or docetaxel with each other or placebo in chemotherapy-naive or mixed populations (with and without prior chemotherapy) with asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Feasibility assessment evaluated the trials' suitability for NMA inclusion. The main outcomes were hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Results: Searches of relevant bibliographic databases, trial registers, Web sites, and conference abstracts conducted in October 2014 identified 25,712 records. Ten randomized controlled trials were eligible for the NMA. Enzalutamide was superior to placebo for OS and rPFS (fixed-effects model). NMA results (fixed-effects model) showed no evidence of a difference between enzalutamide and abiraterone/prednisone (HR 0.95 [95% CrI 0.77-1.16]), sipuleucel-T (HR 1.07 [95% CrI 0.84-1.37]), or radium-223 (HR 1.10 [95% CrI 0.87-1.37]) for OS. HRs were similar for the random-effects model. Nevertheless, results (fixed-effects model) suggested that enzalutamide was superior to abiraterone/prednisone (HR 0.59 [95% CrI 0.48-0.72]) and sipuleucel-T (HR 0.32 [95% CrI 0.25-0.42]) for rPFS. Results also suggested superiority of enzalutamide versus placebo, abiraterone/prednisone, or sipuleucel-T for time to chemotherapy. Conclusions: For rPFS, the NMA suggests that enzalutamide is superior to abiraterone/prednisone and sipuleucel-T. There is no evidence of a statistically significant difference in OS between enzalutamide and abiraterone/prednisone, sipuleucel-T, or radium-223. Given the limitations in network construction and underlying assumptions made to complete these analyses, results should be interpreted with caution.","[McCool, Rachael; Glanville, Julie; Arber, Mick] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England; [Fleetwood, Kelly] Quantics, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Goodall, Howard] Jazz Pharmaceut, Oxford, England; [Naidoo, Shevani] Astellas Pharma Inc, Chertsey, England",University of York - UK; Jazz Pharmaceuticals,"McCool, R (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England.",rachael.mccool@york.ac.uk,"Glanville, Julie/ADR-6508-2022; Fleetwood, Kelly/GSD-5711-2022","Glanville, Julie/0000-0002-1253-8524;",,,,,48,18,18,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,OCT,2018,21.0,10.0,,,,,1259,1268,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.012,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GW4GZ,30314628.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446871600016,0

For the application of this methodology, a panel of municipal data was constructed covering several variables related to socioeconomic, demographic, and public health infrastructure characteristics in the cities for the period from 2010 to 2016. The results show a significant reduction in hospital admissions in treated municipalities with an increasing and perceptible effect in the second year of the program.","[Campos Fontes, Luiz Felipe; Conceicao, Otavio Canozzi] Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV EESP, Getulio Vargas Fdn, Itapeva St 164-64, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Jacinto, Paulo de Andrade] Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade Federal do Parana,"Fontes, LFC (通讯作者)，Sao Paulo Sch Econ FGV EESP, Getulio Vargas Fdn, Itapeva St 164-64, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",luizfelipefontes.80@gmail.com,"CONCEIÇÃO, OTAVIO CANOZZI/AAE-7412-2019","Fontes, Luiz Felipe/0000-0002-0097-3852",,,,,38,17,20,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,AUG,2018,27.0,8.0,,,,,1284,1299,,10.1002/hec.3775,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL4IN,29770534.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437114300010,0

Based on the relative concept of inequality, a range of values were proposed for the trade-offs between improving total population health and reducing health inequalities. Methods A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of 422 college students in Portugal. Respondents faced three hypothetical allocation scenarios where they needed to decide between two health programmes that assign different health gains to two anonymous sub-groups of the population and to two subgroups identified by socioeconomic class. Combinations of the median response to these three questions were used to estimate the parameters of the CES-HRSWF. Results Findings suggest that the quantification of the efficiency-equality trade-off is not independent of the inference procedure used. Plausible values for the inequality aversion and for the alpha parameters were obtained ranging from 2.24 to 4.85 and from 0.5 to 0.58, respectively. Conclusions Respondents revealed some aversion to health inequality. However, the extent of this aversion seems to be sensitive to (1) the identification of the groups by occupation status, (2) the size of the health gain, and (3) the inference procedure used.","[Pinho, Micaela] Univ Portucalense, REMIT, Rua Dr Bernardino Almeida 541-619, P-4200072 Porto, Portugal; [Pinho, Micaela; Botelho, Anabela] Univ Aveiro, Res Unit Governance Competitiveness & Publ Polici, Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade Portucalense Infante D.

Symptoms include bone pain, joint pain, stiffness, and fatigue. Published evidence regarding the patient experience of XLH is sparse and no XLH-specific outcome measures have been validated. Objectives: To understand the symptoms, impacts, and patient experience of XLH and to evaluate the face and content validity of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC (R)) and the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) for use as end points in XLH clinical trials. Methods: Face-to-face, qualitative, semistructured interviews were conducted with 18 adults with XLH in the United States using concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing techniques. Openended questioning elicited spontaneous concepts focusing on XLH-associated symptoms and functional limitations. Cognitive debriefing of the WOMAC (R) and BPI-SF assessed the relevance and patient understanding of item wording, recall period, and response options. Results: Various distinct symptom concepts were elicited including pain symptoms, dental symptoms, sensory symptoms, tiredness/ fatigue symptoms, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Participants reported experiencing significant bone and joint pain, stiffness, mobility limitations, and an impact on their ability to work. Cognitive interviewing found both instruments to be relevant and well understood by most patients. Conclusions: The interviews generated rich, qualitative insights into the patient experience of XLH. Cognitive debriefing of the BPI-SF and WOMAC (R) supported their value as XLH clinical trial end points. Future research will assess the psychometric properties of these instruments for use in the XLH population.","[Theodore-Oklota, Christina; Chen, Chao-Yin; Skrinar, Alison] Ultragenyx Pharmaceut, Novato, CA USA; [Bonner, Nicola; Spencer, Holly; Arbuckle, Rob] Adelphi Values, Bollington, Cheshire, England",Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.; Adelphi Group Ltd,"Bonner, N (通讯作者)，Adelphi Mill, Adelphis, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England.",nicola.bonner@adelphiavalues.com,,,"Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (Novato, CA)","Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (Novato, CA)","This project was funded by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (Novato, CA), which commissioned Adelphi Values (Bollington, Cheshire, UK).",,28,20,19,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,AUG,2018,21.0,8.0,,,,,973,983,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.013,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GP7IX,30098676.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441071700011,0

I study a setting with risk-averse bidders and adopt a fully nonparametric approach by not placing any restrictions on the shape of the utility function beyond regularity conditions. I propose a population criterion function that has a unique minimizer, which characterizes the utility function and density of private values. The resulting estimators emerge after replacing the population quantities by sample analogues. These estimators are uniformly consistent and their convergence rates are established. I further suggest an estimator for the optimal reserve price. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimators perform well in finite samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Second, to assess whether longer times to launch or lack of launches affected medicines with high or low expected additional clinical benefit. Third, to identify possible determinants of the probability of a cancer medicine to be launched. Methods: Correlation between time to launch and a set of variables hypothesized to affect launch was tested using a complementary log-log model for a sample of 46 cancer medicines that obtained EU-wide marketing authorization between 2000 and 2014. Results: In median, for a sample of 24 cancer medicines that obtained marketing authorization between 2010 and 2014, the expected time from EU-wide marketing authorization to first use of a medicine was shortest in Sweden, 3.1 months, followed by Scotland (9.3 months), Belgium (14.8 months), and Estonia (27.8 months). Median times to launch were longer for the entire sample of 46 cancer medicines that obtained marketing authorization between 2000 and 2014. In the all-country model, medicines with shorter times to submission for reimbursement, local manufacturers headquarter (or local sales representative), and a Food and Drugs Administration priority review or a combination of expedited approval programs and medicines launched in Scotland and Sweden were associated with a higher hazard of launch. Longer times since EU-wide approval initially correlate with an increased hazard but as time further elapses they negatively affect the hazard of launch. Conclusions: Median times from marketing authorization to first use of cancer medicines were shorter for medicines launched between 2010 and 2014 versus sample-wide (2000-2014). In Estonia, more medicines than in the other countries were not yet launched at the end of the observation period. There was no correlation between Prescrire and European School of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale ratings of added clinical value and time to launch.","[Ferrario, Alessandra] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Populat Med, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401 East, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ferrario, Alessandra] Harvard Pilgr Hlth Care Inst, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401 East, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Ferrario, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Med Sch, Dept Populat Med, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401 East, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Ferrario, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Pilgr Hlth Care Inst, 401 Pk Dr,Suite 401 East, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",alessandra_ferrario@harverdpilgrim.org,,"Ferrario, Alessandra/0000-0002-1572-3581",,,,,29,19,19,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2018,21.0,7.0,,,,,809,821,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.003,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GM6VJ,30005753.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438314900008,0

Outcomes can be beneficial (e.g. increased survival or cure rates) or detrimental (e.g. adverse events, pain associated with treatment, treatment costs, time required for treatment). Treatment effects may also be heterogeneous across outcomes and across patients. Randomized controlled trials are usually insufficient to supply evidence across outcomes. Observational data analysis is an alternative, with the caveat that the treatments observed are choices. Real-world treatment choice often involves complex assessment of expected effects across the array of outcomes. Failure to account for this complexity when interpreting treatment effect estimates could lead to clinical and policy mistakes. Objective Our objective was to assess the properties of treatment effect estimates based on choice when treatments have heterogeneous effects on both beneficial and detrimental outcomes across patients. Methods Simulation methods were used to highlight the sensitivity of treatment effect estimates to the distributions of treatment effects across patients across outcomes. Scenarios with alternative correlations between benefit and detriment treatment effects across patients were used. Regression and instrumental variable estimators were applied to the simulated data for both outcomes. Results True treatment effect parameters are sensitive to the relationships of treatment effectiveness across outcomes in each study population. In each simulation scenario, treatment effect estimate interpretations for each outcome are aligned with results shown previously in single outcome models, but these estimates vary across simulated populations with the correlations of treatment effects across patients across outcomes. Conclusion If estimator assumptions are valid, estimates across outcomes can be used to assess the optimality of treatment rates in a study population. However, because true treatment effect parameters are sensitive to correlations of treatment effects across outcomes, decision makers should be cautious about generalizing estimates to other populations.","[Brooks, John M.] Univ South Carolina, 915 Greene St,Room 303D, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Brooks, John M.] Ctr Effectiveness Res Orthopaed, 915 Greene St,Room 303D, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Chapman, Cole G.] Univ South Carolina, 915 Greene St,Room 303B, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Chapman, Cole G.] Ctr Effectiveness Res Orthopaed, 915 Greene St,Room 303B, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Schroeder, Mary C.] Univ Iowa, Coll Pharm, 115 S Grand Ave,Room S525, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Iowa,"Brooks, JM (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, 915 Greene St,Room 303D, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.;Brooks, JM (通讯作者)，Ctr Effectiveness Res Orthopaed, 915 Greene St,Room 303D, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",john-brooks@sc.edu; cole-chapman@sc.edu; mary-schroeder@uiowa.edu,"Brooks, John Matthew/HLW-2505-2023; Brooks, John/R-3585-2019","Brooks, John Matthew/0000-0001-7365-4417; Chapman, Cole/0000-0002-1132-3767",Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) [ME-1303-6011],Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)(Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute - PCORI),This project was funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) under project number (ME-1303-6011).,,48,8,8,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Test of a new model,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Baumol's cost disease; health care industry; panel data,UNBALANCED GROWTH; EXPENDITURE; DETERMINANTS; TECHNOLOGY; ANATOMY,"Rising health care costs are a policy concern across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and relatively little consensus exists concerning their causes. One explanation that has received revived attention is Baumol's cost disease (BCD). However, developing a theoretically appropriate test of BCD has been a challenge. In this paper, we construct a 2-sector model firmly based on Baumol's axioms. We then derive several testable propositions. In particular, the model predicts that (a) the share of total labor employed in the health care sector and (b) the relative price index of the health and non-health care sectors should both be positively related to economy-wide productivity. The model also predicts that (c) the share of labor in the health sector will be negatively related and (d) the ratio of prices in the health and non-health sectors unrelated, to the demand for non-health services. Using annual data from 28 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries over the years 1995-2016 and from 14U.S. industry groups over the years 1947-2015, we find little evidence to support the predictions of BCD once we address spurious correlation due to coincident trending and other econometric issues.","[Atanda, Akinwande; Menclova, Andrea Kutinova; Reed, W.

A study of UK survey responses,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,capability approach; ICECAP; outcome valuation; well-being,QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY; ICECAP-A; HEALTH; CARE; BENEFITS; EXTRA,"A core feature of the capability approach is that a person's capabilities (what they are able to do and be in their life) can differ from their functionings (what they actually do and are in their life). However, the degree to which capability and functioning differ in practice is unclear. This paper investigates this issue, focusing on capability and functioning differences (CFD) across different aspects of life and different individuals. In the study, the ICECAP-A capability questionnaire was modified to measure both functionings and capabilities and was completed by U.K.-based convenience sample of 943 people. Around one third of people reported CFD in at least one area of their life, most commonly in terms of their achievement. People were more likely to report CFD when they had a degree-level education and when they had impaired health. An additional finding was that capability varied more with education whereas functioning varied more with health status. This finding needs further examination, but it suggests that the choice of evaluative space may influence how priorities are set for public spending.","[Al-Janabi, Hareth] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Al-Janabi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",h.aljanabi@bham.ac.uk,,"Al-Janabi, Hareth/0000-0002-3691-8310",MRC Early Career Fellowship in the Economics of Health [G1002334]; NIHR Career Development Fellowship [CDF-2015-08-025]; MRC [G1002334] Funding Source: UKRI; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [CDF-2015-08-025] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),MRC Early Career Fellowship in the Economics of Health; NIHR Career Development Fellowship; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"MRC Early Career Fellowship in the Economics of Health, Grant/Award Number: G1002334; NIHR Career Development Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: CDF-2015-08-025",,40,11,11,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27.0,3.0,,,,,465,479,,10.1002/hec.3586,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,28944529.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428324700008,0

We randomly assigned health workers to different gift treatments within a program that visited health workers, measured performance and encouraged them to provide high quality care for their patients. We show that unconditional non-monetary gifts improve performance by 20 percent over a six-week period, compared to the control group. We compare the impact of the unconditional gift to one in which a gift is offered conditional on meeting a performance target and show that only the unconditional gift results in a statistically significant improvement. This demonstrates that organizations can improve the performance of health workers in the medium term without using financial incentives. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Brock, J.

Methods: We conducted focus groups/telephone-based interviews and surveys to understand perceptions of RWE and assess awareness, quality, and relevance of two high-profile examples of published RWE studies. A purposive sample comprised 4 physicians, 15 pharmacists, and 1 researcher representing 18 US health plans and health system organizations. Results: Participants reported that RWE was generally used, or useful, to inform safety monitoring, utilization management, and cost analysis, but less so to guide P&T decisions. Participants were not aware of the two sample RWE studies but considered both studies to be valuable. Relevant research questions and outcomes, transparent methods, study quality, and timely results contribute to the utility of published RWE. Perceived organizational barriers to the use of published RWE included lack of skill, training, and timely study results. Conclusions: Payers recognize the value of RWE, but use of such studies to inform P&T decisions varies from organization to organization and is limited. Relevance to payers, timeliness, and transparent methods were key concerns with RWE. Participants recognized the need for continuing education on evaluating and using RWE to better understand the study methods, findings, and applicability to their organizations.","[Malone, Daniel C.; Brown, Mary; Peters, Loretta] Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, 1295 N Martin,POB 210202, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Hurwitz, Jason T.] Univ Arizona, Ctr Hlth Outcomes & Pharmacoecon Res, Tucson, AZ USA; [Graff, Jennifer S.] Natl Pharmaceut Council, Washington, DC USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Malone, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, 1295 N Martin,POB 210202, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",malone@pharmacy.arizona.edu,,"Hurwitz, Jason/0000-0003-3879-9877",National Pharmaceutical Council,National Pharmaceutical Council,This project was funded by the National Pharmaceutical Council.,,29,44,47,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2018,21.0,3.0,,,,,326,333,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.08.3013,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA0QL,29566840.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428019200012,0

This paper estimates by how much the number of treatments demanded is reduced by a higher waiting time. I use variation in waiting times for low-urgency patients caused by rare and resource-intensive high-urgency patients to estimate the relationship. I find that when waiting times are higher, more low-urgency patients are deterred from treatment and leave the hospital during the waiting period without being treated. The waiting time elasticity of demand for low-urgency patients is approximately -0.25 and is highest for the lowest-urgency patients.","[Sivey, Peter] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Sivey, P (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",peter.sivey@rmit.edu.au,"Sivey, Peter/V-4668-2019","Sivey, Peter/0000-0002-3703-615X",Alan Williams Fellowship; NHMRC [567217]; Department of Health and Human Services (Victoria),Alan Williams Fellowship; NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Department of Health and Human Services (Victoria),"The author is also an honorary senior fellow at the Melbourne Institute for Applied Economic and Social Research, University of Melbourne and completed some of the work in this project when funded to visit the Centre for Health Economics, University of York, by the Alan Williams Fellowship.

The exploratory data were distributed to all teams. By July, eight teams had submitted their predictions for 1600 additional pairs and described their analytical approach. After these predictions had been posted online, a confirmatory survey was fielded (4148 additional respondents). Results: The victorious team, Discreetly Charming Econometricians, led by Michal Jakubczyk, achieved the smallest chi(2), 4391.54 (a predefined criterion). Its primary scientific findings were that different models performed better with different pairs, that the value of life span is not constant proportional, and that logit models have poor predictive validity in health valuation.

Details of decision-making processes including the new drug listing submission, Drug Advisory Committee (DAC) meeting, and procedures prior to and following the meeting, were extracted from the official Hong Kong Hospital Authority drug formulary management website and manual. Publicly-available information related to the new drug decision-making process for five HTA agencies [the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), the Australia Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), and the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC)] were reviewed and retrieved from official documents from public domains. The DAC is in charge of systemically and critically appraising new drugs before they are listed on the formulary, reviewing submitted applications, and making the decision to list the drug based on scientific evidence to which safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness are the primary considerations. When compared with other HTA agencies, transparency of the decision-making process of the DAC, the relevance of clinical and health economic evidence, and the lack of health economic and methodological input of submissions are the major challenges to the new-drug listing policy in Hong Kong. Despite these challenges, this review provides suggestions for the establishment of a more transparent, credible, and evidence-based decision-making process in the Hong Kong Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. Proposals for improvement in the listing of new drugs in the formulary should be a priority of healthcare reforms.","[Wong, Carlos King Ho] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Family Med & Primary Care, Ap Lei Chau Clin, 3-F,161 Ap Lei Chau Main St, Ap Lei Chau, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Carlos King Ho; Wu, Olivia] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment, 1 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Cheung, Bernard M.

This is a real problem that must be addressed seriously by Government of Indonesia and need the support from the educational institution to contra the radicalization. Educational institution could contribute of contra-radicalization activities through the teaching and learning process or educational curriculum and also by community service activities. The Alkhairaat Foundation is one of influential foundation in the Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, that has educational institution on the form of public school, islamic school, and university that are located on Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua. From the research conducted by qualitative methods, the result shown that Alkhairaat had implemented contra-radicalization activities by contragrienvances, contra-ideology, and contra-mobilization. Generally, the activities had carried out in the community through da'wah. As well as especially for contra-radicalization carried out through character education by requiring the implementation of curriculum to Alkhairaat which is made by PB Alkhairaat and must be applied by all of the organization under PB Alkhairaat. Implementation of contra-radicalization by Alkhairaat has succeeded in preventing radicalization in its cadre by implementing a local content curriculum (Muatan Lokal/Mulok) of Alkhairaat in the public school, islamis school, boarding school, and university. In line with the efforts of Government of Indonesia to developing character building on curriculum to educational institution so the curriculum of Alkhairaat could be a model for making character building on curriculum as an effort to contra-radicalization. This model could be implemented nationally and globally over the world.","[Ali, Yusuf; Saragih, Herlina J.

In the second stage, the suitability of alternative A is assessed in the same way according to each of the values of the results of the partial single-criterion evaluations of alternative A. The third stage of evaluation is the number that is a sophisticated aggregate of the results of all single-criterion evaluations on a common scale, taking into account their mutual synergy (multi-criterial evaluation of the alternative A). Within this third stage, the uncertainty often comes into play arising from the vagueness of the description of the dependence of the resulting aggregate on the vector of the results values of all single-criterion evaluations. In a concrete example it is shown and demonstrated how a fuzzy approach based on fuzzy logic faces this internal uncertainty of the herein presented evaluation process of alternatives.","[Haskova, Simona] Inst Technol & Business, Sch Expertness & Valuat, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Hasková, S (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business, Sch Expertness & Valuat, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",haskovas@post.cz,"Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"MATFYZPRESS PUBL HOUSE, FAC MATH & PHYSICS",PRAHA 8,"CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, SOKOLOVSKA 83, PRAHA 8, 186 75, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7378-372-3,,,,2018,,,,,,,127,132,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO2PI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507455300023,0

Thus, they represent only 20% of corporate tax revenues and 30% of income tax revenues. The constraint and reluctance of investors remain highly noticed and the risk of tax evasion increases, especially in the digital world and globalization. Escape and fraud strategies are becoming more diversified, more complex and more international. Tax evasion has become much easier in the current context characterized by of the great freedom and rapidity of capital flow and the development of the digital economy; this reality has led to the emergence of new models of business that promote opportunities for tax evasion and raise greater challenges.

Behavior of discrete event systems, in which the individual components move from event to event rather than varying continuously through time, is often described by systems of max-plus linear equations or matrix equations. Discrete dynamic systems can be studied using max-plus matrix operations. It often happens that a max-plus matrix equation with exact data is unsolvable. Therefore, we replace matrix elements with intervals of possible values. In this way, we obtain an interval max-plus matrix equation. Several types of solvability of interval max-plus matrix equations have been studied yet. In this paper, we prove the necessary and sufficient condition for an interval max-plus matrix equation to be strongly tolerance solvable and provide an algorithm for checking whether the given interval matrix equation is strongly tolerance solvable.","[Myskova, Helena] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Math & Theoret Informat, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04200, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Mysková, H (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Math & Theoret Informat, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04200, Slovakia.",helena.myskova@tuke.sk,"Myšková, Helena/AAA-6088-2020",,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,"MATFYZPRESS PUBL HOUSE, FAC MATH & PHYSICS",PRAHA 8,"CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, SOKOLOVSKA 83, PRAHA 8, 186 75, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7378-372-3,,,,2018,,,,,,,360,365,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO2PI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507455300062,0

Currently, we live in the era of so-called Industry 4.0, as has been named after the German scientists Kagermann, Lukas and Whalster. The development of Industry 4.0 is ascribable to the exploitation of information technology - through interconnection, collaboration and data analysis. These are all factors that depend on a fundamental element: information, which derives from the Latin noun informatio (-nis). The ability to analyse and identify (and (and interpret) information interconnections, through the progressive introduction of new technologies, will change (and in part is already changing) the production's methods: with the increase in integration between the various phases of production and client assistance, there will also be greater direct collaboration between the relevant actors. Big Data, in particular, allow us to investigate the smallest details and at the same time to identify large-scale large-scale correlations, so far unknown, with an infinite potential: most of the industrial companies, aware of the potential inherent in these processes, have already started to digitalise their production, their logistic and commercial procedures. Spontaneous questions then arise: where information is actually found, who owns it (which is not indifferent from the point of view of privacy matters), what potential economic exploitation are available. Two themes will be fundamental. The first concerns the so-called end of work: increasingly sophisticated machines and robots that work, human workers who lose their jobs and income. The second concerns new legislative rules necessary to regulate robots' work and consequent algorithms that guide them: what happens if an intelligent robot causes damages? Whose responsibility is it? What can we say about security and privacy? The subject is so warm and sensitive that recently the European Parliament has proposed rules on civil law on robotics to the European Commission and further analysis is needed.","[Sbroiavacca, Alessia] Univ Udine, Udine, Italy; [Sbroiavacca, Alessia] Univ Trieste, Trieste, Italy; [Sbroiavacca, Fulvio] Federmanager Natl Commiss Ind 4 0, Bari, Apulia, Italy; [Sbroiavacca, Fulvio] Univ Trieste, Fac Engn, Software & Informat Syst Design, Comp Engn, Trieste, Italy",University of Udine; University of Trieste; University of Trieste,"Sbroiavacca, A (通讯作者)，Univ Udine, Udine, Italy.;Sbroiavacca, A (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Trieste, Italy.",sbroiavacca.alessia@spes.uniud.it; fulvio.sbroiavacca@gmail.com,,,,,,,2,1,1,3,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,742,745,,,,,,4,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100079,0

The first and important step in customer retention is to classify the customers into possible churners, those likely to switch to another service provider, and non-churners. The second step is to take action to retain the most probable churners. The main challenge in churn classification is the rarity of churn events. In order to overcome this, two aspects are found to improve the churn classification model: the training data and the algorithm. The recently proposed multi-period training data approach is found to outperform the single period training data thanks to the more effective use of longitudinal data. Regarding the churn classification algorithms, the most advanced and widely employed is the ensemble method, which combines multiple models to produce a more powerful one. Two popularly used ensemble techniques, random forest and gradient boosting, are found to outperform logistic regression and decision tree in classifying churners from non-churners. The study uses data of housing loan customers from a Nordic bank. The key finding is that models combining the multi-period training data approach with ensemble methods performs the best.","[Seppala, Tomi; Thuy, Le] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Informat & Serv Management, Espoo, Finland",Aalto University,"Seppälä, T (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Informat & Serv Management, Espoo, Finland.",,"Seppala, Tomi/AAF-4502-2020",,,,,,6,1,1,1,3,UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA,VALENCIA,"CAMINO VERA S-N, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",,,978-84-9048-689-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,141,144,,10.4995/CARMA2018.2018.8334,0.0,,,4,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN2ZN,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000477974500017,0

There is a growing need for the use of economic evaluations to assess the value of interventions for children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), a population that has increasing demands for healthcare services. Unfortunately, few evaluations have been conducted to date, perhaps stemming from challenges in applying existing economic evaluation methodologies in this heterogeneous population. Opportunities exist to innovate methods to address key challenges in conducting economic evaluations of interventions for children with NDDs. In this paper, we discuss important considerations and highlight areas for future work. This includes the paucity of appropriate instruments for measuring outcomes meaningful to children with NDDs and their families, difficulties in the measurement of costs due to service utilization in a wide variety of sectors, complexities in the measurement of caregiver and family effects and considerations in estimating long-term productivity costs. Innovation and application of evaluation approaches in these areas will help inform decisions around whether the resources currently spent on interventions for children with NDDs represent good value for money, or whether greater benefits for children could be generated by spending money in other ways.","[Lamsal, Ramesh; Zwicker, Jennifer D.] Univ Calgary, Sch Publ Policy, 906-8th Ave SW, Calgary, AB T2P 1H9, Canada; [Zwicker, Jennifer D.] Univ Calgary, Fac Kinesiol, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary,"Zwicker, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Sch Publ Policy, 906-8th Ave SW, Calgary, AB T2P 1H9, Canada.;Zwicker, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Fac Kinesiol, Calgary, AB, Canada.",zwicker1@ucalgary.ca,,,Kids Brain Health Network; Network of Center of Excellence; CIHR; Sinneave Family Foundation; CHILDBRIGHT,Kids Brain Health Network; Network of Center of Excellence; CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Sinneave Family Foundation; CHILDBRIGHT,"RL and JZ are supported by grants from the Kids Brain Health Network, a Network of Center of Excellence and CHILDBRIGHT, funded by CIHR.

Using the Indonesian Family Life Survey, I investigate the extent to which the expansion of a midwife program affects the age at first birth and the number of school years of women. My findings suggest that women who were exposed to a midwife when they have to decide on further school attendance (aged 13-20years) delay their first birth and also stay longer in school. According to the average returns of education in Indonesia, I conclude that reproductive health services provided by midwives can generate large socioeconomic benefits by allowing young women to postpone their first birth.

The manufacturer of XprESS, Entellus Medical, claims the technology is as effective as FESS in improving quality of life and is associated with quicker recovery times and reduced costs. The Medical Technologies Advisory Committee (MTAC) at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) selected XprESS for evaluation. Nine trials published in 13 papers were correctly identified by the company as relevant to the decision problem, including one randomised controlled trial (REMODEL study). From this evidence, the company concluded that XprESS is as beneficial as FESS for a range of clinical endpoints. The External Assessment Centre (EAC) agreed with the company's conclusion in a subgroup of patients, but judged that the evidence did not generalise to patients within the NHS fully. The company constructed a de novo costing model. XprESS generated cost-savings of 1302 pound per patient compared with FESS. The EAC critiqued and updated the model's inputs, with differences in results driven by changes in assumptions on procedure duration, length of hospital stay and the proportion of procedures undertaken in an outpatient setting under local anaesthetic. Although cost-incurring in the base case, XprESS generated cost savings under certain scenarios. The MTAC reviewed the evidence and supported the case for adoption, issuing positive draft recommendations. After public consultation NICE published this as Medical Technologies Guidance 30.","[Jenks, Michelle; Turner, Emily Eaton; Arber, Mick; Craig, Joyce] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England; [Willits, Iain; Cole, Helen; Sims, Andrew] Newcastle Upon Tyne Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Freeman Hosp, Freeman Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE7 7DN, Tyne & Wear, England; [Hewitt, Neil] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Level 1A,City Tower,Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester M1 4BT, Lancs, England",University of York - UK; Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Newcastle Freeman Hospital; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence,"Jenks, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House,Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England.",michelle.jenks@york.ac.uk,"Sims, Andrew/AAT-8027-2021","Sims, Andrew/0000-0002-9553-7278; Jenks, Michelle/0000-0002-1637-1506",NICE,NICE,"The authors are grateful to the clinical experts identified by NICE, who provided expertise and clinical knowledge.

The analysis indicates that on average the point-of-purchase provision of calorie information on chain restaurant menus reduced body mass index (BMI) by 1.5% and lowered the risk of obesity by 12%. Quantile regression results indicate that calorie labeling has similar impacts across the BMI distribution. An analysis of heterogeneity suggests that calorie labeling has a larger impact on the body weight of lower income individuals, especially lower income minorities. The estimated impacts of calorie labeling on physical activity, smoking, and the consumption of alcoholic beverages, fruits, and vegetables are small in magnitude, which suggests that other margins of adjustment drive the body-weight impacts estimated here.

Our instrumental variable results show that a one-standard-deviation increase in the distance to the nearest hospital (5km) raises the fatality rate by 13.84% at the sample average. This figure is equal to 0.92 additional deaths per 100 accidents. We show that both ordinary least squares and difference-in-differences estimates, common approaches in the literature, provide a downward-biased measure of the true effect of hospital proximity because they do not fully solve spatial sorting problems. Proximity is more important when the level of road safety is low, when emergency services are less responsive, and when the nearest hospital has relatively low quality standards.","[Bertoli, Paola] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bertoli, Paola] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Grembi, Veronica] Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria,"Bertoli, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.;Bertoli, P (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",paola.bertoli@vse.cz,"Bertoli, Paola/AAG-1751-2019","Bertoli, Paola/0000-0001-8818-4243; Grembi, Veronica/0000-0002-5405-320X",,,,,37,13,16,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,SEP,2017,26.0,,,2,,,78,91,,10.1002/hec.3571,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FH7GV,28940915.0,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411353600006,0

That representation is used to discuss the advantages and limitations of second-order identification in a mixed VAR. We show that it is possible to find the numbers of causal or noncausal components of the process from its multivariate autocovariance function, while nonlinear autocovariances are needed to distinguish between them. The paper introduces also a consistent semi parametric estimator for mixed causal/noncausal multivariate non-Gaussian processes, called the Generalized Covariance (GCov) estimator, which relies on combined standard and nonlinear autocovariances of the process. The GCov does not require any distributional assumptions on the errors. The approach is illustrated by a simulation study and applied to commodity prices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

One argument is that non-profit status serves as a signal of quality when consumers are not well informed. A testable implication is that an increase in consumer information may lead to a reduction in the number of non-profits in a market. We test this idea empirically by exploiting an exogenous increase in consumer information in the US nursing home industry. We find that the information shock led to a reduction in the share of non-profit homes, driven by a combination of home closure and sector switching. The lowest quality non-profits were the most likely to exit. Our results have important implications for the effects of reforms to increase consumer provision in a number of public services.

We address the potential endogeneity of prices by taking advantage of the unequal spatial coverage of providers and instrumenting price by the number of municipalities served by a provider.

Eye examinations play an important role in early detection. However, DR screening by optometrists is not always universally covered by public or private health insurance plans. This study assessed whether expanding public health coverage to include diabetic eye examinations for retinopathy by optometrists is cost-effective from the perspective of the health care system. Methods: We conducted a cost-utility analysis of extended coverage for diabetic eye examinations in Prince Edward Island to include examinations by optometrists, not currently publicly covered. We used a Markov chain to simulate disease burden based on eye examination rates and DR progression over a 30-year time horizon. Results were presented as an incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Extending public health coverage to eye examinations by optometrists was associated with higher costs ($9,908,543.32) and improved QALYs (156,862.44), over 30 years, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1668.43/QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that the most influential determinants of the results were the cost of optometric screening and selected utility scores. At the commonly used threshold of $50,000/QALY, the probability that the new policy was cost-effective was 99.99%. Conclusions: Extending public health coverage to eye examinations by optometrists is cost-effective based on a commonly used threshold of $50,000/QALY. Findings from this study can inform the decision to expand public-insured optometric services for patients with diabetes.","[van katwyk, Sasha; Thavorn, Kednapa] Ottawa Hosp, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Clin Epidemiol Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Jin, Ya-ping] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Jin, Ya-ping; Trope, Graham E.; Buys, Yvonne; Flanagan, John; Brent, Michael H.; El-Defrawy, Sherif] Univ Toronto, Dept Ophthalmol & Vis Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Masucci, Lisa] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tu, Hong Anh] Hlth Qual Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wedge, Richard] Hlth PEI, Charlottetown, PE, Canada; [Flanagan, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Optometry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Flanagan, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Vis Sci Program, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Thavorn, Kednapa] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Thavorn, Kednapa] ICES UOttawa, Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Ottawa,"Thavorn, K (通讯作者)，Ottawa Hosp, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, 501 Smyth Rd,POB 201B, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L6, Canada.",kthavorn@ohri.ca,,"Thavorn, Kednapa/0000-0003-4738-8447",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),This study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).,,25,9,9,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2017,20.0,8.0,,,,,1034,1040,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.04.015,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FI3CO,28964434.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411834200005,0

Objectives: To identify international experience with disinvestment initiatives and to review empirical analyses of disinvestment initiatives. Methods: We performed a literature search using the PubMed database to identify international experience with disinvestment initiatives. We also reviewed empirical analyses of disinvestment initiatives. Results: We identified 26 unique disinvestment initiatives implemented across 11 countries. Nineteen addressed multiple intervention types, six addressed only drugs, and one addressed only devices. We reviewed 18 empirical analyses of disinvestment initiatives: 7 reported that the initiative was successful, 8 reported that the initiative was unsuccessful, and 3 reported that findings were mixed; that is, the study considered multiple services and reported a decrease in the use of some but not others. Thirty-seven low-value services were evaluated across the 18 empirical analyses, for 14 (38%) of which the disinvestment initiative led to a decline in use. Six of the seven studies that reported the disinvestment initiative to be successful included an attempt to promote the disinvestment initiative among participating clinicians. Conclusions: The success of disinvestment initiatives has been mixed, with fewer than half the identified empirical studies reporting that use of the low-value service was reduced.

Methods: Semistructured interviews with representatives of HTA bodies in England, Scotland, Sweden, and France were conducted. An interview topic guide was developed on the basis of findings from a systematic comparison of HTA decisions for 10 orphan drugs. Qualitative thematic data analysis was applied to the interview transcripts using the framework approach. Results: Eight representatives from the four HTA bodies were interviewed between March and June 2015. Evidentiary requirements and approaches to dealing with imperfect or incomplete evidence were explored, including trial design and duration, study population and subgroups, comparators, and end points. Interviewees agreed that decisions regarding orphan drugs are made in a context of lower quality evidence, and the threshold of acceptable uncertainty varied by country. Some countries imposed higher evidentiary standards for greater clinical claims, which may be more challenging for orphan diseases. The acceptability of surrogate end points was not consistent across countries nor were the validation requirements. The most common social value judgments identified related to innovation, disease severity, and unmet need. Differences were seen in the way these concepts were defined and accounted for across countries.

However, certain characteristics of malaria decision problems present a challenge to the application of healthcare economic evaluation methods. This paper identifies five such challenges. The complexities of (i) declining incidence and cost effectiveness in the context of an elimination campaign; (ii) international aid and its effect on resource constraints; and (iii) supranational priority setting, all affect how health economists might use a cost-effectiveness threshold. Consensus and guidance on how to determine and interpret cost-effectiveness thresholds in the context of internationally financed elimination campaigns is greatly needed. (iv) Malaria interventions are often complimentary and evaluations may need to construct intervention bundles to represent relevant policy positions as sets of mutually exclusive alternatives. (v) Geographic targeting is a key aspect of malaria policy making that is only beginning to be addressed in economic evaluations. An approach to budget-based geographic resource allocation is described in an accompanying paper in this issue and addresses some of these methodological challenges.","[Drake, Tom L.] Myanmar Oxford Clin Res Unit, Yangon, Myanmar; [Drake, Tom L.; Lubell, Yoel] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Oxford, England; [Lubell, Yoel] Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Bangkok, Thailand",University of Oxford; Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU); Mahidol University,"Drake, TL (通讯作者)，Myanmar Oxford Clin Res Unit, Yangon, Myanmar.;Drake, TL (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Oxford, England.",tom.d@tropmedres.ac,,"Drake, Tom/0000-0002-6781-6632; Lubell, Yoel/0000-0002-0237-1070",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Wellcome Trust major overseas programme in South East Asia [106698/Z/14/Z],Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Wellcome Trust major overseas programme in South East Asia(Wellcome Trust),TD and YL are supported by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The optimal solution depends primarily on whether the household's present value of the consumption reference levels is below, equal to, or above the present value of its endowment income. Reference levels below the endowment income are associated with the self-enhancement motive. In this case, the household avoids relative losses in consumption in any present or future state of nature (good or bad). As a result the degree of loss aversion does not directly affect optimal consumption and risk taking activity. Reference levels equal to the endowment income are associated with the belonging motive. An example would be a household comparing to others that belong to the same social class. In this case the household's optimal consumption is the reference consumption and the household will not invest in the risky asset. Finally, reference levels above the endowment income are associated with the self-improvement motive (or high aspirations). For such high reference levels, households cannot avoid experiencing a relative loss in consumption, either now or in the future. As a result, loss aversion directly affects consumption and risky investment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Multi-fold generalized SCOs are defined as compound options on (compound) options, where the call/put property of each fold can be arbitrarily assigned. To obtain the analytic pricing formula for n-fold generalized SCOs, we prove and generalize a mathematical expectation related to multivariate normal variables, which are potentially very useful in pricing many types of option. Subsequently, with the help of the proven conclusions, the n-fold generalized SCOs pricing formulas for the diffusion model and the log-normal jump-diffusion model are derived. Finally, some possible computational methods for the calculation of SCOs price are presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We provide a recipe for the estimation of this matrix by subsampling; an approach that computes rescaled copies of the original statistic based on local stretches of high-frequency data, and then it studies the sampling variation of these. We show that our estimator is consistent both in frictionless markets and models with additive microstructure noise. We derive a rate of convergence for it and are also able to determine an optimal rate for its tuning parameters (e.g., the number of subsamples). Subsampling does not require an extra set of estimators to do inference, which renders it trivial to implement. As a variance-covariance matrix estimator, it has the attractive feature that it is positive semi-definite by construction. Moreover, the subsampler is to some extent automatic, as it does not exploit explicit knowledge about the structure of the asymptotic covariance. It therefore tends to adapt to the problem at hand and be robust against misspecification of the noise process. As such, this paper facilitates assessment of the sampling errors inherent in high-frequency estimation of volatility. We highlight the finite sample properties of the subsampler in a Monte Carlo study, while some initial empirical work demonstrates its use to draw feasible inference about volatility in financial markets.

Our main proposition is that, for each permissible coalition structure, the kernel is a singleton; thus, the number of licensees that maximizes the patent holder's revenue can be determined with the kernel. Specifying the upper and lower bounds of the kernel for each coalition structure, we also provide the sufficient conditions for the integer that maximizes the licensees' total surplus to be the optimal number of licensees for the patent holder. The numerical comparison of the bargaining outcomes to those obtained by non-cooperative licensing by means of fee through take-it-or-leave-it offers is provided for a cost-reducing innovation in a linear Cournot market. Regardless of the ways of licensing, the producer surplus is maximized when the magnitude of cost reduction is large. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We gather data on 4190 scientists who were either nominated for or successfully elected to the Chinese Academy of Science or of Engineering. Being elected as an academician in China is a boost in social status (vice-ministerial level) with negligible direct economic impact (US$ 30 monthly before 2009). After correcting for two sources of bias, (1) some potential academicians decease too young to be elected, leading to selection bias in favor of academicians and (2) the endogenous relationship between health and social status, we find that the enhanced social status of becoming an academician leads to approximately 1.2 years longer life.

In particular, CD implies a deterministic comparative static of a change in decision when risk changes, but SD does not have such an implication. In this paper, we propose the first test of central dominance, which amounts to checking a functional inequality. We derive the asymptotic distribution of a lower bound of the proposed test and suggest a bootstrap procedure to compute the critical values. We also conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of this test. Our empirical study finds clear evidence of CD relations between the S&P 500 index return distributions during 2001-2013 and results in unambiguous implications for investment decisions.

Aligned with these efforts, several value assessment frameworks have been introduced recently to help providers, patients, and payers better understand the potential value of drugs and other interventions and make informed decisions about their use. Given their early stage of development, it is imperative to evaluate these efforts on an ongoing basis to identify how best to support and improve them moving forward. This article provides a multistakeholder perspective on the key limitations and opportunities posed by the current value assessment frameworks and areas of and actions for improvement. In particular, we outline 10 fundamental guiding principles and associated strategies that should be considered in subsequent iterations of the existing frameworks or by emerging initiatives in the future.

Considering a credit market with an asymmetry of information between borrowers and lenders, we assume that borrowers have to pay a cost to reveal information on the quality of their project. They decide to be transparent if it is necessary for getting a loan or for paying a lower interest rate. Two types of competitive equilibria may exist: an opaque equilibrium in which all projects receive funding without revealing information; a transparent one in which only the best projects reveal information and receive funding. It is also possible to get multiple equilibria. Incorporating this microeconomic mechanism in an OLG model, the economy may experience fluctuations due to the change of regime, and indeterminacy may occur. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the alternative choices of a TOLAC and an ERCD for women with low-risk, singleton gestation pregnancies. Methods: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EconLit, and the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry with no language, publication, or date restrictions up until October 2015. Studies were included if they were primary research, compared a TOLAC with an ERCD, and provided information on the relative cost of the alternatives. Abstracts and partial economic evaluations were excluded. Results: Of 310 studies initially reviewed, 7 studies were included in the systematic review. In the base-case analyses, 4 studies concluded that TOLAC was dominant over ERCD, 1 study found ERCD to be dominant, and 2 studies found that although TOLAC was more costly, it offered more benefits and was thus cost-effective from a population perspective when considering societal willingness to pay for better outcomes. In sensitivity analyses, cost-effectiveness was found to be dependent on a high likelihood of TOLAC success, low risk of uterine rupture, and low relative cost of TOLAC compared with ERCD. Conclusions: For women who are likely to have a successful vaginal delivery, routine ERCD may result in excess morbidity and cost from a population perspective.","[Rogers, Anna Joy; Kilgore, Meredith L.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Care Org & Policy, SHEL 121,1530 3rd Ave South, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Rogers, Nathaniel G.] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Med, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Rogers, Nathaniel G.] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Pediat, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Subramaniam, Akila; Harper, Lorie M.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Med, Ctr Womens Reprod Hlth, Maternal Fetal Med Div,Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Birmingham, AL USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Health Science Center; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Health Science Center; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Rogers, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Care Org & Policy, SHEL 121,1530 3rd Ave South, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",rogersaj@uab.edu,,"Rogers, Nathaniel/0000-0001-6297-6779; Subramaniam, Akila/0000-0003-0753-805X",National Institute of General Medical Sciences [T32GM008361]; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [1TL1TR001418-01],National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)),A.J.

By do not involving the stakeholders in the management of Kutai National Park have caused the failure of the partnership. In partnership, Kutai National Park Authority and local communities should become key actors in management, assisted and supported by district governments, corporations, and NGOs. Through the qualitative method, the research found an idea to renewing the form of partnership to managing the Kutai National Park by involving more stakeholders in the partnership that will be formed formally. The engagement of multi stakeholder in this matter expected to save the Kutai National Park's forest that have rich biodiversity which would be useful in order to achieve sustainable development post 2015 such as poverty reduction, the availability of employment, nutrition and clean drinking water. It is believed that this partnership will not only enhance the people's sense of belonging to the park but also deal with the problem of poor law enforcement and the Indonesian government's lack of contributions in the conservation of the park.

Our approach involves identifying a suitable subset of the set of alternatives, such that (a) the preference order is representable on this subset, and (b) the subset has the property that for each alternative, there is some element in this subset which is indifferent to it. We follow Wold in choosing this subset to be the diagonal. Our first result uses a weak monotonicity condition (on the diagonal), and a substitution condition, and may be identified as the essence of Wold's contribution. In the second result, we show that one can obtain a Wold-type representation result when weak monotonicity is replaced by a weak continuity condition. We use the countable order-dense characterization of representability in the proofs of both results, thereby integrating the contributions of Wold (1943) and Debreu (1954). Through a series of examples we show that our representation results are robust; they cannot be improved upon by dropping any of our conditions. An example is also presented to show that existence of degenerate indifference classes is compatible with the representation of monotone preferences. Our study thereby indicates that while the presence of substitution possibilities can be useful in representing preferences, they are not necessary for such results to hold. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, an autoregressive conditional Frechet (AcF) model is proposed in which the maxima are modeled by a Frechet distribution with time-varying scale parameter (volatility) and shape parameter (tail index) conditioned on past information. The AcF provides a direct and accurate modeling of the time-varying behavior of maxima and furthermore offers a new angle to study the tail risk dynamics in financial markets. Probabilistic properties of AcF are studied, and a maximum likelihood estimator is used for model estimation, with its statistical properties investigated. Simulations show the flexibility of AcF and confirm the reliability of its estimators. Two real data examples on cross-sectional stock returns and high-frequency foreign exchange returns are used to demonstrate the AcF modeling approach, where significant improvement over the static GEV has been observed for market tail risk monitoring and conditional VaR estimation. Empirical result of AcF is consistent with the findings of the dynamic peak-over-threshold (POT) literature that the tail index of financial markets varies through time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Li, KP; Li, Q; Lu, LN",,,,"Li, Kunpeng; Li, Qi; Lu, Lina",,,Quasi maximum likelihood analysis of high dimensional constrained factor models,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Constrained factor models; Maximum likelihood estimation; High dimensionality; Inferential theory,APPROXIMATE FACTOR MODELS; NUMBER; COVARIANCE; ARBITRAGE; RISK; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS; RETURNS,"Factor models have been widely used in practice. However, an undesirable feature of a high dimensional factor model is that the model has too many parameters. An effective way to address this issue, proposed in a seminar work by Tsai and Tsay (2010) is to decompose the loadings matrix by a high-dimensional known matrix multiplying with a low-dimensional unknown matrix, which Tsai and Tsay (2010) name the constrained factor models. This paper investigates the estimation and inferential theory of constrained factor models under large-N and large-T setup, where N denotes the number of cross sectional units and T the time periods. We propose using the quasi maximum likelihood method to estimate the model and investigate the asymptotic properties of the quasi maximum likelihood estimators, including consistency, rates of convergence and limiting distributions. A new statistic is proposed for testing the null hypothesis of constrained factor models against the alternative of standard factor models. Partially constrained factor models are also investigated. Monte Carlo simulations confirm our theoretical results and show that the quasi maximum likelihood estimators and the proposed new statistic perform well in finite samples. We also consider the extension to an approximate constrained factor model where the idiosyncratic errors are allowed to be weakly dependent processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The fractional stochastic trends allow for a wide range of nonstationarity, indexed by a memory parameter, nesting the familiar 1(1) case and allowing for parametric short-memory. The individual effects can nonparametrically vary simultaneously across time and across units. The cross-sectional covariance matrix is also nonparametric. The main focus is on estimation of the time series parameters. Two methods are considered, both of which entail an only approximate differencing out of the individual effects, leaving an error which has to be taken account of in our theory. In both cases we obtain standard asymptotics, with a central limit theorem, over a wide range of possible parameter values, unlike the nonstandard asymptotics for autoregressive parameter estimates at a unit root. For statistical inference, consistent estimation of the limiting covariance matrix of the parameter estimates requires consistent estimation of a functional of the cross-sectional covariance matrix. We examine efficiency loss due to cross-sectional correlation in a spatial model example. A Monte Carlo study of finite-sample performance is included. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.
