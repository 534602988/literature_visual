Nevertheless, there is little consensus based on empirical findings on what are the sources of nation's competitiveness, especially in the context of an economic and political union like the EU. Thus, the goal of this paper is to empirically pinpoint the determinants of competitiveness for eleven new EU member states (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia). We measure competitiveness through GDP per person employed while our explanatory variables are divided into two groups of determinants . price and non-price competitiveness factors. Consequently, we set the following hypothesis that the role of non-price competitiveness factors is more important compared to price competitiveness factors in the new EU member states. In order to test it, we employ linear dynamic panel model based on one step GMM estimator (Arellano -Bond) on the yearly data, covering the period from 1999 to 2016. The most interesting results refer to the positive role of the government and the structure of exported goods (both non-price competitiveness factors). The relevance of our result extends beyond this sample, as it demonstrates the necessity of examining factors other than level of wages, prices and exchange rates when looking at the competitiveness of contemporary economies.","[Dumancic, Lucija Rogic; Mackic, Velibor] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Dumancic, LR (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",lrogic@efzg.hr; vmackic@efzg.hr,,,Croatian Science Foundation [IP-09-2014-5476],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project: No. IP-09-2014-5476.,,27,0,0,1,7,BC GRUP INC,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH, 2134 SOK, DERELI APT.

Its maintenance and survival will depend on that, within an economic environment as turbulent as the current one. This paper addresses two current topics in organizations: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Intellectual Capital (IC). The literature says that both of them are sources of competitive advantages. On one hand, the exercise of CSR will provide more productivity, more performance and more competitive success. On the other hand, the IC comprises a set of intangible values in organizations (human capital, relational capital and structural capital) able to provide more value than tangible assets. This paper focuses the potential impact of a joint strategy based on the exercise of CSR and the IC, resulting in the so-called Sustainable Intellectual Capital (SIC). A theoretical and exploratory study based on a review of previous research and analysis of the potential of each concept in building competitive advantage for organizations is carried out. The links between CSR and IC are identified from the strategic management to the scope of reporting. Also, the impact that both concepts can determine on the performance of organizations is analyzed. Finally, linking sustainability indicators for each of the IC dimensions would lead to the SIC. The incidence of this is the achievement of a competitive advantage over corporate strategy, leading to the creation of value in the organization. The most important result will be to demonstrate, from the theory, the possible linkage between CSR and IC in organizations. This way, a socially responsible company will have a better Human Capital, a broader Relational Capital and a stronger Structural Capital. The value of the research lies in obtaining a new approach linking the two types of strategic assets under study, called the SIC. The authors consider the potential of a strategy based on the exercise of CSR to achieve an increase of IC.","[Gallardo-Vazquez, Dolores] Univ Extremadura, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Accounting & Financial Econ, Badajoz, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Gallardo-Vázquez, D (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Accounting & Financial Econ, Badajoz, Spain.",dgallard@unex.es,,,Research Group BUSINESS RESEARCH (INVE) [SEJ022],Research Group BUSINESS RESEARCH (INVE),"This paper has been funded by the Research Group BUSINESS RESEARCH (INVE), included in the Catalogue of Research Groups of the Autonomous Community of Extremadura with SEJ022 code.",,47,1,1,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,106,113,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000014,0

We think that ethical behaviors are pivotal in determining the success or failure of an organization. They affect a company's reputation and help to define a business model that will thrive even in adversity. Organizations can consider ethical behavior a way to differentiate themselves through the relationships that they create with stakeholders. This study aims to describe ways of identifying the principles of Corporate Social Responsibility that allow a more meaningful understanding of the Ethical behavior of modern corporations. The interest in the researches in all areas of ethical behavior and CSR is growing. Ethical behavior and CSR drive the activities of an organization and the value systems that underlie their business activities. We have studied CSR through the framework of the stakeholder theory of the organizations and posit that CSR, as practiced today, is connected with ethical behavior with other dimensions of an overall reputation framework still uncovered. The analysis of the international literature will be accompanied by the case study of the company L'Oreal. The L'Oreal company's behavior is as important as its economic performance or the quality of its products. In these regards, L'Oreal's ambition is to be an exemplary company worldwide and integrates ethics into the very heart of its business practices. In 2017, the group was recognized for the eighth time by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies.

In 2013, the European Commission started to impose antidumping duties on exports of Argentinean biodiesel. They were considered being dumped due to reduced export taxes compared to those applied to soybean oil exports. The objective of this paper is to analyze the economic consequences of these Argentinean differential taxes on the European biodiesel and related sectors. Thanks to an original model simulating the world markets of main arable crops, we first analyze the results of an increase of the export tax on biodiesel only. We then simulate the consequences of a reduction of export taxes on soybean products. Finally, we assess the impacts of the overall Argentinean policy of differentiated taxation of agricultural exports. One main conclusion is that European biodiesel producers are relatively more penalized than biodiesel producers in other countries by the current Argentinean policy, due to a relatively greater production of rapeseed. US and Brazilian producers suffer from welfare losses in all scenarios due to the indirect effects on soybean markets. The welfare impacts on consumers and taxpayers are often opposite to the welfare impacts on producers, leading to small global welfare effects.","[Gohin, Alexandre; Levert, Fabrice; Forslund, Agneta] UMR SMART Agrocampus Ouest INRA, Rennes, France",Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest; INRAE,"Gohin, A (通讯作者)，INRA UMR SMART Agrocampus Ouest, CS61103, 4 Allee Adolphe Bobierre, F-35000 Rennes, France.",alexandre.gohin@inra.fr,,"Levert, Fabrice/0000-0002-1168-2567",,,,,23,0,0,0,8,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Design/methodology/approach-In this paper, taking Shandong Province as an example, this paper tries to analyze the conflict of labor-intensive enterprises in labor-oriented enterprises, and takes 2354 valid samples collected from the labor-intensive enterprises in Shandong province as the empirical research object. With SPSS19.0 Statistical analysis software, through the establishment of the nature of the enterprise, the industry belongs to the industry, the degree of education, etc. 108 variables, the use of empirical analysis, combined with literature search and interdisciplinary research and other research methods on Shandong Province labor-intensive The harmonious degree of enterprise labor relations. Findings-Results revealed that older service employees experienced fewer customer stressors. Customer stressors mediated the negative relationship between age and burnout. Age was associated with use of passive avoidant (avoiding) and active constructive (problem solving) conflict management strategies. Furthermore, older employees used those strategies more effectively. Especially when avoiding conflicts, older employees reported more professional efficacy than younger colleagues. In contrast, younger employees benefited considerably less from strategy use and reported higher levels of burnout in general. Thus, results suggest older employees' effective conflict management and their positive perception of customer stressors contribute to lower levels of burnout. Practical implications-In order to alleviate the labor-force conflict in labor-intensive enterprises, we can improve the legal system of labor conflicts by establishing the correct solution to the conflict of labor and capital conflicts, strengthen the effectiveness of existing labor laws, implement the implementation system of labor conflicts, And other ways to resolve conflicts in a timely manner.

Design/methodology/approach - Looking at a sample of 27 emerging market economies between 1980 and 2014, the authors resort to both static panel techniques as well as dynamic impulse response function analysis using local projection methods to uncover the direct impact of adjustments on inequality. Findings - The authors find that fiscal consolidations tend to lead to an increase in income inequality and reduce the redistributive role of fiscal policy. Spending-based consolidations are more detrimental to income distribution than tax based ones and fiscal retrenchment during bad times raises inequality. In times of fiscal expansion inequality seems to rise in the medium term and this effect is larger if the economy is booming. Research limitations/implications - The distributional effects of consolidation, i.e. whether consolidation can confer benefits, must be balanced against the potential longer term benefits. It should be recognized that there is scope for improving the targeting and efficiency of public programs and that fiscal adjustments would not unavoidably run into such an efficiency vs equity trade-off. Originality/value - The paper, applying a consistent methodology, documents the set of fiscal episodes emerging market economies experienced over time. The authors empirically examine both the static and dynamic links between fiscal consolidation and inequality. Since composition matters, the authors explore how spending and tax-based fiscal consolidations affect income distribution. The authors conduct several robustness checks including the use of alternative income distribution proxies and state-contingent estimations on the phase of the business cycle.","[Jalles, Joao Tovar] IMF, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Jalles, JT (通讯作者)，IMF, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",joaojalles@gmail.com,"Jalles, Joao Tovar/AAA-9923-2019","Jalles, Joao Tovar/0000-0002-7171-5076",,,,,58,12,12,0,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We examine the flow-performance relation for different classes of U.S. domestic equity mutual funds. Our results show a stronger positive relation for the retail class than for the institutional class. More importantly, the significant relation for the retail class is mainly driven by funds with net outflow. This evidence is inconsistent with the smart-money hypothesis. We further show that retail funds exhibit greater persistence than institutional funds in net outflow. Once we control for expected fund flowfund flows, the flow-performance relation is no longer significant. We also perform robustness checks based on international funds and bond funds.

The appropriate risk management should lead to an efficient allocation of available funds. Approaches based on Value at Risk measure have been used as a means for measuring market risk since the late 20th century, although regulators newly suggest to apply more complex method of Expected Shortfall. While evaluating models for market risk estimation based on Value at Risk is relatively simple and involves so-called backtesting procedure, in the case of Expected Shortfall we cannot apply similar procedure. In this article we therefore focus on an alternative method for comprehensive evaluation of VaR models at various significance levels by means of data envelopment analysis (DEA). This approach should lead to the adoption of the model which is also suitable in terms of the Expected Shortfall criterion. Based on the illustrative results from the US stock market we conclude that NIG model and historical simulation should be preferred to normal distribution and GARCH model. We can also recommend to estimate the parameters from the period slightly shorter than two years.","[Kresta, Ales; Tichy, Tomas; Toloo, Mehdi] Vysoka Skola Banska Tech Univ, Ekon Fak, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Kresta, A (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Banska Tech Univ, Ekon Fak, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",ales.kresta@vsb.cz; tomas.tichy@vsb.cz; mehdi.toloo@vsb.cz,"Kresta, Aleš/J-8603-2013; Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Toloo, Mehdi/C-2679-2014; Kresta, Aleš/L-1251-2019; Toloo, Mehdi/F-7575-2019","Kresta, Aleš/0000-0001-8621-3493; Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330; Kresta, Aleš/0000-0001-8621-3493; Toloo, Mehdi/0000-0002-6977-4608",,,,,33,2,2,1,9,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The intensity of uptake was measured using an index that accounted for the number of CA components used, their relative importance, and the rate and extent of their application. Previous studies ignore some or all of these important aspects of uptake. The determinants of use and intensity were identified using a double hurdle model. Although most smallholders applied the reduced tillage or crop rotation components of CA, few combined these practices with mulching. Farm size and experience with CA technology impacted positively on the current use of CA, while distance from town (market) and ownership of an ox-drawn plough reduced the intensity of its uptake. Sensitivity analysis showed that these results change when partial measures of CA uptake are used, emphasising the importance of establishing a comprehensive measure of intensity.

In the model the bank jointly determines the capital issuance and investment policy. Given an exogenous minimum capital requirement, lower-of-cost-or-market accounting is the most effective regime that induces the bank to issue more excess equity capital above the minimum required level and implement less risky investment policy. However, the disciplining role of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting may discourage the bank from exerting project discovery effort ex-ante. From the regulator's perspective, the accounting regime that maximizes the social welfare is determined by a tradeoff between the social cost of capital regulation and the efficiency of the bank's project discovery efforts. When the former effect dominates, the regulator prefers lower-of-cost-or-market accounting; when the latter effect dominates, the regulator may prefer other regimes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The data used in this study came from the 2013 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), which is a national survey. Older adults aged 60 and above were included in the study. The Andersen Health Care Services Utilization Behavioral Model was used as the study framework to understand the impact of health insurance coverage on health care services utilization. The framework discusses the relationship between predisposing elements, enabling variables, and need for care factors and health care services utilization. The main results show that predisposing, enabling and need for care factors predicted health care services utilization among the elderly both in urban and rural China. It is expected that this study will extend knowledge in the area of health insurance and health care service utilization, giving us insight into the overall effects of health insurance coverage on health service use among older adults.","[Lin Wenyi; Sun Zhigang; Hu Yiya] JiNan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Lin, WY (通讯作者)，JiNan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",linwenyi2008@163.com; 821370509@qq.com; 543314883@qq.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,10,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,518,525,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700036,0

Employing univariate and multivariate switching regime beta models, our results suggest that the public real estate markets examined responded significantly to the financial crisis with a significant increase in the volatility parameter compared to normal period. Moreover, the linkages of the public real estate markets with the two world market indices have been altered differently by the financial crisis, and are enhanced in the post-crisis period for the European region. In contrast, the three major Asian public real estate markets display reduced risk spillover effect in the low volatility state from the world market in recent years. Our findings offer important and yet different implications for investors in their pursuit for portfolio diversification and policymakers in contagion management in the Asian and European public real estate and stock markets after a recent major financial crisis.","[Liow, Kim Hiang; Ye, Qing] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117566, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Liow, KH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",rstlkh@nus.edu.sg; yeging@gmail.com,"Liow, KimHiang/K-7295-2013",,Ministry of Education (Singapore) [R-297-000-119-112],"Ministry of Education (Singapore)(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","The first author wishes to acknowledge the funding support given by the Ministry of Education (Singapore) in respect of the research project R-297-000-119-112 to which this paper is related to.

With respect to preservation of industry, these restrictive instruments are accompanied by an opportunity to obtain subsidies from operational programmes in the case of implementation of measures beyond the mandatory requirements. The Moravian-Silesian Region is one of the regions worst affected by high air pollution; a significant part of the OP ENV funds was allocated there as environmental investment. Besides a reduction in the air pollutant emissions, the implementation of the supported measures also has economic impacts. The objective of the paper is an assessment of the economic and social impacts of the environmental investment using input-output modelling. Among other things, it follows from the paper that the implementation of environmental measures worth CZK 5.1 billion in the Moravian-Silesian Region induced an additional production in the Czech Republic in 2013-2015 of CZK 9.7 billion. The impact of the investment was assessed also based on gross added value, generated profits of contractors, and additional demand for workforce in 2014-2015 in form of full-time contracts. The investment was burdened by a high degree of imports because the technologies used are not manufactured in the Czech Republic.","[Machac, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Machác, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Prague, Czech Republic.",machac@e-academia.eu,"Macháč, Jan/AEQ-1532-2022",,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,297,304,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100038,0

To this end, a novel measure of stock market sentiment, dubbed the Net Psychology Index (NPI), based on information contained in Bloomberg News's end-of-the-day stock market reports, is confronted with a battery of multivariate empirical analyses. Results suggest that NPI is statistically different from popular sentiment proxies within the literature. NPI exhibits predictive power, increasing stock returns in the short run with this impact dissipating in the medium term. NPI does not exhibit asymmetric effects on returns for size- and momentum-related portfolios. A trading strategy based on NPI generates a statistically significant positive monthly return. Recursive out-of-sample fit analyses report a lower standard deviation of forecasting errors for NPI-based returns models versus competing accounts.","[Mangee, Nicholas] Armstrong State Univ, Savannah, GA USA",University System of Georgia; Armstrong Atlantic State University,"Mangee, N (通讯作者)，Armstrong State Univ, Dept Econ, 11935 Abercorn St, Savannah, GA 31419 USA.",nicholas.mangee@armstrong.edu,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),The author is grateful to the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) for supporting this research.,,47,10,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The subject of this research is the securities market as a mechanism for the redistribution of financial resources. The purpose of the research is the development of the interaction scheme which is efficient, effective and feasible in the current environment between the securities market and the regional economy. The theoretical basis of this research is the theory of the securities market. To achieve this goal, the authors used a functional-relational approach to the study of the activities of the securities market participants. During the research, the following results were obtained: possible submodels of interaction between the securities market participants were identified; the reserve of increasing the efficiency of the securities market in the regions of Western Siberia was revealed; the model of the priority interaction between the securities market participants for the benefit of the regional economy was built; the assessment of the possible effect of the development of the regional securities market on key indicators of the regional economy development was done. The obtained results are recommended for use in the development of regional economic policies and programmes of socio-economic development of regions. Long-term stimulation of the economic growth is a very complex process, but with the proper elaboration of the organizational issues, implementation of the proposed model of interaction among the securities market participants will ensure high investment and business activities of the regional economic entities.","[Miller, Alexander; Miller, Andrey] Omsk State Univ, Dept Econ & Financial Policy, Omsk, Russia",Dostoevsky Omsk State University,"Miller, A (通讯作者)，Omsk State Univ, Dept Econ & Financial Policy, Omsk, Russia.",aem55@yandex.ru,"Miller, Alexander/R-2948-2016",,Russian Foundation for Humanities [16-12-55008],Russian Foundation for Humanities,"The work was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Humanities, project No. 16-12-55008.",,15,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,429,437,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600071,0

Indeed, fatal failure has been repeated. Most managers in organization, however, know importance of learning from failure since it leads them improve their business performance. One of the reasons is said to be poor organizational memory. Inadequate organizational memory causing incomplete recall does not well contribute to accurate learning. There is a unique company, which has succeeded in establishing their way to leaning from failure. Executing the learning activity, they have not repeated same failures which were once reviewed with their way. Eventually they have maintained good business performance. We, in this paper, studied a case of organizational learning from failure in the Japanese company and explored acceleratory factors in the process of organizational memory in the learning. We found that Computer based memory like knowledge repository augments hard memory like written rule, scripts, routine work and so on, but may inhibit soft memory like human memory in the organizational learning from failure in the company. We also found that hard memory is more effective than soft memory in the company.","[Nagayoshi, Sanetake] Shizuoka Univ, Acad Inst, Coll Global Interdisciplinary Studies, Shizuoka, Japan; [Nakamura, Jun] Shibaura Inst Technol, Grad Sch Engn Management, Tokyo, Japan",Shizuoka University; Shibaura Institute of Technology,"Nagayoshi, S (通讯作者)，Shizuoka Univ, Acad Inst, Coll Global Interdisciplinary Studies, Shizuoka, Japan.",nagayoshi@inf.shizuoka.ac.jp; jyulis@shibaura-it.ac.jp,"Nakamura, Jun/AAZ-2766-2021","Nakamura, Jun/0000-0001-9855-798X","JSPS (JSPS KAKENHI Grant) [15K00319, 17K03872]",JSPS (JSPS KAKENHI Grant),"The authors thank the president Mr. Yasukazu Sengoku, a director Mr. Masashi Tokunaga, and the employees in Sangikyo Corporation, who kindly dedicated to our research works.

Sometimes there are good, sometimes not. Not, because of many scandals that occur. It happens really often, that contract is disadvantageous, because price is too high. Usually because only few companies take part in tender, so competitive fight is too weak and price rises. Sometimes it is vice versa, price is too low, we can say unrealistic. Winning company later admits that and asks another money in order to proceed with delivery of subject of procurement. In most cases procurement authority has to accept this, because other companies aren't able to continue in semi finished task, e. g in IT projects. Aim of this work was identification of possible free data sources for public procurement analysis and subsequently to understand attributes and to design analyses we could do with them. Analyzing of results of procurement can bring us some interesting knowledge about this process, like who is winning tenders, what criteria can affect final price, what type of competition is most useful and so on. We used data source from Aliancia Fair-play, ORSR - Trade Register of Slovak Republic (Obchodny Register SR) and Register UZ - Register of Financial Statements (Register Uctovnych Zavierok). Generally we come with this article to present some interesting view on results of public procurement in Slovakia in chosen time period from 2009 to 2016. We have found, that draft price in tenders is mostly overvalued, even in case of one competitor in tender. We also found, that EU fund tender can affect final price more than number of competitors. In last part of use case study regarded financial indicators and draft/final price we proved some common thoughts, that companies with bigger assets hit final price better than those with lower or that companies with bigger liabilities compete in low value tenders.","[Niroda, Peter] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Cepel, Martin] LIGS Univ LLC Honolulu, Richards St,Suite 836, Honolulu, HI USA",Technical University Kosice,"Niroda, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",peter.niroda@student.tuke.sk; cepel@benzinol.com,"Cepel, Martin/AAY-6375-2020",,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,567,579,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700059,0

Field research included collecting data from primary sources within 150 enterprises in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thirty variables regarding the areas of enterprise profile and data driven personalization were considered by applying instruments of questionnaire and interview. The prediction of business success was experimentally tested by applying the following four algorithms: J48, IBk, MLP, and NB. Based on application of the above mentioned algorithms, research results show that the highest percentage of prediction of business success (74%) was reached with J48 algorithm. Other results of prediction were 62%, 52% and 64% for IBk, MLP, and NB algorithms, respectively.

Given the exploratory nature of the research, after an in-depth literature review, we conducted an online survey among Italian consumers to see if there is a significant correlation between IC principal sub-dimensions (i.e. Relational Capital, Human Capital and Structural Capital) and the VCC components founded in our analysis. Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we have analyzed 270 usable questionnaires finding that, in order to decide to co-create value with firms, the IC sub-dimensions play a critical role. This macro-result is coherent with literature that acknowledge to IC a crucial role in order to enhance the relationship and the closeness between firms and consumers. In addition, the findings show that the motivations (i.e., IC drivers/components) that influence Italian consumers decision to participate in value co-creation activities with firms are quite homogeneous and similar both for those who have already participated to these activities as well for those who have never participated to them. The study has several managerial implications as well as limitations. In fact, the survey has been conducted only among Italian consumers and therefore the research should be extended by a geographically standpoint. In addition, the research has analyzed only the demand-side, while it would be certainly useful to know the views of companies on these issues also with qualitative methods (e.g., with in-depth interviews to top-management). This study provides to practitioners important suggestions and warnings about the importance of the development and the enforcement of IC sub-dimensions in order to (co-)create value with external actors and consequently suggests the importance of using a open approach towards consumers to create an effective and interactive relationship with them and for the appropriation of the co-created value. The study fills a gap in the literature, since there are not so many references in literature for a deep understanding of the concrete relationship between IC and VCC (and no one with regard to Italian consumers). In addition, this paper offers an example of large-scale investigation that, compared to previous studies, is distinguished by the technique used to answer to our research questions.","[Rossi, Marco Valerio; Magni, Domitilla] Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Rossi, MV (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy.",marcovalerio.rossi@uniroma1.it; domitilla.magni@uniroma1.it,"Magni, Domitilla/AAE-8279-2019; Rossi, Marco Valerio/GOH-2631-2022; Magni, Domitilla/HPC-9136-2023","Rossi, Marco Valerio/0000-0002-0626-9890; MAGNI, Domitilla/0000-0001-5555-6004; Rossi, Marco Valerio/0000-0002-0774-2627",,,,,45,0,0,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,269,278,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000034,0

One of the accountability forms of zakat organizations is published financial statements. The zakat organizations obtain a mandate from the donors to manage and utilize zakat funds as well. The zakat organizations are responsible either to the donors and recipients or to Almighty God. The zakat organizations have a big role in social and economic life. Zakat as a form of social concern which can overcome poverty in a country and improve the quality of life of the recipients through programs of zakat utilization. Paying zakat is an obligation for Muslim. Indonesia is a country which has the majority of Muslim with great zakat potential but its realization is still low. This is due to the lack of public awareness in paying zakat and the lack of public trust against zakat organizations. To gain public trust in zakat organizations, good governance is needed, namely transparency and accountability. Lack of public trust is related to the zakat management which has many obstacles, such as the utilization of zakat funds is not well managed, the quality of human resources and integrity of zakat management is still low, lack of standardization of zakat management and internal control pretty weak. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore how to build a good accountability through culture values of Bugis Makassar ethnic group.

Individuals are affected by economic security while planning their household budget. The aim of this paper is to analyse changes of economic security in Latvia in the context of globalization. Authors have done a review of literature on economic security, comparing and analysing different definitions of economic security both at individual and state level. Authors have also calculated the level of economic security in Latvia by various methods based on the literature review. Economic security index for Latvia is calculated using the Osberg and Sharpe method and the United Nations indicators method. It is concluded that globalization has differentiated impact on economic security in Latvia. After joining the European Union the level of economic security in Latvia has increased, but during the global financial crisis it deteriorated. During the financial crises, the factors impacting economic security negatively were stronger than the ones impacting it positively, but in the years after the crises the situation has slightly improved. This paper contributes to theoretical and practical research of economic security as there have been very few research papers about this topic in Latvia in comparison with other countries. This paper provides first steps to create an Economic security index which would be suitable for Latvia, as the research concludes that the existing methods are not comprehensive.","[Savrina, Baiba; Supe, Janis] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Savrina, B (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"ŠAVRIŅA, Baiba/ABG-4319-2021",,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,575,582,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400057,0

The model integrates agronomic and bio-physical data into a regional bottom-up land use optimization model to account for heterogeneity in opportunity costs of agricultural production choices and environmental outcomes. The results suggest that from the economical point of view, most of the crops with highest net returns are cultivated under intensive, high nitrogen fertilizers input management practices (with 80 - 120 kg of nitrogen per hectare). On the other hand crops like pea, soy or potatoes achieves the highest net returns under low or medium input management practices.

Banking sector plays a major role as banks provide an important portion of funds to business sector. Banks offer loans based on the performance of each individual firm. The criteria of selection change over time. In 2004 after adoption of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in Slovakia the agriculture did change. Decoupling of direct payments from the first Pillar in combination with the average size of the farm cause even bigger changes as in the old member states. The paper aims to measure the effects of CAP on access to credit of individual farms and the changes in the bank preferences. Agriculture in Slovakia has different structure compared to agriculture in old EU member states. The majority of UAA (75%) is cultivated by large farms -agricultural holdings- with 1200ha per farm on average. Therefore although subsidies in form of direct payments per hectare are lower than in old member states, the payment per farm is one of the biggest in EU. Direct payments play an important role also in connection with access to credit. Subsidies granted by Agricultural Paying Agency serve as collateral for banks and they significantly decrease the default risk of agricultural holdings. There is a significant difference between small and large farm access to credit. Profitability is one of the key criteria of banks to offer loans to businesses. The profitability of agriculture in Slovakia remains very low on average. The CAP favors crop production and therefore crop farms are much more profitable when compared to animal production.","[Toth, Marian; Bohacikova, Andrea] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Palkovic, Jozef] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Tóth, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",marian.toth.fem@gmail.com; andrea.bohacik@gmail.com; jozef.palkovic@uniag.sk,"Palkovič, Jozef/IUO-3489-2023; Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019",,project VEGA [1/0666/17]; Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-15-0552]; KEGA [041SPU-4/2017],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); KEGA,"This paper was supported by the project VEGA no. 1/0666/17 with the title Impact of Integration and Globalization on Business Risk in Slovak Agriculture, by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-15-0552 with the title Impact of financial markets and agricultural policies on the agri-food sector and KEGA no. 041SPU-4/2017 with the title Financial management a business risk in Slovak agriculture.",,4,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,410,416,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400056,0

The focus is on market income at the top and bottom of the income distribution. Results show that increases in overall freedom are associated with average income growth. When viewed separately, an increase in overall freedom is associated with larger income growth rates for income earners in the bottom 90% relative to the top 10%. Interestingly, results show that increases in overall economic freedom are related to larger relative growth rates for the top 10% incomes within high-income states and larger relative growth rates for the bottom 90% incomes within low-income states. Top-to-bottom income ratio regressions suggest a negative and statistically significant relationship between economic freedom and income inequality.","[Wiseman, Travis] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Starkville, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Wiseman, T (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Starkville, MS 39762 USA.",ravis.wiseman@msstate.ed,,,,,,,36,17,18,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Knowledge about the presence of a central market and its price dynamic effects on satellite markets will assist the effectiveness of food assistance and other humanitarian food price support interventions. This is of particular interest to constant food aid recipients such as Ethiopia. This article intends to empirically investigate as to whether or not there is a central maize market that dictate and lead price information flow over the regional wholesale maize markets in Ethiopia. If such a dominant maize market exists, then how does its price affect the maize grain prices of major regional wholesale maize markets in Ethiopia? The extended VAR procedure of Toda and the Yamamoto Granger Causality approach is used to test the central maize market hypothesis. Furthermore, we use the system of seemingly unrelated regression model to examine the effects of the central market price on three wholesale regional maize market prices in Ethiopia. The results indicate that Addis Ababa wholesale maize market influences the maize price formation of all regional maize markets examined in this study. Therefore, interventions targeting the central wholesale market could successfully provide a buffer for local maize surplus and consumption markets against undesirable price shocks stemming from the central market.","[Yami, Mesay] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa; [Meyer, Ferdi] Univ Pretoria, BFAP, Pretoria, South Africa; [Hassan, Rashid] Univ Pretoria, CEEPA, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Yami, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa.;Meyer, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, BFAP, Pretoria, South Africa.;Hassan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, CEEPA, Pretoria, South Africa.",mesay44@gmail.com; ferdi.meyer@up.ac.za; rashid.hassan@up.ac.za,"Hassan, Rashid/CAG-5246-2022",,Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP),Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP).

Over the past decades of years, college English education, despite its reforms of syllabuses and curriculum requirements as well as the inclusion and expansion of translation part in the national College English Test examinations, has hardly made any spectacular progress on the fostering of non-English major students' English translating capabilities. Absence of independent translation teaching courses, high-grade textbooks, and qualified teachers exists on translation teaching in college English education. Three suggestions are proposed to solve the awkward situation. First, offer independent translation courses by adding one period of specialized translation class or making translation a selective course to equip non-English college students with more translation competence to better facilitate their future careers. Second, compile special translating course books integrally, systematically, and pertinently to stimulate students' interest and enthusiasm so as to improve their real translating competence. Third, provide qualified translation faculty through appropriate training programs or recruiting specialized translation teachers. This paper pioneers a new way to the research of non-English college translation education and provides some profound insights.","[Yao, Qin] Fudan Univ, Foreign Language & Literature Mobile Stn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yao, Qin] Jiangsu Univ, Foreign Language & Literature Dept, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Jiangsu University,"Yao, Q (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Foreign Language & Literature Mobile Stn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Yao, Q (通讯作者)，Jiangsu Univ, Foreign Language & Literature Dept, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,"zhu, zhu/JDN-0159-2023",,General Financial Grant from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M601481],General Financial Grant from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation,"This paper is sponsored by General Financial Grant from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, NO. 2016M601481.",,6,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-435-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,49.0,,,,,,217,219,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6OH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426885700053,0

The supplier finds that demand disruption and retailer's sales cost disruption happen simultaneously after her production plan is formulated. How to maximize the total supply chain profit in the centralized and the decentralized decisions is analyzed, which is a new problem compared with the previous studies. The results obtained are as follows. The supplier needs to adjust the retail price if the disruptions satisfy a given condition. If the disruptions satisfy other conditions, the supplier needs to adjust both the retail price and the production quantity. In the decentralized decision, an improved revenue-sharing contract, a new supply contract, can coordinate the disrupted supply chain.

This study provides preliminary evidence about the application of the somatic marker hypothesis in investment choices using heart rate and skin conductance response measures. Twenty undergraduate students were split equally into expert (defined by familiarity with investments) and novice (no familiarity) groups, because previous research has associated expertise with cognitive differences in decision making scenarios. Both groups completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and Behavioral Investment Allocation Strategy task-a computerized simulation of real trading scenarios-as assessments of investment decision-making in conditions of low versus high uncertainty, as defined by the Bayesian calculation (level of certainty is more than: (1 - ( 300%))/(300% - (- 300%)) = 66.67% (0.67). Results suggest that, although primaryinducers (innate physiological responses) support and guide optimal decision-making in conditions of uncertainty, secondary inducers (physiological responses dependent on memory/experience) moderate this effect; that is, the stressful thoughts that accompany the task restrict optimal decision-making.

The price of gold coin is an important factor in cost-benefit analysis for individuals in their marriage and divorce decisions in Iran. Dowries (Mehrieh) are usually in the form of gold coin and a wife has a legal right to request them from her husband upon both parties signing the marriage contract. Increasing the price of gold coin may intensify the internal stress and struggles within families, leading to a higher probability of divorce. We investigated the long-run relationship between real price of gold coin and divorce rate for the case of Iran over the period 1980-2014. Controlling for other factors such as women's education, social globalization, economic growth rate, and the war period with Iraq, our regression results showed that there is a positive and significant long-run relationship between real price of gold coin (as well as unanticipated changes in real price of gold coin) and marital instability.","[Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza] Philipps Univ Marburg, Ctr Near & Middle Eastern Studies CNMS, Econ Middle East Res Grp, Marburg, Germany; [Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza] ERF, Cairo, Egypt; [Gholipour, Hassan F.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Swinburne Business Sch, John St, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Gholipour, Hassan F.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Transformat Innovat, John St, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",Philipps University Marburg; Ifo Institut; Swinburne University of Technology; Swinburne University of Technology,"Gholipour, HF (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Swinburne Business Sch, John St, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.;Gholipour, HF (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Transformat Innovat, John St, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",farzanegan@uni-marburg.de; hgholipour@swin.edu.au,"Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza/AFM-2779-2022","Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza/0000-0002-6533-3645",,,,,48,3,3,1,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

We show that, if the government perceives the citizens' demand as a demand for substitutable services, it will choose provision by two independent agencies. If the government perceives the citizens' demand as a demand for complementary services, it will choose provision by a single consolidated agency. Exogenous shocks to the number of citizens amplify these incentives. Evidence from the Italian National Health Service (NHS) supports this hypothesis. Results show a positive effect of proxies of substitutable services on the number of regional local health authorities and a negative effect of proxies of complementary services. The major immigration amnesties, taken as shocks to the number of citizens entitled to the service, magnify these effects.","[Fedeli, Silvia] Sapienza Univ Roma, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ & Diritto, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Leonida, Leone] Kings Coll London, Kings Business Sch, Bush House,30 Aldwich, London WC2B 4BG, England; [Santoni, Michele] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Econ Management & Metodi Quantitat, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, MI, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of London; King's College London,"Leonida, L (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Kings Business Sch, Bush House,30 Aldwich, London WC2B 4BG, England.",silvia.fedeli@uniroma1.it; leone.leonida@kcl.ac.uk; michele.santoni@unimi.it,"Santoni, Michele/K-8421-2017","Santoni, Michele/0000-0001-5971-4751; Leonida, Leone/0000-0002-6721-8413",,,,,56,4,6,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2018,177.0,3-4,,,SI,,265,285,,10.1007/s11127-018-0569-6,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GW2IX,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446708000005,0

The empirical relevance of this result has been challenged by many studies. In this paper, we show that such extrinsic instability associated with a balanced-budget rule is a robust phenomenon in a similar closed-economy setting enhanced with endogenous capital utilization. This suggests that the design or operation of a balanced-budget fiscal policy should recognize that it may constitute a potential source of self-fulfilling prophecies and belief-driven fluctuations.","[Huang, Kevin X.

What is the relation between firms' job-creation incentives and stock market valuations? We answer these questions in a model with time-varying risk, modeled as a small and variable probability of an economic disaster. A high probability implies greater risk and lower future growth, lowering the incentives of firms to invest in hiring. During periods of high risk, stock market valuations are low and unemployment rises. The model thus explains volatility in equity and labor markets, and the relation between the two.","[Kilic, Mete] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Wachter, Jessica A.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wachter, Jessica A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Southern California; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kilic, M (通讯作者)，USC Marshall Sch Business, 3670 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",mkilic@marshall.usc.edu,,,,,,,59,24,27,2,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

However, little is known about the actual underlying risk to the fiscal sector just after such events. In this paper, we estimate the risk of fiscal shortages due to tropical storms in the Caribbean. To this end, first we use a panel VAR and estimate that while government expenditure does not respond to damages due to tropical storms, there is a significant contemporaneous effect on fiscal revenue. The results also reveal that different components of expenditure and revenue respond differently to hurricane shocks. Then, employing a parametric bulk extreme value model on estimated losses due to historical events, we show that the fiscal shortage due to storms can potentially be sizeable depending on the rarity of the event, but varies considerably across islands. However, any risk assessment is fraught with considerable uncertainty, particularly for rare but potentially very damaging tropical storm strikes.","[Ouattara, Bazoumana] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Strobl, Eric] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland; [Vermeiren, Jan] Kinet Anal Corp, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Yearwood, Stacia] Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facil, St Michael, Barbados",University of Manchester; University of Bern,"Ouattara, B (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",osman.ouattara-2@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on the qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 34 senior managers in Ethiopia in matched pairs of four commercial organisations in private and state sectors and secondary sources. Findings The research reveals how the erstwhile protected state-owned organisations responded to institutional complexity, by seeking to extend their legitimacy claims whereas the emergent private sector organisations sought to construct a new legitimacy, in part by adopting some of the logics used by state-firms. Research limitations/implications Extending this study with longitudinal comparative case studies across other emerging market economies could cast light on the varied ways in which organisations manage institutional complexities. Practical implications It is imperative that the government and policy makers have clarity in issuing directives and other signals about valued objectives to be pursued by enterprises. Otherwise, the organisational level actors may remain uncertain about the acceptable behaviours and responses and are likely to waste time and resources in trying to anticipate an unclear sense of direction. Originality/value This is a novel study which examines how organisational actors manage institutional complexity in a transitional economy context by undertaking legitimacy building work and appearing to meet state-public expectations.","[Woldesenbet, Kassa] De Montfort Univ, Strateg Management & Mkt, Leicester, Leics, England",De Montfort University,"Woldesenbet, K (通讯作者)，De Montfort Univ, Strateg Management & Mkt, Leicester, Leics, England.",kwoldesenbet@dmu.ac.uk,,"Woldesenbet Beta, Kassa/0000-0001-8144-2254",,,,,71,7,7,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Using a dataset covering more than 400 Paris Club agreements, this paper fills that gap. It provides a comprehensive description of the evolving characteristics of these operations and studies their impact on debtors. The progressive introduction of new terms of treatment gradually turned the Paris Club from an institution primarily concerned with preserving creditors' claims into an instrument to foster development in the world's poorer nations, among other objectives. Our study finds that more generous restructuring conditions involving nominal relief are associated with an acceleration of per capita GDP growth and with a reduction in poverty and inequality. We also find that countries receiving nominal relief tend to receive lower aid flows subsequently, the opposite being the case for countries receiving high reductions in the net present value of their obligations, but no nominal haircuts.

Given the importance of perceived fairness, it is essential to understand the major factors that influence customers' perception of the fairness of prices set by revenue management methods. A nationwide survey was conducted to identify the perception of fairness of the price setting methods, the perception of price fairness in relation to certain factors of influence, the perceived fairness of different pricing tactics, and the evaluation of price fairness for the latest experience in a hotel and the influence on the purchasing intentions. Structural equation modelling was used to assess the influence of distributive and procedural fairness on the perceived value and the buying intentions. The resulting model essentially shows that tourists who perceive a price as fair are inclined to consider the method used to set that price as correct The main findings regarding revenue management-type approaches emphasize that the price setting method oriented on competition is considered the fairest method for setting prices. Most survey participants believe that the most frequent situation of unfair price is found in accommodation services. Among the unfair pricing tactics are, on the one hand the difference of prices based on the nationality of the customers (higher prices for tourists from abroad) and, on the other hand, the 9-ending prices. Offering lower prices for longer periods and for larger groups represents the fairest pricing tactics that hotels can use. The manners in which Romanian customers use to rate price fairness for hotel services mainly relies on the comparison of the current price to a previous one, and on their own belief of what fair price should be. The managerial implication of this study is linked to the setting prices decisions in order to be perceived as fair prices/tariffs.","[Tuclea, Claudia-Elena; Vranceanu, Diana Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Nastase, Carmen-Eugenia] Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Suceava, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Tuclea, CE (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",claudiaelenatuclea@yahoo.com,"Vranceanu, Diana/L-3115-2019; Tuclea, Claudia/R-7491-2019; Nastase, Carmen/AAO-5779-2020","Vranceanu, Diana/0000-0002-5547-7493; TUCLEA, Claudia-Elena/0000-0002-8104-0041; Nastase, Carmen/0000-0002-1660-2087",,,,,49,0,1,1,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,905,919,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/905,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700006,0

Transfers from teacher surplus schools to deficit schools within a 10 km radius in Haryana, a state of India for which we have geo-coded location of schools in 2013, enables 19 percent of deficit schools to meet the minimum requirement. We use the mandated norms in the Right to Education Act in India, to define deficit and surplus schools. In the process we also provide a characterization of schools that are in deficit and those in surplus. We find that connectedness, the social composition of the enrolled students, the income of the neighborhood are important determinants of a school being in deficit. Surplus schools mirror the results on deficit, but not always so: they are far more heterogenous, leading to possibilities that they may in fact be no different than some low shortage deficit schools. Keeping in the background this heterogeneity in surplus schools, we design local transfers between schools and evaluate them on how well they match characteristics of the donor and recipient schools. The chosen algorithm is compared to another transfer rule that reduces the variance of shortages across schools and is found to be better in matching characteristics, that is, the donor and recipient schools are, on an average, matched in characteristics: in terms of the development of the region, its rural/urban location, connectivity and school characteristics. A comparison of transfers that follow our redistribution rule to transfers resulting from an actual transfer policy shows that while our rule removes deficits in rural areas, the actual transfers favored more developed regions.

We present a method for identifying domiciled family firms using register data; this method offers greater accuracy than previous methods. We apply this method to Swedish data concerning firm ownership, governance, and kinship from 2004 to 2010. We find that the family firm is a significant organizational form, contributing over one third of all employment and gross domestic product (GDP). Family firms are common in most industries and range in size. Furthermore, we find that, compared to private non-family firms, family firms have fewer total assets, employment, and sales and carry higher solidity, although family firms are more profitable. These differences diminish with firm size. We conclude that the term family firm includes a large variety of firms, and we call for increased attention to their heterogeneity.","[Andersson, Fredrik W.; Poldahl, Andreas] Stat Sweden, SE-70189 Orebro, Sweden; [Johansson, Dan; Karlsson, Johan; Lodefalk, Magnus] Orebro Univ, Sch Business, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden; [Johansson, Dan] HUI Res, SE-10329 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lodefalk, Magnus] Ratio Inst, SE-10364 Stockholm, Sweden",Statistics Sweden; Orebro University,"Karlsson, J (通讯作者)，Orebro Univ, Sch Business, SE-70182 Orebro, Sweden.",fredrik.andersson@scb.se; dan.johansson@oru.se; johan.karlsson@oru.se; magnus.lodefalk@oru.se; andreas.poldahl@scb.se,"Lodefalk, Magnus/AAI-1579-2021","Lodefalk, Magnus/0000-0003-0149-9598; Andersson, Fredrik/0000-0003-1043-0728",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation; Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation; Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth,"Lodefalk gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation.

Ex ante riskier borrowers receive more funding at the extensive margin when interest rates are lower. Ex post performance is independent of the level of interest rates at origination. Still, loans granted in periods of very low and stable interest rates show higher default rates once interest rates start to increase. Risk-taking is stronger among banks with lower capital ratios, suggesting that this channel may be linked to managerial incentives for risk-shifting.","[Bonfim, Diana; Soares, Carla] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Bonfim, Diana] Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Soares, Carla] Nova SBE, Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Bonfim, D (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal.;Bonfim, D (通讯作者)，Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",dbonfim@bportugal.pt; csoares@bportugal.pt,,"Bonfim, Diana/0000-0002-3108-8514",,,,,41,24,26,3,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

However, the existing applications of classical Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition face criticism for their imprecise understanding of the factors affecting institutional discrimination in labor markets, as well as for their lack of power in formulating well-targeted anti-discrimination policies. Following Oaxaca (1973), we propose a new method to decompose the total discrimination index (TDI) to analyze employment and wage discrimination in the labor markets of developing countries. The TDI is decomposed into the employment discrimination index (EDI) and the wage discrimination index (WDI), then into the underpayment index to majorities (UPI) and the overpayment index to minorities (OPI). We apply this method to the institutional discrimination against rural migrants in China's urban areas. Using national representative data from 2002 to 2013, we have found that, 1) the TDI increased quickly after China entered the WTO, then dropped after anti-discrimination policies were implemented. 2) The TDI is mainly determined by the UPI, while the TDI's fluctuation is mainly determined by the WDI. Our method provides insights into the changing composition of employment and wage discrimination and their respective labor market outcomes in developing countries. As a result, appropriate policy measures may be developed accordingly. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A natural choice would be to adopt a fully nonparametric specification of the relationship in order to let the data reveal its nonlinearity. But, we would be faced with the problem of the curse of dimensionality due to the presence of many control variables in addition to income. Here, we first propose to estimate generalized additive models where only income is supposed to enter nonlinearly in the specification. Second, we use a recent cross-validation procedure in order to choose among various competing specifications including the parametric double-log specification widely used in the literature in addition to GAM specifications. This methodology is implemented for each of the six waves of the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey from 2004 to 2014. The calorie-income relationship is nonlinear whatever the wave. A strong response of calorie intake to an increase in income for poorest households is highlighted, showing that there is still room for income-based policies to fight against malnutrition. A byproduct of this methodology is the decomposition of the evolution of average calorie intake between the two waves in the part due to population change and that coming from the change in calorie-income relationship, shedding new light on the nutritional transition in Vietnam.

In response to the landmark work of Obst et al. (Environ Resour Econ 64:1-23, 2016. doi: 10.1007/s10640-015-9921-1), we provide arguments with regard to the suitability of particular valuation approaches. Generally, we agree that respective valuation methods need to produce values that are consistent with national accounting standards such as representing exchange values. However, we disagree with their conclusions regarding specific valuation techniques. Firstly, the circumstance that methods used for estimating shadow prices can also be used to derive consumer surplus does not justify the general exclusion of all shadow pricing methods for valuation of ecosystem services for national accounts, especially for public ecosystem services. Secondly, that preference-based methods can also be used to assess welfare changes does not imply that cost-based methods are generally better suited for ecosystem accounting. To the contrary, we see an essential need for preference information in accounting contexts. Thirdly, that accounting standards use a written-down replacement cost approach, does not mean ecosystem accounting requires to employ a replacement cost approach. To the contrary, we argue that assessing ecosystem degradation through restoration costs would be in line with writing down depreciation, but we also point to its limits.","[Droste, Nils; Bartkowski, Bartosz] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Droste, N (通讯作者)，UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",nils.droste@ufz.de; bartosz.bartkowski@ufz.de,"Bartkowski, Bartosz/C-9476-2015; Droste, Nils/I-2449-2019","Bartkowski, Bartosz/0000-0001-5938-1221; Droste, Nils/0000-0003-4357-9115",,,,,45,11,11,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Undoubtedly, the growth in native (foreign) population size will directly contribute to higher public (private) housing price, and indirectly induce higher private (public) housing price via general equilibrium effects. The question is how to quantitatively evaluate the magnitude of each impact. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic general equilibrium framework with heterogeneous native and foreign agents interacting in both public and private housing markets. Natives can upgrade from public to private housing over their lifetime. We also allow the option for foreigners to choose to obtain permanent residency and then compete with natives in the public housing market. We calibrate the model into the Singapore economy between 1993 and 2015. The model accounts for about 85.7% of private housing price growth and 46.2% of public housing growth in the data. The decomposition exercises suggest that native population growth can generate about 67.0% of private housing price growth, while the growth of the foreign population can generate about 7.05% of public housing price growth. Finally, when borrowing is not allowed, the demand for private housing decreases, and this pushes down the private housing price. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The model incorporates rents due to both resource scarcity and capital scarcity as well as intra-region Ricardian rents. Regions set taxes on nonrenewable resource production strategically to balance tax revenues and local benefits from investment conditional on other regions' tax rates. A representative extraction firm then allocates production capital across regions and time to maximize the present value of profits. Generally, we find that the division of resource rent between firms and regional governments ultimately depends on the relative scarcity of natural and production capital, relative costs across space, and the value regional governments place on economic activity. This theoretical result provides policymakers with information on the determinants of optimal tax rates and motivates future empirical research on the factors influencing the division of resource rent in practice.","[Maniloff, Peter] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Manning, Dale T.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado School of Mines; Colorado State University,"Maniloff, P (通讯作者)，Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",maniloff@mines.edu; dale.manning@colostate.edu,,,,,,,39,7,7,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This finding is consistent with the theory that monitoring costs or informational frictions can help explain the adjustment of bank assets at a bilateral country level. Distance is a particularly relevant friction, and has non-uniform effects for advanced and emerging hosts. If the assets are denominated in domestic rather than foreign currency, this can reduce the negative effect of distance on adjustment. Further we find that trade, colonial ties and the history of a position are important for the bilateral adjustment of bank assets.","[Mehigan, Caroline] Trinity Coll Dublin Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland",,"Mehigan, C (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland.",mehigac@tcd.ie,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1566-0141,1873-6173,,EMERG MARK REV,Emerg.

There has been excessive use of spatial econometric models and too much emphasis on statistical procedures in empirical studies. In this study, we contribute to the existing literature by conducting a more rigorous analysis of the relationship between economic growth and emissions in Chinese cities using spatial Durbin models. Our results show that emissions increase monotonically in relation to economic growth at the city level and that the driving effects of economic growth are slightly smaller in central China than in eastern and western China. In addition to economic growth, industry's share of the economy is a major driver of emissions, while technological improvement, measured by energy intensity per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), and the effectiveness of environmental governance flatten the shape of the environmental Kuznets curve. We provide evidence of local spillover effects of explanatory variables on emissions. Economic competition as well as technological diffusion are found to exist in Chinese cities in relation to emissions. We also find carbon leakage between cities only if the per capita GDP of a given city is less than $493 (in 2010 constant dollars). Results hold when robustness checks are performed. Policy makers should carefully consider regional differences and the inherent spatial interactions between factors when formulating carbon reduction policies.","[Meng, Lina] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Huang, Bo] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Bo] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Space & Earth Informat Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Huang, B (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Huang, B (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Space & Earth Informat Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bohuang@cuhk.edu.hk,"meng, li/HTQ-7341-2023; meng, li/GVT-2063-2022; Huang, Bo/H-9874-2014","Meng, Lina/0000-0002-5919-7149; Huang, Bo/0000-0002-5063-3522",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41501586]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China [2016J05106]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720151280],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant No. 41501586), the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China (Grant No. 2016J05106), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 20720151280).

However, choice of marketing communication mix would differ between firms and across industries. This study examines the influence of integrated marketing communications (IMC) dimensions on customer loyalty to mobile telecommunication service among competing firms in telecommunication service industry. Using cross-sectional survey research design, multistage sampling procedure (stratified, quota and simple random) sampling techniques, data was collected from 150 respondents out of which n = 134 copies of the retrieved questionnaires. The data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics (correlation and regression), while hypotheses were tested using the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results show a significant relationship between customer loyalty and direct marketing (r = .375**); publicity (r = .514**); sales promotion (r = .470**) and advertising r = .562**) respectively. The multiple regression result indicates R-2 value of .483, meaning that integrated marketing communication dimensions accounted for 48.3% variance in customer loyalty. The study therefore recommends IMC as a strategic tool for targeting subscribers to patronize and retain them with a mobile telecom service provider for a long time. It further suggests that managers in the industry should prioritize their strategies on the basis of IMC dimension that makes the greatest contribution to the criterion of interest, with beta and high coefficient in their budgetary allocation for the optimal promotional mix to achieve the organisational goal both in short and long-run.","[Oluwafemi, Olaolu Joseph; Adebiyi, Sulazmon Olanrewaju] Univ Lagos, Fac Management Sci, Business Adm Dept, Lagos, Nigeria",University of Lagos,"Oluwafemi, OJ (通讯作者)，Univ Lagos, Fac Management Sci, Business Adm Dept, Lagos, Nigeria.",ooluwafemi@unilag.edu.ng; soadebiji@unilag.edu.ng,"Adebiyi, Sulaimon Olanrewaju/AAQ-5770-2020","Adebiyi, Sulaimon/0009-0001-0546-0060; Adebiyi, Sulaimon Olanrewaju/0000-0001-7657-1182",,,,,51,8,13,2,24,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

What factors shape the effectiveness of policy implementation following reform decisions? These questions increasingly concern the international donor and research communities, given the importance of policy environments in shaping development outcomes and the growing need to achieve development impact with scarce resources. To address these questions, this paper introduces the Kaleidoscope Model of policy change. Inductively derived from empirical examples in developing countries, political economy literature, and theoretical scholarship on the policy process, the model proposes a set of 16 operational hypotheses to identify the conditions under which policies emerge on the agenda and ultimately are implemented. The paper tests the model empirically in Zambia by evaluating eight policy reform episodes related to agricultural input subsidies and vitamin A fortification. Empirical application and hypothesis testing rely on rigorous process tracing using secondary sources and semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 58 stakeholders in Zambia. In the policy reforms studied, a majority of the KM's core variables proved robust across the two distinct policy domains, while a handful emerged as relevant only episodically. In an era of growing pressure on donor resources and government budgets, the Kaleidoscope Model offers a practical framework through which practitioners and researchers can assess when and where investments in policy reforms are most feasible given a country's underlying political, economic, and institutional characteristics.

In Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, populist redistribution occurred however in conjunction with weakening of democratic institutions. We associate populist redistribution with resource rents available in the course of the commodity price cycle. When domestic production is predominantly natural resources, other industry interests are ineffective in opposing populist redistribution and preventing the undermining of democracy. Rather than associating populism with preexisting autocracy as others have done, we show empirically that, in the cases we study, resource rents facilitated populism that allowed regime change whereby authoritarian institutions were created.","[Seghezza, Elena] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, Via Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy; [Pittaluga, Giovanni B.] Univ Genoa, Dept Polit Sci, Ple Brignole 3, I-16125 Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa; University of Genoa,"Seghezza, E (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, Via Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.",seghezza@unige.it; pittagb@unige.it,,,,,,,29,9,9,3,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

The empirical analysis indicates that the pass-through of cigarette taxes to the final consumer price is fast but incomplete in Pakistan. The pass-through coefficient is estimated to be in the range of 70 to over 90 percent across four major cigarette brands, and most of the pass-through occurs contemporaneously within a period of 2 months. The results imply that a 1-Pakistan rupee (PR) increase in taxation leads to an increase of PRs 0.8, on average, in cigarette prices. In other words, cigarette taxes are under-shifted to consumers in Pakistan. With respect to the tax pass-through at different price tiers (budget, mainstream, and premium), I find significant variation in the pass-through coefficient, which is close to one for the premium cigarette brand and significantly lower for the budget and mainstream cigarette brands.","[Cevik, Serhan] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St, Washington, DC 20436 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Cevik, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St, Washington, DC 20436 USA.",scevik@imf.org,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We find that (i) SMEs, in contrast to large firms, do not display evidence for the inter-firm liquidity redistribution hypothesis. Especially large vulnerable firms did cut down trade credit provision to the detriment of small vulnerable firms. (ii) We document a general substitution effect between bank and trade credit and show that it has strengthened during the crisis among large firms, but not among SMEs. (iii) We provide evidence that the shift in trade credit financing had adverse real effects on investment behaviour of SMEs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Research on the representational relationship between parties and voters suggests that ideological congruence can boost a party's electoral prospects. However, while the mechanism is at the individual-level, most of the literature focuses on the party-level. In this article, we develop a set of hypotheses based on a multi-issue conception of party-voter congruence at the individual-level, and examine the electoral consequences of these varying congruence levels in the 2014 European Parliament elections. Consistent with our expectations, comparative analysis finds that ideological and issue-specific incongruence is a significant factor in voting behavior in the European Parliament elections. Although the substantive effects of incongruence are understandably small compared to partisanship, government, or EU performance evaluations, party-voter disagreement consistently matters, and voters' issue salience is an important moderator of the impact of incongruence on vote choice.","[Bakker, Ryan] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Jolly, Seth] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY USA; [Polk, Jonathan] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Syracuse University; University of Gothenburg,"Bakker, R (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",rbakker@uga.edu; skjolly@maxwell.syr.edu; Jonathan.polk@gu.se,,"Polk, Jonathan/0000-0002-0125-8850; Jolly, Seth/0000-0003-1983-9837",,,,,76,13,15,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176.0,1-2,,,SI,,267,296,,10.1007/s11127-018-0555-z,0.0,,,30,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438459400015,0

The two biases can be integrated into one distance-based model. We define pure home bias as the excess of home bias relative to this model, and find pure home bias only in emerging markets. Countries with high tax rates and low credit standing have higher pure home bias, and more development comes with lower distance aversion.

First, we show that the ability of EPU to forecast stock returns depends not only on the country used, but also on the sectors examined. This indicates that forecasting of returns is country-dependent (sector-dependent), suggesting that EPU is relatively more important for some countries (sectors) than others. Second, we test whether the predictability of EPU is from either or both the cash flow and discount rate channels. Our results support the discount rate channel over the cash flow channel. Third, we use positive and negative EPU shocks to predict stock excess returns and find evidence of asymmetric predictability. Finally, we consider a mean-variance investor and show that such investor has positive utility by following forecasts generated from the EPU-based model. Our results are consistent with a number of robustness tests. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we argue that partisan preference polarization-conventionally defined as the difference in the favored policy positions of legislators from the two major parties-is not a sufficient statistic for potential political conflict in national politics . Rather, a well-defined measure of potential conflict must take into account (1) the locations of status quo policies and proposed alternatives; and (2) the shape of underlying utility functions. We propose measures of the likely contentiousness of a given status quo policy and of a proposal to move that policy. We then demonstrate the usefulness of these measures using estimates of utility function and final passage vote parameters on enacted legislation from the 111th US Senate (2009-2011).","[Gordon, Sanford C.; Landa, Dimitri] NYU, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Gordon, SC (通讯作者)，NYU, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",sanford.gordon@nyu.edu; dimitri.landa@nyu.edu,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176.0,1-2,,,SI,,193,210,,10.1007/s11127-018-0530-8,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438459400011,0

Nevertheless, despite decades of research on commercial real estate and horizontal patterns of urban development, vertical patterns have been largely ignored.

These patterns reflect tradeoffs between street access and vertical amenities. Vertical rent gradients are non-monotonic, independent of nearby employment, and large. Doubling zipcode employment is associated with a 10.7% increase in rent, consistent with the presence of agglomeration economies.

Overall, we document a low degree of following standardized financial advice: two thirds of the households under review ignore the advice completely and if they choose to heed it, they tend to follow it only to a relatively little extent. Moreover, we find that standardized financial advice is not able to break up the negative effect of financial literacy on following advisors' recommendations. Instead, even in a setting where the potential for misselling is mitigated, the negative impact of advisees' financial knowledge on their propensity to implement financial advice remains statistically and economically significant for all advisees under review except for the affluent households. Our findings support the notion that an increase in financial literacy leads to a higher confidence in one's own judgment and prompts individuals to use financial advice as just another source of information they process when making their financial decisions.

We find that high investor attention and bullish investor sentiment positively affect IPO offer prices and initial returns, leading to subsequent price declines. This suggests that excessive investor optimism can partially explain the IPO puzzles.","[Tsukioka, Yasutomo] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Business Adm, 1-155 Uegahara Ichiban Cho, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan; [Yanagi, Junya; Takada, Teruko] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Business, 3-3-138 Sugimoto, Sumiyoshi, Osaka 5588585, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University; Osaka Metropolitan University,"Tsukioka, Y (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Business Adm, 1-155 Uegahara Ichiban Cho, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan.",tsukioka@kwansei.ac.jp; sweetzunya@gmail.com; takada@bus.osaka-cu.ac.jp,"Yanagi, Junya/IUO-7101-2023; sihite, janfry/B-2951-2015","Takada, Teruko/0000-0002-3694-5415","JSPS KAKENHI [26885065, 23330108]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K18959, 23330108, 26885065] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to the Editor, Professor Carl R.

Accounting for education adjusted life expectancy, earnings variability over the course of a career, and their interactions with the tax code and retirement income system, we find that internal rates of return (IRRs) for new QPP contributions are similar under both reforms for individuals with lifetime average annual earnings of more than $40,000. Both reforms yield substantial IRRs for low-income individuals. Although the Quebec proposal offers higher IRRs for individuals earning less than $40,000, the federal proposal yields greater present value benefits for these same individuals. We show that if new QPP benefits were exempted from the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) clawback, and provided that the working income tax benefit and GIS were not enhanced, the two reforms would yield similar IRRs for individuals with average earnings of more than $15,000. The QPP reform would thus better focus on the middle-income earners originally targeted by reform advocates.","[Boisclair, David; Michaud, Pierre-Carl] HEC Montreal, Dept Appl Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lacroix, Guy; Marchand, Steeve] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Lacroix, Guy] CIRANO, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Michaud, Pierre-Carl] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Laval University; Universite de Montreal,"Boisclair, D (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Appl Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,"Lacroix, Guy/H-9015-2017; Michaud, Pierre Carl/AAA-2357-2021","Michaud, Pierre-Carl/0000-0003-3114-4229; Lacroix, Guy/0000-0001-6415-4496",,,,,19,3,3,0,7,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We find three main results. First, we find that analysts herd less when stocks are covered more in the media. Second, when the firm has negative media sentiment, analysts tend to herd more. Third, higher disagreement in the media is associated with a higher tendency to herd among analysts. These findings are robust to the confounding effect of news flows on returns as well as to alternative explanations. In addition, we find that the effect of media on the herding behavior is conditional on analyst characteristics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There is already a well-established body of literature in public finance, which argues that intergovernmental grants crowd out local revenues. Most existing studies, however, explore the fiscal implications of intergovernmental transfers in high-income countries where sound fiscal systems are taken for granted. In this paper, I explore the impact of intergovernmental transfers on local revenues in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where local fiscal capacity is limited and endogenously determined by financial support from international donors and the central government. I argue that in places where the existing capacity of LGAs to administer tax collection is weak and political costs of enforcing taxation are low-which are perennial features of many rural districts in Africa-intergovernmental transfers facilitate local revenue generation instead of undermining it. Analyzing newly available quarterly fiscal data on local revenues in Tanzania, I show that intergovernmental grants improve the mobilization of local revenues, and also that the positive effect of fiscal transfers on local revenue collection seems to be more pronounced in rural districts.

Advantageous selection is partly attributable to insurer sorting on consumer attributes known and used by insurers.

The findings suggest that the value impact of international diversification depends on a bank's home country: higher levels of diversification are associated with changes in valuations only for banks originating from emerging countries. In addition, the locus of destination of the diversification efforts matters for the direction of effects: while higher levels of intra-regional diversification lead to value enhancement, higher levels of inter-regional diversification seem to induce a negative (but statistically less robust) effect on the valuation of emerging country banks.

We identify the correlates of Kenyan and Tanzanian maize farmers' reported perceptions of soil fertility and assess the extent to which these subjective assessments reflect measured soil chemistry. Our results offer evidence that farmers base their perceptions of soil quality and soil type on crop yields. We also find that, in Kenya, farmers' reported soil type is a reasonable predictor of several objective soil fertility indicators while farmer-reported soil quality is not. In addition, in exploring the extent to which publicly available soil data are adequate to capture local soil chemistry realities, we find that the time-consuming exercise of collecting detailed objective measures of soil content is justified when biophysical analysis is warranted, because farmers' perceptions are not sufficiently strong proxies of these measures to be a reliable substitute and because currently available high-resolution geo-spatial data do not sufficiently capture local variation. In the estimation of agricultural production or profit functions, where the focus is on averages and in areas with low variability in soil properties, the addition of soil information does not considerably change the estimation results. However, having objective (measured) plot-level soil information improves the overall fit of the model and the estimation of marginal physical products of inputs. Our findings are of interest to researchers who design, field, or use data from agricultural surveys, as well as policy makers who design and implement agricultural interventions and policies.

Roughly 80 percent of this productivity growth is accounted for by structural change as employment shares in agriculture declined while employment shares in services and manufacturing rose. Although employment in the formal sector has increased, the bulk of employment growth is accounted for by firms in the informal sector; these informal firms contributed more than one percentage point to economywide labor productivity growth. However, 94% of this labor productivity growth came from a very small subset of informal firms that belong to the in-between sector - a term meant to capture the idea that some of the firms in the informal sector share characteristics with firms in formal sector. An argument is made for targeting these firms for financial and other business services as a means of generating sustained and inclusive labor productivity growth in Tanzania's manufacturing and services sectors.

A correlated random effects (CRE) device is used, and consistency and robustness of results are checked using various other estimation models. The receipt of fertilizer and seed subsidies is shown to have an inconsistent impact on farm productivity and food security; at the same time, access to agricultural advice is consistently insignificant in explaining these. Further analysis, however, shows a statistically significant and strong association with farm productivity and food security when access to extension services is unpacked to include indicators of usefulness and farmers' satisfaction. Households that reported receipt of very useful agricultural advice had greater productivity and greater food security compared to those that reported receipt of advice that they considered not useful and those that did not receive any advice at all. This result implies the need to ensure the provision of relevant and useful agricultural advice to increase the likelihood of achieving agricultural development outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Renewal can be regarded an impetus for realising integrated waterway networks that internalise externalities, which entails broad stakeholder involvement. This can be coordinated through different inter-organisational structures. Applying a transaction-cost perspective, we contribute to the assessment of effective governance arrangements for renewing waterway networks in such an integrated fashion. Our aim is to examine efficient inter-organisational structures for waterway renewal, as perceived by actors involved in a case study of the Dutch waterways. Our findings show that waterway renewal incorporates additional functionalities in terms of capacity (expansion or reduction), but not so much in terms of quality (combining transportation aims with spatial objectives such as ecology or regional development). Inter organisational structures that address geographical interrelatedness and, hence, broader stakeholder involvement were associated with uncertain and time-consuming transactions, because of extensive negotiations regarding the alignment of conflicting interests and the crossing of geographical and administrative boundaries. Also, a change in interdependency from hierarchical towards contractual relationships was required, putting dominant actors (the national government) in an unfamiliar position in which they loosen their grip on infrastructure investments. Perceptions on transactions centre on sectoral aims and individual assets, whereas the actual transaction may be different if a perspective is taken that includes the greater waterway system, the wider spatial surroundings and a longer-term horizon. We conclude that short-term, transportation objectives overrule longer-term, integrative objectives, which withholds strategic considerations required for aligning waterway interests.","[Willems, Jannes J.; Busscher, Tim; Arts, Jos] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Groningen, Netherlands; [Woltjer, Johan] Univ Westminster, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Planning & Transport, London, England",University of Groningen; University of Westminster,"Willems, JJ (通讯作者)，POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",j.j.willems@rug.nl,,"Woltjer, Johan/0000-0003-3179-6294; Willems, Jannes/0000-0002-3318-9706; Arts, Jos/0000-0002-6896-3992; Busscher, Tim/0000-0002-7763-7320",Dutch public waterway authority Rijkswaterstaat; larger research on institutional transformation in the light of waterway renewal,Dutch public waterway authority Rijkswaterstaat; larger research on institutional transformation in the light of waterway renewal,"The authors would like to thank professor Ernest Alexander and professor George de Kam, as well as three anonymous reviewers, for their feedback on earlier versions of the paper.

The regulator is modeled as an intermediary between current and future resource harvesters rather than between producers and consumers, as in the traditional regulatory capture paradigm. When incumbent resource users have weak property rights, they have an incentive to pressure the regulator to allow resource extraction at an inefficiently rapid rate. The main theoretical prediction-that stronger individual property rights will lead the regulator to choose more economically efficient extraction paths-is tested empirically with novel panel data from global fisheries. Exploiting the variation in timing of Catch Share implementation, as well as employing an instrumental variables strategy, we find that regulators are significantly more conservative in managing resources for which firms have strong property rights; this is especially pronounced for resources that have been historically overexploited.","[Costello, Christopher] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Costello, Christopher] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Grainger, Corbett A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Costello, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;Costello, C (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",costello@bren.ucsb.edu; corbett.grainger@wisc.edu,,"Grainger, Corbett/0000-0001-5789-3725",,,,,51,17,19,2,21,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Investment returns are idiosyncratic and subject to Knightian uncertainty. In response, agents formulate robust portfolio policies. These policies are nonhomothetic; wealthy agents invest a higher fraction of their wealth in uncertain assets yielding higher mean returns. This produces a feedback mechanism that amplifies inequality. It also produces an accelerated rate of convergence, which helps resolve a puzzle recently identified by Gabaix et al. (2016). An empirically plausible increase in uncertainty can account for about half of the recent increase in top wealth shares. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using panel data from Indonesia we find that more than half of working age adults in our sample experience a physical disability at least once in four waves over 16 years. Changes in physical functioning have no effect on hours worked among the employed. However, onsets of physical limitations lead to an increase in the probability of leaving employment, while recoveries increase the probability of returning to work. A larger effect is found among self-employed workers compared to salaried workers. Given the rising prevalence of physical limitations with age, physical disability may be a significant barrier to employment for older working age adults in Indonesia. These results overall point towards a need in Indonesia for policies that support maintaining work or returning to work for persons with physical disability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the United States, easements represent the largest charitable gift on a per-donation basis, but skeptics wonder if their tax preference merely subsidizes wealthy landowners rather than inducing conservation. We incorporate federal and state income tax codes into a calculator to quantify the after-tax donation price and demonstrate its sensitivity to landowner income and state and federal policies. Using a 1987-2012 panel, we measure the response of state-level easements to the price. Our large elasticity estimates, spanning -2.4 to -6.1, indicate that tax incentives induce conservation and do not merely subsidize it. We find no evidence that generous tax benefits have caused less strategic patterns of land conservation.","[Parker, Dominic P.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Thurman, Walter N.] North Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; North Carolina State University,"Parker, DP (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dominic.parker@wisc.edu; wthurman@ncsu.edu,,"Thurman, Walter/0000-0002-6106-7685","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [231919]; Lone Mountain Fellowship at the Property and Environment Research Center; North Carolina Agricultural Research Service","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project; Lone Mountain Fellowship at the Property and Environment Research Center; North Carolina Agricultural Research Service","We gratefully acknowledge the advice of Brent Stewart, Guido van der Hoeven, and Phil Harris, which improved our understanding of the tax code.

We begin with a recognition that cost perceptions that inherently characterize incentive-based policy instruments are a fundamental reason for their unpopularity. We therefore argue that the crucial question that policymakers need to address is how the benefit-cost ratios of incentive-based instruments can be altered in ways such that their inherent costs become acceptable. By focusing on the various features of these instruments, we propose three strategies for answering this question theoretically: objectively reduce the costs, reduce the visibility of the costs, and identify compensation strategies, i.e., strengthen the benefit side of the equation. Based on a conjoint analysis for Switzerland, our results demonstrate that reducing objective and perceived costs may indeed strengthen support for incentive-based policy instruments, whereas cost compensation does not seem to work as well. We show, moreover, that the latter can be explained by the fact that substantial numbers of voters do not understand or are not convinced by the commonly proposed mechanism of environmental taxes. Given that voters do not believe in the usefulness and efficacy of incentive-based policy measures, no cost compensation is feasible.","[Stadelmann-Steffen, Isabelle; Dermont, Clau] Univ Bern, Inst Polit Sci, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Stadelmann-Steffen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Polit Sci, Bern, Switzerland.",Isabelle.stadelmann@ipw.unibe.ch,"Stadelmann-Steffen, Isabelle/AAD-2429-2022","Stadelmann-Steffen, Isabelle/0000-0003-3441-4757; Dermont, Clau/0000-0001-5456-8935",Swiss National Science Foundation [NRP 71]; IMG Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); IMG Foundation,"This research was conducted within the National Research Programme Managing Energy Consumption (NRP 71) funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and supported by the IMG Foundation.

While financial resources increase access to healthcare and nutrition and reduce mortality, sickness also reduces labor force participation, thereby reducing income. Without longitudinal data, it is difficult to study the linkage between economic status and mortality. Using data from a national sample of 132,116 Indian adults aged 15 years and above, this paper examines their likelihood of death between wave 1 of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS), conducted in 2004-05 and wave 2, conducted in 2011-12. The results show that mortality between the two waves is strongly linked to the economic status of the household at wave 1 regardless of the choice of indicator for economic status. However, negative relationship between economic status and mortality for individuals already suffering from cardiovascular and metabolic conditions varies between three markers of economic status income, consumption, and ownership of consumer durables reflecting two-way relationship between short- and long-term markers of economic status and morbidity.

Other authors also use Omega for optimizing (non-linear) portfolios with important downside risk. However, we question in this article the relevance of such approaches. First, we show through a basic illustration that the Omega ratio is inconsistent with the Second-order Stochastic Dominance criterion. Furthermore, we observe that the trade-off between return and risk corresponding to the Omega measure, may be essentially influenced by the mean return. Next, we illustrate in static and dynamic frameworks that Omega-based optimal portfolios can be closely associated with classical optimization paradigms depending on the chosen threshold used in Omega. Finally, we present robustness checks on long-only asset and hedge fund databases, that confirm our results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The tests are based on the Swamy statistic. We establish the asymptotic null distribution of the tests under large panels. A prominent advantage of the proposed tests is that they are easy to implement in empirical applications. Monte Carlo experiments show evidence that the tests have good finite sample performance in terms of size and power. The tests are then applied to study the cross-section of firms' excess asset returns using financial data on U.S. firms. The tests allow us to assess, for a given quantile of the distribution of excess returns, whether the linear effect of the pricing factors in standard linear asset pricing models is the same across stocks. The results confirm the validity of those models for the mean and central quantiles. However, for tail quantiles, the slope homogeneity tests reject the null hypothesis providing empirical evidence of pricing anomalies. This suggests that the effect of firm characteristics on the distribution of excess returns is heterogeneous across stocks during booms and busts.","[Galvao, Antonio F.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Juhl, Ted] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Montes-Rojas, Gabriel] Univ San Andres, CONICET, Victoria, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Olmo, Jose] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Iowa; University of Kansas; Universidad de San Andres Argentina; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Southampton,"Galvao, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Tippie Coll Business, W284 PBB,21 E Market St, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",antonio-galvao@uiowa.edu,"Olmo, Jose/Y-7042-2019; Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/M-4750-2015","Olmo, Jose/0000-0002-0437-7812; Montes-Rojas, Gabriel/0000-0002-8447-4929","Equity and Poverty: Methods and Implications, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana [ECO2013-46516-C4-1-R]; Equity and Development Research Group, Generalitat de Catalunya [SGR2014-1279]","Equity and Poverty: Methods and Implications, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana; Equity and Development Research Group, Generalitat de Catalunya","The authors would like to express their appreciation to Valentina Corradi, Roger Koenker, Tom Parker, Hashem Pesaran, Jean-Yves Pitarakis, Kevin Sheppard, Suyong Song, and participants in seminars at UIUC, University of Iowa, and UWM, Central Bank of Brazil, and ES NASM for useful comments and discussions regarding this article.

But what is the meaning of utility? Here we take advantage of the philosophical literature to develop a theoretically robust answer to this question. Based on an analysis of the very diverse philosophical understandings of meaning, we introduce a general definition encompassing this diversity. According to this definition, any account of a given act that can be endorsed by the agent performing this act qualifies as a meaning. We argue that the concept of utility qualifies as economic meaning. This idea has two aspects. First, at a general level, because the axioms of the theory of choice are, in essence, easily understandable, utility can, in general, be conceived as a meaning. Second, more specifically, this very idea allows to define a standard to adjudicate whether specific instances of utility representation qualify as meanings. The main theoretical implication is that, when a given utility modelling fulfils the requirements to qualify as a meaning, then the stipulation of the axioms of the theory of choice is justified. This implication translates into concrete recommendations for applied economics.","[Meinard, Yves] Paris Sci & Lettres Res Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, LAMSADE Lab Modelisat Syst Aide DEcis, CNRS,UMR 7243, F-75016 Paris, France; [Gharbi, Jean-Sebastien] Univ Reims, REGARDS, Fac Sci Econ Sociales & Gest, BP 30 57 Rue Taittinger, F-51571 Reims, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Meinard, Y (通讯作者)，Paris Sci & Lettres Res Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, LAMSADE Lab Modelisat Syst Aide DEcis, CNRS,UMR 7243, F-75016 Paris, France.",yves.meinard@lamsade.dauphine.fr,,"Meinard, yves/0000-0001-5928-8959",,,,,62,1,1,0,5,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

By being intentionally overexposed to the idiosyncratic risk of their firms, overconfident CEOs exhibit a strong belief in their firms' prospects. This belief attracts suppliers beyond the firm's observable expansionary corporate activities. Overconfident CEOs induce more supplier commitments including greater relationship-specific investment and longer relationship duration. Overconfident CEOs also induce stronger labor commitments as employees exhibit lower turnover rates and greater ownership of company stock in benefit plans. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Evolution is always a matter of change and, although its driving force is innovation, the price mechanism is central to how innovations are resolved into economic development. That is Schumpeter's great theme, but he said relatively little about who sets prices or how and why prices are changed. We focus particularly on price determination in markets disrupted by innovations, where firms are necessarily heterogeneous. We contrast the evolutionary paths followed by prices and market structure when prices are determined by market clearing to the paths when prices are determined through the application by firms of administered rules and routines to achieve their strategic objectives. This links the analysis to theories of administered prices and post-Keynesian price theories more broadly. Interaction of innovators with their customers and with established competitors create the context for the evolution of pricing rules along with differential firm growth, which together generates structural change in the industry and the economy. We show that analyzing how the introduction and diffusion of innovations impact on the rules and routines provides the foundation for a broadly applicable evolutionary price theory.","[Bloch, Harry] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Metcalfe, Stan] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",Curtin University; University of Manchester,"Bloch, H (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",h.bloch@curtin.edu.au; stan.metcalfe@manchester.ac.uk,"Bloch, Harry/O-1058-2019","Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925",,,,,25,13,16,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We propose a measure for this leverage constraint tightness by inverting the argument that constrained investors tilt their portfolios to riskier assets. We show that the average market beta of actively managed mutual funds intermediaries facing leverage restrictions captures their desire for leverage and thus the tightness of constraints. Consistent with theory, it strongly predicts returns of the betting-against-beta portfolio, and is a priced risk factor in the cross-section of mutual funds and stocks. Funds with low exposure to the factor outperform high-exposure funds by 5% annually, and for stocks this difference reaches 7%. Our results show that the tightness of leverage constraints has important implications for asset prices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This positive market reaction is stronger in countries that better protect minority shareholder rights. However, a remarkable price reversal is detected in the aftermath of a carve-out transaction that lasts up to two years. In contrast, parent-firm operating performance improves as long as the disposal of subsidiary assets is proven to be an optimal corporate decision.

However, much of the existing literature either focuses on the impact of violence on victim students or studies the specific cases of violent conflicts. Using Brazilian education data, this paper examines the impact of violence in schools on educational outcomes of the schooling system and emphasizes the human capital consequences of recorded violent incidents in schools. First, the paper establishes the psychological stress-threat mechanism by which violent incidents in schools directly impact students' mathematics test scores as well as school level average of these test scores. Thereafter, the paper demonstrates the reduced learning mechanism by which violence further detriments the quality of education, albeit indirectly, by disengaging the teachers and students from their professional responsibilities. The main results are tested for robustness and policy implications are discussed.","[Deole, Sumit S.] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Saale, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Deole, SS (通讯作者)，Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Econ, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany.",sumit.deole@wiwi.uni-halle.de,,"Deole, Sumit/0000-0003-3641-5526",,,,,33,3,7,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The scientific assessment is driven to a large extent by assumptions regarding its effectiveness, costs, and impacts, all of which are profoundly uncertain. We investigate how this uncertainty about climate engineering affects the optimal abatement policy in the near term. Using a two period model of optimal climate policy under uncertainty, we show that although abatement decreases in the probability of success of climate engineering, this relationship is concave implying a rather 'flat' level of abatement as the probability of climate engineering becomes a viable policy option. Using a stochastic version of an integrated assessment model, the results are found to be robust to a wide range of specifications. Moreover, we numerically evaluate different correlation structures between climate engineering and the equilibrium climate sensitivity.","[Emmerling, Johannes; Tavoni, Massimo] FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Emmerling, Johannes; Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo & Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, Dept Management & Econ, Milan, Italy",Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Polytechnic University of Milan,"Emmerling, J (通讯作者)，FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.;Emmerling, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Euro Mediterraneo & Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",johannes.emmerling@feem.it; massimo.tavoni@feem.it,"EMMERLING, Johannes/K-8283-2019","EMMERLING, Johannes/0000-0003-0916-9913; tavoni, massimo/0000-0001-5069-4707",European Community [308329],European Community,"The authors would like to thank Reyer Gerlagh, Martin Weitzman, Scott Barrett, participants of a Workshop on Coupled Climate-Economics Modelling and Data Analysis at ENS, Paris, the FEEM-CMCC convention 2012 in Venice, and the AERE 2013 conference in Banff, and two anonymous reviewers for very helpful comments.

We investigate whether defying comparative advantage has prompted a more sophisticated and diversified export basket in a large panel of countries over the period 1992-2012. We find that developing countries that defy their comparative advantage tend to export more manufactured items and manufacturing goods that are more sophisticated. As for export diversification, the impact is heterogeneous across development levels: although defying comparative advantage seems to help diversify the export baskets of middle-income and resource-rich countries, it tends to concentrate those of lower-income economies. Moreover, we find that the impact of the distance to comparative advantage on productive transformation is strongly conditioned by the size of FDI stocks and by the country's specialization in the lower added-value productive tasks of global value chains (GVCs). More specifically, our results suggest that defying comparative advantage by attracting FDI may be a dangerous strategy in the long-term since it tends to bring only partial and artefact industrialization, with manufacturing exports increasing while the manufacturing value-added actually decreases.

Assessments based on estimated SRCs could thus produce false interpretations and incentives.

Overall, our findings support the notion that the imposition of or increases in an STT harm market quality.","[Pomeranets, Anna] Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Weaver, Daniel G.] Rutgers State Univ, Business Sch, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Weaver, DG (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Business Sch, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",apomeranets@fau.edu; danielweaver@rbsmail.rutgers.edu,,,Whitcomb Center for Research in Financial Services,Whitcomb Center for Research in Financial Services,"We thank an anonymous referee, Yakov Amihud, Amber Anand, Hendrik Bessembinder (the editor), Corey Garriott, Sermin Gungor, Nikolaus Hautsch, Scott Hendry, Charles Jones, Andrew Karolyi, Simi Kedia, Teodora Paligorova, Oded Palmon, Joshua Slive, Aron Veress, Gwendolyn Webb, Jonathan Witmer, Xing Zhou, and conference participants at the 2012 Erasmus Liquidity Conference and the 2012 Groupement de Recherche Europeen (GdRE) Annual Symposium on Money, Banking and Finance for helpful comments on earlier versions of this study.

As a result, quality and especially food safety became elements with new values, in a multidimensional approach of economy consumption. Simultaneously, the globalization of economic and social life has highlighted the need for a unitary approach on how to produce quality and safe products for the final consumer. For this reason, at the international level a series of standards have emerged that organizations have to follow to design, implement and certify food quality and safety management systems that benefit all parties involved. The present paper aims at carrying out a comparative study of certification schemes of food safety management systems in an attempt to give organizations the opportunity to understand what type of quality management system is appropriate to the organizational framework in which they are located, according with established objectives. The research is based on a comprehensive study of specific literature, articles and reference papers, the collection of data being carried out through comparative analysis of international standards, private certification schemes for food safety management products and systems, in the desire to clarify the different approaches but also the similarities and differences between them.","[Pop, Stefan Zaharie] Romanian Assoc Accreditat RENAR, Bucharest, Romania; [Dracea, Raluca; Vladulescu, Carmen] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Pop, SZ (通讯作者)，Romanian Assoc Accreditat RENAR, Bucharest, Romania.",popstefan2000@yahoo.com,,,,,,,17,8,9,0,17,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2018,20.0,47,,,,,9,29,,,,,,21,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ8BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427829800002,0

Prof. Bernard Morard together with Dr. Alexandru Stancu and Dr. Christophe Jeannette from University of Geneva, Switzerland developed a way of identifying these relationships and interactions using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression technique. Their technique identifies the strategic areas (or strategic axes) by highlighting the groups of performance indicators with the highest correlation coefficient between them. The strategic axes can, in turn, identify performance sectors of the company. Our final model identified the interaction among the strategic areas of a financial intermediation services company (SIF) as well as the interaction between the SIF's performance indicators and the group they are a part of. Our goal was to first apply a Principal Component Analysis to find the most important sectors for a SIF company (e.g. axis 1 = Capital and Results) and then to focus on 4 to 6 relevant performance indicators, that are strongly correlated with the respective strategic sectors (axes). The other indicators were discarded or were transferred to other axes where they have a significant weight, obviously, a little less than on the axis from which they were discarded. Once these economic judgments on the strategic areas were completed, we applied the PLS analysis to reveal the correlations between the strategic axes (sectors). These correlations highlight the intensity of interrelations within the company (SIF) and lead to possible strategic lines of interaction. Mainly, we intended: to identify relationships between different strategic axes (sectors) of the company's activities and the interactions between them using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) analysis; to assign to these economic sectors the most appropriate name (for example, Axis 1 = CAPITAL and RESULTS and so on) and to retain maximum 6 relevant indicators for each axis; to reveal the correlations between strategic axes (sectors), highlighting the intensity of interrelations; to lead to the prediction of possible strategic lines of interaction within the company (SIF). Basically, BSC explains the relationship between the corporate governance variables and the company's performance. We intended that, besides the causal interrelations, we would also identify a logical relationship between the analyzed sectors of activity.","[Stancu, Ion; Naghi, Laura Elly] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Stancu, Ion] Inst Financial Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Stancu, Ion Alexandru] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Stancu, Ion Alexandru] AME, Amman, Jordan",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Geneva,"Stancu, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.;Stancu, I (通讯作者)，Inst Financial Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ion.stancu@ase.ro,"NAGHI, LAURA-ELLY/HIK-0573-2022; NAGHI, LAURA-ELLY/ISU-8812-2023","Naghi, Laura Elly/0000-0002-4778-1698",,,,,18,1,1,0,9,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2018,20.0,47,,,,,218,228,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ8BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427829800014,0

It shows how learning through practice can help drive technical change but, when this is impeded, the ability to make use of models and engage in experimental learning becomes even more pertinent for explaining variation in the rate and direction of technical change. The article explores HIV as an example of vaccine innovation, and vaccines as an example of medical innovation. I find the absence of these two variables (ability to learn directly in humans, and ability to learn vicariously through animal models) not only make up a large part of how I would characterize difficulty in the HIV R&D process, but they also seem to go a long way toward explaining why 33 other diseases have-or have not-had vaccines developed for them.

Organizational design serves as a powerful driver in recognizing and developing capabilities, especially through its strategy, structure and organizational processes. This paper analyzes theoretical framework on the relation between presented variables of organizational design and operational and dynamic capabilities, and tests it empirically on a sample of 121 organizations. Results of the empirical research indicate a strong connection and role played by strategy, structure and organizational processes in developing both forms of organizational capabilities. The paper contributes to current research by providing evidence that it is possible to purposefully design organizational elements to match organizational resources with its goals, that is, to enable the development of both operational and dynamic capabilities.","[Aleksic, Ana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Org & Management, Trg JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Aleksic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Org & Management, Trg JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",aaleksic@efzg.hr,"Aleksic, Ana/H-7548-2018","Aleksic, Ana/0000-0002-9702-6703",,,,,40,2,2,2,23,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-9164-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,1,8,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1EW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000495441500001,0

We find that while relationship lending is not associated with credit constraints during a credit boom, it alleviates such constraints during a downturn. This positive role of relationship lending is stronger for small and opaque firms and in regions with a more severe economic downturn.

There are few alternatives available to replace this practice. One possibility is the use of dual-purpose chicken breeds. The use of these chicken breeds would have implications not only for the entire supply food chain but also for consumers. Their meat and eggs have a different appearance, and the resulting products would be more expensive. Furthermore, little is known about consumers' opinions of dual-purpose chickens at present. For this reason, it is essential to explore consumer acceptance of dual-purpose chickens. Mixed methods with a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods proved to be an appropriate approach to learn more about this matter. The results of six focus groups with an exploratory character served as the basis for an online survey with 1,502 respondents in Germany. The data was analysed with the aid of a factor analysis that identified seven factors explaining consumers' attitudes towards dual-purpose chickens. A cluster analysis segmented the respondents into three cluster groups: opponents (37.5%), supporters (23.4%), and indifferents (39.1%). The indifferents represent the largest group of respondents and are therefore an important target group when it comes to potential marketing strategies of products from dual-purpose chickens. The results illustrate the importance of analysing consumer acceptance with regard to emerging issues and before a new product is introduced to the market.","[Bruemmer, Nanke; Petersen, Wiebke; Christoph-Schulz, Inken] Thunen Inst Market Anal, Bundesallee 63, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Brümmer, N (通讯作者)，Thunen Inst Market Anal, Bundesallee 63, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",nanke.bruemmer@thuenen.de,,,Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL),Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL),This study is part of the research project SocialLab - Nutztierhaltung im Spiegel der Gesellschaft.

It shows how city-dwellers experience the control of the party-state through a series of encounters with authority across the city. Questioning the intentionality of a state that appears at the same time omnipotent and elusive, openly violent and subtly hegemonic, the paper reveals the fine mechanisms through which consent is fabricated in the intimacy of the family.","[Buire, Chloe] CNRS, Afr Monde, Pessac, France; [Buire, Chloe] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Architecture & Planning, CUBES, Johannesburg, South Africa",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Witwatersrand,"Buire, C (通讯作者)，Sci Po Bordeaux, 11 Allee Ausone, Pessac, France.",c.buire@sciencespobordeaux.fr,,,"University if the Witwatersrand, in the School of Architecture and Planning (2012-2013); French Institute in South Africa (IFAS); French Embassy in Angola","University if the Witwatersrand, in the School of Architecture and Planning (2012-2013); French Institute in South Africa (IFAS); French Embassy in Angola","This paper is based on data collected thanks to a postdoctoral fellowship at the University if the Witwatersrand, in the School of Architecture and Planning (2012-2013).

We postulate that genetic variation can affect financial markets through its impact on aggregate investment behavior, innovation in the financial sector, and productivity. Our country-level, cross-sectional analysis reveals a significant hump-shaped relation between a country's predicted genetic variation and the size of its financial markets. This result is consistent with the conjecture that at relatively intermediate degrees of genetic variation, the associated intermediate levels of trust and risk-taking within the country result in the largest investment flows into public financial markets. Our results are robust to different measres of financial market size, several regression specifications, and the inclusion of a broad range of controls such as legal origin, institutional characteristics, culture, natural endowment, and trade openness. Our main findings appear to be restricted specifically to equity markets (vs. debt markets) where there is relatively more uncertainty and, thus, trust and risk-taking are relatively more important. Additional analysis suggests that better overall country-level governance can moderate the role that genetic variation plays in shaping equity market size.

Then, specific tasks that need to be performed by particular persons must be detailed.

Take-up does not increase when participants receive information about the product, or an assistance to register, or small subsidies of 2, 10, or 30%. Take-up does not increase when the same information is provided by local respected community leaders, when participants are offered an in-kind gift (a chicken) if they register, when participants are offered the possibility to contribute lower and more frequent payments, or the possibility to pay by cell phone. A full subsidy generates a mere 45% take-up (with no retention after one year). In contrast to these low take-up rates, presenting the same information without any subsidies to existing informal groups raises take-up to 12% (still 7% after one year), as well as trust and knowledge of the product. Social networks play a major role in the adoption of health insurance. This paper provides a cost-effective way to increase take-up of health insurance, while subsidies are found to be largely ineffective at raising take-up in the long run. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies either measured the individual spatial-temporal accessibility of a general transport network or measured the cumulative-opportunity accessibility by public transit through an exclusive computation of the bottom of the full network time prism. By contrast, the current study measures the individual spatial-temporal accessibility by public transit by integrating timetable and passenger departure time and computing the full network time prism. A public transit network is modelled as a time-dependent weighted directed graph, wherein every single directed arc is associated with a time-dependent travel time to represent the linkage between two adjacent stops on a transit route. The time-dependent travel time assigned to arcs is determined according to timetables, which is particularly assigned to infinity when transit service is unavailable between two stops. A modified network potential path area (N-PPA) algorithm based on the time-dependent weighted directed graph is employed to produce a potential path area for the activity participation of an individual by public transit. The proposed methodology is applied as a case study to measure individual spatial-temporal accessibility using the Salt Lake City TRAX system. Results indicate that the outcome of the proposed methodology is sensitive to departure time of passengers.

Revenue arising from the EU increases aggregate demand, and this is a regular instrument for stabilizing fiscal policy. The key conclusion of the analysis is based on regression analysis, and there is demonstrate the procyclical nature of the EU Regional Policy and its negative impact on the effectiveness, efficiency, and economy of national resources. Temporal definition of programming periods and the ability to prepare projects and their implementation in the context of national and EU legal framework were identified as the main determinants of procyclicality.

System integration is the key to developing the required flexibility, because flexibility options exist at all system levels and within the competitive as well as in the regulated (network) domains. The fluctuating nature of variable renewable energy changes the dynamics of investment decisions. We develop a framework for analysing relations between aspects of the regulation of the power sector that need to be coordinated in order to achieve (or at least improve) economic efficiency. We base the framework on the technical functionalities of the electricity infrastructure, which we group along three dimensions: system level (from retail/distribution to transmission/wholesale), geographic scope (the connection between electricity systems) and time scales (from real-time operations and balancing markets to the investment time scale). The framework helps identify regulatory challenges-potential inefficiencies due to a lack of coordination-and to place them into context. The picture that emerges from this approach is that the institutional fragmentation of the European electricity sector will become increasingly burdensome as the development variable renewable energy requires ever closer coordination between countries, between the different levels of the electricity system and between markets that serve different time scales. Interactions between elements of market design and regulation such as congestion management, renewable energy policy and system adequacy policy affect each other and are an additional reason for a system integration approach to regulation.","[De Vries, Laurens J.; Verzijlbergh, Remco A.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"De Vries, LJ (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",l.j.devries@tudelft.nl,"de Vries, L.J.

Although households with nonfarm enterprises are less likely to be poor, a substantial fraction of these households fall below the poverty line. Heterogeneity in the labour productivity of rural nonfarm businesses calls for a two-pronged strategy for rural transformation. Relatively unproductive enterprises may be part of a poverty reduction strategy but should not be expected to contribute to employment and labour productivity growth. Failure to account for this heterogeneity is likely to lead to disappointing outcomes.","[Diao, Xinshen; Mcmillan, Margaret] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Mcmillan, Margaret] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02111 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Tufts University,"Diao, XS (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",x.diao@cgiar.org,,,"CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)","This paper has benefited from funding from the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM) led by IFPRI.",,45,15,15,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

A trading strategy that takes long positions in commodity futures with the most negative skew and shorts those with the most positive skew generates significant excess returns that remain after controlling for exposure to well-known risk factors. A tradeable skewness factor explains the cross-section of commodity futures returns beyond exposures to standard risk premia. The impact that skewness has on future returns is explained by investors' preferences for skewness under cumulative prospect theory and selective hedging practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The most widely known are the twin problems of tax avoidance by foreign investors and tax evasion by domestic actors, which have become a major focus of debate in international organisations and of civil society activism in recent years. The second problem, tax competition, incorporates a range of issues from the prisoners' dilemma' facing countries competing for inward direct investment through to the harmful tax rules used by tax havens that enable tax avoidance and evasion. This article reviews four recent monographs that analyse these problems at an international level. While they contain much useful discussion of the problems and potential technical solutions, there remains a need for political economy research to understand why certain technical solutions have not been adopted by governments. A third challenge faced by developing countries, barely considered in the tax and development literature up to now, leads to a note of caution: international tax institutions tend to be designed in ways that place disproportionate restrictions on capital-importing countries' ability to tax foreign investors.","[Hearson, Martin] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hearson, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",M.Hearson@lse.ac.uk,"Hearson, Martin/N-6854-2017","Hearson, Martin/0000-0002-7108-7372",,,,,11,12,15,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This shift has been strongly influenced by a body of research in subjective well-being (SWB) and the capabilities' approach, which emphasizes the role of freedom, opportunities, and social inclusion on well-being. Using a novel nationally representative survey of Chilean households, this paper explores the relationship between life satisfaction and two hidden dimensions of development, agency, and human dignity. Human agency refers to the capability of an individual to control her destiny and make choices to fulfill goals set autonomously. Human dignity is associated with the absence of feelings of shame and humiliation, and is ultimately related to social inclusion. We use a method that allows to isolate the impact of personality traits affecting both SWB and capabilities' perceptions. Our results show that agency and shame are important predictors of life satisfaction, comparable in magnitude to the effect of income variables. The fact that capabilities that measure freedoms and social inclusion are aligned with well-being measures lends support to the view of human development as integral process. Policies to advance agency, and reduce shame and discrimination are discussed. In the case of shame and discrimination we emphasize the role of interventions that influence stigmatization and group boundaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

During the last years the gross agricultural production in Bulgaria amounts to threefold lower compared to the average level in the EU-27. These low values reveal the big issue in Bulgarian agriculture and raise the question about the efficiency of the policy and the benefits for the society. The goal of the paper is to analyse some of direct payments effects on agricultural output, value added, production costs, land structure and rent. It turns out that the CAP is the policy adjusted better to the old Member States, which can be explained by the historical development approach.

The analysis of results and the discovered deviations from substantive findings resulted in proposing a new indicator of Intellectual Sources of Value Added (ISVA) which was empirically verified using the same sample of businesses. The results suggest that ISVA provides a much more realistic reflection of the processes of value added creation from intellectual capital in agricultural enterprises. It also demonstrates that new value is created in a context of complementarity between tangible and intangible inputs which together provide the agricultural enterprises with a key to growth of efficiency.","[Kozera-Kowalska, Magdalena; Baum, Rafal] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Kozera-Kowalska, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Poznan, Poland.",,"Kozera-Kowalska, Magdalena/U-8914-2018","Kozera-Kowalska, Magdalena/0000-0002-9245-0548; Baum, Rafal/0000-0001-5415-0555",,,,,27,3,3,1,4,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-77-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,209,220,,10.20472/EFC.2018.010.015,0.0,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505164900015,0

After controlling for corporate governance and several firms characteristics, we find that firms with better and more reputable TMTs (measured by larger team size, higher percentage of members with an MBA, higher percentage of members with prior executive experience, and higher number of members serving on boards of other companies) are negatively related to investment inefficiency caused by over- and underinvestment. Furthermore, we find that TMT characteristics complement the positive effect of financial reporting quality on investment efficiency.

Thus, the development in this area is not optimal and much more attention should be put on. Increasing life expectancy cause not only higher demands on the pension systems but also higher demands on social services. This is emphasised by the slower increase of healthy life expectancy and therefore it can be assumed that more people in higher age will require more social services. The paper deals with the issue of the macroeconomic costs and benefits of satisfying the requirements for residential care activities, especially for homes for the elderly as one of the most important area of social care. The aim of the paper is to estimate overall direct and indirect macroeconomic effects for the Czech Republic at the level of the regions. The relation between demand and supply of residential care activities is illustrated for 2013. While some issues can simply be related to the Czech population as a whole, some estimates are presented at the regional level. Economic impacts on the gross domestic product, employment and government finance are estimated by the semi-dynamic input-output analysis. It is illustrated how the investments into social facilities are transformed into economic development with different regional scale.","[Langhamrova, Jitka; Simkova, Martina; Sixta, Jaroslav] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Fak Informatiky & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Langhamrová, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Fak Informatiky & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic.",langhamj@vse.cz; martina.simkova@vse.cz; sixta@vse.cz,"Langhamrová, Jitka/Z-2115-2019; Sixta, Jaroslav/J-9828-2014",,,,,,28,11,11,0,12,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

A network model of risk evolution was made based on the logical relationship of risk events. Then the out-in degrees and the clustering coefficients were discussed for risk analysis and the key events of risk evolution were presented. Finally, considering the probability of events occurrence and transformation, the model was converted into a directed network with weight of events. And the shortest paths of risk evolution were calculated by using the Dijkstra algorithm. The risk control measures on disconnecting chains were presented. The results showed that the clustering coefficient of the model was 0.0424, the network aggregation degree was relativelylow. The weights of all the shortest paths were no more than 15. The research can provide the theoretical foundation for the inhibition of risk transfer and control of accident evolution, which has practical significance for guarding the continuous safety operation.","[Li, Jingjing; Xu, Xiaoyuan; Liu, Xuanya] Tianjin Fire Res Inst MPS, Tianjin 300381, Peoples R China",,"Li, JJ (通讯作者)，Tianjin Fire Res Inst MPS, Tianjin 300381, Peoples R China.",,,,"Technology Research Program of MPS [2016JSYJD04, 2016JSYJB32]; Tianjin Technology Research Program [16ZXCXSF00080]",Technology Research Program of MPS; Tianjin Technology Research Program,"This study was supported by Technology Research Program of MPS (No 2016JSYJD04), Tianjin Technology Research Program (No 16ZXCXSF00080) and Technology Research Program of MPS (No. 2016JSYJB32).",,1,0,0,0,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-574-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,66.0,,,,,,408,413,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448284700064,0

The results show that: In addition to CDD and FD0, all indexes showed an increasing trend before 2000 and a decreasing trend after 2000. The CDD showed a continuous decrease trend, and FD0 decreased first and then increased. There was a significant positive correlation between NDVI and SDII and RX5D in extreme grassland areas in Inner Mongolia and a weak negative correlation with CDD. However, the correlation with the extreme temperature index is not obvious. The area where SU25 is significantly negatively correlated with NDVI is larger, and TNn is obviously weakly negatively correlated. Therefore, it can be seen that extreme precipitation affects the dynamic change of vegetation in typical grassland areas more than extreme temperatures.","[Lina; Zhang, Jiquan; Tong, Zhijun] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Na, Risu] Northeast Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Shan, Yin] Inner Mongolia Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Hohhot 010022, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China; Northeast Normal University - China; Inner Mongolia Normal University,"Zhang, JQ (通讯作者)，Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China.",zhangjq022@nenu.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [41571491, 41371495]; China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest [GYHY201506001-6]; National Key Technology R&D Program of China [2013BAK05B01]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [2412016KJ046]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest; National Key Technology R&D Program of China(National Key Technology R&D Program); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (41571491 and 41371495); The China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest (GYHY201506001-6); The National Key Technology R&D Program of China under Grant (2013BAK05B01); The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (2412016KJ046).,,9,0,0,1,8,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-574-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,66.0,,,,,,14,19,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448284700003,0

This paper examines the determinants of market participation and marketing channel choice decisions by small scale sorghum farmers using a case comprising 380 households from five Wards in the mid Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe. Mixed data collection approaches including a questionnaire, observations and focus group discussions were used. Secondary data triangulated and validated farmers' responses. A double hurdle based on probit and multinomial logit regression models was applied to the two decision making stages. Ninety six percent of the sampled farmers participated in some market as influenced by payment time, number of buyers in the market, age of principal decision maker and distance to market. Three marketing channels were isolated as local, traders and a combination. The local marketing channel dominates due to its convenience and relatively lower transaction costs. Using the local market option as the referent category, weighted average market price of sorghum, number of buyers in the market, distance to the market, dependency ratio and household income are the most robust determinants of marketing channel selection. Sorghum marketing channel options are limited for small scale farmers in Zimbabwe. Strengthening cooperative based and extension anchored marketing can reduce the risks associated with relating to external traders who usually exploit farmers for price, payment time and quality requirements. Decentralisation of the sorghum markets and promotion of value addition activities in the sorghum value chain is likely to reduce transaction costs and increase the market size.","[Musara, Joseph P.] Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Post Bag 1020, Bindura, Zimbabwe; [Musara, Joseph P.] Womens Univ Africa, Fac Agr Sci, POB MP1222, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Musemwa, Lovemore] Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Bindura, Zimbabwe; [Mutenje, Munyaradzi] CIMMYT, Southern Africa Reg Off, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Mushunje, Abbyssinia] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-5700 Alice, South Africa; [Pfukwa, Charles] Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Bindura, Zimbabwe",University of Fort Hare,"Musara, JP (通讯作者)，Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Post Bag 1020, Bindura, Zimbabwe.;Musara, JP (通讯作者)，Womens Univ Africa, Fac Agr Sci, POB MP1222, Harare, Zimbabwe.",jpmusara@gmail.com,"Musara, Joseph Persevearance/AAV-6491-2021","Musara, Joseph Persevearance/0000-0002-2226-3616",European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),This work was conducted within the framework of the Research Platform Production and Conservation in Partnership (www.rp-pcp.org).

It assesses the main determinants of firm's profitability in the pre-crisis and post-crisis period from 2000 to 2015. Design/methodology/approach - This methodology splits the factors that influence firm profitability in two groups: firm-specific (internal) factors and macroeconomic indicators. It further aims to look at the consistency of the factors in the pre-crisis and post-crisis period. The return on assets and the net profit margin are considered as proxy for corporate profits. The panel generalized least square and panel vector auto-regression model have been employed, and it is observed that the exchange rate seems to have played a major role in the crisis period by explaining the earning quotient for Indian firms. Findings - This paper concludes that the firm-specific variables and exchange rate channels are quite relevant in explaining the profitability of Indian manufacturing firms. It accepts the hypotheses that size and liquidity enhances whereas leverage discourages the profitability. Few exceptions have been observed during the crisis period. The study also concludes that in the short run, the changes in exchange rate are not increasing profitability, but in the long run, it increases profitability as the volatility of nominal exchange rate is positively impacting profitability. Moreover, the study finds that the nominal exchange rate index is more informative and explains that profitability is better than real exchange rate index in the case of Indian manufacturing firms over the study period. Research limitations/implications - The managers and the policy makers should give utmost importance to the firm-specific determinants, especially after the crisis period, and consider the appropriate exchange rate to evaluate firm performance for making any change in the policy to make any business profitable. Originality/value - This study has been conducted over a longer time by using advanced panel data analysis techniques on the recent data. The study period properly captures the crisis time and the research includes different selection of profitability that highlights corporate earnings pattern. Moreover, validation of the exchange rate sensitivity of profitability over nominal and real exchange rate increases the robustness of the study. Moreover, on Indian manufacturing firms, the study is very significant and unique.","[Nanda, Swagatika] Vidyalankar Sch Informat Technol, Dept Management Studies, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Panda, Ajaya Kumar] Natl Inst Ind Engn, Dept Accounts & Finance, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE),"Nanda, S (通讯作者)，Vidyalankar Sch Informat Technol, Dept Management Studies, Bombay, Maharashtra, India.",swagatika.n@gmail.com,,"Panda, Dr. Ajaya Kumar/0000-0002-4260-5599",,,,,76,43,47,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Under open access, resource users may remain trapped in poverty. Regulation of resource use generates rents that can finance labor reallocation to resource-independent production. Transferability of harvest quotas broadens the scope for labor reallocation, in particular if harvest quotas are distributed unequally. Once the process of labor reallocation is started, it continues until a long-run efficient labor allocation is achieved. We use data from an Indian fishery to illustrate numerically how the design and distribution of harvest quotas affects labor, wealth, and resource dynamics in a rural economy.","[Noack, Frederik] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Food & Resource Econ Grp, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Riekhof, Marie-Catherine] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Quaas, Martin] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of British Columbia; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Kiel,"Quaas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany.",quaas@economics.uni-kiel.de,"Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012","Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829; Riekhof, Marie-Catherine/0000-0001-6565-8661","cluster of excellence Future Ocean; BMBF [01UN1011B, 01LA1104C]; DFG; World Bank",cluster of excellence Future Ocean; BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); World Bank(The World Bank India),"We thank Joshua Abott as well as two anonymous referees for their insightful comments on this paper.

Notably the supporters of free banking criticise the current monetary system and consider present money unbacked. This does not correspond to the fact that the money is backed by the assets of the issuers. There are demands to return to full gold backing. The analysis of the share of gold in the monetary base and in the monetary aggregates M1 and M2 for the United States of America and the Czech Republic over the period 1993-2016 shows a complete shortage of gold. The results are in units or tenths of percent. The author discusses some other unsolved issues, primarily the high price volatility and the impossibility of unlimited convertibility. Attention is also paid to currency board systems with full foreign currency backing. With the hypothetical admission of full gold backing, restricting the money supply by the amount of gold would quickly and dramatically curtail the supply of credit, with subsequent impacts on economic growth. Requirements for full gold backing of present money are completely illusory.","[Revenda, Zbynek] Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Revenda, Z (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic.",zbynek.revenda@vse.cz,,"Revenda, Zbynek/0000-0002-1218-5845",,,,,11,1,1,0,3,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The paper provides a comparative analysis of bicycle sharing spatial mobility patterns before, during, and after a disruption in public transportation system. We also apply a complex network-theoretic approach to uncover the impact of the disruption on the connectivity of the bicycle sharing usage network. We found that the disruption in public transportation in London increased the total number of bicycle sharing trips by 85% from an average 38,886 to 72,503 trips per day. The duration of trips also increased by 88% from an average 23 to 43 min. The disruption also had a considerable impact on the structure and properties of the bicycle sharing mobility network. The connectivity of the network of bicycle sharing trips increased by 88% from 0.102 to 0.187. We found that many of the observed changes are heterogeneously distributed over space suggesting that the impact of the disruption was not uniform across the network. However, the structure of communities in the bicycle sharing mobility network remained roughly invariant from day to day.

The surprising finding is that adjusting the capital asset pricing model for anchoring provides a plausible unified framework for understanding almost all of the key asset pricing anomalies. The anomalies captured in the theoretical framework include the well-known size and value effects, high alpha of low beta stocks, accruals, low volatility anomaly, momentum effect, stock splits, and reverse stock splits. The market equity premium is also larger with anchoring.

We explore and balance these interests and identify solid reasonableness of such a reward especially in enhancing the transfer of knowledge from employees to employers. Thus, we suggest employers, whose business is based on innovations, to implement a level of rewards that would be at least incentive for employees to pass inventive ideas to employers.

Market orientation is 'the extent to which an actor in the marketplace uses knowledge about the market, especially about customers, as a basis for decision-making on what to produce, how to produce it, and how to market it'. Market orientation comprises three constructs: market intelligence generation, dissemination and responsiveness. Value chain governance can facilitate market orientation requirements. Value chain governance includes network governance, contracting and informal relationships. Knowledge about how governance can facilitate a value chain's market orientation is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore how the governance of a global food value chain can facilitate the value chain's market orientation. The study applies a multiple case study design. Four in-depth case studies were conducted on global food value chains from New Zealand to Western Europe dealing with the products apples, kiwis, venison and lamb. Interviews were conducted with actors from these four value chains in the Netherlands as well as in New Zealand. In each value chain actors with similar functions were interviewed in order to make the results comparable. Analysis of the case studies shows that network governance (i.e. leadership, shared governance and facilitation), contractual agreements (i.e. type and content: price, volume, quality) and informal relationships (i.e. trust and commitment) can contribute to the market orientation of a value chain. Leaderships and shared governance, in combination with good informal relationships in the chain, as well as contractual incentives, are main contributors to market orientation in global fresh food value chains. The paper adds to the still very scarce literature on governance of value chains and market orientation of value chains.","[Trienekens, Jacques; van Velzen, Mariska] Wageningen Univ & Res, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lees, Nic; Saunders, Caroline] Lincoln Univ, POB 85084, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand; [Pascucci, Stefano] Univ Exeter, Business Sch, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England",Wageningen University & Research; Lincoln University - New Zealand; University of Exeter,"Trienekens, J (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",jacques.trienekens@wur.nl,"Lees, Nicholas/G-2005-2015; trienekens, jacques/JFA-0126-2023","Lees, Nicholas/0000-0002-9412-7939;",,,,,51,24,26,6,40,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Russia has recently introduced a number of governance training programs such as Social Administration (1996), Public and Municipal Administration (1999) and Human Resource Governance (2002) in the higher education system. However, they all became part of a larger specialization category entitled Economics and Governance, which resulted in the disruption of the content of governance itself Neither group has not yet given special attention to its sociological component. Nonetheless, Russian universities that established, as part of their governance training programs, departments or curriculum modules related to sociology of governance now graduate the best-qualified governors. Students study the theoretical, organizational and practical implications of governance interactions, key objectives, challenges and mechanisms of Public and Municipal Administration, methods and tools for attracting investment in the economy of Russia's municipalities and regions as well as the ins and outs of the property governance system. Sociology of governance is a basic discipline that allows students to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills and fosters more in-depth understanding of social, political and economic aspects of governance processes among students. Sociology of governance is a discipline that summarizes all governance-related disciplines in terms of identifying and investigating the specificities of governance relationships at all functioning levels of society and its parts and in all areas of society. The study of sociology of governance as a discipline examining governance relationships and interactions among participants in governance processes has been relatively recent in Russia.

With some household expenses financed by credit, a growth in household debt levels can be observed. This research is based on panel data at the micro level for Polish households, obtained from the Social Diagnosis (Diagnoza Spoleczna) study in 2009 and 2015. The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of changing household incomes on their debt levels. The overall change in household debt levels is examined using mobility indices. The results show that the general improvement in the income situation of indebted households varies depending on the level of debt. The subjective perception of the income situation of the low-debt households has improved. In addition, the heavier the burden of loan repayments, the less likely it is that households can benefit from the favourable economic situation.","[Walega, Agnieszka; Walega, Grzegorz] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Walega, A (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland.",,"Wałęga, Grzegorz/T-9206-2019; Wałęga, Agnieszka/ABD-6566-2021","Wałęga, Grzegorz/0000-0002-4355-5204;","National Science Centre (NCN, Poland) [2015/19/D/HS4/02569]","National Science Centre (NCN, Poland)(National Science Centre, Poland)","This paper was supported by funds from the National Science Centre (NCN, Poland) through grant No. 2015/19/D/HS4/02569.",,22,0,0,1,4,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-77-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,552,561,,10.20472/EFC.2018.010.039,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505164900039,0

In recent years, commodity markets, similarly to economics or financial markets, have been transformed. In the first decade of the twenty-first century significant fluctuations of raw material prices were observed. Moreover, many investors originating from financial markets started to be more and more active on commodity markets. Cheapening and easily accessible capital encouraged investors to seek alternative ways to multiply their assets, and one of the solutions was an increased exposure on commodity markets. The purpose of this article was the consideration of market financialization based on our own and other empirical studies as well as chosen theoretical concepts. A hypothesis was formed which reads: The result of the financialization of the commodity markets process is the increasing fluctuation levels of prices. The verification of this hypothesis is based on comparison analysis of the changeability of prices of chosen materials and the positioning of the investors groups in the period of 2007-2017. Furthermore other empirical studies conducted by other authors were analysed. Understanding the impact of financialization on the prices of goods requires an evaluation of its influences on the economic mechanisms shaping the situation on commodity markets. It was concluded that the financialization of the commodity markets has an effect on the increased fluctuation of chosen materials.","[Wlodarczyk, Bogdan; Szturo, Marek] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Wlodarczyk, B (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland.",bogdan.wlodarczyk@uwm.edu.pl; marsz@uwm.edu.pl,,"Wlodarczyk, Bogdan/0000-0002-8965-9957; Szturo, Marek/0000-0001-7978-1089",,,,,17,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-76228-9; 978-3-319-76227-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,99,108,,10.1007/978-3-319-76228-9_10,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448435600010,0

In the absence of end-of-day quote data, this method generally provides the highest cross-sectional and average time-series correlations with the TAQ effective spread benchmark. Moreover, it delivers the most accurate estimates for less liquid stocks.

Our study considers whether shareholders may also consider CSR activities when voting in director elections and say-on-pay votes. We find that CSR performance is associated with shareholder support in both director elections and say-on-pay votes. In particular, we find higher support for both director elections and executive compensation when there are more CSR strengths. Additionally, we find that the social strength aspect of CSR is the most important component in the relationships between CSR and director elections and that the environmental strengths aspect is the most important component in the relationship between CSR and executive compensation. Our results suggest that shareholders may value certain types of CSR and are more supportive of boards and management when CSR performance is stronger. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The key question examined in the paper is whether we observe an asymmetry between the effects of positive and negative changes on individual happiness, and if it exists, whether it is observed uniformly across the happiness distribution. Such an asymmetry is referred to as loss aversion in prospect theory. Loss aversion effects are analyzed with respect to relative income as well as expected and actual income changes. We find that feeling relatively poor has a greater negative effect on happiness than the positive effect of feeling relatively rich, i.e., losses bite more than gains. Moreover, the degree of loss aversion with respect to relative income was found to increase as we move down the happiness distribution. However, no evidence of loss aversion is detected with respect to income changes at the mean, though the happiness of relatively unhappy people is found to be affected more by losses than by equivalent gains.","[Fang, Zheng] Singapore Univ Social Sci, Sch Business, 461 Clementi Rd, Singapore 599491, Singapore; [Niimi, Yoko] Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Ohtemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan",Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS),"Niimi, Y (通讯作者)，Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Ohtemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan.",fangzheng@suss.edu.sg; niimi@agi.or.jp,"Fang, Zheng/H-4201-2019","Fang, Zheng/0000-0002-8622-8959",JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI [15H01950]; Asian Growth Research Institute; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01950] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Asian Growth Research Institute; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to Andrew Clark, Charles Yuji Horioka, participants of the 15th Panel Survey Conference (Japan) and International Conference on Well-being (Singapore), and an anonymous referee for their invaluable comments.

Our econometric analysis supports the following conclusions: (1) the effect of asymmetric information on the probability of claims is significant; (2) the effect of ex ante moral hazard on the probability of claims is not significant, establishing adverse selection as the underlying source of information asymmetry; (3) the effect of asymmetric information (including ex ante moral hazard) on the severity of claims is not significant; and (4) the impact of ex post moral hazard on claim severity is significant for a subset of lower-coverage policyholders.

New optimal trajectories are found that were hidden in the simplified analysis. Furthermore, it is shown that two Nash equilibria may exist with the one leading to the steady state with a high level of ecological services dominating the other one. For larger initial states, only the Nash equilibrium with a low level of ecological services exists, which implies that the users of the lake can be trapped in the bad Nash equilibrium. Finally, it is shown that implementing the optimal phosphorus loadings from the simplified version into the full lake model can have considerable welfare losses, as the lake can end up in the wrong basin of attraction, but in most cases welfare losses are small because of the fast-slow dynamics.","[Grass, Dieter] Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Operat Res & Syst Theory, ORCOS, Vienna, Austria; [Xepapadeas, Anastasios] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Studies, Athens, Greece; [Xepapadeas, Anastasios] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy; [Xepapadeas, Anastasios; de Zeeuw, Aart] Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [de Zeeuw, Aart] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [de Zeeuw, Aart] Tilburg Univ, TSC, Tilburg, Netherlands",Technische Universitat Wien; Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Bologna; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Grass, D (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Operat Res & Syst Theory, ORCOS, Vienna, Austria.",dieter.grass@tuwien.ac.at; xepapad@aueb.gr; A.J.deZeeuw@uvt.nl,"Xepapadeas, Anastasios/ABH-3240-2020",,,,,,40,10,10,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

An answer to this question is provided by Weingast et al. (J Polit Econ 89(4):642-664, 1981), whose law of 1/n posits that an increase in the number of elected representatives always leads to an increase in public spending. Because elected politicians regard the tax base as a common pool from which they can finance specific projects for their constituencies, and these specific constituencies internalize the full benefits of the projects, but only bear a fraction of the costs (projects are financed from the common tax base), fiscal inefficiency will increase with the number of representatives. In this paper, I test the validity of the law of 1/n using a dataset of 9325 German municipalities between 2008 and 2010. Through the application of a regression discontinuity design, many of the methodological pitfalls of previous studies can be avoided and a valid estimation of the causal effect of legislature size on public spending for German municipalities can be determined. The results do not corroborate the positive findings of previous studies, which generally supported the implications of the law of 1/n. For the years 2008-2010, I find a negative effect of legislature size on public spending in German municipal councils.","[Hoehmann, Daniel] Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Höhmann, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany.",daniel.hoehmann@uni-bamberg.de,"Höhmann, Daniel/Q-6047-2019","Hohmann, Daniel/0000-0003-1740-5234",,,,,63,12,12,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2017,173.0,3-4,,,,,345,367,,10.1007/s11127-017-0484-2,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FM2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414798900006,0

(2010) DMA/DMS estimator in state space representation to create forecasts using a data-rich forecasting environment. Our approach is mainly related to economic and financial time series that are subject to periods of high volatility, which increases the necessity of a time varying parameter framework. In a forecasting exercise for the stock and gold markets, we highlight the economic value-added of our approach by applying a simple trading rule to the return series. By combining both assets, we show that our approach performs better when compared to alternative forecasting models such as machine learning algorithms and standard DMA/DMS. Results for the complexity of the forecasting models highlight the advantages of high dimensional forecasting approaches in times of economic uncertainty, such as the recent financial crisis. The economic performance of the trading rule weakens when we consider transaction costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Can PIL in India truly serve as a model for other developing countries in promoting the basic rights of their citizens? Reconsidering the conditions that enable the judiciary to engage in judicial activism through PIL, this paper argues that writ jurisdiction is the key factor in considering the peculiarity and sustainability of Indian PIL, as the unique development of its jurisdiction has contributed to increased power for judges in delivering social justice to society and has also opened the possibility of judges pursuing their own agendas through the resulting informalization of procedure and remedy.

To test this, we analyze changes in the relation between hedge funds' stock market exposure and aggregate stock market liquidity. Employing an optimal changepoint approach, we find that equity-oriented hedge funds display a significant shift in liquidity-timing behavior after the major market microstructure changes in the year 2000. The shift is from a negative relation between market beta and liquidity towards a positive relation. We rule out a mechanistic explanation of the results by computing the returns to several familiar risk arbitrage strategies, finding in them no evidence of a similar shift in liquidity timing.

The strategy hedges an option with three options at different maturities and strikes by matching the option function expansion along maturity and strike rather than risk factors. Its hedging effectiveness varies with the maturity and strike distance between the target and the hedge options, but is robust to variations in the underlying risk dynamics. Simulation analysis under different risk environments and historical analysis on S&P 500 index options both show that a wide spectrum of strike-maturity combinations can outperform dynamic delta hedging.","[Wu, Liuren] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Zhu, Jingyi] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Wu, LR (通讯作者)，Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, One Bernard Baruch Way,B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA.",liuren.wu@baruch.cuny.edu,"Wu, Liuren/HGD-6691-2022",,The City University of New York PSC-CUNY Research Award Program,The City University of New York PSC-CUNY Research Award Program,"We thank Federico M.

The quality of services specific to accounting profession is primarily aimed at compliance with the ethical and professional standards, without depending only on regulatory and monitoring activities exercised by professional bodies but being determined by the mentality of professionals and their ability to meet customer expectations and assess their future needs. In our research we analysed the evolution of quality classes obtained within each professional body during 2009-2014, by ranking the performance of entities that were submitted to quality audit. Though we found an upward trend for promotion in the higher quality classes, we consider that supervision only seeks the degree of compliance with professional and ethical standards in the field. Competition requirements in the accounting profession in the digital era, together with the globalization of markets and standardization of financial communication at regional and global level, are demanding from the professional accountant far more than compliance with existing standards. To study the potential for shifting from compliance to excellence in the accounting profession we conducted an empirical study using survey as a quantitative research method. The survey results revealed that the vast majority of those surveyed are organized in private offices and do not have quality control procedures and only a small proportion of respondents considered necessary to implement a quality management system. We deepened our researches and identified a compliance of professional standards with the requirements of a quality management system based on PEVA cycle and we concluded that the decisive step from compliance to excellence can be achieved by an effect of size, brought along by the association of professional accountants in small and medium entities and assumption of a quality culture in the companies providing accounting services.","[Avram, Costin Daniel] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania; [Togoe, Greti Daniela] Agcy Payments & Intervent Agr, Drobeta Turnu Severin, Romania; [Avram, Alexandra] West Univ Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania",University of Craiova; West University of Timisoara,"Avram, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania.",avramcostindaniel@yahoo.com,,"Costin Daniel, Avram/0000-0002-0741-7007",,,,,24,2,2,1,13,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2017,19.0,,,,11,,1077,1090,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9VF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413858500011,0

The program sent SMS updates regarding confirmed attendance of clinic staff and activities to randomly selected cell phone-owning households in the local community. These messages aimed to reduce uncertainty regarding the availability of clinic services, and in turn, increase the expected benefit of deciding to visit the local health clinic. A difference-in-difference approach is used to evaluate the impact of the SMS program, and we find that the messages led to an increase in clinic attendance, the receipt of medicine, and reduced the duration of illness for young children aged six and under. However, these benefits are only seen for children who are the same sex as the cell phone owner, suggesting favoritism toward the health of these children. The benefits are found to be similar for both boys and girls. This is evidence that it is possible to increase health care utilization without changing the behavior of clinic staff.

Using Bhola's three dimensions of impact-impact by design, impact by interaction, and impact by emergence-focuses not just on what changes as an intended result of an intervention, but on how change happens and how positive changes can be sustained. The principal focus of the article is methodological and as such it describes in some detail the development of a sequence of participatory visualization and discussion methods and their application with a range of stakeholders, from program staff in the headquarters of the implementing agency, to local government officials, front-line program workers, and beneficiaries. It suggests that the use of a participatory approach can enable researchers and evaluators to gain a fuller picture of incidental and unintended outcomes arising from interventions, making participatory process evaluation a valuable complement to other impact assessment methodologies.

The latest thinking suggests that broader, multi-pronged, multi-level, strategic approaches that may overcome the limitations of narrow, localized successes, hold more promise. This paper examines the challenges and opportunities, in theory and practice, posed by the integration of two such citizen-based accountability strategies-social accountability and legal empowerment. It traces the foundations of each of these approaches to highlight the potential benefits of integration. Consequently it examines whether these benefits have been realized in practice, by drawing upon five cases of organizations pursuing integration of social accountability and legal empowerment for health accountability in Macedonia, Guatemala, Uganda, and India. The cases highlight that while integration offers some promise in advancing the cause of social change, it also poses challenges for organizations in terms of strategies they pursue.

This paper highlights that technology also diffuses across countries and industries through intermediate input supply. Technology transfer to intermediates suppliers ensues from R&D that induces a demand for technologically advanced intermediates. I analyze R&D spillovers through intermediate input usage and supply for 18 manufacturing industries in 20 OECD countries over 1987-2009. Results support both use- and supply-driven R&D spillovers. Comparing their effects reveals interesting variations. Among domestic industries, intermediate input supply is the dominant channel. For international relations, both use- and supply-driven R&D spillovers are found.","[Poetzsch, Christina] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Poetzsch, C (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",christina.poetzsch@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

By unbundling and valuing the investment, (dis)saving, insurance and risk-sharing functions of pensions, PPRs allow risk management and (dis)saving to be customized to the specific features of heterogeneous individuals. Unlike variable annuities, PPRs allow investment risks to be combined with longevity insurance without giving rise to high year-on-year volatility in consumption streams or opaque and rigid valuation and smoothing rules.

Using the data from the Understanding Society UK survey, we apply structural equation modelling to examine if the Big Five personality traits help explain why certain individuals choose to invest in energy efficiency measures while others do not, even under nearly identical financial conditions. The results show that personality traits affect one-time, high-cost energy efficiency investments indirectly through environmental attitudes and risk preferences. However, low-cost pro environmental habits, such as conserving energy and buying 'green' products, are mediated only through the environmental attitude, but not through the risk preference channel. This is consistent with the fact that these everyday choices carry a much lower financial risk than an expensive energy efficiency investment. The findings illustrate that personality traits may pose a barrier to reducing energy consumption in the residential sector and underline the need for creating differentiated and targeted products and policies.

Lit area expansion had more effect on rural poverty measures than did intensive margin growth in terms of the brightness of light from urban areas. For India's current stage of development, growth of secondary towns may do more to reduce rural poverty than does big city growth although our theoretical model suggests that cities may eventually take over from towns as the drivers of rural poverty reduction.

I consider several remedies that an institutional designer may consider in order to avoid this problem while allowing information transmission that benefits the voters. I evaluate the effects of (1) limiting Expert communication to binary endorsements, (2) encouraging competition between Experts, and (3) restricting the agenda in order to consider only one dimension at a time.

The empirical application is comprised of 56 commercial banks based in five GCC countries over the period 1995-2011. In addition, to examine the differences between banks, a range of explanatory variables from both the bank-level and macro-level are included in several models. The results of hazard and survivor functions indicate that Islamic banks have a higher incidence rate of failure and therefore a shorter survival time than conventional banks. The discrete-time duration model (or the complementary log-log model) findings for the all-banks-pooled model confirm that the hazard rate increases with Islamic banks. Furthermore, the analysis of each bank type reveals that the effect of explanatory variables on survival time differs between Islamic and conventional banks. For instance, increasing the net interest margin ratio causes the hazard rate in Islamic banks to rise, whereas this rate is lowered in conventional banks. Among the macro-level variables, a higher inflation rate leads to a higher hazard rate; improving the regulatory quality correspondingly reduces the hazard rate of survival time in the banking sector of countries within the GCC.

We focus on the interplay of asymmetric emission taxes and the home market effect and show how a large-market advantage can counterbalance a high emission tax, so that trade liberalization leads firms to move to the large high-tax economy. Global emissions decrease when trade is liberalized in this case. We then simulate the model with endogenous taxes. The larger country, which has the advantage of the home market effect, will be able to set a higher Nash emission tax than its smaller trade partner yet still maintain its manufacturing base. As a result, a pollution haven will typically not arise in this case as trade is liberalized. However, global emissions increase as a result of international tax competition, which underscores the importance of international cooperation as trade becomes freer.","[Forslid, Rikard] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Forslid, Rikard] CEPR, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Forslid, R (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden.",rf@ne.su.se; okubo@econ.keio.ac.jp; mark.sanctuary@hhs.se,,,"Swedish Research Council; Jan Wallander's and Tom Hedelius's Research Foundation; Mistra's ENTWINED program; KAKENHI [16K03652, 26220503]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H00986, 15H03348, 26220503, 16K03652] Funding Source: KAKEN","Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Jan Wallander's and Tom Hedelius's Research Foundation; Mistra's ENTWINED program; KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to Daniel Millimet and Jayjit Roy for providing the data, originally collected by Wolfgang Keller and Arik Levinson.

The results show that the use of this approach leads to a significant improvement of the Sharpe ratio when compared to the naive strategy and the optimal portfolios based on a simple multivariate GARCH approach such as the DCC model, even when different transaction costs are considered.

Our analyses provide clear evidence that the term structure of credit spreads has more predictive power than the government bond yield. Specifically, the paper shows that the credit spread curve of medium-grade corporate bonds has more useful information than the government bond yield curve for predicting the business cycle. However, our results indicate that the increase in the BBB-rated credit spread is associated with future economic expansion, contradicting the theoretical prediction in the existing literature. Our Markov-switching analysis demonstrates that this peculiar relationship holds only during the global financial crisis regime, and the 1-year government bond yield and the term spread of A-rated credit spread information have significant predictive power for the business cycle, regardless of the economic state.

Using duration models with random effects, which take into account the multiple spells and ranked exits, allows estimations of the stepwise exit rates from each rating category. After controlling for key time-varying indicators such as GDP growth, political and financial ratings, and trade openness, I find that each of the following contributes to the differences in the duration and exit in investment risk ratings across countries and rating categories: (i) path-dependent effects specific to each level of rating; (ii)country-characteristics based on education attainment, geography, history and culture, and (iii) remaining heterogeneity effects that include the graders' subjective assessments.","[Rakotoarisoa, Manitra A.] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Econ & Social Dev Dept, Trade & Markets Div, D-835,Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Rakotoarisoa, MA (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org United Nations, Econ & Social Dev Dept, Trade & Markets Div, D-835,Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",manitra.rakotoarisoa@fao.org,,,,,,,69,0,0,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Based on a three-stage approach, our empirical evidence suggests that a one-time monetary-easing shock can significantly trigger house price booms in Euro area countries with liberal mortgage markets. Such shocks can explain over 20% of the forecasting error variance of non-fundamental house price runups in Ireland and Spain. We find that, in countries with more regulated mortgage markets, monetary policy stance does not significantly affect non-fundamental house prices. Policymakers may wish to focus on limiting mortgage equity withdrawals and on monitoring loan-to-value ratios and tax policies in order to minimize the side effects of accommodative monetary policies on housing market stability for Euro area countries. We posit that this is especially true for peripheral countries, which are more likely to be subjected to overly loose monetary policy stances. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of these spikes in world food prices on local food prices and thus on local consumers is determined by the food price pass through. Pass through is defined as the extent to which changes in world food prices lead to changes in local food prices. We examine the determinants of variation in food price pass through from global to local consumer prices in a global sample of 147 countries, using FAO data on world food prices and ILO data on food prices for consumers. While market integration matters, our study finds that income per capita is the dominant factor explaining cross-country variation in pass through of food prices. We estimate an elasticity of about 0.3 of pass through with respect to income per capita. This means far greater price transmission of food price shocks at the commodity level to final consumers in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The implication is that future swings in world food prices will in particular jeopardize food security in poor countries. Trade policy measures of market integration also affect the pass through significantly, whereas infrastructure and geography measures play no significant role. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Sons-of-the-soil terminology, developed with reference to. conflicts in South Asia, has been used to describe some of Africa's most violent or enduring conflicts, including those in eastern DRC, northern Uganda, the Casamance Region of Senegal, and southwestern Cote d'Ivoire. Is Africa becoming more like South Asia, where land scarcity has often fueled conflicts between indigenous land owners and in-migrants? This paper argues that political science theories that focus on rural migration and land scarcity alone to explain outbreaks of SoS conflict in Asia fall short in Africa because they are underdetermining. The paper proposes a model of structure and variation in land tenure institutions in sub-Saharan Africa, and argues that these factors are critical in explaining the presence of absence of SoS conflict over land. This conceptualization of the problem highlights the strong role of the state in structuring relations of land use and access, and suggests that the character of local state-backed land institutions goes far in accounting for the presence or absence, scale, location, and triggering of large-scale SoS land conflict in zones of smallholder agriculture. A meta-study of 24 subnational cases of land conflict (1990-2014), drawn from secondary and primary sources and field observations, generates case-based support for the argument. The study suggests that omission of land-tenure institution variables enfeebles earlier political science theory, and may inadvertently lead policy makers and practitioners to the erroneous conclusion that in rural Africa, primordial groups compete for land in an anarchic state of nature.

We focus in particular on the recent introduction of a securities transaction tax (STT) in Italy. A peculiarity of the Italian STT is that it only concerns stocks of corporations with a market capitalization above (sic) 500 million. We exploit this feature via a differences-in-differences approach-comparing taxed and non-taxed stocks before and after the introduction of the tax - and via a regression discontinuity design - comparing the performance of stocks just above the threshold with those just below. Focusing on the regulated market, we find that the new tax reduced liquidity, but it left transaction volumes and returns substantially unaffected.

The adherence to the European Union and the lift of restrictions on the labour market in Western Europe facilitated the short-term and definitive emigration. The temporary and definitive departure of a part of the labour force from the emigration countries led to a significant flow of remittances. Being viewed as the main gain of the loss of labour force, remittances are important at macroeconomic level to the extent in which they bring in the receiving country economic growth. The emigration of the labour force may have a positive or a negative influence on the economy of a country according to the way in which remittances received are used by emigrants. This study analyses the impact that the remittances have on the economic development of the country, on investments and exports in Romania. The characteristics of macroeconomic variables used require, for the econometric analysis, the determination of the Granger causality by means of the Toda and Yamamoto's procedure (1995). The results obtained confirm that remittances do not Granger cause either the economic development of Romania expressed in the GDP, or the investments or the exports.","[Chirila, Viorica; Chirila, Ciprian] Univ Alexandru Ioan Cuza Iasi, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Chirila, V (通讯作者)，Univ Alexandru Ioan Cuza Iasi, Iasi, Romania.",chviorica@gmail.com,"Chirilă, Viorica/K-3050-2019; Chirila, Ciprian/HZM-3093-2023","Chirila, Ciprian/0000-0002-8489-8465",,,,,19,11,12,1,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2017,19.0,46,,,,,696,710,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413856000007,0

Complete reversibility has been frequently invoked but less studied, especially for the case of lumpy investment typically considered in capital budgeting. We examine a simple lumpy investment problem for the full range, from complete irreversibility to completely reversibility, with a focus on the latter. The optimal stopping rules under complete reversibility are to invest when the project generates enough net cash flow to cover Jorgenson's opportunity cost of investment and to disinvest when it does not. Given the static nature of these rules, net present value as a timing criterion under reversibility is not pertinent. Investments that are partially reversible have much in common with completely irreversible investments but nothing in common with completely reversible investments. The case of reversible investment provides a foil for understanding that the distinguishing feature of investment as treated in corporate finance is that it entails at least some irreversibility.

The use of different data sets in terms of time periods, and number and geographic location of countries, different theoretical background leading to different econometric specifications, and single type of econometric methodology, make any comparison impossible. This paper looks into the dynamic interaction between military spending and economic growth during the period 1988-2013 that includes the recent years of economic crisis covering 138 countries without making any prior assumptions about the theoretical channels of influence, while not limited to a single estimation method but employing a wide range of methodologies in order to form a complete picture of the long- and short-run interaction. Furthermore, as such interaction might not be linear, we create three groups of countries based on the countries' income developmental stage. Overall we find no evidence of long- and short-run causality from the military spending to economic growth except for the developing countries (positive in the long run). However, from economic growth to military spending we find a positive impact for all groups except the least developed countries. We also notice the interaction was more prominent prior to the start of the economic crisis.","[Desli, E.; Gkoulgkoutsika, A.; Katrakilidis, C.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Desli, E (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",desli@econ.auth.gr,"Gkoulgkoutsika, Alexandra/ABE-2742-2021; Desli, Evangelia/AAO-3970-2021","Gkoulgkoutsika, Alexandra/0000-0002-8893-5999; Desli, Evangelia/0000-0002-4904-9046",,,,,62,22,22,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In southwestern Madagascar, zebu cattle are the most prominent herded animal, and the heads a household owns is a strong indicator of both prestige and social status. Given the extreme socio-cultural value of zebu cattle in Malagasy culture, however, many authors question the economic rationale of zebu accumulation. Consequently, improved zebu herding has been widely ignored as a suitable target for development interventions. Empirical micro-level data on the role of livestock herding in terms of household economics is missing, though. With this contribution, we close this knowledge gap by analyzing the economic importance of zebu herding against (i) the general role of livestock husbandry and (ii) non-cattle-related livelihood and coping strategies to safeguard smallholders against crop failures. We conducted a longitudinal household and recall survey (n = 150 households, stratified random sampling, bi-weekly data acquisition) covering a year in which crop failure was widespread. Our study finds that households spent large shares of their total cash income on food purchases, whereas proceeds from the sale of livestock accounted for >56% of cash food expenditures. Remittances from out migrated household members were the 2nd most important income source. Similarly, the collection of wild foods and the reduction of food consumption were widespread coping strategies, as well as reliance on food aids from NGOs. The sale of zebu contributed a highly variable share to total income, depending on the livelihood strategy by households. However, while we can document an insurance function from zebu herding, small ruminants, i.e., goats and particularly sheep and chicken were more important for compensating food expenditures. Policy implications include a promotion of livestock diversification and poultry, systematic fodder forestation and improvements for the security of pastoralists in southern Madagascar.

Using a decomposition approach to disentangle factor endowments and returns by ethnic group, we draw four key conclusions. First, removing language barriers would significantly reduce inequality among ethnic groups, narrowing the ethnic gap, and especially so through enhancing the gains earned by minorities from education. Second, variations in returns to education exist in favor of the majority in mixed communes, suggesting that either the special needs of minority children have not been adequately addressed in the classroom, or unequal treatment in favor of the majority exists in the labor market. Third, in contrast to recent literature, there is no difference in the benefits drawn from enhanced infrastructure at the commune level across ethnic groups. Finally, we find little evidence to support the established views that the ethnic gap is attributed largely to differences in the returns to endowments. Overall, our research highlights the importance of considering language barriers and the availability of infrastructure for ethnic inequality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

From a theoretical perspective, BoCE has been explained either by the misperception of chance, also known as the gambler's fallacy, or by the loss repair effect. The aim of this paper is to look more closely at the former. We run a laboratory experiment in which the information set is relatively rich but the implementation of the Bayesian updating process is fairly simple. By doing so, we are able to elicit a range of consistent but heterogeneous probability beliefs and to distinguish between Bayesian and non-Bayesian subjects. We obtain two major results concerning Bayesian subjects. First, they exhibit a strong and robust short-run BoCE. Second, they are seemingly not affected by the audits of other taxpayers in their compliance decision. These results are robust to different definitions of Bayesianity as well as to different specifications and conflict with the evidence that Bayesian agents correctly perceive the chance of being audited. In turn, these findings suggest that the existing explanations of the BoCE are not satisfactory and that alternative theories are needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is based on an economic description of uneven-aged forestry using a size-structured transition matrix model. In discrete time with fixed harvesting costs, optimizing harvest timing requires solving of a vector of integer variables in addition to the usual number of harvested trees. This mixed integer problem is solved using bilevel optimization, where the times of harvest are solved by a hill-climbing algorithm, and harvest intensities by a gradient-based interior point algorithm. Optimizing the integer harvest timing variables is crucial especially when the initial stand is an outcome of a plantation type of even-aged management and the forest owner prefers to continue forestry without clearcuts. Optimal harvest timing is shown to depend strongly on a fixed cost level, initial stand state, and interest rate. A steady state harvesting interval is typically 10-25 years, however, during transition it may be as long as 55 years. Increasing the interest rate decreases the average steady state capital value of the stand but may cause the steady state harvest frequency to decrease or increase due to flexibility in targeting harvests to different tree size classes. It appears that the legal limitations both in Sweden and Finland are constraining the optimal solutions.","[Ramo, Janne; Tahvonen, Olli] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Latokartanonkaari 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Rämö, J (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Latokartanonkaari 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",janne.ramo@helsinki.fi; olli.tahvonen@helsinki.fi,,"Ramo, Janne/0000-0002-0528-5207",,,,,56,25,26,2,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We explore the effect of government expenditures on expenditure growth in each quintile of the expenditure distribution and the effect of growth for each group. We find that the benefits of growth are concentrated among the better-off sectors of the population in these two countries (perhaps to the detriment of the poorer sectors) by looking at the effects within a country and across different groups of households and administrative entities. We exploit variation in expenditures and growth across and within regions of each country to estimate the elasticities of expenditure with respect to fiscal expenditure and mean expenditure growth at different points of the expenditure distribution, using household survey data and government expenditure data at the district level. We find that, overall, mean expenditure growth benefits the top expenditure groups. The welfare spillovers are mostly present for top 20% of the expenditure distribution, with the middle of the distribution in Tanzania responding slightly to these spillovers. Public/social expenditures do not appear to affect inequality considerably, but do tend to work toward decreasing inequality. However, mean expenditure growth is related to increases in inequality in the sense that the richest sectors of the population benefit the most from growth. We find that the growth elasticity of expenditure is only above one for the top quintile in both countries. In Tanzania, a 1% increase in average household expenditure is related to a 1.96% expenditure growth in the top quintile and 0.43% in the third quintile. In Rwanda, a 1% increase in average household expenditure is related to a 1.93% increase in household expenditure in the top 20% of the distribution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a model in which heterogeneous commuters choose departure times from home and residential locations in a monocentric city with a bottleneck located between a central downtown and an adjacent suburb. We then demonstrate that commuters sort themselves temporally and spatially on the basis of their value of travel time and their flexibility. Furthermore, we reveal that introducing an optimal congestion toll alters the urban spatial structure, which contrasts with the previous literature. We further demonstrate through an example that congestion tolling can cause the city to physically expand outward, which helps rich commuters but hurts poor commuters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We compare two treatments that have been found to mitigate hypothetical bias, cheap talk and honesty priming, with a neutral priming control. We find greater sensitivity to price among respondents during choices made immediately following the cheap talk intervention. As additional choices are made, the wedge between price sensitivity in the control and honesty prime treatments diminishes and eventually loses statistical significance. We find this effect in both our online choice experiments and among respondents to face-to-face choice experiments conducted by de-Magistris, Gracia, and Nayga. Our online implementation of an honesty priming intervention yields no significant change in price sensitivity compared to a control. While de-Magistris et al. implement an honesty priming intervention that fully mitigates hypothetical bias in a face-to-face setting, we show that this effect is also transient, and in later choice exercises we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equality between honesty priming and the control. Our results are robust to multiple specifications and suggest additional work is required to adapt priming interventions for online settings and to extend the effectiveness of popular hypothetical bias mitigation techniques when respondents face multiple choice tasks.","[Howard, Gregory] East Carolina Univ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Roe, Brian E.; Nisbet, Erik C.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Martin, Jay F.] Ohio Sea Grant Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Howard, G (通讯作者)，East Carolina Univ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",howardgr@ecu.edu; roe.30@osu.edu; nisbet.5@osu.edu; martin.1130@osu.edu,"Roe, Brian E/A-7386-2009",,National Science Foundation's Coupled Natural and Human Systems [GRT00022685]; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center; Ohio State University; East Carolina University,National Science Foundation's Coupled Natural and Human Systems; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center; Ohio State University(Ohio State University); East Carolina University,"a professor at Ohio State University and the Ohio Sea Grant Program (martin.1130@osu.edu).

It shows that the method of Baillon et al. (2017b) can be adapted for field studies, providing ambiguity measurement tasks that are more comprehensible for nonacademic subjects. Ambiguity attitudes were elicited in two groups of Chinese adolescents (poor rural and rich urban), among whom the income variation is big. In the rural group the poorer are both more ambiguity averse and more a-insensitive, whereas in the urban group the richer are more a-insensitivite. On average, the poor rural adolescents are worse at dealing with ambiguity than their urban counterparts. A-insensitivity, which measures people's understanding of an ambiguous situation, is an important but sometimes neglected component of ambiguity attitude. Policies aiming to help people improve decisions may focus more on reducing a-insensitivity as this cognitive bias is more likely to be influenced by intervention than people's intrinsic aversion towards ambiguity.","[Li, Chen] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Tinbergen Bldg H12-29,Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Li, C (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Tinbergen Bldg H12-29,Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",c.li@ese.eur.nl,,,Tinbergen Institution; Econometrics Institute at Erasmus School of Economics,Tinbergen Institution; Econometrics Institute at Erasmus School of Economics,"I would like to thank the coordinating teachers at the participating schools and the NGO One-School organization in China for making this study possible.

It is suggested that there is a counter-movement against liberal capitalism that was triggered by the economic crisis of 2008 and the stagnating incomes that set in as austerity policies were widely pursued. The new direction is termed as organized capitalism, with a stronger focus on the national level.

We find that bird-feeding is primarily but not exclusively motivated by the direct consumption value of interaction with wildlife. The implicit valuations given to different species suggest that people prefer birds that have aesthetic appeal and that evoke human feelings of protectiveness. These findings suggest that people derive wellbeing by adopting a warden-like role towards 'their' wildlife. We test for external validity by conducting a hedonic analysis of sales of bird food.

In Indonesia, the expansion is largely driven by smallholder farmers. While recent research has studied effects for the environment and climate change, socioeconomic impacts in the small farm sector have hardly been analyzed. Here, we address this research gap by analyzing effects of oil palm adoption on farm household living standards and nutrition in Sumatra. Using survey data and econometric models, we estimate average impacts, impact pathways, and impact heterogeneity. Results show that oil palm adoption improves household living standards and nutrition. Mean impacts on food and non-food expenditures, as well as on calorie consumption and dietary quality, are all positive and significant. A sizeable part of the total effects is attributable to oil palm adopters expanding their farm size rather than realizing higher profits per hectare. Oil palm has lower labor requirements than alternative crops (especially rubber), so that adopting farmers are able to manage larger land areas. Labor saved through switching from rubber to oil palm is also used to increase off-farm incomes. Impact heterogeneity is analyzed with quantile regressions. We find positive effects of oil palm adoption across the entire expenditure distribution. However, the absolute gains in total expenditures and non-food expenditures are larger for the better-off, suggesting that oil palm may contribute to rising inequality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Why do clients change how microfinance projects function in unanticipated ways? Previous scholarship on microfinance has overlooked the relevance of already existing borrowing practices and norms to how people engage with and use microfinance. Over 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork in the Kumaon region of eastern Uttarakhand state in northern India, I found that Kumaonis altered the microfinance program of a local NGO to make it fit with their already existing borrowing practices, which were intimately tied to their livelihood strategies. Kumaoni livelihoods were based on exchange relationships with family, friends, and neighbors through which they could secure the means for physical and financial survival, as well as social and emotional survival. These relationships were governed by a moral economy that obligated exchange partners to properly assist one another, and ensured balance between partners and across multiple social ties. Rather than abandoning their exchange relationships, Kumaonis and local fieldworkers, who also relied on these ties, altered microfinance so that it fit with this moral economy and became another node in the already existing networks of assistance. If they had not been able to alter projects, Kumaonis would likely have stopped participating, as other groups in similar circumstances around the globe have done. Although the microfinance program was a success in the eyes of beneficiaries, senior staff members and donors remained unaware of why projects changed on the ground. To ensure that development programs can be made relevant to people's lives and cultural values, development practitioners must relinquish control over the minutiae of development and allow local-level workers to negotiate the details of projects with participants.

The estimates, which are based on hedonic price equations with the degree of radioactive contamination measured by airborne surveys, indicate that the contamination decreased the price of residential land and imply a substantial willingness to pay to avoid exposure to the radioactive fallout.

This article analyzes the political-economic determinants of China's agricultural subsidy changes using producer subsidy equivalents (PSEs) drawn from annual data from 1984 to 2015 on 16 agricultural commodity sectors that include multiple policy instruments. Empirical results indicate that national factors, such as high rates of economic growth and a lower share of agriculture in the economy, have been the primary drivers of increases in PSEs, and that larger, more geographically concentrated agricultural sectors are more likely to be subsidized at a higher PSE rate. Finally, China's joining the World Trade Organization in December 2001 led to significant increases in PSEs that were not already explained by internal national or commodity-specific factors. In essence, China's agricultural subsidy programs and levels increasingly resemble those of developed countries, primarily as a result of economic transformation and the ability to structure agricultural policies within the WTO rules. Moreover, this article predicts that agricultural subsidies will trend slightly upward in the next decade and that the strongest opportunities to export to China will be in animal products or grains that are utilized for feed or processed foods, where the levels of subsidies are predicted to increase but remain lower than for traditional food crops.

We underline the decisive role of guns Vs butter models in integrating conflicts in the mainstream economics, while maintaining links with military operational researches. We particularly focus on the Contest Success Function which is the cornerstone of guns Vs butter models.

The Nitrogen Index Tier Zero tool is employed in generating a nitrogen balance sheet at the farm level. As CA technology may improve farmers' access to better technology, we employ a selectivity-corrected meta-frontier approach to account for potential selection bias and technology heterogeneity. The empirical results suggest that farmers practising CA are environmentally more efficient than conventional farmers. The findings also show that environmental efficiency is significantly influenced by access to credit, farming experience and years of schooling of household head, land ownership and distance to markets. Moreover, farmers practising CA are found to be technically more efficient than those using the conventional technology.","[Abdulai, Abdul-Nafeo; Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Johanna Mestorf Str 5, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; Department of Food Economics and Consumption Stud, Univ Kiel, 24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel; University of Kiel,"Abdulai, AN (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Johanna Mestorf Str 5, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",anabdul@food-econ.uni-kiel.de; aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Abdul-Rahaman, Awal/GVS-8674-2022; Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021",", Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",,,,,52,51,54,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We hypothesize that state governments pursue two distinct goals when allocating grants to local governments: (1) helping aligned local parties win the next election and (2) buying off unaligned municipalities that may obstruct the state government's policy agenda. We argue furthermore that the relative importance of these two goals depends on local political conditions. In line with this argument, we show empirically that the effect of political alignment on grant receipts varies depending on the degree of local support for the state government.

We show that the cointegration component allows capturing well-known features of commodity prices, i.e., upward sloping (contango) and downward sloping (backwardation) term-structures, smaller volatilities for longer maturities and an upward sloping correlation term structure. The model is calibrated to futures price data of ten commodities. The results provide compelling evidence of cointegration in the data. Implications for the prices of futures and options written on common commodity spreads (e.g., spark spread and crack spread) are thoroughly investigated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This may impact the dynamics of investment and liquidity management, although few studies test their financial implications. We exploit the peculiar advantages of copper mines as a laboratory to identify cash-flow sensitivities. In this context, investment decisions depend on the expectations of the long run price of the commodity, while the spread between the spot price and this long run expectations shifts current cash-flows. For this study we compiled a sample of copper firms between 2002 and 2012. We do not find significant effects of cash flow on current capital expenditures, but we do observe a systematic cash flow sensitivity of cash holdings, meaning that some of these transitory earnings are retained as liquidity. This cash stockpiling is stronger among financially constrained firms. In a context of time-to-build, our findings support financial theories emphasizing the salience of cash as buffer stock for liquidity in preparation for future investment opportunities.

Over the long-term though, only the lower correspondent deposits effect persisted.

Our article extends the prior literature by decomposing stock insurers into publicly traded and nonpublicly traded (closely held) entities and breaking down both types of stocks into family-owned and nonfamily-owned categories. We further subdivide family firms into those with family-member CEOs and those with nonfamily CEOs. We find that the probability of nonroutine turnover has a significant negative relationship with firm performance. Turnover probabilities vary significantly by organizational form and ownership structure. Family firms with family-member CEOs have the lowest turnover rate of any ownership type. The probability of nonroutine CEO turnover is lower for mutuals than for publicly traded nonfamily stock firms and also for all other types of stocks except closely held family stock firms and publicly traded family stocks with family-member CEOs.

Some politicians may reduce their efforts, while others may pursue beneficial long-term policies that may be unpopular in the short term. We propose a novel pension system that solves the effort problem while preserving the willingness to implement long-term policies. The idea is to give politicians the option to choose between a flexible and a fixed pension scheme. While in the fixed scheme, performance has no impact on the pension, the pension increases with short-term performance in the flexible scheme, using the vote share of the officeholder's party in the next election as a performance indicator. Such a pension choice improves the well-being of citizens since officeholders are encouraged to invest in those activities that are beneficial for society. We analyze the properties and consequences of such a system.

We find that libraries with similar preferences are likely to lose from building a consortium and that those with diverse preferences are likely to gain by doing so. Combining libraries with diverse preferences implies that their valuation for different publishers' journals is more symmetric, which intensifies competition among publishers for scarce combined budgets. A tension between short term and long term considerations might generate a library consortium trap.' Our insight can be applied to other buyer groups as long as competition is generated by buyers' budget constraints.","[Jeon, Doh-Shin] Univ Toulouse Capitole IDEI, Toulouse Sch Econ, Mfg Tabacs 21 Allee Brienne, Toulouse, France; [Menicucci, Domenico] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, Via Pandette 9, Florence, Italy",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Florence,"Jeon, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole IDEI, Toulouse Sch Econ, Mfg Tabacs 21 Allee Brienne, Toulouse, France.",dohshin.jeon@gmail.com; domenico.menicucci@unifi.it,,,Jean-Jacques Laffont Digital Chair,Jean-Jacques Laffont Digital Chair,"We thank Jay Pil Choi, Matthew Ellman, Christiaan Hogendorn, Tobias Klein, Martin Peitz, John Thanassoulis, the Editor and three anonymous referees for helpful comments and the audience who attended our presentations at EARIE (Porto, 2013), ICT Conference (Paris, 2014) and Postal Economics Conference (Toulouse, 2014).

We demonstrate how a randomized experiment can be leveraged to measure selection bias by conducting a subsequent observational study that is identical in every way except that subjects choose their treatment-a quasi-doubly randomized preference trial (quasi-DRPT). Researchers first strive to think of and measure all possible confounders and then determine how well these confounders as controls can reduce or eliminate selection bias. We use a quasi-DRPT to study the effect of class time on student performance in an undergraduate introductory microeconomics course at a large public university, illustrating its required design elements: experimental and choice arms conducted in the same setting with identical interventions and measurements, and all confounders measured prospectively to treatment assignment or choice. Quasi-DRPTs augment randomized experiments in real-world settings where participants choose their treatments.

Moreover, throughout the analysis we differentiate between non-complex and complex banks, the latter of which could be seen as exhibiting a further level of risk. We seek to establish how these risk factors interact with bank specific, market structure and economic variables. Key results indicate that earnings volatility (business risk) increases with market power but decreases with size and output, while risk-taking (managerial risk) decreases with market power and increases with size and output. Furthermore, in examining return per unit of risk, results demonstrate that increased return and risk-taking are associated with bank specific factors and the economic environment, whereas decreased risk taking is associated with market structure. This suggests a management of risk, which increases with factors under bank control or improving external environment but decreases with the interaction of competitors. Overall, the results suggest that policy should focus on liquidity and equity buffers that should operate counter-cyclicality but size and market structure per se are not determining factors for higher risk. In terms of the recent financial crisis, it is likely that the great moderation that proceeded the crisis led to higher risk-taking due to higher economic growth but without the necessary buffers being established.

In this framework we show that it may be optimal for the central authority to choose a relatively inefficient monitoring technology and to reduce monetary incentives.

This paper argues that the size and the composition of the female migrant population can affect the marital stability of natives. We tested such hypothesis taking Italy as a case-study because it exemplifies a male-breadwinner society and because it is a relatively new immigration country. We estimated discrete-time event history models predicting marital disruption on data from the nationally representative 2009 Family and Social Subjects survey. Our results illustrated that the increasing presence of first mover migrant women (coming from Central-South America and Eastern Europe) was associated with higher separation risks among natives, especially for couples with lower human capital. By advancing the relevance of foreigners as a potential driver of natives' family life courses, our findings add to our understanding of partnership dynamics in recent immigration countries.","[Vignoli, Daniele; Pirani, Elena] Univ Florence, Viale Morgagni 59, Florence, Italy; [Venturini, Alessandra] Univ Turin, Lungo Dora Siena 100 A, Turin, Italy",University of Florence; University of Turin,"Vignoli, D (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Viale Morgagni 59, Florence, Italy.",vignoli@disia.unifi.it,"PIRANI, ELENA/AAL-7695-2020; venturini, alessandra/AAR-2121-2020","PIRANI, ELENA/0000-0002-4306-2899;",Migration Policy Center of the European University Institute,Migration Policy Center of the European University Institute,"We would like to thank Daniela Del Boca, Anna Di Bartolomeo, Philippe Fargues, Anna Paterno, and Chiara Pronzato for their comments on an earlier version of the paper.

This article examines variations in road traffic volume due to adverse weather in an arctic region, a topic that has received little attention in the transportation literature. The subject of the case study is northern Norway's Saltfjellet mountain pass, which is part of European Highway 6 (Ev6). A succinct econometric structural equation model was used to test hypotheses regarding the impacts of fluctuations in temperature, precipitation and wind speed on passenger and freight traffic volumes. The findings indicate that there was some reduction in traffic volume during adverse weather, particularly with respect to passenger traffic. However, the day-to-day variations in traffic volumes were relatively low at the studied section of road, although it is known that generalized transport costs increase significantly in adverse weather due to delays related to poor driving conditions and closed roads. The studied region is rural with limited access to alternative routes or transport modes, thus making this portion of the road particularly important for the communities in the region. Hence, the toad users have few other options than using this high-cost road in order to maintain their activities. The use of standardized parameters in transport models to predict the effect of adverse Weather on traffic volume, would not be appropriate in the studied context. However, it is recommended that the benefits of reducing the extra costs that adverse weather impose on traffic are estimated and included in road-project assessment tools to capture the burden and strain imposed on road users. This to ensure that appropriate decisions are made regarding the development and improvement of transportation facilities, particularly in rural areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One reason put forward trying to explain this phenomenon is reduced trade policy uncertainty. This paper is one of the first to explore the role of anticipation and trade policy uncertainty in the case of a recently concluded deep and comprehensive EU FTA, including significant behind the border measures. We use monthly data at a lower level of aggregation (8-digit level) compared to previous studies and we account for changes in the EU product classification over time. We also distinguish between the impact on products which are actually subject to liberalisation under the FTA as opposed to those which are already duty-free and we examine the effects on both the extensive margin and the intensive margin. We consider the impact of the FTA during three different periods of time (the start of negotiations, initialling of the agreement and entry into force), while comparing with the period before negotiations began. The results indicate that the FTA has had a positive impact on exports on both margins. The impact on the EU is somewhat higher indicating that EU exporters have more to gain in terms of increasing the predictability of the trade policy regime of the destination market and lowering its tariffs than vice versa. The results demonstrate that the impact of FTAs should not be assessed against the time period just prior to entry into force of the agreement, but much earlier to account for anticipation effects.","[Lakatos, Csilla; Nilsson, Lars] European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium",,"Nilsson, L (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium.",lars.nilsson@ec.europa.eu,,"Nilsson, Lars/0000-0003-0012-1753",,,,,19,26,27,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

However, achieving this target remains a major challenge for sub-Saharan Africa, and the ability of governments in the region to expand access is constrained by limited financial resources. This paper investigates whether targeting foreign aid to the water and sanitation sector can help achieve the goal of expanding access to water and sanitation services in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis is based on panel data estimation techniques controlling for country-specific effects and potential endogeneity of regressors. The econometric results suggest that increased aid targeted to the supply of water and sanitation is associated with increased access to these services, although the relationship is non-linear. The evidence in this study makes an important contribution to the scholarly debate on aid effectiveness. It also has important practical implications for aid policy: specifically, it suggests that in addition to scaling up aid disbursements to sub-Saharan African countries, donors need to increase aid allocation to water and sanitation as well as other areas where the region lags behind. There is also a need to identify structural constraints that may limit access to water and sanitation, and utilize foreign aid so as to alleviate these constraints. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Each financial institution's contribution to systemic risk can be measured as its systemic expected shortfall (SES), that is, its propensity to be undercapitalized when the system as a whole is undercapitalized. SES increases in the institution's leverage and its marginal expected shortfall (MES), that is, its losses in the tail of the system's loss distribution.

The formal sectors of the financial system, which include a fast-growing stock market and are dominated by a banking sector with large state-owned banks, have played a critical role in financing the state sectors and the investment-driven economic growth model. However, the formal sectors have not served the needs of the private sectors or of households; these dynamic sectors have been financed by alternative finance sectors operating largely outside the markets and formal institutions. Going forward, financial markets need to be further developed to provide more support for the private sectors, including technology and services industries; the formal and alternative sectors should work together to improve the efficiency of resource allocation to better support the new model of consumption-and innovation-driven growth. Finally, the financial system needs to reduce the likelihood of damaging financial crises, which have included a real estate crisis, a banking crisis triggered by defaults on corporate and local government debt, and a twin crisis in the currency market and the banking sector.","[Allen, Franklin] Imperial Coll London, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Qian, Jun Q.

The Vector Autoregressive model revealed certain causal dependencies among the markets.

Findings suggest that benefits were not equally distributed: 50 per cent of people moved in and out of poverty, and the other half was either non-poor (37%) or always poor (13%).","[Bader, Christoph; Wiesmann, Urs; Heinimann, Andreas] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Hallerstr 10, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Bieri, Sabin; Wiesmann, Urs; Heinimann, Andreas] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern,"Bader, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Hallerstr 10, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",christoph.bader@cde.unibe.ch,"Bader, Christoph/AAG-8312-2020","Bader, Christoph/0000-0002-8991-353X; Heinimann, Andreas/0000-0001-8905-8169; Bieri, Sabin/0000-0001-5919-2455","Feminization, Agricultural Transition and Rural Employment (FATE) project: partnership research on agricultural transition in Nepal, Bolivia, Rwanda, and Lao PDR; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under the Employment Module of the Swiss Programme for Research on Global Issues for Development (r4d Programme)","Feminization, Agricultural Transition and Rural Employment (FATE) project: partnership research on agricultural transition in Nepal, Bolivia, Rwanda, and Lao PDR; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under the Employment Module of the Swiss Programme for Research on Global Issues for Development (r4d Programme)","We acknowledge support from the Feminization, Agricultural Transition and Rural Employment (FATE) project: partnership research on agricultural transition in Nepal, Bolivia, Rwanda, and Lao PDR, funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under the Employment Module of the Swiss Programme for Research on Global Issues for Development (r4d Programme; www.r4d.ch).",,59,12,15,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Per capita consumption fell in urban areas, raising poverty substantially. Households cut back on food consumption and basic durables, and attempted to cope by increasing their adult and child labour supply. The mechanisms at play include the intensity of the shock, food prices and the timing of Agatha with respect to local harvest cycles. The results are robust to placebo treatments, migration and measurement error, and partly explain the increase in poverty in the country previously attributed solely to the collateral effects of the global financial crisis.","[Baez, Javier E.; Lucchetti, Leonardo; Genoni, Maria E.; Salazar, Mateo] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Baez, Javier E.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",The World Bank; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Baez, JE (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jbaez@worldbank.org,,,,,,,15,22,25,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Institutions tend to stay away from the stocks with extremely low and extremely high levels of firm-specific uncertainty because of their desire to hedge against aggregate volatility risk or exploit their competitive advantage in obtaining and processing information, coupled with the dislike of idiosyncratic risk. Thus, the spread in uncertainty measures is wider for low IO stocks, and the same is true about the differential in aggregate volatility risk.","[Barinov, Alexander] Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Business Adm, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Barinov, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Sch Business Adm, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",abarinov@ucr.edu,,"Barinov, Alexander/0000-0003-1199-3274",,,,,30,8,10,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

The paper deals with the systemic approach to the analysis of foreign authors from various perspectives related to the world experience of introducing the Internet banking in the banking sector. The authors illustrate domestic expertise of development and introduction of banking services for remote customer service in Bashkortostan. It is noteworthy that various banks apply different approaches to the introduction of the Internet banking service in the customer base. The method of statistical analysis was implemented during the study, thus revealing the proportion of the Internet banking users in the total number of users with various incomes per capita in a family. It is specified that the vast majority of people applying the Internet banking are people with the average level of income, high income and low income. It is shown that there is a direct dependence between the experience of the Internet banking user and frequency of using this service. The majority of operations account for regular payments such as mobile communications, the Internet, transfers between accounts within the bank and payment of utilities. However, in spite of this fact, there are still restrictions and drawbacks while exploiting the systems that should be improved.","[Bayguzina, Lyuza; Galimova, Guzaliya] Bashkir State Univ, Dept Finance & Taxat, Inst Econ Finance & Business, Ufa, Russia",Ufa University of Science & Technology,"Bayguzina, L (通讯作者)，Bashkir State Univ, Dept Finance & Taxat, Inst Econ Finance & Business, Ufa, Russia.",Lyuzab@mail.ru; ggalimova02@yandex.ru,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,47,51,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600008,0

The interviewed were entrepreneurs and managers of selected SMEs, and the survey was done in a questionnaire format. The obtained results were processed using the chi-square and Z-score. It was concluded by this research that entrepreneurs put a large emphasis on cooperation with commercial banks; however, they do not consider credit conditions favorable. Larger and older enterprises view credit conditions as favorable to a greater degree. It was also concluded that entrepreneurs with a college education and larger enterprises view credit conditions as favorable.

From the publishing of the Social Insurance Law to today, in one hand, it makes great progress on legislation, enlarges the scale of its benefiting, and improves the social security system. In other hand, it is clear that there is no the matching system that the rules of the law are not clear and the supervisions are missing. So the advantage and disadvantage of social security is clear. Therefore, in fact, there are many unreasonable and unscientific defects when the law is implementing, the law is not synchronous with reality, and it not only is far away from reaching the goal of scientific legislation, but also damages the benefit of people.

To put the social security into laws is the way to safeguard the benefit of the citizen by compulsive legal method. It can improve the functions of the social insurance system and its credibility, and it is the expression of improving the legislation as well.

Margolis et al. (2007) observed that the mechanisms connecting prior corporate financial performance (CFP) to subsequent CSP is an important issue for further investigation. In this study, we examine whether different states of cash flow liquidity impact the extent of a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. If firms perform well in CSP, we assume they have greater cash flow liquidity as measured by the KZ index and Altman's Z-score. We posit that firm engagement in CSR is negatively linked with financial constraint dummies, which are computed as above 20% on the KZ index, or an Altman's Z-score below 1.81. In this study, we compute the ratio of CSR strengths to concerns for each firm, which allows us to assign a specific CSR 'Focus' for each sample firm. Based on data from MSCI ESG STATS ratings, all firms are divided into seven focuses: an Environment Focus (ENV), a Community (COM) Focus, an Employee (EMP) Focus, a Diversity (DIV) Focus, a Product (PRO) Focus, a Governance (CGOV) Focus and a Human Rights (HUM) Focus. Furthermore, a multiple logit regression is conducted based on these seven focuses to examine the impact of financial constraints/liquidity proxies on firms with different CSR focuses. Our results confirm a significant negative association between CSR activities and the degree of financial constraints/distress. Our finding confirms the view of Campbell (2007). For the CSR focuses, we find that in general firms facing financial constraints do not engage in any CSR activities, especially when the degree of financial constraints is assessed by the KZ index. Our findings are robust using various CSR measures and financial constraint measures, and potentially useful to market participants when making investment decisions. Our findings also provide greater understanding of the characteristics of CSR firms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The traditional way is traders can carry into the market when the spread out of the reasonable scope. When the price back to normal levels, unwinding operation and complete an arbitrage process. However, spreads of soy oil and palm oil does not meet the stability, so we need to test cointegration model residual error after regression, combined with the maximization of expected return to determine the arbitrage opportunity. In traditional cointegration model, long-term equilibrium relationship is y(t) = 3070.8 + 0.50x(t). When the residual absolute value is greater than 61.125, arbitrageurs may take positions into the market, until the residual back to a reasonable range. However the traditional cointegration model without considering the estimation error, and estimated parameter has high sensitivity. So we will use the bayesian method to estimate parameters, we get the Bayesian-cointegration is y(t) = 3071 + 0.54x(t). The residual under this model is stable. Therefore, we can find arbitrage opportunities through the model.

We first assume that consumption utility is linear and demonstrate that the propensity to take up insurance is increasing with the loss probability. This finding explains the puzzle that people are not willing to take up subsidized disaster insurance but want to take up insurance for modest risk at highly loaded premiums. In the extreme cases, everyone will buy insurance for almost certain loss at fair premium but nobody will pay fair premium to buy insurance for nearly impossible loss events. To make the expositions more general, we relax the consumption utility to be quadratic and get similar results by numerical analysis.

Information forms the basis of anticipating future economic trends, timely adoption of adequate business decisions, and ensuring the survival, growth and development of the company in turbulent economic conditions. The most important source of information for managing business processes and activities of the company is the accounting information system (RIS). It represents the central part of the information system of the company, because it summarizes the data of all functions into a unique set of benchmarks that is suitable for use by the management of all hierarchical levels. In doing so, manufacturing companies have the most complex RIS organization. On the other hand, the management of manufacturing companies has a need for a wider range of accounting information than is the case in other economic activities. The research hypothesis proved in the paper reads: A higher degree of use of accounting information in business decision-making has a positive impact on the net profit margin from business activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina manufacturing enterprises.. In addition to the above, we will investigate whether there are differences in the level of use of accounting information in the Bosnia and Herzegovina manufacturing companies in terms of the size criteria. The research sample includes 110 profitable production companies from Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbian Republic. Hypothesis testing will be performed with an alpha level of confidence of 95%, using correlation and regression analysis, as well as descriptive statistical processing.

The formation of a single European market permit the usage of comparative advantage in agriculture and favor of those who have better geographical and soil and climate position Increasing the participation of Slovakia in the EU single market requires to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the agri-food sector. This also applies to restructuring and risk diversification of agricultural production. Long represented crops on arable land in marginal areas in Slovakia are being replaced by innovative businesses to medicinal herbs, soft fruit plantations as well as others on the market desired products. Important role should play also non-traditional Black Chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa). According to some sources Chokeberry is seen as a new superfood. Chokeberry fruits have great potential in the future of a healthy diet, and chokeberry can be grown even in areas to an altitude of 1 000 m. It does not freeze even at - 37o C. There exist a real assumptions that there will be a demand for Chokeberry and that the soil contained in unfavorable marginal conditions of Slovakia will be used more efficiently. In the past, Chokeberry was grown mainly in Eastern European countries. Especially after 1940, Chokeberry began to grow more in the Soviet Union, with the 18 000 ha of its plantation, mainly used for the production of vitamin C. The second country with 5 000 ha of this kind of crop was Poland. Subject of a scientific paper is dedicated to the model of plantations while production parameters and valuation inputs and outputs are applied to the environment of farms in mountain and foothill areas of Slovakia. Traditional methods for assessing the economic efficiency of production of agricultural commodities (indicators of profitability, cost performance) and their mutual comparison are used in analytical validation. The main methods of returns evaluation of costs to establish the orchard are dynamic methods for assessing the economic efficiency of investments. The research results bring indicators of economic efficiency of cultivation Black Chokeberry. Interesting conclusions are comparison of economic indicators which evaluate the cultivation of Chokeberry and conventional agricultural crops. Contributions highlight the possibility of substitution of conventional crops grown on arable land by Chokeberry plantations. From the perspective of investors is interesting the pessimistic scenario of techno-economic evaluation of chokeberry plantations. Internal rate of return exceeds more than 10% return on invested capital into the business in the seventh year of planting the orchard. If the initial investment expenditure is higher on investment in network protection against air raid of birds, value of internal rate of return may be higher than 20%. Research results are interesting also because of their practical relevance in terms of agricultural holdings.","[Gurcik, Lubomir; Porhajas, Viktor; Bajusova, Zuzana] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Gurcik, L (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",lubomir.gurcik@uniag.sk; viktor.porhajas@uniag.sk; bajusova.spu@gmail.com,"Bajusova, Zuzana/E-5560-2019","Bajusova, Zuzana/0000-0002-1960-5750",,,,,11,1,1,1,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,88,94,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400011,0

We build on the theoretical model of Markusen and Venables (1999) and modify it to better reflect reality and to capture international industrial linkages. For empirical part we build a unique and large database that covers 30 European countries over 2001 - 2013. Rich data are combined from the Amadeus, UN Comtrade and BACI sources. Our results do not show evidence for a pure spillover effect when other channels are controlled for. However, on a more detailed level we show that MNE's presence significantly affects domestic firms both in terms of changing market structure and productivity improvements. On other hand, change in sourcing patterns often results in that domestic firms are crowded-out. However, those domestic firms, that are able to withstand this double competition, receive additional benefits stemming from their interaction with downstream MNEs in form of productivity spillovers. We also document existence of trade (export) spillovers for both upstream and downstream levels. Despite that impact of the MNEs presence is not unambiguous the existence of positive production and trade spillovers is overwhelming.","[Hanousek, Jan] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kocenda, Evzen] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vozarova, Pavla] Czech Tech Univ, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Czech Technical University Prague,"Hanousek, J (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Hanousek, Jan/H-2879-2014; Kocenda, Evzen/R-9674-2017; Vozárová, Pavla/AAP-8093-2020; Vozárová, Pavla/HCH-8508-2022; Hanousek, Jan/HOC-4951-2023","Kocenda, Evzen/0000-0003-4110-1169; Hanousek, Jan/0009-0006-3997-5931",,,,,45,1,1,0,0,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-32-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,71,116,,10.20472/EFC.2017.007.006,0.0,,,46,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6MP,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854900006,0

Knowledge of the enterprise's value is required to make rational decisions in terms of evaluating its efficiency and investment attractiveness as well as assessing its development prospects; the role of strategic analysis in the process of enterprise valuation has a great significance in terms of determination of total profit potential. Profit potential consists of internal and external potential. External potential is expressed by opportunities and risks arising from the business environment, which the enterprise has to face. Internal potential of the enterprise is the ability to take advantage of opportunities and to resist risks arising from the external environment. The characteristic features of internal potential of the enterprise are its strengths and weaknesses.

And most of them do so. However, some decide not to and they do so for obvious reasons. The efforts to increase the tax compliance has recently translated into an effort to decrease the number of hours spent by taxpayers complying and in efforts to increase public awareness of the taxation system in general, while at the same time ensuring that the deliberate fraudulent behavior is forcefully sanctioned. The only obvious tool available for tax authorities to fight tax evasion, decrease the time spent complying and increase the overall trust of the taxpayers in the tax system at minimum cost is the use of skillful and user friendly technology tools. Having the above in mind, this paper aims to analyze the impact that technology might have in fighting tax evasion in Romania. In order to do so, we will have to introduce the Romanian tax system and the main elements of the tax evasion in Romania. Then, we will introduce several other taxation systems in the OECD which are similar to the Romanian taxation system who have introduced technology tools to enhance tax compliance in areas dominated by tax evasion and their results. Lastly, the paper will present the pros and cons of each technology-based system and will conclude whether the use of technology tools can also be envisaged by the Romanian authorities. The results of this study are quite fascinating, namely that similar and even more underdeveloped countries have successfully reduced tax evasion through the use of technology and that Romania can also envisage implementing similar tools with great chances of success.","[Ionita, Claudiu; Ibadula, Birol; Vlad, Cristina; Brezeanu, Petre] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Romana Sq,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ionita, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Romana Sq,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.",claudiu.ionita.ro@gmail.com; birol_ibadula@yahoo.com; cristina.vlad8@gmail.com; brezeanupetre@yahoo.com,"PETRE, BREZEANU/F-9468-2012",,,,,,14,0,0,1,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,257,267,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800020,0

It is expected that microcredit increases agricultural productivity by enhancing allocative and technical efficiency and by overcoming financial constraints that reduce purchase of inputs. However, microcredit will have competing uses in the event of uninsured health shocks to the household. Using an endogenous switching regression model and after accounting for self-selection, the results reveal that microcredit has a significant mitigating effect on farm productivity losses. Thus, microcredit generates a double dividend among smallholders serving as insurance against health shocks in rural areas and improving agricultural productivity.","[Isoto, Rosemary E.] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Sam, Abdoul G.; Kraybill, David S.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Tufts University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Isoto, RE (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",rosemary.isoto@tufts.edu,,,,,,,36,9,9,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

It finds a robust and positive impact of the rural surplus labor on urban-rural inequality, which is consistent with Lewis' dual economy theory. Economic growth is found to aggravate the urban-rural inequality in the earlier period, but there is no hard evidence in the later period. This implies that China has not yet, or at least by 2007, entered the second stage of the Kuznets curve. We also find no robust evidence on the impact of the inequality on growth in either period, but find robust evidence on the impact of both foreign direct investment and exports on the increasing inequality during the earlier period, whereas no significant impact in the later period is found. Finally, the spread of education reduced the inequality in the earlier period, but no such impact is robust in the later period.","[Jin, Furong] Incheon Natl Univ, Sch Northeast Asian Studies, Incheon, South Korea; [Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Incheon National University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",kenneth@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",Incheon National University,Incheon National University,This work was supported by Incheon National University Research Grant in 2016.,,34,5,5,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a cross-sectional survey on individual investors, the study identifies active and inactive investors and then, investigates active trading by estimating binary logistic regression. Findings - Active investors in Malaysia are more likely to be male, working in non-finance-related sectors and are more experienced. The likelihood of active trading increases with the number of hours spent on researching investment, very short-term favorable unemployment and economic growth expectations (three-month) and past investment outcomes, whereas this probability decreases with higher cognitive ability and short-term unemployment expectations. Practical implications - The results imply that regulators may focus on certain groups of investors, based on the result of this study, and provide them training to reduce inactivity in this market. As active trading in response to past investment outcomes indicate rational response, regulators therefore may inform investors to learn about their ability and skill from their prior investment outcome, through educational program. Educational program may also include the role of macroeconomic indicators in active investing decisions. Originality/value - This is the first study to combine a list of demographic and socio-economic characteristics, investment characteristics, macroeconomic expectations and past investment outcomes together to explain the likelihood of active trading.","[Khan, Mohammad Tariqul Islam] Multimedia Univ, Fac Business, Melaka, Malaysia; [Tan, Siow-Hooi; Chong, Lee-Lee] Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Cyberjaya, Malaysia",Multimedia University; Multimedia University,"Khan, MTI (通讯作者)，Multimedia Univ, Fac Business, Melaka, Malaysia.",tariqul.islam@mmu.edu.my,"Khan, Mohammad Tariqul Islam/P-8957-2019; Chong, Lee Lee/AAW-2248-2020; Tan, Siow-Hooi/AAG-1696-2020","Khan, Mohammad Tariqul Islam/0000-0002-9747-5728; Chong, Lee Lee/0000-0003-0041-7829; Tan, Siow-Hooi/0000-0001-6366-5606","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [EP20101103001]","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme","Financial support provided by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (Grant No. EP20101103001) is gratefully acknowledged by the authors.",,40,4,4,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Using a spatial econometric model it has been confirmed that related variety plays a significant role in employment growth in creative industries, while significance of unrelated variety has not been confirmed. In other words, the districts specialising in different, but at the same time cognitively and technologically related creative sectors, have achieved higher employment growth in comparison to those specialising either in one selected creative sector, or in unrelated sectors. Moreover, the results indicate that knowledge spillover effect in creative industries is configured more locally what emphasizes the importance of a local level in the process of knowledge creation and its spillover.","[Klasova, Slavka; Korobanicova, Iveta; Burger, Peter] Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Klasova, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosiciach, Ekon Fak, Kosice, Slovakia.",slavka.klasova@tuke.sk; iveta.korobanicova@tuke.sk; peter.burger@tuke.sk,"Korobanicova, Iveta/L-6041-2017; Klasová, Slávka/AAH-3713-2019; Burger, Peter/AAH-4330-2019","Burger, Peter/0000-0002-7512-4660",,,,,39,0,0,1,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The Triangle Model of Responsibility proposed by Schlenker precisely forecasts and explores a participant's sense of responsibility. Based on the Model, this research maintains that, in college English teaching, teachers' sense of responsibility is determined by three factors: recognition of their identities as teachers, teaching regulations and teaching activities. And the Model also yields great implications for researches into college English teachers' sense of responsibility. People get used to exploring the connotation of responsibility from legal and moral perspectives. Similarly, college English teachers' responsibility can also be interpreted both legally and morally. The so-called legal responsibility refers to the obligations that teachers must perform as specified in laws and regulations. Moral responsibility indicates that college English teachers should not only play such roles as gardeners or candles defined by the society, but also must recognize teaching as a profession and observe restrictions on their behaviors in performing their professional duties. Setting college English teachers' responsibility at the moral respect, this research will mainly explore how to motivate and actualize college English teachers' sense of responsibility in their teaching practice.","[Lu, Tuanhua] Xianyang Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Xianyang 712000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xianyang Normal University,"Lu, TH (通讯作者)，Xianyang Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Xianyang 712000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,Project of Talents of Xianyang Normal University [XSYQL201510]; 13th Five-Year Plan Fund of Educational Scientific Research of Shaanxi Province [SGH17H179],Project of Talents of Xianyang Normal University; 13th Five-Year Plan Fund of Educational Scientific Research of Shaanxi Province,[Fund Source]This paper is funded by the Project of Talents of Xianyang Normal University (No.: XSYQL201510).

The belief is that crop diversification is an effective strategy for dealing with a variety of issues, including poverty alleviation. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to justify these positions. We contribute to filling this research gap by providing quantitative evidence on the impact of diversity in crop cultivation on household poverty. Using household panel data from Ethiopia we develop a diversity index to measure the effect of crop diversity on poverty status. To control for endogeneity and selection bias resulting from unobserved heterogeneity we utilize a recently developed parametric method for estimating dynamic binary response models with endogenous contemporaneous regressors. Our results provide evidence that households which grow a diverse set of crops are less likely to be poor than households that specialize in their crop production.

Social entrepreneurship is a relatively young sector. The Act on social entrepreneurship is undergoing a drafting process. One of the barriers for social entrepreneurship is the absence of this act, which is already applied in some other countries. This paper aims to identify the main barriers to the operations of social enterprises on the basis of a questionnaire survey conducted in social enterprises.

The template requires cooperation between actors and stakeholders and comprises three steps: (1) identification of needs for sustainability; (2) development of value chain practices aimed to deliver sustainable value, and assignment of responsibilities to actors for these practices; and (3) formulation of a sustainable value proposition. The template also allows a simple graphical representation of sustainability in value chains, which helps improve communication between actors, and allows stakeholders to be kept informed. The template is applied to a sustainable pork value chain to illustrate how it captures various aspects of sustainability in the pork industry.","[Monastyrnaya, Elena; Le Bris, Gwenola Yannou; Yannou, Bernard] Univ Paris Saclay, Cent Supelec, Lab Genie Ind, 3 Rue Joliot Curie, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Monastyrnaya, Elena] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Monastyrnaya, Elena] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Inst Humanities Social Sci & Technol, 30 Ave Lenin, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Le Bris, Gwenola Yannou; Petit, Gaelle] Univ Paris Saclay, UMR GENIAL, AgroParisTech, INRA, F-91300 Massy, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Tomsk Polytechnic University; heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM); AgroParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE,"Monastyrnaya, E (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, Cent Supelec, Lab Genie Ind, 3 Rue Joliot Curie, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;Monastyrnaya, E (通讯作者)，ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Monastyrnaya, E (通讯作者)，Tomsk Polytech Univ, Inst Humanities Social Sci & Technol, 30 Ave Lenin, Tomsk 634050, Russia.",elena.monastyrnaya@usys.ethz.ch,"Yannou, Bernard/HIK-1722-2022; Yannou-le Bris, Gwenola/L-4119-2015","Yannou, Bernard/0000-0003-4511-4450; Yannou-le Bris, Gwenola/0000-0002-3279-9473",,,,,40,16,16,2,40,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Firms compete with each other and their business ideas are no more based only on ownership of tangible assets but on applying knowledge that helps them to generate above the average profits. Intangible assets rise in their importance, contribute to economic growth and became a significant factor in increasing firm's profitability. For the reason of their intangibility, we have no satisfactory data, which allow us to manage these assets effectively. Therefore, a lot of methods for estimating the value of intangible assets have been developed. The objective of our paper is to compare three main approaches, which were used as intangible intensity indicators in last five years. We apply them on a sample of data of European companies from database Amadeus. We show that for European firms with increasing ROTA rank measure, the value of R&D expenses and disclosed intangible assets increase as well.","[Mrazkova, Silvia; Glova, Jozef] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investments, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Mrázková, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investments, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",silvia.mrazkova@tuke.sk; jozef.glova@tuke.sk,"Glova, Jozef/Z-2482-2019","Glova, Jozef/0000-0001-5972-7771",VEGA [1/0311/17],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This research was supported by VEGA project No. 1/0311/17 on Measuring and Reporting Intangible Assets,,24,0,0,3,9,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,558,566,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700058,0

Results remain robust to a variety of alternative hypotheses and sensitivity tests. This study provides evidence not only of the differential impact of depoliticization, but also suggests that the relationship between political connections and performance may be different based on bank ownership.","[Poczter, Sharon] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Poczter, S (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",sharon.poczter@cornell.edu,,,,,,,41,4,4,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

We define social ties between individual auditors and client CEOs/CFOs as working or educational alumni.' We find that clients with social ties are significantly and positively associated with abnormal accruals and the presence of reporting small profits, and are more likely to receive clean audit opinions compared to clients without social ties. Moreover, we find that the working-tie effect on audit quality is stronger than the school-tie effect. Furthermore, we find that socially connected clients are more likely to downward restate their audited earnings in subsequent years. In addition, we find that the social-tie effect on audit quality can be mitigated by several personal characteristics of individual auditors, such as partner, female, accounting major, auditing experience, etc. Overall, our study sheds new light on the impact of social ties between individual auditors and client executives on audit quality.","[Qi, Baolei; Tian, Gaoliang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Rong] Rochester Inst Technol, Saunders Coll Business, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Rochester Institute of Technology,"Yang, R (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Saunders Coll Business, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",rong.yang@rit.edu,,,"Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China [2014M562432]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71502134, 71372163, 71572144]",Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was financially supported by Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China [grant number 2014M562432]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71502134], [grant number 71372163], [grant number 71572144].",,88,6,6,2,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

However, knowledge is not always commercially exploited. The obstacles preventing knowledge commercialization are known as the knowledge filter. The literature has identified entrepreneurship as a mechanism of overcoming the knowledge filter. This article further argues that absorptive capacity is another effective factor that can solve the knowledge filter puzzle. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a new approach to measuring regional absorptive capacity and, via exploratory factor analysis, identifies two types of absorptive capacity: cognitive capacity and technical capacity. Multivariate analysis finds a significant moderating role of cognitive capacity (and to a lesser extent technical capacity) in the impact of knowledge on regional economic performance and therefore supports absorptive capacity as an effective mechanism for the penetration of the knowledge filter. The empirical results also provide additional evidence on the role of entrepreneurship in commercializing new knowledge and penetrating the knowledge filter.","[Qian, Haifeng] Univ Iowa, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, 338 Jessup Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Jung, Hyejin] Korean Univ Technol & Educ, Sch Ind Management, 415 Budaedong Seobukgu, Cheonan 31079, Chungnam, South Korea",University of Iowa; Korea University of Technology & Education,"Qian, HF (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, 338 Jessup Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",haifeng-qian@uiowa.edu; hjjung@koreatech.ac.kr,,"Qian, Haifeng/0000-0001-8371-5826",Regional Studies Association,Regional Studies Association,This research is funded by the Early Career Grant Scheme of the Regional Studies Association (Recipient: Haifeng Qian).,,55,41,44,7,57,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Meanwhile, both kinds of households experience similar reduction in incomes, and have much the same disaster coping strategies.

One of the alternative ways to finance infrastructure projects for more efficient and superior fulfillment of public services as well as promoting the local economic development is the introduction of forms of public-private partnership between local government and private sector entities. Public-private partnership suppose including legal and natural entities in performing activities of public interest of local importance on the basis of an agreement concluded in accordance with the law, under which terms public and private sector entities keep their resources for more efficient and superior supply of certain public services. In addition the private sector engages its own resources, knowledge and skills, in order to provide certain goods and services otherwise provided by the public sector. Taking into account the positive aspects of this method of financing the infrastructural projects, the research objective in this paper is considering the current situation, and the opportunities and prospects for its use in Republic of Macedonia.

However, some countries in their political decisions refuse utilization of QALYs and thresholds as optimizing criteria. The critical reflexion concerns both theoretical and experimental foundations. Based on a literary review, fundamental arguments against the concepts are summarized, and a synthesis of material objections is presented. As a whole, the critics' arguments can be judged as quite strong. Instead of these two concepts, the decision makers should consider the whole spectrum of clinical, economic, moral, political and organizational arguments, and employ also other mathematical models.","[Rogalewicz, Vladimir] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn CzechHTA, Kladno, Czech Republic; [Bartak, Miroslav] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Social Work, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic; [Rogalewicz, Vladimir] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, Dept Biomed Technol CzechHTA, Nam Sitna 3105, Kladno 27201, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Czech Technical University Prague,"Rogalewicz, V (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn CzechHTA, Kladno, Czech Republic.;Rogalewicz, V (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, Dept Biomed Technol CzechHTA, Nam Sitna 3105, Kladno 27201, Czech Republic.",rogalewicz@fbmi.cvut.cz; miroslav.bartak@ujep.cz,"Rogalewicz, Vladimír/H-6246-2011; Barták, Miroslav/N-9249-2017","Rogalewicz, Vladimír/0000-0001-5432-4148;",,,,,80,1,1,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,664,677,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700068,0

This paper outlines the procedural aspects and costs of recruiting and hiring H-2A workers. Cost data is from a 2014 survey of citrus harvesters and defines pre-employment costs as filing fees, advertising, surety bonds, travel, and housing. The pre-employment costs associated with guest workers are estimated to be nearly $ 2,000 per worker. The survey was motivated by the '60-minute rule' imposed by the U.S. Department of Labor prior to the 2012-13 citrus harvesting season. Cost data were collected across two crop season, 2012-13 and 2013-14, to analyze the cost implications of the rule. We found that the 60-minute rule significantly increased filing fees. These fees, however, represent a very small share of total costs and overall pre-employment costs associated with the H-2A program did not significantly change.","[Roka, Fritz M.] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Southwest Res & Educ Ctr, 2685 State Rd 29 North, Immokalee, FL 34142 USA; [Simnitt, Skyler; Farnsworth, Derek] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240,McCarty B 1109, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Roka, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Southwest Res & Educ Ctr, 2685 State Rd 29 North, Immokalee, FL 34142 USA.",fmroka@ufl.edu,,,USDA Specialty Crop State Block Grants through the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services,USDA Specialty Crop State Block Grants through the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services,This project was supported in part with funding from the USDA Specialty Crop State Block Grants through the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

The development process is supported by a decentralised local management unit. In the initial phase the founders of a local partnership have to make two important decisions. First, they have to lay down the delineations of their territory. Here they can either draw on pre-existing spatial entities or define a new territory from scratch Second, they have to design operational structures. In practice the management unit can be either LEADER-focused dealing mainly with programme-related issues, or conceptualised as a multi-issue and multi-fund development agency. The design of territories as well as of management structures are supposed to have an impact on the partnerships' operational effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two basic management models. It also determined whether a relationship exists between the spatial congruence and the effectiveness of management. The empirical investigations follow an explanatory sequential mixed methods procedure. The quantitative analysis is based on the midterm evaluation of LEADER implementation in Austria in 2007-2013. The qualitative part is built on expert interviews. Statistical testing revealed that spatial congruence and management model excel their impact through the latent variable institutional thickness. Local partnerships covering a territory with a higher spatial matching and running a one-stop-shop-like development agency had least difficulties to set up an effective management. The expert interviews confirmed these results but stressed the fact that governance regimes with a high institutional thickness must remain open for new actors and new ideas.","[Salchner, Gunter] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Salchner, G (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,531,542,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400053,0

This study uses data of non-financial listed firms of 8 European countries for the period between 2004 and 2015. In order to differentiate crisis impact on European countries, we divided the eight countries in two groups: (1) group 1 - Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy; and (2) group 2 - Germany, France, Finland and United Kingdom (UK). The estimation method used in this study is the GMM system (1998) estimator. Results indicate that IC efficiency of the current period has a positive impact on the financial performance. The three components of VAIC(TM) Model - CEE, HCE and SCE of the current period have a positive impact on financial performance, with the exception of SCE of that for the first group of countries has a negative impact on financial performance. Findings suggest that the financial crisis negatively affects financial performance on both groups of countries. These results may be a consequence of the reduction of demand as well as of firms' investments, namely, in intangible assets. Leverage has a negative impact on firms' financial performance of group 1, while in group 2 it can be noticed that leverage has a positive impact on firms' financial performance. This suggests that firms of group 1 may had greater difficulties in accessing credit, namely, facing unfavorable terms of credit given that the group 1 is composed by the most affected countries by the global financial crisis, which had negative consequences on the amount as well as on credit terms.","[Sardo, Filipe; Serrasqueiro, Zelia] Univ Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior,"Sardo, F (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal.",filipesardo@outlook.pt; zelia@ubi.pt,"Serrasqueiro, Zélia/J-5662-2014; Sardo, Filipe/D-8238-2017","Serrasqueiro, Zélia/0000-0003-1761-5426; Sardo, Filipe/0000-0002-2278-7161",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/04007/2013]; FEDER/COMPETE [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER/COMPETE(European Union (EU)),The authors are pleased to acknowledge financial support from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (grant UID/ECO/04007/2013) and FEDER/COMPETE (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659),,44,0,1,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,279,287,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000035,0

It is noteworthy that the magnitude of the TER coefficient remains relatively smaller as those obtained for developed country cases and samples. Interestingly the study also found the presence of a reverse causation as output appears to be also a determinant of TER. In other words, output level which proxies for the earning capacity of the economy play an important role in TER, which is mostly financed by the government in the countries under study. In addition to the national income, domestic investment, education attainment, foreign direct investment and openness level being other determinants of such TER for these countries. Moreover, there is evidence that TER encourages private investment suggesting some indirect effects of TER on output via the private capital channel.

This might be true in the countries the authors evaluated, but it certainly is not the case in Argentina, where horizontal and vertical coordination (rather than integration) is the norm. During the last 25 years the institutional environment impacted the way farming is organized in Argentina, mainly by using contracts between different players and service providers. The agricultural production sector increasingly shifted from a low to medium and to a large-scale business model, and production units expanded horizontally by means of land leases (coordination) and purchases (integration) in order to increase the scale of production and dilute fixed costs in an attempt to generate higher margins. In that sense this paper arises four questions: (1) why is it that in Argentina large-scale farming is predominantly done via contracts instead of vertical and horizontal integration?; (2) why have large-scale farming networks recently stalled or even declined in terms of area growth?; (3) how and why do these networks vary their scale of production, locations and strategies?; and (4) what can we expect in terms of evolution of different types of large-scale farming? It is observed that in Argentina there were different institutional contexts, sometimes with clearer and more stable conditions and low levels of uncertainty, sometimes with higher intervention policies and transaction costs. The paper discusses how new organizations emerged during different periods and scenarios, in a context of increased international demand for agricultural commodities. The most relevant conclusions drawn from this analysis are that, in Argentina's agriculture, there is a continuous shift from ownership to management, although consolidation towards larger scale entities has slowed down due to the existence of institutional and policy restrictions.","[Senesi, Sebastian I.; Daziano, Marcos F.; Palau, Hernan] Univ Buenos Aires, Agron Sch, Dept Inst Org & Strategy Food & Agribusines Progr, Av San Martin 4453,C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Chaddad, Fabio R.] Univ Missouri, 125 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Chaddad, Fabio R.] INSPER, 125 Mumford Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Buenos Aires; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Insper,"Daziano, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, Agron Sch, Dept Inst Org & Strategy Food & Agribusines Progr, Av San Martin 4453,C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",daziano@agro.uba.ar,,,,,,,39,10,10,0,17,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The performance of twenty-one VaR models that are generated by a combination of three conditional volatility specifications including GARCH, GJR and MARCH and seven distributional assumptions for return innovations is investigated. We implement stringent backtesting during crisis and post-crisis periods for developed, emerging and frontier markets. Results show that the skewed-t along with heavy-tailed Levy distributions considerably improve the forecasts of one-day-ahead VaR for long and short trading positions during crisis period, regardless of the volatility model. However, we find no evidence that a given volatility specification outperforms the others across markets. The relevant models show evidence of long memory in developed markets and conditional asymmetry in frontier markets; whereas the standard GARCH is found to be the best suited specification for estimating VaR forecasts in emerging markets. The inclusion of high volatility period in the estimation sample highlights the predictability of VaR during post-crisis period, where even the normal distribution rivals the more sophisticated ones in terms of statistical accuracy and regulatory capital allocation.

The article substantiates the need to take into account the diversity of models of entrepreneurship participation in the social and economic development of territories. Three models of entrepreneurs' participation in the economic and social development of the Russian Far East are possible. They correspond to three options for assessing and stimulating such participation by various levels of government. The first model has a solid legal basis. The second model reflects the results achieved in the development of entrepreneurship in a market economy. The third model is based on the current understanding of entrepreneurship. The analysis of possible models is supplemented by their synthesis on the foundation of the general economic basis of entrepreneurship. The creation of new capital is such common economic basis for entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs operating within the framework of the first model create predominantly new productive capital. For its creation, they should receive the appropriate assessment and support of the state. Entrepreneurs operating under the second model create a new capital of all kinds (productive, financial, intellectual). For this, they should receive a higher appreciation and more significant support of the state. Entrepreneurs, operating under the third model, create predominantly new intellectual capital.

Historic performance data of three stock, one governmental bond and two alternative investment indices where used to analyze these diversification effects using modern portfolio theory. The empirical analysis reveals that the performance of investments in alternatives depend on macroeconomic market factors; the commodity sector especially is harmed by recent market turbulences and the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008.

Using Random Forest (Breiman et al., 1984) to measure variable importance, we adopt the long-dated cross-country data on public debt developed by Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), which covers 66 countries in 1970 to 2012. The robust conclusions as follows. 1. Debt-related variables have higher importance on eruption of external default. 2. Macroeconomic-related variables reflecting the background of a country have higher importance on eruption of domestic default. 3. The interest payments from debt have higher importance on eruption of banking crisis. Especially, the origins of external default are corresponding with those of banking crisis. In the past, the relationship between macroeconomic variables and debt default is hard to conclude. However, we get robust conclusions, reflecting that macroeconomic-related variables, debt-related variables are indeed important origins of external default, domestic default and banking crisis.","[Ting, Chien-Jung; Wang, Ching-Shu] SHU TE Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Shu-Te University,"Ting, CJ (通讯作者)，SHU TE Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-405-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,37.0,,,,,,125,144,,,,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ9PC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429699600008,0

While brand contribution to company performance is well documented through various researches with respect to the consumer goods industries, in the case of the banking sector, the subject literature is rather scarce. The purpose of this article is to present the results of empirical research on the relationships between brand strength and bank performance for Polish listed banks. This article contributes to the development of marketing and the corporate finance theory. Research was conducted based on an unbalanced panel time-series sample of 12 banks companies and a 71-year observation of banks listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2008 and 2014. This study reveals a strong, significant and positive relationship between the brand strength index and different bank performance measures: interest spread, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), economic profit margin (EPM) and price to book value (P/BV) ratio.","[Urbanek, Grzegorz] Univ Lodz, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Urbanek, G (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Lodz, Poland.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,2,12,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,681,689,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400068,0

The main building blocks of core competences are intangibles, including intellectual capital. The utilisation and development of competences provide two sources of value creation for the company, these being: the current value of cash flows in present operations (utilisation of competences) and the value of options for the creation of new cash flows (from investments in new competences). The starting point to formulate a strategy as understood in this manner is an analysis of the structure of company's competences and their relative position against its competition, as well as the scrutiny of current and foreseen market requirements in regard to winning competences. As a result of such an analysis, it is possible to estimate the company's market competency gap and competitive competency gap. The aim of this article is to demonstrate, based on a theoretical example, the course of action which leads to the identification of core competences, underlying intangibles and intellectual capital in any given sector, and to present a method to assess numerically the absolute (against market requirements) and relative (against competition) competency gaps of the company. These measuring instruments can be applied to indicate the actions, including investments in given intangibles, which ought to be taken in order to improve the market position and competitiveness of the company. They could also be the basis of the assessment of the company's core competences. This paper contributes to the strategic management and intellectual capital literature with the proposition of a method for identifying competitive and market competency gaps.","[Urbanek, Grzegorz] Univ Lodz, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Urbanek, G (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Lodz, Poland.",gregu@uni.lodz.pl,,"Urbanek, Grzegorz/0000-0002-1372-8127",,,,,13,0,0,1,16,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,339,347,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000042,0

In our paper we consider frequency channels as investment instrument and secondary market resembles financial market. Generally, in the market are heterogeneous investors with various preferences, which lead to different patterns of behaviour. One of the most suitable tools for analyzing heterogeneity of market participants is Agent-based modeling. We analyzed behaviour of five distinguished types of investors, who are differentiated by parameter settings in Roth-Erev Reinforcement Learning algorithm.

Thus, regions where GDP per capita is low, a high proportion of people has low education, a high proportion is over the age of 65 and there is strong net immigration are more likely to be apprehensive of the European Union, be suspicious of immigrants and not want them as neighbours and, most importantly, to vote for Brexit.

Evidence supports findings from one strand of the fractured literature: the WVS-trust question captures expectations about others' trustworthiness. We further show that the WVS-trust question correlates with stable beliefs about how trustworthy people in general are. However, when subjects go through a treatment induced negative experience, WVS-trust question does not capture the immediate fluctuation in belief about trustworthiness anymore.

The most common accessibility metric, the cumulative opportunity measure, is often computed as the number of jobs that can be reached within a certain time frame. Aggregating all jobs, however, often inflates the opportunities that can be reached by socially vulnerable residents, which could feed into and/or generate inadequate policy decisions. This study therefore develops the measure of accessibility to low-income jobs for vulnerable residents by public transport, specifically taking into account realized travel times by these vulnerable individuals. This fine-grained measure, computed across 11 major Canadian cities, is a modified place-based accessibility metric that incorporates facets of person-based metrics, allowing planners and policy makers to propose more targeted interventions to improve the quality of life of their cities' most vulnerable populations. The study further allows for direct comparisons between the impacts of variation in accessibility levels between different regions to help create best practices in land use and transport planning.","[Deboosere, Robbin; El-Geneidy, Ahmed] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University,"El-Geneidy, A (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",ahmed.elgeneidy@mcgill.ca,"El-Geneidy, Ahmed/N-3904-2013","El-Geneidy, Ahmed/0000-0002-0942-4016",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR),"The authors would like to thank Prof. David Levinson, University of Sydney for inspiring and encouraging us to do this research.

In particular, we use a field experiment to assess the extent to which the introduction of this ICT platform improved monitoring by the district, effort by service providers, and inputs at service points in health, education and water in Arua District, Uganda. We find suggestive evidence of a short-term improvement in some education services, but these effects deteriorate by year two of the program, and we find little or no evidence of an effect on health and water services at any period. Despite relatively high levels of system uptake, enthusiasm of district officials, and anecdotal success stories, we find that relatively few messages from citizens provided specific, actionable information about service provision within the purview and resource constraints of district officials, and users were often discouraged by officials' responses. Our findings suggest that for crowd-sourced ICT programs to move from isolated success stories to long-term accountability enhancement, the quality and specific content of reports and responses provided by users and officials is centrally important.

Our finding is consistent with the view that CSR engagement is a strategy for firms to pursue political legitimacy from the government and seek legitimacy in general from the public.

To account for endogeneity of air pollution in the determination of wages and property prices, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in air quality induced by a policy subsidizing coal-based winter heating in northern China, and document a discontinuity in average air quality for cities located north and south of the policy boundary. Using data for all 288 Chinese cities in 2011, we estimate an equilibrium relationship between wages and house prices for the entire system of Chinese cities, and specify a regression discontinuity design to quantify how variation in air quality induced by the policy affects this relationship locally. Our preferred estimates of the elasticity of wages and house prices with respect to concentration are 0.53 and 0.71 respectively. At the average of our sample, the willingness to pay for a unit reduction in concentration is CNY 261.28 (USD 40.50), with a significant share reflected in labor market outcomes.","[Huang, Xuan] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lanz, Bruno] Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, A-L Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",Peking University; University of Neuchatel,"Lanz, B (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, A-L Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",bruno.lanz@unine.ch,,,,,,,52,17,19,2,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find that the UK has become much less integrated into global production networks than other EU countries over the period 2000-14, and is almost unique among EU countries in that the domestic content of its exports increased over this period. This reflects the relatively high and growing domestic service content in UK exports. As a result of this, reducing the UK's tariffs on imported goods is unlikely to have a large direct effect on the average export competitiveness of UK firms. Potentially more significant for the UK is how future trade barriers with the EU are likely to affect its participation in cross-country value chains that meet final demand in markets in North America and East Asia. Such indirect exports are not captured in conventional trade statistics and can only be analysed using a GVC approach. Our findings suggest that the UK will benefit only to a limited extent from bilateral trade agreements with countries outside the EU (a 'Global Britain' strategy) if it gives up its role in the supply chains that service these countries via the EU hub.","[IJtsma, Pieter; Los, Bart; Timmer, Marcel P.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Levell, Peter] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Levell, Peter] UCL, London, England",University of Groningen; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"IJtsma, P (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.",p.a.ijtsma@rug.nl; peter_l@ifs.org.uk; b.los@rug.nl; m.p.timmer@rug.nl,"Los, Bart/ABE-5900-2020; Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023; timmer, marcel p/A-7716-2008",,"ONS Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence (ESCoE); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (CPP) [ES/M010147/1]; 'The UK in a Changing Europe' initiative [ES/R000980/1]; ESRC; Dutch Science Foundation (NWO) [453-14-012]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/R000980/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ONS Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence (ESCoE); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (CPP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); 'The UK in a Changing Europe' initiative; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Dutch Science Foundation (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are grateful to Wen Chen for able research assistance.

Studies on China's experience just began to accumulate but remain inadequate given the size and speed of the country's HSR and regional growth. This paper reports a benchmark analysis of HSR impacts on travel times, accessibility, economic productivity, and regional disparity in the context of China's current growth initiative centered at city-cluster regions. The study utilized data from year 2006 without HSR and 2014 with HSR for 266 prefectural level cities and analyzed HSR's impacts at the spatial scales of nationwide, territorial regions, and city-cluster regions. In the study, travel times measured the city-to-city average travel times by rail, whereas accessibility analysis applied a gravity model of total employment. Three indicators of economic productivity were calculated: Gross Regional Product (GRP) per capita, per worker, and per square kilometer of built-up land. Finally, regression models framed around economics production theory were estimated. The main findings are: HSR contributed to travel times savings, accessibility enhancement, and productivity gain but with limitations. HSR reduced city-to-city travel times at a national average by 45% or 589 min. City-clusters in Western China, where the starting level of travel times were long, enjoyed a greater rail time reduction than other regions. HSR increased accessibility of all cities and regions; a simplified decomposition analysis estimated HSR's contribution being 25-45% of total accessibility change. Access disparity within most city-cluster regions decreased, whereas the between-region gaps remained during the study period. The study estimated HSR elasticity of GRP per capita being 0.28 nationwide. Responses to HSR varied greatly among city-clusters when measured in GRP per worker and per built-up area terms. As China's HSR network continues to expand, optimizing HSR impacts should focus on integrating fully with other transportation modes and fitting well with national and local development initiatives.","[Liu, Liwen] Jiangxi Normal Univ, 99 Ziyang Rd, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ming] Wuhan Univ, 8 Donghu Rd South, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ming] Univ Texas Austin, 310 Inner Campus Dr,B7500, Austin, TX 78717 USA",Jiangxi Normal University; Wuhan University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Zhang, M (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, 8 Donghu Rd South, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",liuliwen305@163.com; zhangming@whu.edu.cn,,"liu, liwen/0009-0007-4443-8169",Jiangxi Normal University Young Faculty Enhancement Grant; USDOT UTC Cooperative Mobility for Competitive Megaregions Grant,Jiangxi Normal University Young Faculty Enhancement Grant; USDOT UTC Cooperative Mobility for Competitive Megaregions Grant,Jiangxi Normal University Young Faculty Enhancement Grant; USDOT UTC Cooperative Mobility for Competitive Megaregions Grant.,,75,83,86,3,103,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

A clearly negative relation is found between use of the IRB approach and RWA densities, even after controlling for portfolio and bank characteristics. The jurisdiction in which a credit exposure is located affects both the use of IRB and risk density. Portfolio variables (default rate, weight of corporate exposures), and bank characteristics (book equity ratio, liquidity measures) are also significantly related to risk weights.

This assumption underlies the recovery result of Ross 2015. Following the methodology of Alvarez and Jermann 2005 and Hansen and Scheinkman 2009, we estimate the martingale component in the long-term factorization of the SDF using U.S. Treasury data. The empirically estimated martingale component is highly volatile and produces a downward-sloping term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. In contrast, the transition independence assumption implies a degenerate martingale component and an upward-sloping term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. Thus, transition independence is inconsistent with our empirical results.","[Qin, Likuan; Linetsky, Vadim; Nie, Yutian] Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, 1245 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Linetsky, V (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, 1245 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",linetsky@iems.northwestern.edu,"Linetsky, Vadim/B-7474-2009",,"National Science Foundation [CMMI-1536503, DMS-1514698]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1514698] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),This paper is based on research supported by grants from the National Science Foundation [CMMI-1536503 and DMS-1514698].,,31,6,7,2,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Despite the widespread prescription of this elixir, disagreements persist about its efficacy during crises. Much of the existing literature suggests that increasing transparency decreases information asymmetries, increases policy predictability and the credibility of policy commitments, improves the effectiveness of monetary policy, and bolsters public confidence. Each of these effects could plausibly shorten the duration of economic crises. Critics counter, however, that effects of transparency are ambiguous and may increase policy uncertainty, raise volatility, increase the prospect of collectively self-destructive behaviors, and decrease the effectiveness of monetary policy effects that could prolong crises. These debates persist in part because related empirical research tends to focus primarily on the transparency of central banks and its impact on market expectations regarding short-term interest rates without considering the transparency of national governments and how the availability of credible data about the national economy from sources other than the central bank affects public and market expectations. We argue that greater transparency of national governments - often inferred from, yet independent of, the transparency of central banks - will decrease the duration of inflation and currency crises by providing information about existing economic conditions, increasing the predictability and credibility of national economic policy, and increasing confidence in the efficacy of policy choices by demonstrating the degree to which the policy positions of national politicians and central bankers align. We operationalize government transparency in terms of the government dissemination of credible macroeconomic information using the Hollyer, Rosendorff, and Vreeland (HRV) index. Our analyses of 125 countries from 1980 through 2010 indicate that higher levels of government transparency are strongly correlated with shorter durations of inflation and currency crises and that the level of transparency is negatively correlated with the severity or size of inflation crises.","[Shambaugh, George E.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Sch Foreign Serv, 681 ICC, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Shen, Elaine B.] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, 301 ICC, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University; Georgetown University,"Shambaugh, GE (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Sch Foreign Serv, 681 ICC, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",george.shambaugh@georgetown.edu; es1044@georgetown.edu,,"Shambaugh, George/0000-0003-3607-5082",,,,,83,13,14,1,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Using unique student-level test score data and controlling for school fixed effects, we estimate the impact of a linguistic activity, which is an activity to promote logical thinking through linguistic communication, in a classroom on reading and mathematics test scores of sixth-grade students in primary schools. We find that linguistic activities improve students reading and mathematics test scores and that their impacts are substantial. We find no statistically significant difference in the effects of these activities across class sizes and cram schooling status of students.

However, little is known about the effects of life-course events, for instance, residential relocation and changes in household structure, on driving behaviour. In particular, in China's cities, massive urban renewal and residential relocation provide new contexts for transport. This paper aims to contribute to new evidences for the links between changes in car use and residential relocation by taking Beijing as a case. Structural Equation Modelling is applied to explore the effects of built environment, self-selection, and household status on car ownership and car use, and to highlight the mediating effect of changes in commuting distance on travel mode variation following residential relocation. The results show that residents make their travel choices based on their life stages, that is, the birth of kids, marriage, and a larger household size encourage car purchase and facilitate car use. The built environment variables play moderate roles in reshaping driving behaviour after residential relocation when controlling for other factors. Besides, commuting distance has marginal effects on car use and travel mode choice. More specifically, increasing commuting distance encourages the use of the metro and private cars. The present study has important implications for future research and policies aiming to discourage car dependence in growing metropolises.","[Zhao, Pengjun; Zhang, Yixue] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Room 3267,Yifu 2 Bldg,5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Zhao, PJ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Room 3267,Yifu 2 Bldg,5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",pengjun.zhao@pku.edu.cn; beckyzhang1537@pku.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Yixue/0000-0003-4040-4731",NSFC [41571147],NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the NSFC, project No. 41571147.",,117,36,38,6,62,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The paper postulates that income shifting through ITP is likely to be more pronounced in developing countries where weak institutions are present. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses a unique unbalanced panel data of 18 companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange covering the period of nine years (2008-2016), to investigate whether MNCs use ITP to shift income out of the country. The comparison is made using an indirect approach where performance (e.g. profit before tax) and post-performance measures (e.g. dividend payment) are used for an equal number of foreign and local companies. The empirical analyses include t-tests, pooled and random effects logistic regressions. Findings The results show significant differences between foreign controlled entities (FCEs) and Ghanaian controlled entities in terms of capability, profitability and dividend distribution. Since there is a positive between these measures, the results do not suggest possible income shifting by FCEs through ITP. Research limitations/implications This paper uses an indirect method of investigating income shifting among MNCs. For future studies, a more direct method can be adopted by examining import and export prices of specific products for both foreign and domestic firms. Originality/value The study investigates the possibility of income shifting arising from ITP practices among multinationals in developing countries. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first in this regard. Thus, the study contributes to the transfer pricing and income shifting literature by providing evidence from a developing country.","[Agana, Joseph Akadeagre] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Accounting & Finance, Kumasi, Ghana; [Agana, Joseph Akadeagre] Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway; [Mohammed, Abu-Khanifa] Minist Finance, Budget Div, Accra, Ghana; [Mohammed, Abu-Khanifa] Univ Dev Studies, Sch Business & Law, Wa Campus, Tamale, Ghana; [Zamore, Stephen] Univ Agder, Dept Management, Kristiansand, Norway; [Zamore, Stephen] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Agder; University for Development Studies; University of Agder; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Agana, JA (通讯作者)，Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Accounting & Finance, Kumasi, Ghana.;Agana, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway.",jaagana.ksb@knust.edu.gh; abukhanifa@yahoo.com; stephen.zamore@uia.no,"Agana, Joseph/ABC-6981-2021; Zamore, Stephen/GZA-3885-2022","Agana, Joseph/0000-0001-9538-8244",,,,,57,1,1,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The purpose of this paper is to address some of these questions in India. Design/methodology/approach The usage patterns of conventional, developed world, basic strategic marketing practices within manufacturing firms in India - one of the world's fastest growing emerging markets - are compared against the usage of the same practices among their counterparts operating in the highly developed market of the USA. The study is based on separate surveys conducted in each country. Data analyses are conducted using chi(2) tests. Findings CSMPs are being quite widely adopted in India albeit to a lesser extent than in the USA. However, several notable areas of difference suggest that some practices might not be appropriate in emerging markets due to one or more of their unique and strategically relevant situational characteristics. Research limitations/implications Low response rates render questionable the extent to which the study samples can be considered representative of the populations under scrutiny. Equally, differences in the respondents' interpretation of some of the marketing terminology used in the questionnaire cannot be ruled out. Practical implications The research confirms that Indian marketing strategists appear to judge many conventional practices to be appropriate within an emerging market environment. However, it also casts doubt on the relevance of at least eleven specific practices. Originality/value The study provides a useful starting point for better understanding the adoption patterns and applicability of conventional strategic marketing within a uniquely interesting cross-cultural context that has attracted little academic attention to date.","[Brooksbank, Roger] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Mkt, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Subhan, Zahed] Drexel Univ, Close Sch Entrepreneurship, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Calderwood, Richard John] Univ Waikato, Fac Educ, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Waikato; Drexel University; University of Waikato,"Brooksbank, R (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Mkt, Hamilton, New Zealand.",rogerb@waikato.ac.nz,"Calderwood, Richard/ABC-3705-2021",,,,,,95,4,4,1,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Design/methodology/approach This study applies a combination of GARCH models and event study techniques. Findings This study shows that the financial markets do not significantly react to SCR announcements, possibly because these African markets are already perceived to be risky. Research limitations/implications At last, a significant portion of Africa's sovereign debt is held by foreign investors (Arslanalp and Tsuda, 2014) who commonly preclude asset managers from investing in low SCR grades. Thus, an unfavorable SCR announcement could lead to a withdrawal of these funds, which could significantly alter both fiscal and monetary policies in the economy. Practical implications SCRs is immaterial to investors holding African securities. Social implications Although financial markets are weakly responsive to SCR announcements, they appear to be informationally important in the operation of stocks and bond markets in Africa. Therefore, governments should appreciate the long-term information exchange between investors and borrowers, and the consequential nature of credit ratings in Africa's nascent financial markets in order to proactively manage the risks of negative ratings. Originality/value Studies on credit rating effects on Africa markets are rare.","[Mutize, Misheck; Gossel, Sean Joss] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Mutize, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Cape Town, South Africa.",mmutize@gmail.com,"gossel, sean/ABC-3931-2021; mutize, misheck/AAC-2855-2019","gossel, sean/0000-0002-9156-1959; Mutize, Misheck/0000-0001-7477-3514",,,,,60,7,9,5,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

However, ICT graduates' earnings fell sharply after the dot-corn bust, after which they partially recovered and then remained relatively stable.

Consistent with preference externalities in racial and ethnic enclaves, we find that greater residential segregation was associated with more African-American theater entry. Estimates from a model of firm entry indicate that residential segregation increased the variable profits of African-American movie theaters, reducing the market size required for theater entry by 13.3 percent for a one standard deviation increase in segregation. We also provide evidence that racial bias increased both variable profits and fixed costs, and on net reduced African-American theater entry. An interpretation consistent with this finding is that racial animus forced black customers toward segregated accommodations while also limiting access to key inputs for potential entrants.","[Gil, Ricard] Queens Univ, Smith Sch Business, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Marion, Justin] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Econ Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",Queens University - Canada; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Marion, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Econ Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",ricard.gil@queensu.ca; marion@ucsc.edu,,"Gil, Ricard/0000-0003-3627-0988",Koch Foundation,Koch Foundation,"We appreciate the helpful comments of Bruno Cassiman and seminar and conference participants at ISNIE 2015, IESE Strategy and Entrepreneurship Winter Mini Conference, the Mallen Economics of Film Entertainment Conference, the Catalan Economic Society, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Tilburg University, Universidad de Oviedo, Universidad Publics de Navarra, UC Santa Cruz, the University of Utah, and the Carey Business School at Johns Hopkins University.

Where social welfare systems are insufficient, these costs may fall to other family members. We set out to estimate the association between long-term care needs and family transfers in selected low- and middle-income countries. Methods: We used data from the World Health Organization's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE). Using regression, we analysed the relationship between long-term care needs in older households and i) odds of receiving net positive transfers from family outside the household and ii) the amount of transfer received, controlling for relevant socio-demographic characteristics. Results: The proportion of household members requiring long-term care was significantly associated with receiving net positive transfers in China (OR: 1.76; p = 0.023), Ghana (OR: 2.79; p = 0.073), Russia (OR: 3.50; p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant association with amount of transfer received only in Mexico (B: 541.62; p = 0.010). Conclusion: In selected LMICs, receiving family transfers is common among older households, and associated with requiring long-term care. Further research is needed to better understand drivers of observed associations and identify ways in which financial protection of older adults' long-term care needs can be improved.

The proposed model, labeled Heston++, calibrates both markets with an average relative error (on quoted implied volatilities over two years of data) of 2%, and a maximum relative error of 4%, without additional computational costs with respect to traditional affine benchmarks. Hedging performance on both markets is also drastically improved. The displacement can be interpreted as a volatility push-up reflecting expectations about a (risk-neutral) lower bound on forward VIX dynamics. Our empirical results document substantial correlation between the dynamics of the displacement and the variance risk premium, and still provide strong support for the presence of both price/volatility negatively correlated co-jumps and idiosyncratic jumps in the volatility dynamics, even when the displacement is added.

This paper investigates the effects of the NRSPI program on retirement and old-age labor supply patterns in China, using two-wave nationwide survey data. After controlling for endogenous bias by using instrumental variables, we found that receiving pension benefits from the NRSPI program can substantially increase the likelihood of retirement and reduce the number of working hours among women, even though the amount of NRSPI pension benefits is far below the minimum cost of living. Furthermore, we broke down the labor supply into agricultural and nonagricultural labor supply, and found that most of the decrease in labor supply stems from the agricultural labor supply. We also found that people from different income brackets, contribution levels, education backgrounds, age groups, and household registration statuses behave differently in their retirement and in terms of labor supply decision-making.","[Shu, Lei] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Int Acad Business & Econ, 25 Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Finance & Economics,"Shu, L (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Int Acad Business & Econ, 25 Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",l.shu@tjufe.edu.cn,"Shu, Lei/AAE-6599-2022",,,,,,39,28,31,9,88,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-828X,2212-8298,,J ECON AGEING,J.

We consider and compare the two ex-ante and ex-post tax policies in which the government chooses the optimal environmental tax before or after private firms invest fixed costs and enter the market, respectively. When the excess burden of taxation is small (large), we find that ex-post taxation imposes a lower (higher) tax level than ex-ante taxation, which induces a larger (smaller) number of firms and a higher (lower) environmental damage. We also show that the excess burden of taxation can increase the welfare, but ex-ante taxation always yields higher welfare than ex-post taxation. Finally, we show that privatization policy in a free entry market decreases environmental damage but increases welfare only when the entry cost is low.","[Xu, Lili] Dalian Maritime Univ, Econ & Trade Dept, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China; [Lee, Sang-Ho] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Gwangju 500757, South Korea",Dalian Maritime University; Chonnam National University,"Lee, SH (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Gwangju 500757, South Korea.",lilixu@chonnam.ac.kr; sangho@jnu.ac.kr,"Xu, Lili/AAY-4923-2021; Lee, Sang-Ho/E-7848-2017","Xu, Lili/0000-0001-9660-3145; Lee, Sang-Ho/0000-0002-0283-5998",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5B0059731],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2017S1A5B0059731).,,39,24,24,2,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

They have also presented some limitations. The depoliticization literature has not looked into policymakers' active allocation of responsibility for economic outcomes to individuals. The Foucauldian responsibilization literature has largely overlooked who construct(s) the responsibilization governing technique and the political process through which this technique is produced. I argue that synthesizing the two frameworks can overcome these limitations and improve our ability to analyse the current state of the neoliberal project. I illustrate my argument by analysing the case of a governmental Financial Education Department in Israel. The department was established as a depoliticizing tool in a context of a popular protest that re-politicized economic policy. Its main concern was constructing financially responsible subjects. As political circumstances changed, political support waned and the department stagnated, although it never diminished.","[Avigur-Eshel, Amit] Sapir Coll, Dept Publ Adm & Policy, IL-7915600 Sderot, Israel",,"Avigur-Eshel, A (通讯作者)，Sapir Coll, Dept Publ Adm & Policy, IL-7915600 Sderot, Israel.",amit.avigur@mail.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,66,5,6,3,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

The complexity of the phenomenon implies that a large set of policy instruments can be used to address child labor or can affect child labor. This review of 33 impact evaluations provides a comprehensive look at pathways through which social protection (credit and microfinance, cash transfers, vouchers, food programs), and labor programs affect child labor. Despite the complexity of integrating findings across different child labor definitions, implementation contexts, and policy instruments, some patterns emerge. For example, programs that address child labor by reducing the vulnerability of the household produce the desired effect. Transfers reduced child labor in most cases. Similarly, programs that help the household cope with exposure to risk, for example, health insurance, reduce household reliance on child labor. On the other hand, policies aimed at increasing adult household members' participation in the labor market or entrepreneurial activities, can generate demand for adolescent and child work. Of course, such programs are an important component of anti-poverty strategies, but they could be modified and integrated with additional interventions to ensure that they do not produce adverse effects on child labor.

This paper illustrates why ideas matter, and how they can change over time. Inequalities are reinforced when they are taken for granted. But this can be disrupted when marginalised people gain self-esteem; challenge hitherto unquestioned inequalities; and gain confidence in the possibility of social change. Slowly and incrementally, social mobilisation can catalyse greater government commitment to socially inclusive economic growth. This is illustrated with ethnographic research from Latin America, where income inequality has recently declined. Clearly, however, no single paper can provide a comprehensive account of political change in an incredibly diverse region. By highlighting some ways in which ideas matter (and the limitations of alternative hypotheses about increased fiscal space and democratisation), this paper merely seeks to persuade political economists to go beyond 'incentives'. Future efforts to tackle inequality might harness the power of ideas: tackling 'norm perceptions' (beliefs about what others think and do); publicising positive deviance; and strengthening social movements.

Central to these debates is the question of whether and how aquaculture impacts local incomes and employment, yet little empirical evidence exists on the issue. To address this question, we propose a Local Economy-wide Impact Evaluation (LEWIE) model which nests fish farm models within a general-equilibrium model of their local economy. The model is calibrated using primary data collected from 1102 households in Myanmar's main aquaculture zone, representative of 60% of the country's aquaculture farms. Using this model, we examine the impact of aquaculture on the incomes and labor market outcomes of fish farming households, but also crop farms and non-farm households in the cluster. Simulating one-acre increases in pond/plot surface we find that: (1) aquaculture generates much higher incomes per-acre than agriculture; (2) aquaculture generates larger income spillovers than agriculture for non-farm households by way of retail and labor markets; (3) small commercial fish farms generate greater spillovers than large fish farms. These results bolster the notion that fish-farming, and in particular small-scale commercial aquaculture, may have a significant role to play in rural development and poverty reduction.

In our model, executives add value to the firm not only by participating in production decisions, as do other workers in the economy, but also by identifying new investment opportunities. Improvements in technology that are specific to new vintages of capital raise the return to managers' skills for discovering new growth projects and, thus, increase the compensation of executives relative to workers and disparities in pay across executives. Our model implies that, controlling for firm size, compensation is higher in fast-growing firms and that pay inequality increases as investment opportunities in the economy improve.

Using a regression discontinuity design and data from Finnish local elections, we find that ranking first within a party enhances a politician's chances of getting promoted to the position of a municipal board chair, the most important task in Finnish local politics. Other ranks matter less. We document that the effect of ranking first is larger when there is less within-party competition, but the role of external competition is ambiguous. Our evidence suggests that the mechanism behind the rank effects is primarily unrelated to electoral incentives but rather to party-specific norms or political culture. Ranks seem to be, however, only a complement to other promotion criteria such as politicians' previous political experience or how close to the party lines their policy positions stand.","[Merilainen, Jaakko] Stockholm Univ, IIES, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tukiainen, Janne] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Tukiainen, Janne] VATT Inst Econ Res, Arkadiankatu 7, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Stockholm University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Meriläinen, J (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, IIES, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",jaakko.merilainen@iies.su.se; janne.tukiainen@vatt.fi,"Tukiainen, Janne Tuomas/JXN-2934-2024","Tukiainen, Janne Tuomas/0000-0003-2534-657X; Merilainen, Jaakko/0000-0003-4700-3850",Emil Aaltonen Foundation,Emil Aaltonen Foundation,"We thank two anonymous referees, editors William F.

To capture possible heterogeneity of effects, we use the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) for comparative case studies. The SCM allows to compare the trajectory of post-reform health outcomes of treated countries (those which experienced trade liberalization) with the trajectory of a combination of similar but untreated countries. On average, trade liberalization significantly reduced child mortality. The average reduction is around 9% ten years after the liberalization. But there is significant heterogeneity in the impact. For the cases for which the SCM could provide a reliable counterfactual, trade liberalization significantly reduced child mortality in approximately half the cases. In most other cases there was no significant effect. In the majority of the significant cases, the reduction in child mortality was more than 20%. On average, trade liberalization reduced child mortality more (a) in democracies compared to autocracies, (b) when incomes were higher and (c) when it reduced taxation of farmers.

Yet, while there exists an abundant literature on the impact of transport infrastructure investment on the overall accessibility level, very few studies try to verify the possible link between accessibility and regional economic development. This issue seems to be particularly interesting in the case of the EU's New Member States that have experienced a big push to develop their transportation networks in the last decade. Hence, in the present paper we apply the potential accessibility indicator for Poland in order to verify the general productivity effects of major transport infrastructure investments between 2004 and 2014. We find that accessibility improvement seems to be weakly but positively correlated with growth in regional employment. However, the impact on the growth of regional production is not statistically significant. We also find that, once nonlinearity is assumed, accessibility improvement does not have a statistically significant impact on urban areas. At the same time it is in fact negatively correlated with output growth in the case of rural areas.","[Rokicki, Bartlomiej] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Rokicki, Bartlomiej] Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Urbana, IL USA; [Stepniak, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Warsaw, Poland; [Stepniak, Marcin] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Geog, tGIS, Madrid, Spain",University of Warsaw; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Polish Academy of Sciences; Complutense University of Madrid,"Rokicki, B (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",brokicki@wne.uw.edu.pl; marcinstepniak@ucm.es,"Rokicki, Bartłomiej/E-9295-2016; Stepniak, Marcin/D-8582-2015","Stepniak, Marcin/0000-0002-6489-5443; Rokicki, Bartlomiej/0000-0002-8392-0536","Polish National Science Centre [DEC-2013/09/D/HS4/02679, UMO-2016/22/E/HS4/00464]",Polish National Science Centre,B.

This empirical evidence indicates that fund alpha and fund size are not independent entities. Consequently, skill, rather than being measured by the fund alpha, should be measured by the value that a fund extracts from capital markets.

We develop a three-location spatial applied general equilibrium model calibrated to the 2001 Tanzanian Social Accounting Matrix to examine the impact of various public investment programs on household welfare across this diverse geography in which production and consumption are locationally specific and transport costs support equilibrium price differences across locations. We examine how different public investment packages combined with reforms in the transport sector alter the equilibrium structure and location of economic activity. The choice of financing arrangement matters for welfare, since tax incidence, relative price, and real exchange rate movements are non neutral. We show that the distributional consequences of alternative investment programs may matter more in terms of household welfare than the direct consequences of targeting investment to particular sectors or locations. For instance, under some financing scenarios, interventions that aid agriculture may lead to decreases in the welfare of the rural unskilled labor force, because the financing mechanisms create distortions that effectively skew the terms of trade sufficiently powerfully against the rural unskilled as to outweigh the direct welfare-enhancing effects of the public investment. We also note that welfare gains are generated by the movement of rural workers out of quasi-subsistence agriculture into higher productivity jobs in other sectors and locations.

Self-control and saving habit were tested as additional factors that potentially moderate the relationship between constructs representing reflective and impulsive processes and behavior, or exert indirect effects on behavior through these systems. A community sample of 594 participants completed measures of saving intention, buying impulsiveness. trait self-control, saving automaticity, and propensity to save money. A well-fitting variance-based structural equation model, goodness-of-fit index = 0.338, average path coefficient = .119, p < .001, accounted for statistically significant amounts of variance in the key dependent variables: intention to save, R-2 = .364, buying impulsiveness. R-2 = .232, and saving behavior, R-2 = .173. Self-control and saving habit were indirectly related to saving behavior through intention, and buying impulsiveness was directly related to behavior when saving habits were low. Findings indicate strong saving habits may help to protect against impulsive spending and offer several targets for interventions aimed at improving saving behavior.","[Allom, Vanessa; Mullan, Barbara Ann; Monds, Lauren; Hamilton, Kyra; Rebar, Amanda L.; Hagger, Martin S.] Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, Hlth Psychol & Behav Med Res Grp, Perth, WA, Australia; [Orbell, Sheina] Univ Essex, Dept Psychol, Colchester, Essex, England; [Hamilton, Kyra] Griffith Univ, Sch Appl Psychol, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Rebar, Amanda L.] Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Hlth & Human Res, Rockhampton, Qld, Australia; [Hagger, Martin S.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Sport & Hlth Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland",Curtin University; University of Essex; Griffith University; Central Queensland University; University of Jyvaskyla,"Mullan, BA (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, Hlth Psychol & Behav Med Res Grp, Perth, WA, Australia.",barbara.mullan@curtin.edu.au,"Hagger, Martin S./G-5211-2012; Mullan, Barbara/E-2474-2019","Hagger, Martin S./0000-0002-2685-1546; Rebar, Amanda/0000-0003-3164-993X; Hamilton, Kyra/0000-0001-9975-685X; Orbell, Sheina/0000-0002-8665-3541; Mullan, Barbara/0000-0002-0177-8899",,,,,73,20,24,7,49,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

Efforts to enhance humanitarian accountability have historically focused on formal, technocratic processes. Scholars in other disciplines have explored non-formal forms of accountability including socializing accountability, which refers to interpersonal processes through which interdependent individuals hold each other to account. Yet little empirical data on socializing accountability exists in the humanitarian context. We draw on a conceptual framework that outlines practical dimensions of socializing accountability among networked non-profit staff (Romzek, LeRoux, Johnston, Kempf, & Schede Piatak, 2013) and apply it to the reproductive health responses in two case studies, Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar in 2008 and the Haiti earthquake in 2010. Using interviews with 96 aid workers in the two cases, we explore the ways in which they held each other to account through social, interpersonal means for the implementation of the minimum standard in reproductive health service provision. We identify new behaviors, rewards, and challenges, such as constructive criticism and overwhelming workloads, that augmented or undermined socializing accountability within the two case studies. We adapt and extend the model for the humanitarian context and propose a preliminary conceptual framework for assessing socializing accountability in a crisis response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A less recognized fact is that variation in rates of unsheltered homelessness is higher in warm places as well. We document this fact using quantile regression techniques and show that it has important implications for estimating the determinants of homelessness across communities. In particular, housing prices, poverty rates and religiosity are much more strongly associated with rates of unsheltered homelessness in warm places than in cold places. As an alternative to splitting the sample, we find that logarithmic transformations of rates of unsheltered homelessness can be reliably used in a pooled sample. Associations between total homelessness and important covariates also vary across warm and cold places, in this case in terms of both rates and logarithms. Ultimately, future research should carefully account for climate when estimating the determinants of homelessness.","[Corinth, Kevin] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, 1789 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Lucas, David S.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Univ Dr,MS 3G4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; George Mason University,"Corinth, K (通讯作者)，Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, 1789 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",kevin.corinth@aei.org; dlucas6@gmu.edu,"Lucas, David/GXZ-5135-2022","Lucas, David/0000-0002-2376-4025",,,,,31,10,15,1,13,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

We find that the effects of centralization, routinization, and formalization are broadly similar for almost all components of dynamic capabilities, and that only a few show a different pattern. Centralization and routinization are negatively related to dynamic capabilities, and formalization has a significantly positive effect. We provide insights into the role of managerial practices by explaining variation among the learning components of dynamic capabilities. This has implications for the nature and development of dynamic capabilities as well as for the routine versus deliberate learning debate.","[Arndt, Felix] De Montfort Univ, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England; [Arndt, Felix] Univ Agder, N-4630 Kristiansand, Norway; [Fourne, Sebastian P.

Recently, several states have required that online retailer Amazon collect sales tax during checkout.

The effect is stronger for large purchases, where purchases declined by 29.1%, corresponding to an elasticity of -3.9.

Using both product-level and firm-level panel data, our results suggest that Swiss exports (intensive margin) and the export probability (extensive margin) are negatively affected by a currency appreciation. However, this adverse effect is mitigated in sectors and firms that are more integrated in GVCs, which could be explained by the natural hedging of exchange rate movements. Our findings are robust to the use of different measures of natural hedging and GVC integration and also hold across various specifications and estimation methods that control for sample selection, firm heterogeneity, heteroskedastic errors and persistence in export behavior. The dynamic specifications also reveal that export hysteresis driven by a currency appreciation is a concern particularly for firms that are not established in export markets.","[Fauceglia, Dario; Wermelinger, Martin] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Fauceglia, Dario] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Winterthur, Switzerland; [Lassmann, Andrea] KOF ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Shingal, Anirudh] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Shingal, Anirudh] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland",University of St Gallen; Zurich University of Applied Sciences; European University Institute; University of Bern,"Shingal, A (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.;Shingal, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland.",dario.fauceglia@zhaw.ch; lassmann@kof.ethz.ch; anirudh.shingal@wti.org; martin.wermelinger@unisg.ch,"Fauceglia, Dario/HKN-9664-2023","Shingal, Anirudh/0000-0001-8007-7531",Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO),Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO),"We would like to thank the editor on this manuscript, Prof. Gorg, two anonymous referees, Christian Busch, Michal Fabinger, Michael Siegenthaler, and participants at SECO seminars, the Australasian Trade Workshop 2015, and the annual EEA and ETSG conferences 2015 for their useful comments and suggestions.

We build a formal model of the interaction between such communities and the alternative institutional setting based on intellectual property rights that we call Technology. The model accounts for both the communitarian social process taking place inside the community and for the presence of spillovers both across and within each institution. We prove that communities grow endogenously above a certain size threshold, and that such growth depends on supply-side mechanisms centered on the developers' social motivations and interactions. In a comparative statics analysis, we show that the community's innovative performance rests not only on its own characteristics (strength of social motivations and/or of protection of the community-produced knowledge) but also on factors outside its scope, namely, the institutional characteristics of Technology. We discuss the managerial and policy implications of our findings.","[Giordani, Paolo E.] LUISS Guido Carli Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Rullani, Francesco] LUISS Guido Carli Univ, ERShub, Dept Business & Management, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Zirulia, Lorenzo] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; Luiss Guido Carli University; University of Bologna,"Zirulia, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",pgiordani@luiss.it; frullani@luiss.it; lorenzo.zirulia@unibo.it,"Zirulia, Lorenzo/AFN-4014-2022","Zirulia, Lorenzo/0000-0002-2876-2037; GIORDANI, PAOLO/0000-0002-2192-6350; RULLANI, FRANCESCO/0000-0001-6142-856X",Italian Ministry of University Research [CUP B81J12002690008],"Italian Ministry of University Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))",The authors wish to thank the Editor and an anonymous referee for their precious comments and suggestions.

Pastoralism faces increased vulnerability to climate change, and pastoralist women are both disproportionately affected by severe drought and underrepresented in formal decision-making processes. Increased participation by women in decision-making thus promises to offer a win-win solution: greater gender equality as well as enhanced resilience to persistent drought. This quasi-experimental study evaluates an intervention that aimed to increase drought preparedness in northern Kenyan pastoralist communities through the empowerment of women at the household and community levels. It uses a difference-in-differences design combined with matching estimation to causally isolate effects of the intervention. At the community level, there was an increase in women's political awareness and participation in formal decision-making processes, but that participation did not translate into meaningful outcomes. At the household level, however, there was a large and positive effect on actions taken to better prepare for drought (which mostly took the form of pre-emptive livestock sales). Given the entrenched gender roles related to livestock sales in this setting, this finding is encouraging and warrants further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The consequences of this preoccupation have escaped the attention of scholars however, a lacuna that this article addresses. Through ethnographic research of sites of state led welfare and community driven development in Medan, Indonesia, I trace the emergence of a moral logic characterised by bagi-bagi, or development as a share. National anti-corruption discourses, lived experiences of petty corruption, and the failures of development projects to bring meaningful benefits encourage various stakeholders to manoeuvre to get a share, or take their part from the resources that flow from the state. The impact of this logic exceed its practices, however. I advance the concept of moral atmosphere to reveal the emotional and affective consequences, the ways the ever-present possibility of bagi-bagi permeates development encounters and marks individuals as objects of suspicion. Through the empirical material, I demonstrate the ways the moral atmosphere of bagi-bagi influences subjectivities, social relations, and the distribution of resources, and hence the importance of examining it as an element of the development arena.

The effects are especially large for speculative-grade and short-maturity bonds.

This is consistent with the Paris Declaration as well as SDG 5 on gender equality and women's empowerment. Critics have argued, however, that REDD+ design, both in policy and projects, does not take gender into account effectively, rather marginalizing women from decision making processes and exacerbating inequalities. Most of that research has been site specific or on single countries. This article uses data from a longitudinal study of subnational REDD+ initiatives in six countries to analyze their gendered impact on perceived wellbeing. Comparative research on subjective wellbeing was conducted at 62 villages participating in 16 REDD+ initiatives and 61 control villages at two periods in time, using a before-after-control-intervention (BACI) design. Focus groups with villagers (68% male) and women (100% female) permit a gendered comparison of definitions of wellbeing and outcomes of initiatives. The results highlight that while definitions of wellbeing overlapped between the two groups, almost half of the women's focus groups thought that having their own source of income was important. Outcomes regarding wellbeing change suggest that perceived wellbeing decreased in REDD+ villages both for villagers as a whole and for women, relative to control villages, but the decrease was much worse for women - a decrease that is significantly associated with living in a REDD+ village. These declines may be due to unrealized expectations for REDD+, combined with little attention to gender in REDD+ initiatives, in spite of an important portion (46%) of specific interventions that women view positively. These interventions provide insights into potential ways forward. Overall, however, REDD+ initiatives appear to be repeating past mistakes, with insufficient attention to gender equality and safeguarding women's rights. More effort needs to be paid to ensuring that gender is an integral part of future initiatives to combat climate change in rural communities. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

I use a sample of closed-end funds to show that internal, within-board connections are also significant determinants of shareholder value. I find that boards with shared education, employment, and family backgrounds exhibit lower market values, higher expense ratios, higher director compensation levels, and an increased likelihood of financial misrepresentation. Director turnover is lower within these boards, and new director appointments are more likely to share connections with incumbent directors. I conclude that internal board networks negatively impact a firm's governance environment and overall monitoring quality.","[Souther, Matthew E.] Univ Missouri, Robert J Trulaske Sr Coll Business, 327 Cornell Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Souther, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Robert J Trulaske Sr Coll Business, 327 Cornell Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",,,,,,,,62,9,10,13,66,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-4101,1879-1980,,J ACCOUNT ECON,J.

Panel data from six regions in Botswana (period 19792012) is analyzed with a stochastic output distance function and inefficiency effects model. We decompose agricultural output growth into; total factor productivity (TFP) and changes in input use (factors of production). TFP is further decomposed into scale effects, technical efficiency and technological change. The results show that over the study period agricultural output grew at a very low rate of 0.072 percent per year, which is largely due to a growth in factors of production at 0.071 percent per year rather than TFP growth (which declined at 0.003 percent per year). We found that the decline in productivity has been due to technological regress and low growth in technical efficiency and scale efficiency. Policy options aimed at improving agricultural productivity and output growth will require the strengthening of extension services; improving the agronomic and husbandry management skills of farmers through training; and by encouraging fanners to adopt and utilize technologies that have been provided under existing policy programs.","[Temoso, Omphile; Hadley, David; Villano, Renato] Univ New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia",University of New England,"Temoso, O (通讯作者)，Univ New England, UNE Business Sch, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",otemoso2@une.edu.au,"Hadley, David/C-5924-2008; Villano, Renato Andrin/I-3680-2017; Temoso, Omphile/R-2392-2017","Hadley, David/0000-0001-8634-2586; Villano, Renato Andrin/0000-0003-2581-6623; Temoso, Omphile/0000-0002-3327-0467",,,,,49,6,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We introduce a novel risk-sharing mechanism that incorporates nominal loss-aversion in two ways. First, the system avoids out-of-pocket wealth transfers by sharing only a fraction of positive returns over a high-water mark of pension assets. Secondly, payments from a generation insurance fund are targeted at nominal pension shortfalls below a reference point, which mitigates the loss experience at retirement. From a simulation of overlapping generations with stochastic asset returns and interest rates we find that the generation insurance scheme outperforms a pure individual retirement scheme by a significant margin: a similar risk of pension shortfall can be achieved with a contribution rate that is up to 20% lower. The efficiency gains vary with the extent of risk sharing over generations but remain large for sensible parameter values. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Studying the evolution of coagglomeration patterns, we show that the type of agglomeration that benefits firms has drastically changed over the course of a century and differs markedly across industries. Whereas, at the beginning of the twentieth century, industries tended to colocate with their value chain partners, in more recent decades the importance of this channel has declined and colocation seems to be driven more by similarities in industries' skill requirements. By calculating industry-specific Marshallian agglomeration forces, we are able to show that, today, skill-sharing is the most salient motive behind the location choices of services, whereas value chain linkages still explain much of the colocation patterns in manufacturing. Moreover, the estimated degrees to which labor and input-output linkages are reflected in an industry's coagglomeration patterns help improve predictions of city-industry employment growth.

However, these studies ignore the fact that migration will be dampened by changes in wage rates and housing prices as a result of migration. In this study, we apply a novel approach of linking a residential sorting model to an interregional computable general equilibrium model of the United States to capture wage and housing price feedbacks to assess the economic impacts of climate-change-induced migration. We find that endogenizing wages significantly dampens migration patterns. However, there are significant positive impacts on gross regional product and consumption in the Northeast, West, and California at the expense of the South and Midwest. In addition, wage effects are found to dominate housing price and climate effects, which results in larger welfare changes.","[Fan, Qin] Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Econ, 5245 N Backer,MS-PB20, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Fisher-Vanden, Karen] Penn State Univ, Environm & Resource Econ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Klaiber, H.

Using descriptive statistics in combination with OLS modelling, the paper analyses the intra-urban employment growth by workplace in regard to the opening of the Copenhagen Metro in 2002. The study identifies strong employment growth in the case of Copenhagen and higher employment growth in metro-served areas compared to non-metro-served areas in the first ten years after the opening of the Metro. The study also finds that when zooming in on the local scale, employment growth has been unevenly distributed along the metro corridor leading to a spatial restructuring of intra-urban employment patterns. This highlights that geographical scale and time is of critical importance when addressing the development of employment in areas that have witnessed investment in infrastructure.

Fluid intelligence provides traders with computational skills necessary to draw a statistical inference. Cognitive reflection helps traders avoid behavioral biases and thereby extract signals from market orders and update their prior beliefs accordingly. ToM describes the degree to which traders correctly assess the informational content of orders. We show that cognitive reflection and ToM are complementary because traders benefit from understanding signals' quality only if they are capable of processing these signals.","[Corgnet, Brice] GATE L SE, EMLYON Business Sch, Ecully, France; [Desantis, Mark; Porter, David] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; emlyon business school; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Corgnet, B (通讯作者)，GATE L SE, EMLYON Business Sch, Ecully, France.",,"Porter, David/R-7202-2019; Corgnet, Brice/G-7917-2017","Corgnet, Brice/0000-0003-0086-8523",LABEX CORTEX,LABEX CORTEX,"Brice Corgnet is with EMLYON Business School, GATE L-SE.

As such, several experiments have documented the degree of prudence, temperance, and, to a lesser extent, edginess and bentness that laboratory subjects exhibit. More recently, researchers have argued that higher order risk preferences generally conform to mixed risk-averse and mixed risk-loving patterns that arise from a preference for disaggregating or aggregating harms, respectively. This article examines the robustness of this pattern in three ways. First, it attempts to directly replicate previous results with compound lotteries over monetary outcomes. Second, it compares behavior in compound lotteries with behavior in reduced-form lotteries. And third, it evaluates choices over monetary and nonmonetary risks. While previous results are replicated for compound lotteries over monetary outcomes and aggregate behavior with reduced-form lotteries has a similar pattern, individuals clearly treat compound and reduced-form lotteries differently. Further, behavior differs between monetary and nonmonetary outcomes.","[Deck, Cary; Schlesinger, Harris] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Deck, Cary] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Deck, Cary] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Deck, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.;Deck, C (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",cdeck@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,22,17,17,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

This presents a significant opportunity to reimagine how tram corridor streetscapes can function as places that build upon neighbourhood identity and sustain local economic activity. However, the literature on the connection between transport infrastructure and place quality is small and relatively new. This is particularly true for street-running light rail (also referred to as 'tram' or 'streetcar') infrastructure. Based on the 'movement and place' model, this research presents a new framework to define place types served by Melbourne trams, as well as the different tram link types relating to tram infrastructure used to get people to/from those destinations. It implements the framework to the network and explores variation in movement and place framework links including categorisation of links into four tram streetscape groups.

The Danish local government reform in 2007, which caused tax increases in some municipalities and tax decreases in others, provides plenty of exogenous variation, thus eliminating endogeneity problems. The results imply full capitalisation of the present value of future taxes under reasonable assumptions about discount rates. Consequently, the paper gives an empirical confirmation of two striking consequences of a land tax. First, it does not distort economic decisions because it does not distort the user cost of land. Second, the full incidence of a permanent land tax change lies on the owner at the time of the (announcement of the) tax change; future owners, even though they officially pay the recurrent taxes, are not affected as they are fully compensated via a corresponding change in the acquisition price of the asset.","[Hoj, Anne Kristine; Schou, Poul] Danish Econ Councils, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jorgensen, Mads Rahbek] Danish Minist Finance, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Hoj, AK (通讯作者)，Danish Econ Councils, Copenhagen, Denmark.",akh@dors.dk; major@fm.dk; ps@dors.dk,,"Jorgensen, Mads Rahbek/0000-0002-1600-8299",Danish Economic Council,Danish Economic Council,"The authors are grateful for comments from an anonymous referee, colleagues and the chairmanship of the Danish Economic Councils.

The effectiveness of self-protection often depends on the actions of other economic agents and can be modeled as a stochastic coordination game with multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria. We use lab experiments to analyze tacit coordination in stochastic games with two kinds of interdependencies in payoffs: non-spatial in which every agent's action has an impact on the risk faced by every other agent, and spatial in which agents only impact the risk faced by their immediate neighbors. We also compare behavior in the stochastic games to deterministic versions of the same games. We find that coordination on the payoff-dominant equilibrium is significantly easier in the deterministic games than in the stochastic games and that spatial interdependencies lead to greater levels of coordination in the deterministic game but not in the stochastic game. The difficulty with coordination observed in the stochastic games has important implications for many real-world examples of interdependent security and also illustrates the importance of not relying on data from deterministic experiments to analyze behavior in settings with risk.","[Kroll, Stephan] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Shafran, Aric P.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, Orfalea Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",Colorado State University; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Kroll, S (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",stephan.kroll@colostate.edu; ashafran@calpoly.edu,,,"Rocky Mountain Research Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture","Rocky Mountain Research Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service)","This research was supported in part by funds provided by the Rocky Mountain Research Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.",,27,3,4,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

It draws from an analysis of variegated union strategies in the Mercedes-Benz-Vitoria Global Value Chain (MBV-GVC), located in the autonomous community of the Basque Country (north Spain). More concretely, it explains how the recurring adoption of micro-corporatist strategies at the car assembly plant undermined and fragmented working conditions whilst, in sharp contrast, the adoption of confrontational strategies in supplier companies led to the empowerment of the workforce, increasing salaries of new entrants well above new assembly workers'. This occurred parallel to Basque unions' challenge of prevailing institutionalised forms of collective bargaining, especially by questioning the power that Provincial Metal Sector Agreements have in the regulation of salaries and working conditions of medium and small (non-unionised) companies. Thus, in exploring how Spanish and Basque trade unions' strategies produced different institutional settings, this article argues that IPEL approaches are helpful in providing complex and nuanced accounts of the uneven development of capitalism as a result of labour's agency.","[Las Heras, Jon] Univ Manchester, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Las Heras, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",jonlasheras@linuxmail.org,"HERAS, JON LAS/K-9559-2019","HERAS, JON LAS/0000-0001-9148-2516",,,,,90,11,11,1,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Drawing on a critical institutionalist perspective, this article analyzes the marketization of corporate control against the backdrop of the structural problem of overaccumulation and locates the variegated trajectory of marketization in the specific interplay between the state and different capital fractions. This article focuses on Serbia and Turkey. Serbia has witnessed a substantial marketization of corporate control which comprises the adoption of (foreign) investor friendly market-enabling regulations and a growing number of majority acquisitions which were often followed by efficiency-oriented restructurings. By contrast, in Turkey, state capital alliances hampered the marketization of corporate control, and advocated for regulations which still allow for the selective prioritization of certain capital fractions.","[Maisenbacher, Julia] Univ Lausanne, IEPHI Dept, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Maisenbacher, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, IEPHI Dept, Quartier UNIL Mouline, Batiment Geopolis, Lausanne, Switzerland.",Julia.Maisenbacher@unil.ch,,,,,,,83,2,2,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

We use MSA fixed effects to capture geographic heterogeneity and develop exogenous measures of housing and labor market contexts using Census and ACS PUMS data. We then run a Oaxaca-Blinder style decomposition analysis to explain the race gap in household formation over this 13-year period, and conduct several robustness checks. We find strong support for the influence of economic context, with strikingly different results by race. Blacks were most sensitive to rents, which increased more dramatically for black young adults over most of the 2001-2013 period compared with whites' rents. The results also suggest that blacks were operating in strongly segmented housing markets throughout this period. In contrast, whites were most sensitive to employment rates, which decreased for white young adults over this period from 75 percent in 2001 to 70 percent in 2013. Despite their unrestricted access to the entire labor market, falling employment proved a significant deterrent to new household formation for white young adults.","[Newman, Sandra; Holupka, Scott] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, 624 N Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Ross, Stephen L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way,U-1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; University of Connecticut,"Newman, S (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, 624 N Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",sjn@jhu.edu; scott.holupka@jhu.edu; stephen.l.ross@uconn.edu,,,W.T.

We find that the stock prices of firms vulnerable to financial intermediation disruption, or firms more exposed to the government, are particularly sensitive to changes in sovereign credit spreads. This is consistent with theories in which default is costly because it disrupts financial intermediation and damages government reputation. Estimation of a structural valuation model indicates that the market prices stocks as if sovereign default has large effects on vulnerable stocks, translating to a 12% destruction of the value of their productive assets.","[Andrade, Sandro C.; Chhaochharia, Vidhi] Univ Miami, POB 248094, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University of Miami,"Andrade, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, POB 248094, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",sca@miami.edu,,,U.S. Department of Education Title VI Grant,U.S. Department of Education Title VI Grant,"For helpful comments and discussions, we thank Geert Bekaert (Editor), Brian Barrett, Stijn Claessens, Jacopo Cimadomo (discussant), Sudipto Dasgupta, Robin Greenwood, Cam Harvey, Alexandre Jeanneret, Alexandre Lowenkron (discussant), Blake Phillips (discussant), Stephan Siegel, and three anonymous referees.

Even today, the world faces the prospect of several of these crises occurring simultaneously. Yet despite their persistence, there is no agreed model for the development of famines, making it difficult to detect their emergence and to prevent their occurrence. Examining a diverse range of historical and contemporary crises, this paper argues that the evolution of famines can be identified by a set of recognizable elements: pressure, hold, self-reinforcing dynamics, famine system, and rebalancing. It suggests that severe pressure on a population, when held in place for sufficient time, leads to self-reinforcing dynamics that can eventually organize into a famine system that rapidly causes high levels of mortality, until it re-balances and collapses. It contends that this famine systems model can provide analytical insight into the development of most famines and can potentially be used to better identify and respond to these crises in the future.

We find strong evidence for prefecture-level national and club convergence in energy efficiency. In particular, the listed key environmental protection (KEP) prefectures, prefectures in central and western regions and prefectures not listed as resource-based (RB) converge faster than the non-KEP prefectures, prefectures in eastern region and RB prefectures.

The risk-diversification strategies provide insights into the vulnerability of some states to housing bubbles, and successfully characterize the recent housing boom-bust cycle.

We elicit beliefs about relative performance after repeated rounds of feedback across a series of cognitive tests. Relative to a Bayesian benchmark, we find that subjects update on average conservatively but not asymmetrically. We define individual measures of conservatism and asymmetry relative to the average subject, and show that these measures explain an important part of the variation in beliefs and competition entry decisions. Relative conservatism is correlated across tasks and predicts competition entry both independently of beliefs and by influencing beliefs, suggesting it can be considered a personal trait. Relative asymmetry is less stable across tasks, but predicts competition entry by increasing self-confidence. Ego-relevance of the task correlates with relative conservatism but not relative asymmetry.","[Buser, Thomas] Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gerhards, Leonie] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [van der Weele, Joel] Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, CREED, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Tinbergen Institute; University of Amsterdam; University of Hamburg; University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Buser, T (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.buser@uva.nl; leonie.gerhards@wiso.uni-hamburg.de; vdweele@uva.nl,,"van der Weele, Joel/0000-0002-1855-9289; Gerhards, Leonie/0000-0001-7885-1874",Danish Council for Independent Research - Social Sciences (Det Frie Forskningsrad - Samfund og Erhverv) [12-124835]; Research Priority Area Behavioral Economics at the University of Amsterdam; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO),Danish Council for Independent Research - Social Sciences (Det Frie Forskningsrad - Samfund og Erhverv); Research Priority Area Behavioral Economics at the University of Amsterdam; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Danish Council for Independent Research - Social Sciences (Det Frie Forskningsrad - Samfund og Erhverv), grant number 12-124835, and by the Research Priority Area Behavioral Economics at the University of Amsterdam.

From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the notion of flow-of-risk and provide sufficient conditions for a bow-tie network architecture to endogenously emerge as a result of intermediation. This architecture shows three distinct sets of counterparties: (i) Ultimate Risk Sellers (URS), (ii) Dealers (indirectly connected to each other), (iii) Ultimate Risk Buyers (URB). We show that the probability of widespread distress due to counterparty risk is higher in a bow-tie architecture than in more fragmented network structures. Empirically, we analyse a unique global dataset of bilateral CDS exposures on major sovereign and financial reference entities in 2011-2014. We find the presence of a bow-tie network architecture consistently across both reference entities and time, and that the flow-of risk originates from a large number of URSs (e.g. hedge funds) and ends up in a few leading URBs, most of which are non-banks (in particular asset managers). Finally, the analysis of the CDS portfolio composition of the URBs shows a high level of concentration: in particular, the top URBs often show large exposures to potentially correlated reference entities.

Additionally, exposed advisers were more likely to close. Advisers who provided services that can build trust, such as financial planning advice, experienced fewer withdrawals.

Before the reform, SOE workers enjoyed similar job security as government employees. The reform caused massive SOE layoffs, but government employees kept their iron rice bowl. The changes in the relative unemployment risks for SOE workers provide a clean identification of income uncertainty. With self-selection biases mitigated by focusing on government assigned jobs, precautionary savings account for about 40 percent of SOE households' wealth accumulation. Moreover, demographic groups more vulnerable to the reform also accumulated more precautionary wealth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The present study develops and tests an organizational capability (OC) model of the franchisor's choice of MUF. According to the OC view, the franchisor gains a competitive advantage by exploration and exploitation of firm-specific resources and capabilities. We hypothesize that, if the franchisor expects to obtain a competitive advantage resulting from higher exploration and exploitation capabilities when using MUF as opposed to single-unit franchising, the franchisor will more likely choose MUF as a governance mode of the franchise system. Based on empirical data from the German and Swiss franchise sectors, the results of the regression analysis support these hypotheses.

However, there is less empirical research on how domestic violence impacts nutrition and food security. Two pathways described in the literature are (1) perpetrators withhold food as a form violence or control, leading to poor nutrition of women and (2) women's food preparation and portion allocation trigger retaliatory violence by perpetrators. Interviews by community researchers with over 100 women in rural Bangladesh reveal a little documented linkage between violence and food practices in rural Bangladesh. I find that women, in light of the realities and possibilities of domestic violence, weigh choices about food consumption and distribution, often choosing to eat less or lower quality foods. That is, women often demonstrate agentic decision-making in a context of violence, referred to here as burdened agency. Women traverse and navigate a complex set of relationships between hunger, undernutrition, agency and domestic violence, differing from the two presumed causal pathways. Recognizing burdened agency can explain how women make decisions around food practices, and why the uptake of certain food security and nutrition interventions may be reduced. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Calibrated model results can match relations between oil prices and economic quantities, and can rationalize behavior in equity and futures markets over this period as a consequence of changing risk premia driven by an increase in long-run oil supply uncertainty.

It physically separates those who migrate from the land upon which collective processes of labour and ritual practice are often based, it affects congruence between individual and collective rationality (as migrants make the choice to maintain or relinquish community membership), and it robs communities of the adult residents who can be essential for projects of collective action. Using the concept of comunalidad, created by Indigenous intellectuals in Oaxaca, Mexico to analyse the importance of alternative practices surrounding land, labour, governance, and ritual found in the region, we show that while Indigenous villages are profoundly affected by different forms of migration, migration itself is not necessarily a death knell for Indigenous peasants. We argue that communities struggleoften successfullyto find ways to evolve and reconfigure themselves economically and politically, incorporating migration into the fabric of their daily lives and organizational structures. To make this argument, we draw on ethnographic research conducted with Indigenous Oaxacan transnational communities, both in the United States and Mexico.","[Robson, James] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Kirk Hall,117 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada; [Klooster, Daniel] Univ Redlands, Dept Environm Studies, 1200 East Colton Ave, Redlands, CA 92373 USA; [Worthen, Holly; Hernandez-Diaz, Jorge] Benito Juarez Autonomous Univ Oaxaca, Inst Sociol Res, Ave Univ S-N Ex Hacienda 5 Senores, Oaxaca 68120, Mexico",University of Saskatchewan; Universidad Autonoma Benito Juarez de Oaxaca,"Robson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Kirk Hall,117 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada.",james.robson@usask.ca,,"Hernandez-Diaz, Jorge/0000-0002-0283-4995",National Science Foundation; American Association for University Women; Inter-American Foundation; Tinker Foundation; Mellon Foundation; Government of Canada Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship; University of Manitoba,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); American Association for University Women; Inter-American Foundation; Tinker Foundation; Mellon Foundation; Government of Canada Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship; University of Manitoba,"We express our sincere thanks to the authorities, residents, and non-residents of Santa Maria Yavesia, San Juan Evangelista Analco, San Baltazar Yatzachi el Bajo, Santiago Comaltepec, Santa Cruz Tepetotutla, and San Miguel Maninaltepec for their participation in this research.

In this context, individuals who are socially embedded and exposed to the existing biosocial arena integrate macro-institutional, determinants with everyday micro-institutional settings during the life course. Drawing together institutional analysis and a life course approach, the article examines the interplay of institutions in the exposure, action and outcomes behind individuals health in two case study wards in urban India-one planned settlement, and the other a 'slum-like' settlement. It applies longitudinal methods of household survey and life course analyses of individuals reporting diseases to understand the interplay of institutions. The analysis reveals statutory rules creating boundary conditions for exposure to infection. The individuals exploit these using the socially embedded norms to contest and negotiate through coalitions and networks. The statutory rules defines the scope and outcomes of the health-seeking decisions. The study in two case study reveals that seemingly 'planned settlement' is conducive over the spread of infections than in slum-like settlement. It calls for strategic focus on improving the boundary conditions - the environmental hygiene and public health infrastructure - which might be more effective than contemporary neo-liberal techno-centric and individualized interventions. Failure to promote these actions will provide an environment conducive to the future spread of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Theoretically, it pushes for greater understanding of the socio-political struggle of individuals, rather than focusing on risk factors and dualistic nature of macro-and micro-institutions. The approach leaves room for applying situated political approach in understanding mobility and seasonality of exposure to diseases in urban regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Bidders with preemption fears are more likely to acquire target firms at an earlier development stage. However, if uncertainty is high, an acquirer may opt to wait and buy the target firm at a later stage as assets in place. The fear of preemption affects the efficient exercise of each offer differently. While the timing of a hostile takeover under threat of preemption converges to an efficient global optimiser threshold, negotiated mergers are exercised inefficiently too early. Premiums to the target firm are higher when the firm is acquired at an earlier stage, and when the bidder fears being preempted. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent with other studies, under counter-cyclical financial intermediation costs, credit easing policies aimed at reducing credit spread ameliorate the response of the economy and lead to a faster recovery. More importantly, I find that expansionary fiscal policy during an episode of liquidity trap is associated with a large multiplier effect that prevents an otherwise deeper and longer recession. Moreover, the large impact of expansionary fiscal policy is maintained even if credit policy is already in place.","[Yepez, Carlos A.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Rm 644 Fletcher Argue Bldg, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Yépez, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Rm 644 Fletcher Argue Bldg, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada.",Carlos.Yepez@umanitoba.ca,"Yepez, Carlos/AFK-8475-2022","Yepez, Carlos/0000-0001-5851-8986",UM/SSHRC TGP UM Project [47916],UM/SSHRC TGP UM Project,Financial support from UM/SSHRC TGP (UM Project #47916) is gratefully acknowledged.,,7,1,1,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

The 2003 change introduced a $4,000 payment to states for every adoption of a child aged 9 and older above a state-specific baseline. In 2008, the payment was doubled to $8,000. Using a discrete hazard model cast in a difference-in-differences framework, I do not find robust evidence that the incentives increased the probability of adoption for older children relative to younger children following the policy changes. I also do not find that the incentives affected the timing of adoption, likelihood of termination of parental rights, or the amounts of adoption assistance for older children relative to younger children. The findings illustrate the incentives are unable to help states overcome many of the challenges associated with achieving adoption for older children.","[Brehm, Margaret E.] Oberlin Coll, Dept Econ, 10 N Prof St,233 Rice Hall, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA",University System of Ohio; Oberlin College,"Brehm, ME (通讯作者)，Oberlin Coll, Dept Econ, 10 N Prof St,233 Rice Hall, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA.",mbrehm@oberlin.edu,,,"Institute of Education Sciences [R305B090011]; Children's Bureau, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services","Institute of Education Sciences(US Department of EducationInstitute of Education Sciences (IES)); Children's Bureau, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services","For helpful comments and discussions, I thank Stacy Dickert-Conlin, Steven Haider, Leslie Papke, Ronald Fisher, Michael Conlin, Jeffrey Wooldridge, Kelly Vosters, Paul Brehm, participants in seminars at Michigan State University, and participants at the 2013 Missouri Valley Economics Association.

This higher degree of interdependence and integration not only provides firms with higher access to international capital markets with lower cost of equity but also generates upward vulnerabilities for local markets due to their exposure to global and regional shocks. This article focuses on the level of interdependence across the Pacific Basin stock markets using the return spillover measure proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012), given their increasing role in global trade and finance. We are also interested in investigating the effect of shocks affecting the United States and the Japanese stock markets as well as their transmission to the emerging markets. We mainly find that: (1) the interdependence of the emerging stock markets in the ASEAN countries is driven by a higher exposure to the US shocks than to shocks affecting the developed economies of East Asia, and (ii) the cross-market linkages in the Pacific Basin region have become stronger over time, which may reduce the benefit of regional diversification strategies and expose the countries of the region to increasing contagion risk.

The Effect of Transnational Farmland Investments on the Ghanaian Economy,DEVELOPING ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Farmland investment; Large-scale land acquisition; Foreign direct investment; Economic growth,GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM-ANALYSIS; BIOFUELS,"Transnational investments in farmland in developing economies are recent and controversial. While they bring developmental opportunities including capital deepening, new technology, and employment opportunities, there are also concerns about the dislocation of local farmers and insufficient compensation for land use. This paper investigates how these seemingly conflicting effects interact in the process of economic growth by fitting a dynamic general equilibrium model to Ghanaian data. The differing effects of two common foreign investment activities, grain farming and biofuel production, are investigated. Grain farming investments tend to promote capital accumulation and increase income and consumption over the transition, whereas labor income is adversely affected. Biofuel projects induce the reverse. Results identify the relative labor intensity of technology on foreign-operated farms, which affects the returns to domestic capital and the pace of capital deepening, as a major determinant of the long-term effect of farmland investments.","[Choi, Donggul] Minot State Univ, Div Social Sci, 202E Old Main,500 Univ Ave W, Minot, ND 58707 USA",,"Choi, DG (通讯作者)，Minot State Univ, Div Social Sci, 202E Old Main,500 Univ Ave W, Minot, ND 58707 USA.",choix129@umn.edu,,,,,,,26,5,5,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We examine a new method for constructing LIBOR that produces an unbiased estimator of the true rate. LIBOR itself is based solely on transactions. We allow for fines when a bank's transaction is different than a comparison rate, which depends on the set of transactions and non-manipulated rates elicited by a revealed preference mechanism. These non-manipulated rates will always be used in the fines, but transactions may not. We address how this approach applies to potential replacements for LIBOR and other financial benchmarks, and how it works even in markets in which there are few transactions.","[Coulter, Brian] Western Univ, Richard Ivey Sch Business, London, ON, Canada; [Shapiro, Joel; Zimmerman, Peter] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Oxford,"Coulter, B (通讯作者)，Western Univ, Richard Ivey Sch Business, London, ON, Canada.",,,"Zimmerman, Peter/0000-0003-2132-0014",,,,,22,18,20,2,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

We employ cross-shareholder and stable shareholder ownership as the proxy variables of the strength of a manager's defense against market disciplinary power. We examine the effect of the proxy variables on manager-enacted corporate behaviors and the results indicate that entrenched managers who are insulated from disciplinary power of stock market avoid making difficult decisions such as large investments and business restructures. However, when managers are closely monitored by institutional investors and independent directors, they tend to be active in making difficult decisions.

These structures are characterized by different arrangements for internal rescue of affiliates against default. The cost of debt and leverage are endogenous. For moderate bailout probabilities, subsidiary structures, wherein the two entities provide mutual internal rescue under limited liability, have the highest group value, but also the highest risk taking as measured by leverage and expected loss. We explore the effect of constraints on leverage and policy implications.

In the experimental treatment, choosing an equal allocation came at the cost of not knowing the own performance, which led to a substantial increase of performance-based choices in comparison with the control treatment. The effect seems especially pronounced for women, but the gender effect is due to a difference in expectations regarding performance.

We find that although an annual vehicle registration tax reduces the incentive to purchase additional vehicles among households whose sole purpose for doing so is to cheat' the restriction (i.e., the adverse scale effect'), it does so with an external cost. The cost occurs because households whose purpose for purchasing an additional vehicle is not to cheat the restriction are given the same disincentive with the tax. We show how simple one- and two-stage lotteries can be used to not only discriminate between cheater and non-cheater households (in particular, to avoid providing a disincentive to the latter type of household), but also to provide an even stronger disincentive to the former.","[Caplan, Arthur J.; Kim, Man-Keun] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84321 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Caplan, AJ (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84321 USA.",arthur.caplan@usu.edu,,"Kim, Man-Keun/0000-0002-0205-9618",Utah Agricultural Experiment Station [UTAO1074],Utah Agricultural Experiment Station,This research has been funded by Utah Agricultural Experiment Station grant no.

The reasons are multiple and involve health, economic, social and environmental issues. City planners are implementing new urban configurations aimed at providing global solutions for environmental and mobility challenges by improving the availability and quality of the public space for walking. The aim of this paper is to provide a procedure to evaluate the impact of obstacles to pedestrian mobility and walkability - understanding obstacles as street crossings where pedestrians must wait to continue their route. The procedure combines the calculation of travel time on minimum cost routes and network kernel density estimations. The implementation of a new urban configuration in a medium sized city in northern Spain -the superblocks model in Vitoria-Gasteiz city- serves as a case study. The main results show that the implementation of the superb locks reduces pedestrian travel times by approximately 4-5%, and that the greatest improvements in pedestrian mobility due to the reduction of obstacles are found in areas in the city centre or in streets linking important residential areas with the centre. The procedure has been demonstrated to be useful for urban and transport planners to identify priority areas of action and to evaluate pedestrian movements and walkability under new urban configurations.","[Delso, Javier; Martin, Belen; Ortega, Emilio] Univ Politecn Madrid, Transport Res Ctr TRANSyT UPM, Madrid, Spain; [Martin, Belen; Ortega, Emilio] Univ Politecn Madrid, MONTES Sch Forest Engn & Nat Environm, Dept Forest & Environm Engn & Management, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Delso, J (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Transport Res Ctr TRANSyT UPM, Madrid, Spain.",javier.delso@upm.es; belen.martin@upm.es; emilio.ortega.perez@upm.es,"Ortega, Emilio/K-4931-2014; Martín, Belén/AAH-1502-2019","Ortega, Emilio/0000-0003-3495-9861; Martín, Belén/0000-0001-9709-0361; Delso, Javier/0000-0002-7921-3986",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid [RP151320028]; Department of Education of the Madrid Region; European Social Fund [PEJD-2016/AMB-2671]; Ministry of Education of Spain [FPU16/01557],Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Department of Education of the Madrid Region; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Ministry of Education of Spain(Spanish Government),"This paper was produced under the framework of the following project Desarrollo de Aplicaciones SIG para la Implementacion de Indicadores de Fragmentacion Urbana y Mejora de la Movilidad funded by the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, research project no.

Yet, if an RCT is to inform policy, it is critical to establish external validity. This paper systematically reviews all RCTs conducted in developing countries and published in leading economic journals between 2009 and 2014 with respect to how they deal with external validity. Following Duflo, Glennerster, and Kremer (2008), we scrutinize the following hazards to external validity: Hawthorne effects, general equilibrium effects, specific sample problems, and special care in treatment provision. Based on a set of objective indicators, we find that the majority of published RCTs does not discuss these hazards and many do not provide the necessary information to assess potential problems. The paper calls for including external validity dimensions in a more systematic reporting on the results of RCTs. This may create incentives to avoid overgeneralizing findings and help policy makers to interpret results appropriately.","[Peters, Joerg] RWI, Res Grp Climate Change Developing Countries, Essen, Germany; [Peters, Joerg] Univ Passau, Passau, Germany; [Langbein, Joerg] RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Roberts, Gareth] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Roberts, Gareth] AMERU, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Passau; University of Witwatersrand,"Peters, J (通讯作者)，RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",peters@rwi-essen.de,,"Ankel-Peters, Jorg/0000-0002-7835-8745","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy; Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Research of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy; Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Research of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia","Jorg Peters is heading the research group Climate Change in Developing Countries at RWI, Germany and is Professor at University of Passau.

Time-of-use (TOU) pricing-higher electricity prices during peak hours and lower electricity prices during off-peak hours-is by far the most common way to achieve more efficient levels of electricity consumption through reducing peak demand. The empirical evidence of the effectiveness of TOU pricing is sparse in the commercial and industrial sectors and there is no consensus in the literature on the statistical significance and magnitude of the effects. Applying a quasi-experimental design, this study evaluates an ongoing experiment of voluntary business TOU pricing plan by a major utility company in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Using the nearest-neighbor matching method, we identify control customers for the voluntary participants of the business TOU pricing. From difference-in-differences analysis, we find a statistically significant reduction in peak-hour electricity demand in response to the TOU pricing. We also find that there is no conservation effect, meaning that the total level of electricity consumption does not change under the TOU pricing.","[Qiu, Yueming] Arizona State Univ, Program Technol Entrepreneurship & Management, Sutton Hall 340M,6049 S Backus Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Kirkeide, Loren] Salt River Project, Dept Forecasting Res & Econ Dev, 1600 N Priest Dr, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Wang, Yi David] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Banking & Finance, 10 Huixin Dongjie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Arizona State University; University of International Business & Economics,"Qiu, YM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Program Technol Entrepreneurship & Management, Sutton Hall 340M,6049 S Backus Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",yueming.qiu@asu.edu; Loren.Kirkeide@srpnet.com; dyiwang@uchicago.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1509077]; Salt River Project CREC; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering [1509077] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Salt River Project CREC; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","We would like to thank the following individuals for the helpful comments they offered during the preparation of this paper: Aaron Dock, Kerry Smith, Michael Hanemann, Nicolai Kuminoff, Kelly Bishop, Alvin Murphy, Daniel Laney, Ryan Fulleman, Melissa Buchler and the two anonymous reviewers.

Model results show that the method of tax revenue recycling makes a difference. Either labor-tax, or capital-tax, recycling can reduce the welfare cost of a carbon tax policy relative to lump sum recycling. Of the two tax recycling options, reducing capital taxes provides the greater reduction in welfare costs. However, carbon tax revenues decline with stringent carbon dioxide (CO2) emission targets and the availability of a negative-emissions technology such as bio-electricity with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS). As BECCS expands, net carbon tax revenues peak and decline due to an offsetting subsidy for carbon sequestration, limiting the potential for labor- or capital-tax recycling to reduce welfare costs of a climate policy.","[Sands, Ronald D.] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Sands, RD (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",RSANDS@ers.usda.gov,,"Sands, Ronald/0000-0002-2864-0339",,,,,6,7,8,2,32,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Such a welfare loss may not always be due to market power, though. In particular, marginal-cost pricing would result in negative profit for the firm in the presence of economies of scale. In such a scenario, a positive Lerner index could simply reflect the firm's need to earn non-negative profits rather than market power. We propose a novel, scale-corrected price-cost margin for firms that produce in the economies of scale range. We show that this measure is more informative about market power than the Lerner index itself. As an empirical illustration, we analyze market power in the U.S. banking sector using both the corrected and uncorrected Lerner index. The corrected Lerner index reveals significant market power for U.S. commercial banks during the 2000 - 2014 period. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Its novelty lies in assessing the intermediary role of institutions and the importance of recipient and donor heterogeneity. The long-run growth effect of (aggregate) aid from traditional donors is robustly non-positive, and the indirect effect is negative. Disaggregation reveals donor heterogeneity. Chinese aid outperforms aggregate aid from traditional donors with respect to growth; however, it has a negative institutional effect. Recipient heterogeneity is largely a short-run phenomenon, with only a few countries showing some deviations from shared long-run parameter sets. Comparing donor behavior suggests that the future of aid would benefit more from focusing on quality - particularly, specialization and donor alignment.","[Wako, Hassen Abda] UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands; [Wako, Hassen Abda] Maastricht Univ, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Wako, HA (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands.;Wako, HA (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands.",hassen.wako@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Wako, Hassen/AAU-5025-2021","Wako, Hassen/0000-0002-1930-689X",,,,,91,27,27,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The presence of P2PL-based Fintech is a solution for people who have not been touched by banking but have technology literacy. Therefore, the majority of users are millennial young generation as business people. The parties in P2PL-based Fintech consist of Lenders, Organizers, and Loan Recipients. But in practice, the legal relationship that is formed between the lender and the organizer is only limited to the authorizer, then the lender with the recipient of the legal relationship loan formed is the debt payable. Therefore, the loan agreement is only between the lender and the loan recipient while the organizer as the facilitator who recommends, selects and analyzes the loan provision is not included in the agreement, so the party vulnerable to loss is the lender. Therefore the lender must be protected so that the funds are not lost due to misuse of the organizer or due to the default of the recipient of the loan. This Normative Research uses two approaches namely the law and conceptual approach. The research results are that there are two preventive legal protections for lenders regulated in OJK Regulation No.77/PJOK.01/2016 concerning Information Technology-Based Lending and Borrowing Services and repressive protection in article 37 PJOK. The implications of this research are to provide guidelines for parties in implementing P2PL-based Fintech, especially legal protection for lenders and the prudential principle of the organizers in distributing funds.","[Anita] Airlangga Univ, Programme Law, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Zulaikha, Siti] Airlangga Univ, Dept Shariah Econ, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Rofiah, Khofidlotur; Pertiwi, Risa Sari] Airlangga Univ, Programme Sci Islamic Econ, Sch Postgrad, Surabaya, Indonesia",Airlangga University; Airlangga University; Airlangga University,"Anita (通讯作者)，Airlangga Univ, Programme Law, Surabaya, Indonesia.",anita-2018@fh.unair.ac.id,"Zulaikha, Siti/AFR-1714-2022",,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,1305,1316,,10.18502/kss.v3i13.4286,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics; Religion,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Religion,BS3YS,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000716967900093,0

The aim of this paper is to evaluate, on example of the Italian First Republic (1948-1994), the hypothesis that proportional electoral systems, fragmented party systems and common coalition governments result in large-scale public pension systems. All these theoretical prerequisites of large-scale pension system were found in the Italian First Republic. Moreover, nearly for a half century, all Italian governments were led by the Christian Democracy. No real alternation of governments resulted in institutionalized clientelism. This negative phenomenon was probably one of the main reasons of extensive Italian public pension system which was the most generous in the developed world. We use comparative method, historical method and correlation analysis to evaluate the impact of constitutional rules on the public pension system on the example of Italy.

We find that rival firms increase advertising expense, and that this increase is proportional to the size of industry violators' pre-existing market share. Rival firm product-market share also increases in the industry market share of violators, and this relation is more pronounced when products are more substitutable. Rival firm operating performance also increases in proportion to the industry market share of violators. Overall, these findings suggest that the increased creditor control associated with covenant violations has a significant influence on rival firms and product-market competition.

Rather than a planning failure, I argue this is a product of state-sanctioned corporate hegemony over mining land.

These include the mapping and unmapping that render mining land terra incognita to the state while shoring up corporate power; the multiple visions and contestations over what is to be done with the land, and finally, how different and contingent temporalities shape and limit those visions in practise.","[Butcher, Sian] Univ Johannesburg, Gauteng City Reg Observ, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Butcher, Sian] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; University of Witwatersrand,"Butcher, S (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa.",sian.butcher@wits.ac.za,,"Butcher, Sian/0000-0003-4978-6991",University of Minnesota's (UMN) Global Spotlight Doctoral Dissertation International Research Grant (2012-2013) during a PhD at UMN,University of Minnesota's (UMN) Global Spotlight Doctoral Dissertation International Research Grant (2012-2013) during a PhD at UMN,Research was funded by the University of Minnesota's (UMN) Global Spotlight Doctoral Dissertation International Research Grant (2012-2013) during a PhD at UMN.,,109,4,4,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

We focus on listed firms in Taiwan, where information on directors' and officers' liability insurance is publicly available. Consistent with prior studies, we find that insured firms are more likely to use accrual-based earnings management. However, we demonstrate that the level of overall earnings management is marginally lower for insured firms because they rely less on costly real earnings management.

To achieve this goal, we first identify a methodological and empirical gap in a multidimensional approach to the measurement and evaluation of intergenerational fairness. Then, we indicate and characterize the most important and obvious dimensions of intergenerational fairness. Since we are aware of the limitation that it is probably impossible to identify all the economic and social aspects in which intergenerational relations are reflected, we focus on those which are most addressed in the literature and can be measured or evaluated. These are: pensions, incomes, taxation and public debt, education, the labour market and healthcare. We can conclude that all these dimensions are closely related one to each other. Moreover, all of them are closely linked to the life cycle theory. An important feature of intergenerational relations is their time inertia, which means that present relations (e.g. distribution of GDP between generations) determine future relations. We also see some other important aspects of intergenerational fairness that were not discussed in our paper (natural resources, housing, migration). These can constitute the subject of further conceptual developments.","[Chybalski, Filip] Lodz Univ Technol, Lodz, Poland; [Rosado Cebrian, Beatriz] Univ Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain",Lodz University of Technology; Universidad de Extremadura,"Chybalski, F (通讯作者)，Lodz Univ Technol, Lodz, Poland.",filip.chybalski@p.lodz.pl; brosadot@unex.es,"Chybalski, Filip/N-2595-2018","Chybalski, Filip/0000-0001-9555-8741",National Science Centre (Poland) [UMO-2016/23/B/HS4/01772],National Science Centre (Poland),"The paper forms part of the project Intergenerational fairness across welfare state regimes: A comparative cross-country study, funded by the National Science Centre (Poland) under grant number UMO-2016/23/B/HS4/01772.",,52,0,0,0,3,LODZ UNIV TECHNOLOGY PR,LODZ,"BIBLIOTEKA POLITECHNIKI LODZKIEJ-BUDYNEK B22, UL WOLCZANSKA 223, LODZ, 90-924, POLAND",,,978-83-7283-900-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,19,32,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470276200002,0

The growing supply of distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) from the emerging Argentinean corn-based ethanol industry is a potential feedstuff for swine producers. Using a multi-objective linear programming model, this study examined the economic and environmental concerns (i.e. cost and phosphorus content) associated with introducing DDGS in swine feed rations. Results suggest that including DDGS in swine diets concurrently minimized cost and phosphorus content. The results were extrapolated to the entire Argentinean swine industry and show that the inclusion of DDGS in swine rations could potentially save the Argentinean swine industry about 19.21 million US dollars annually and reduce phosphorus content by up to 5%. In addition, sensitivity analysis of DDGS price was conducted and the potential demand for DDGS from swine by growth category was derived.","[De Matteis, Maria C.; Yu, T.

Nevertheless, there are hardly any dairy products from pure animal welfare programs (AWPs) on the market. Although dairy farmers are a very important stakeholder group for the successful implementation of AWPs, very little is known about their attitudes toward the introduction of such programs. For this study, 258 conventional dairy farmers in Germany were questioned about FAW and AWPs via an online survey. We identified five clusters (farmer groups) that significantly differ with regard to their attitudes toward AWPs, FAW, and their own willingness to improve the level of animal welfare or take part in specialized AWPs. Cluster A consists of farmers who strongly oppose AWPs; farmers in this cluster will probably not take part in AWPs, especially because they do not consider it profitable to do so. Farmers in cluster B also view AWPs and the associated market effects with some skepticism; however, they are willing to improve their level of animal welfare and, therefore, may someday become willing to participate in AWPs. Cluster C farmers have diverse attitudes toward AWPs; since they are slightly willing to improve the level of animal welfare on their farms and as they are comparatively most optimistic concerning the market effects of higher animal welfare standards, these farmers could also become AWP participants in the future. Farmers in cluster D have positive attitudes toward AWPs and show the highest willingness among the five clusters to improve animal welfare on their farms. However, when it comes to the market effects of higher national animal welfare standards and the market potential for more animal-friendly products, these farmers are the most skeptical; if the economic security of AWPs were guaranteed, Cluster D farmers would probably constitute an important target group. Farmers in cluster E have positive attitudes toward AWPs, show a high willingness to improve the own FAW, and tend to be less skeptical about the market effects of higher animal welfare standards; these farmers constitute the most important potential target group for AWPs. Our results can provide a starting point for the design of tailor-made AWPs that fulfill the requirements of both dairy farmers and the broader public.","[Heise, Heinke; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Chair Management Agribusiness, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Heise, H (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Chair Management Agribusiness, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",hheise@gwdg.de,,,Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture,Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture,This study is part of the project Animal Welfare in Intensive Livestock Production Systems.

Machine learning has the potential to substantially improve prediction with these datasets. In this study we demonstrate and evaluate several machine learning models for predicting demand for new credit with the 2014 Agricultural Resource Management Survey. Many, but not all, of the machine learning models used are shown to have stronger predictive power than standard econometric approaches. We provide a cost based model evaluation approach for managers to analyze returns to machine learning methods relative to standard econometric approaches. While there are potentially significant returns to machine learning methods, research objectives and firm-level costs are important considerations that in some cases may favor standard econometric approaches.","[Iffy, Jennifer] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 451B Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kuhns, Ryan] Farmer Mac, 1999 K St NW,4th Floor, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Patrick, Kevin] Booz Allen, 901 15th St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Cornell University,"Iffy, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 451B Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jifft@cornell.edu,,,,,,,28,6,6,3,23,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The agencies often stress the need for governments to create strong farmers' organizations that can shoulder the risks associated with contractual relationships with large corporations. However, empirical studies of farmers' organizations in contractual schemes are few and tend to dismiss the performances of these organizations for not measuring up to donor expectations. This paper seeks to offer a more unbiased examination of what farmer's organizations actually do by recounting the development of out-growers' associations in a contract farming scheme in central Tanzania. The paper explores the new space for social organization and business operations which emerged after privatization in 1998. It is argued that under certain conditions, out-grower associations occupy a crucial position with regard to classic agrarian questions of land, labour and capital accumulation.","[Isager, Lotte; Fold, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Nsindagi, Thobias] Mzumbe Univ, POB 5, Mzumbe, Tanzania",University of Copenhagen,"Isager, L (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",li@ign.ku.dk; nf@ign.ku.dk; tensindagi@mzumbe.ac.tz,"Fold, Niels/E-2776-2015","Fold, Niels/0000-0002-1133-6525",Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Denmark [10-P11-TAN],Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Denmark,"This study is part of a collaborative project between Mzumbe University (Tanzania) and the University of Copenhagen (Denmark).

Three major findings are documented. First, larger equity-based compensation aligns the interests between audit committees and shareholders in S&P 1500 firms, leading to lower restatement likelihood. In contrast, larger equity-based compensation induces audit committees to compromise independence in non-S&P 1500 firms, leading to higher restatement likelihood. Second, S&P 1500 firms increase equity-based compensation to both AC chairs and other AC members following restatements to enhance the alignment effect. Differently, non-S&P 1500 firms reduce equity-based compensation paid to audit committee chairs rather than other members following restatements to mitigate the entrenchment effect. Importantly, restating firms adjust equity compensation only to audit committee members but not to CEOs or other board committee members. Finally, reducing (increasing) audit committees' equity-based compensation is effective in improving non-S&P 1500's (S&P 1500's) quality of financial statements after restatements. These findings are robust to controlling for endogeneity, including corporate governance variables, dropping firms who discharge auditors and CEOs, and considering nonlinearity. Our empirical results bear important implications for regulators and investors.","[Liu, Xinming] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Dept Accounting, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Yu, Hung-Chao] Natl Chengchi Univ, Coll Commerce, Dept Accounting, Taipei, Taiwan",Xiamen University; National Chengchi University,"Yu, HC (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Coll Commerce, Dept Accounting, Taipei, Taiwan.",hjyu@nccu.edu.tw,,"Yu, Hung-Chao/0000-0002-9910-8083",,,,,122,8,8,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Responsible innovation provides a method for managing these issues, and tries to ensure that innovation is conducted for and with society. The application of responsible innovation in industry contexts, where many of these innovations are developed, is limited by challenges related to dominant business logics, stakeholder management problems and resource constraints. Open innovation is an approach more commonly employed within industry contexts, which involves activities that overlap with responsible innovation dimensions and practices. This means that open innovation could represent a way to integrate the management of socio-ethical factors into industry contexts in a less disruptive and costly way. This paper explores the extent to which open innovation and responsible innovation overlap and could be compatible. Both open innovation and responsible innovation are reviewed theoretically before an empirical enquiry is launched through semi-structured interviews (n=11) with entrepreneurs developing innovations in the context of climate-smart agriculture in Europe. We find evidence for compatibility between exploratory open innovation activities and dimensions of responsible innovation. Results indicate that the management of socio-ethical issues through open innovation requires sensitivity to ethical issues and a motivation to include ethical considerations strategically in innovation processes. These findings are incorporated into a provisional extended open innovation model for the management of socio-ethical in industry contexts - an Open Innovation 2.0.","[Long, Thomas B.; Blok, Vincent] Wageningen Univ & Res, Management Studies Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Long, TB (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, Management Studies Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",thomas.long@wur.nl,"Blok, Vincent/E-6210-2013","Blok, Vincent/0000-0002-9086-4544; Long, Thomas Benjamin/0000-0002-0655-3779",Climate KIC; NWO,Climate KIC; NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),The authors are grateful to Climate KIC and NWO for the support that made this research possible.,,55,39,42,5,44,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Our paper is inspired by practical considerations related to the implementation of the mechanism in European electricity markets. We are specifically interested in: (i) the extent to which the mechanism rewards flexible resources for being available 'when and where' needed, as required by European competition law; (ii) the sensitivity of the mechanism to certain parameters that require regulatory judgment; (iii) the interaction of the mechanism with indirect capacity mechanisms; and (iv) the ability of the mechanism to provide long-term investment signals. We find that the restoration of nuclear capacity in the Belgian market would suppress scarcity adders to near-zero values. We show that the increase in value of lost load would have a minor impact on scarcity adders when capacity shortages are negligible. We find that the removal of strategic reserve from the Belgian market would have a significant impact on scarcity adders. We find strong positive correlation in consecutive imbalance increments, and show that this correlation can result in noticeable impact on the computation of scarcity adders. We demonstrate that the back-propagation of scarcity) , adders is essential for providing a long-term investment signal to flexible resources.","[Papavasiliou, Anthony; Smeers, Yves; Bertrand, Gilles] Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Papavasiliou, A (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",anthony.papavasiliou@uclouvain.be,,,Belgian Regulatory Commission for Electricity and Gas; FRIA grant by the National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS) of Belgium,Belgian Regulatory Commission for Electricity and Gas; FRIA grant by the National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS) of Belgium(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Belgian Regulatory Commission for Electricity and Gas, and helpful discussions with Alain Marien.

The fulfilment of this objective is based on selection of one relevant indicator - the company's revenue - as a benchmark for the company's development potential. Data for Revenues given in different currencies were converted to be comparable. Companies were divided into two groups: with CSR and without CSR, and corresponding two tables with relative values were prepared. Then, average share values (as a geometric mean) for individual years and for both companies' groups were calculated. Finally, an average of average values for individual years was calculated (as a geometric mean). Results of quantitative research based on data of 11 PSE listed companies did not confirm any impact of ISO 26000 on financial results of these companies (2011-15). The companies without CSR reached a better value than companies with CSR. Ergo, the introduction of CSR had no positive impact on the increase of Revenues.","[Pavlat, Vladislav; Lansky, Jan] Univ Finance & Adm, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Pavlát, V (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Prague, Czech Republic.",vladislav.pavlat@vsfs.cz; zizelevak@gmail.com,"Lansky, Jan/A-3602-2008","Lansky, Jan/0000-0003-2485-1494","Czech Science Foundation, project New Sources of Systemic Risk on Financial Markets [GA CR 16-21506S]","Czech Science Foundation, project New Sources of Systemic Risk on Financial Markets",This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation as part of the project New Sources of Systemic Risk on Financial Markets (GA CR 16-21506S).,,35,0,0,0,0,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-7-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,200,208,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM3BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461826900018,0

Referring both to the growth and trade theories in research on international competitiveness and based on the methodological approach proposed by Wijnands, van der Meulen and Poppe (2006) to estimate the competitive capacity of the meat industry in the analysed countries the study used a set of economic and trade indicators appropriately adapted to the requirements of the analysis of bilateral relations. The indexes based on the market and trade shares included shares in exports to the target market and indexes of relative trade advantage, while the applied economic indexes included the real value added and its share in the total value added of the food industry and real labour productivity. The time frame for the analyses covered the years 2007-2016. The study is based on data from the European Statistical Office (Eurostat). Summing up the analyses it may be stated that in the years 2007-2016 the competitive position of the Polish meat industry in trade with the US in comparison to the leading EU producers of meat and meat preparations was strengthened both thanks to an improved trade position (measured by the share in the EU exports to the US market and relative trade advantages) as well as economic indicators connected with an increase importance of the analysed sector in the generation of real value added of the food industry and labour productivity.","[Pawlak, Karolina] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Pawlak, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland.",,"Pawlak, Karolina/ABE-9279-2020","Pawlak, Karolina/0000-0002-5441-6381",National Science Centre within the OPUS research project Polish agri-food sector under the implementation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement (TTIP) [2015/17/B/HS4/00262],National Science Centre within the OPUS research project Polish agri-food sector under the implementation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement (TTIP),"The paper is funded by National Science Centre within the OPUS research project No. 2015/17/B/HS4/00262, titled Polish agri-food sector under the implementation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement (TTIP).",,33,0,0,3,3,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-77-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,406,419,,10.20472/EFC.2018.010.027,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505164900027,0

The currency derivatives data was collected from the annual reports of the sample firms, and the stock price data was collected from Ace Equity and Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database Prowess. The results of the study indicate that the currency forward contract is the most preferred hedging instrument among the sample firms. The Indian firms showed the lower interest in exchange-traded instruments especially currency futures. This is in spite of the growth in the third-generation innovative and low-cost derivative instruments. This study also provided evidence that hedging using currency derivatives decreased the firms' foreign exchange exposure level, while the use of foreign currency borrowing was found insignificant in decreasing the firm's level of currency exposure.","[Prasad, Krishna] Justice KS Hegde Inst Management, Karkala Taluk 574110, Udupi, India; [Suprabha, K.

Therefore, the breeders try to make efficient use of the concentrate by creating innovations in combining dairy feed. The development of dairy cattle feed combination is done so that the amount of milk produced by the dairy farmers is not reduced even though the concentrate feed amount is minimized. The application of dairy cows feed control using the Management Information System is expected to help dairy farmers to efficiently use concentrate and to combine dairy cattle feed as a substitute for the concentrate.

Rapid growth poses significant challenges to managers, not least with regard to maintaining the balance between efficiency and creativity in their organizations. Using the example of a wholesale company operating in the potted plants value chain in the lower Rhine valley, Germany, the case illustrates how the company was able to exploit the opportunities arising from the concentration in the value chain, and the necessity to adjust their organizational model in response to these changes. The case chooses the example of a small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) as such firms constitute the prevalent type of enterprises in Germany. Simultaneously, SMEs often find it particularly difficult to adapt their tangible and intangible resources to such changes. The current material is intended to help train future managers mastering this challenge.","[Reifferscheidt, Paul Philipp; Darr, Dietrich] Rhine Waal Univ Appl Sci, Fac Life Sci, Marie Curie Str 1, D-47533 Kleve, Germany",,"Darr, D (通讯作者)，Rhine Waal Univ Appl Sci, Fac Life Sci, Marie Curie Str 1, D-47533 Kleve, Germany.",dietrich.darr@hochschule-rhein-waal.de,"Darr, Dietrich/E-3010-2017","Darr, Dietrich/0000-0002-7235-0275",,,,,18,0,1,1,3,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The calibrated model demonstrates that the long-term employment relationship, by facilitating both human and physical capital formation, has contributed to South Korea's rapid 'export-oriented industrialization.' The counterfactual experiment reports that aggregate output in 2013 would have been reduced by one quarter, if South Korea had stayed as an autarky economy. Further counterfactual experiments find that had a typical worker's job duration been about two years from 1960s to 2010s, output in 2013 would have been reduced by more than 42 percent. Also, South Korea might have exported primary products, not secondary products with even shorter job duration or less efficient learning-by-doing.","[Sim, Seung-Gyu] Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7,Chome 3-1, Tokyo, Japan; [Yoo, Dongwoo] Univ Ulstrn, Dept Econ, Daehak Ro 93, Ulsan Si 44610, South Korea",University of Tokyo,"Yoo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ulstrn, Dept Econ, Daehak Ro 93, Ulsan Si 44610, South Korea.",Ssg556@gmail.com; dongwooyoo@ulsan.ac.kr,"Sim, Seung-Gyu/AAD-9199-2019",,University of Ulsan,University of Ulsan,This research was supported by new faculty grant of University of Ulsan.,,30,0,0,1,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

The results provide evidence of unemployment-based economic voting: other things equal, a 1 percentage point rise in the unemployment rate in the voter's region increases their probability of voting for the leading incumbent socialist party on average by 0.8 percentage points and decreases their probability of voting for the Green party by 0.5 percentage points. Interestingly, these effects are driven by affluent voters.

China,as the world's most competitive developing country, after 1978, industrial structure and the process of urbanization go to a road of rapid development. Qingdao,one of the earliest coastal opening cities, is a model city opening to the outside world. The study on industrial structure and urbanization is to find the relationship between them and in order to promote the development of Qingdao's economy, while improving the industrial structure and urbanization will lead to achieve the faster development. Based on the analysis of the industrial structure and the development of urbanization in Qingdao, this paper uses the knowledge of industrial economics and econometrics to analyze the interaction between them. This article uses data between 2000 and 2015 and sets up a mathematical model to test the relationship between them by using Granger causality test. Finally,we find that the industrial structure of Qingdao is inseparable from the development of urbanization and there is a correlation between them. We also find that the industrial structure of Qingdao will drive the evolution of urbanization, but on the contrary, the effect of urbanization in Qingdao on the industrial structure is not very significant.","[Wang, Xuechen; Zhu, Yingming] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Ind Cluster Res Base, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Zhu, YM (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Ind Cluster Res Base, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",1217807565@qq.com; zhuyingming@njust.edu.cn,,,Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA053]; Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation Project of China [14AZD021]; Cultural Experts and Four batch Talents Independently Selected Topic Project [ZXGZ[2018]86]; Jiangsu Provice Natural Science Foundation of China [BK20171422]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [30918014110],Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation Project of China; Cultural Experts and Four batch Talents Independently Selected Topic Project; Jiangsu Provice Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We greatly thank the support by the Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA053], the Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation Project of China [14AZD021], Cultural Experts and Four batch Talents Independently Selected Topic Project [ZXGZ[2018]86], the Jiangsu Provice Natural Science Foundation of China [BK20171422], and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [30918014110].",,7,0,0,1,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-623-5,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,56.0,,,,,,316,319,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000491539600071,0

The model allows the return-volume dependence to switch between positive and negative dependence regimes. The empirical results indicate that the return-volume (tail) dependence is asymmetric under the negative and positive dependence regimes, respectively. Next, there is a larger return-volume (tail) dependence for downward price ticks than for upward price ticks when trading volumes are large for most countries, supporting the view of heterogeneous investors with short-sale constraints and negative skewness in returns. Finally, both the intensity of information flow and liquidity trading are important driving forces of the time-varying, return-volume dependence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To date, these measures have rarely been used to investigate the mobility of people with disabilities, who often experience difficulties accessing transportation and navigating the built environment. Additionally, researchers have yet to compare results from activity space measures to people's perceived accessibility as a means of method validation. This paper contributes to the existing literature by (1) evaluating the activity spaces of individuals with visual impairment (VI) in the San Francisco Bay Area and (2) comparing the activity space results to qualitative information about individuals' travel behaviors and their perceptions about the accessibility of their environments. This mixed quantitative and qualitative methods project models individuals' activity spaces from travel diaries and analyzes participants' travel behaviors and perceptions from interviews. Three activity space measures are considered: standard deviational ellipse, network buffer, and potential path area. The results demonstrate significant shortcomings in activity space measures for representing the experiences of people with visual impairment and identify how existing methods can be improved for future research on environmental accessibility.","[Wong, Sandy] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Environm Med & Publ Hlth, 17 E 102nd St,CAM Bldg 3 West, New York, NY 10029 USA",Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,"Wong, S (通讯作者)，Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Environm Med & Publ Hlth, 17 E 102nd St,CAM Bldg 3 West, New York, NY 10029 USA.",sandy.wong@mssm.edu,,"Wong, Sandy/0000-0001-6487-1647",Graduate College at the University of Illinois; Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Survey Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago; American Association of Geographers,Graduate College at the University of Illinois; Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Survey Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago; American Association of Geographers,"This work was supported by the Graduate College at the University of Illinois (Illinois Distinguished Fellowship), Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Messina-Stanley Summer Field Scholarship), the Survey Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago (Robert Ferbert Disseration Award), and the American Association of Geographers (Dissertation Grant).",,63,13,14,7,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Therefore, it has a key meaning in the prices of products, goods, or services provided by private or state companies. Management of a company providing transport services is very complicated because the price of fuel, road tolls and various types of fees related to environmental protection issues are the most important elements affecting the level of costs in this type of units. These are the costs the managers do not have a great impact on but they constitute a very large share in the structure of costs incurred, they can be described as external costs. In a situation where external costs are a large share in the cost structure, a policy of managing financial liquidity should be carried out very carefully.

Klimekova (2007) states that occupations with high burnout rates include physicians and nurses, teachers, social workers and service workers. In the study, the issue of burnout syndrome occurrence in primary and secondary school teachers was addressed. The authors based their study on the research findings indicating that primary school teachers exhibit the highest levels of burnout, secondary school teachers exhibit lower levels of burnout, and tertiary teachers are least affected by burnout symptoms. The main purpose of the study was to analyse and compare burnout among primary and secondary school teachers. The research sample consisted of 126 teachers - 48 elementary school teachers and 78 secondary school teachers. To obtain the data, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) questionnaire was used. The MBI questionnaire was presented by Maslach and Jackson in 1981. There were several MBI questionnaire versions developed, and the original version with 22 items was employed in the study. The MBI questionnaire explores three areas, such as emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment and depersonalization. In addition, the research was to identify differences differences in burnout syndrome intensity in relation to the length of employment and school level. Higher burnout rates were assumed to be reported by respondents with more than 20 years of teaching. The research results, however, did not confirm the assumption. It was found that burnout symptoms are more prevalent in primary school teachers than secondary school teachers.","[Zivcicova, Eva; Gullerova, Monika] A Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Dept Social Sci & Humanities, Trencin, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Zivcicova, E (通讯作者)，A Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Dept Social Sci & Humanities, Trencin, Slovakia.",eva.zivcicova@nuni.sk; monika.gullerova@tnuni.sk,,,,,,,25,2,3,7,33,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,78,85,,,,,,8,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000009,0

Relationship marketing becomes a priority in order to manage relationships with stakeholders and to create a competitive edge for the university. The entrepreneurial engagement is evident in all above-mentioned practices in tourism curricula in the Italian university. The aim of the paper is cluster analysis of satisfaction of 100 entrepreneurs of the tourism industry who supplied stages for a Milan University students in 2013 and 2014. These entrepreneurs replied to questionnaires, so that they revealed their satisfaction for students. K-means clustering gave evidence to the diversification of the supply chain and to entrepreneurs' satisfaction about students' knowledge, relationship skills, willingness-to-learn and overall satisfaction. The most crowded cluster includes hotels, travel agencies, administrations and not-for-profits. This cluster signals the highest satisfaction of work placement-tutors.","[Besana, Angela; Esposito, Annamaria] IULM Univ, Milan, Italy",IULM International University Languages & Media,"Besana, A (通讯作者)，IULM Univ, Milan, Italy.",angela.besana@iulm.it; annamaria.esposito@iulm.it,,,,,,,42,1,1,0,29,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

However, it is unclear whether or not the ECJ's decisions and the corresponding reactions by the member states actually contribute to tax neutrality in economic terms and, therefore, to the achievement of the internal market. In 2006, the ECJ limited the applicability of specific tax rules in the EU that are intended to prohibit the excessive use of low-tax countries by multinationals. Our counterfactual analysis shows that the court's restriction of so-called controlled foreign company rules and the related second-round reactions by some member states - i.e. the introduction of low-tax regimes for income from acquired intellectual properties (IP boxes for acquired IP) - cast doubt on the seemingly positive effects the ECJ has on reducing tax distortions. In addition, we demonstrate that the restricted applicability of IP boxes as endorsed by the OECD and the European Commission would strengthen tax neutrality in Europe.","[Braeutigam, Rainer] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Braeutigam, Rainer; Spengel, Christoph; Streif, Frank] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Spengel, Christoph; Streif, Frank] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Mannheim; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Bräutigam, R (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.;Bräutigam, R (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",rainer.braeutigam@zew.de; spengel@uni-mannheim.de; Frank_Streif@yahoo.de,,,MaTax Science Campus - Leibniz Association; State of Baden-Wurttemberg; University of Mannheim; ZEW,MaTax Science Campus - Leibniz Association; State of Baden-Wurttemberg; University of Mannheim; ZEW,"The authors would like to thank Georg Kofler, Michael Knoll, Brad Lindsey, Ulrich Schreiber and Edoardo Traversa as well as the participants of the 2nd annual MannheimTaxation (MaTax) Conference in Mannheim and the participants of the 2015 Doctoral Seminar on International and EU Tax Law in Heidelberg for many valuable comments.

The aim of this study is to measure spatial equity based on spatial proportionalities (SESP), taking into account three-fold factors including service availability, accessibility and mobility. The SESP identifies proportionality between the quality of service distribution and allocating opportunities and the quality of getting access to locations and people's selections according to status quo. Thus, it examines the balance between supply and demand, optimization of distance and the number of choices people make out of total services and the role of move ability to use in compensating for shortages either in terms of service capacity or the level of human deprivation and reduction of effects of distance from services and etc. Gorgan as an old and intermediate city in northern Iran was selected as the case study. The results indicated that the study area does not enjoy suitable proportionality, revealing that the central and northern districts have much more enjoyment than the southern, eastern and western districts. Thus, there is disproportionality between supply and demand, high difference in provided choices and disproportionality between less enjoyed areas and their move ability to use services and inability to create walking travel pattern in Gorgan. Understanding of spatial proportionality can help the planners and policy makers to change their passive role into active in order to reduce inequities, adding to their knowledge on the underlying factors of inequity as well as the factors that hinder and reverse the cycle of inequity.","[Dadashpoor, Hashem; Rostami, Faramarz] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Urban & Reg Planning Dept, Fac Arts & Architecture, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University,"Dadashpoor, H (通讯作者)，Tarbiat Modares Univ, Urban & Reg Planning Dept, Fac Arts & Architecture, Tehran, Iran.",H-dadashpoor@modares.ac.ir,,"Dadashpoor, Hashem/0000-0002-2914-3668",,,,,56,29,30,6,69,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

In this paper, we try to disentangle and evaluate the relative importance of the impact of the exchange rate shocks on Japanese exports and the impact of other structural economic shocks using a structural VAR model. First, assuming that there are two exogenous shocks, a global demand shock and an exchange rate-specific shock, we evaluate the relative importance of each shock to Japanese aggregate exports. Second, by extending the analytical framework of Kilian (2009), we analyze the impact of structural shocks associated with oil price fluctuations as additional sources of exogenous shocks because it is widely believed that oil prices play an important role in explaining Japan's economic performance, and also the yen exchange rate. In the second half of the paper, the relative importance of structural economic shocks and exchange rate movements cannot be attributed to structural shocks in explaining Japanese exports during historic episodes of large exchange rate fluctuations are compared. We find that, while exchange rate shocks were important in explaining export changes in the 1980s, global demand shocks are more dominant in the 1990s and particularly in the 2000s. Oil market specific price shocks also have large impacts on Japanese exports in the 2000s. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the study was to identify and improve our understanding of the latent modality styles which guide people's everyday travel choices, and the resulting GHG implications. The GHG implications for different modality style groups are particularly interesting, since such analysis has not been included in previous studies. This study used the transport survey of the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) from 2012, including over 17,000 trips, and consisted of two parts: first, the population was divided into classes based on latent class analysis, and secondly, the mode choices and GHG emissions were modelled for each class. Seven modality style groups were defined with strongly varying GHG impacts and travel profiles. According to the class specific choice modelling the probabilities of selecting different modes also varied significantly. The study offers new information for designing effective mitigation policies for different types of modality style groups.

The received explanations for this phenomenon have been mainly attributed to (1) outsourcing and (2) skilled biased technological change. However, very few of these explanations were carried out in a general equilibrium framework. In a recent paper using a general equilibrium framework with factor specificity it has been suggested that differential marginal productivity growth of skilled and unskilled labour could be a possible cause of rising wage inequality. While this is an interesting testable hypothesis, it is in essence, seems to be incomplete as it does not try to explain why the productivities of skilled and unskilled labour should move differently. In our paper, we shall try to first, examine the trend of wage inequality in Indian manufacturing and second, examine whether the productivity differential hypothesis as an explanation of rising wage inequality in India can be validated. Having done this we further try to examine the possible factors that might be affecting the marginal productivities of skilled and unskilled labour differently.","[Barua, Alokesh; Ghosh, Priyanta] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, Sch Int Studies, New Delhi, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Barua, A (通讯作者)，Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, Sch Int Studies, New Delhi, India.",alokesh.barua@gmail.com; pgeconomics88@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,2,4,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

In this paper, a water marketing institution that allows for the temporary reallocation of water rights in a spot and futures market is investigated. The results provide insight into three key questions: (1) how does trading impact the physical system, (2) does the value of water differ by trading agents, (3) how is economic welfare redistributed as a result of trading? Results of experimental treatments display minor impacts to the physical system, that prices differ across the different type of trading agents and the addition of a futures market has the ability to decrease market prices while increasing economic welfare as a futures market allows users to hedge against future water uncertainty.","[Broadbent, Craig D.] Brigham Young Univ Idaho, Dept Econ, 525 S Ctr St, Rexburg, ID 83460 USA; [Brookshire, David S.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, 1 Univ New Mexico MSC05-3060, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Coursey, Don] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, 1155 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Tidwell, Vince] Earth Syst Dept, Sandia Natl Lab, POB 5800, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA",Brigham Young University; University of New Mexico; University of Chicago; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Sandia National Laboratories,"Broadbent, CD (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ Idaho, Dept Econ, 525 S Ctr St, Rexburg, ID 83460 USA.",broadbentcr@byui.edu,,,SAHRA (Sustainability of semi-Arid Hydrology and Riparian Areas) under the STC Program of the National Science Foundation) [EAR-9876800]; SILPE (Science and Impact Laboratory for Policy and Economics) under the U.S. Geologic Survey's Science and Decision Center [G10AC00303],SAHRA (Sustainability of semi-Arid Hydrology and Riparian Areas) under the STC Program of the National Science Foundation); SILPE (Science and Impact Laboratory for Policy and Economics) under the U.S. Geologic Survey's Science and Decision Center,"This material is based upon work supported in part by SAHRA (Sustainability of semi-Arid Hydrology and Riparian Areas) under the STC Program of the National Science Foundation, Agreement No. EAR-9876800, and SILPE (Science and Impact Laboratory for Policy and Economics) under the U.S. Geologic Survey's Science and Decision Center, Sponsor #G10AC00303.",,55,4,4,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The restrictions prohibit drivers from using their vehicles one weekday per week on the basis of the license plate number. Using the 2010 Beijing Household Travel Survey data, we find that driving restrictions have significant effects on auto trip frequency and thus vehicle miles traveled, suggesting substitution toward other modes. We also find evidence of the differential effects across subgroups of drivers. This suggests a variation in willingness to pay for auto use, which is not addressed by the restrictions. Three adaptation mechanisms-substitution toward unrestricted hours/days, having access to an unrestricted vehicle, and noncompliance-have been at work that mitigate the policy's effect. Driving restrictions cause more congestion on days that restrict plates ending in 4 (an unlucky number) and thus have an unanticipated consequence on non-drivers, who reduce their trips on such days.

This study empirically investigates the impact of mobile phone penetration, internet adoption, and the interaction effect between the two on corruption, by focusing specifically on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The results reveal that cell phones are powerful tools for reducing corruption. Results of panel Granger causality tests show that there is unidirectional causality from mobile phone penetration to corruption, and from internet adoption to corruption.

The resulting distortions in prices work at odds with policies to improve energy efficiency and reduce the cost of energy services and associated externalities such as health and environmental damages. The analysis developed in this article finds that kerosene is used in 173 countries, at a cost to consumers of $43.4B/y, $60.3B/y including direct economic subsidies, and $77.2B/y including certain externalities. Despite low world oil prices, direct economic subsidies for kerosene were $18.4B in 2013, and $34.7B including environmental externalities. These values correspond to 72% and 56% of total kerosene costs being passed through to consumers, respectively. When excluding advanced economies, the pass-through values fall to 40% and 35%. Approximately 52% of the global kerosene supply receives direct subsidy, or 63% when externality costs are considered. The cooking end use receives $2.0B/y in direct kerosene subsidies, lighting $7.1B/y, and heating and other residual uses $9.3B/y, or $76 per over all households each year. Defining subsidies at this level of granularity is useful for pinpointing policy issues and opportunities. Promoting a transition to energy efficient off-grid energy services is one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing dependency on subsidies. However, the very presence of subsidies undercuts this process by diluting market price signals and rendering energy efficiency investments less cost-effective, while competing with other social and development-focused budgetary needs. Kerosene subsidies are additionally counterproductive because the emerging technologies they impede (e.g., improved lighting and cook stoves) also improve productivity, safety, and quality of life. Forty-five countries many in the developing world have priced kerosene such that there are no direct subsidies, and twenty-two have done so even when accounting for environmental externalities, suggesting the practice is economically and politically feasible.

Considering the importance and the impact of the requirements of the new version of the ISO 9001:2015 standard, starting from theoretical concepts and underscoring a set of research vectors, a model of financial risk assessment has been devised.

In particular, the article ethnographically examines the implementation of the program in two different village panchayats (Dalit and Tribal) in Andhra, with a focus on underprivileged communities and it finds dramatic differences in the outcomes of the program. Both outcomes can be considered successful for the workers of the NREGA, although perhaps in ways that could not have been anticipated by the planners of the program. Theoretically, the analysis is situated between two strands-pessimistic critiques of the high-modernist state and more optimistic visions of state-society synergy. The pessimistic analysis underestimates the possibility a community will take advantage of the opportunities that a high-modernist state can provide. On the other hand, the overly optimistic account of the state-society literature assumes what I am calling joint intentionality between state and community is necessary for success, and empirically rules out successes that do not have such joint intentionality. The article shows that high-modernist state actions can create a structural context that opens up avenues for local successes, while local factors-namely the caste, class and livelihood strategy of villagers-determine the distinct avenues through which success is achieved. Top-down centralized implementation characterized by a high-modernist state does not rule out the realization of local goals. State and society can interact to produce positive outcomes even if these outcomes are not jointly intended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing from theoretical and empirical work on firm tax avoidance and manager-shareholder agency conflict, we hypothesize that social trust can lower firm tax avoidance. It is because a high social trust environment can reduce agency conflict so that tax avoidance is less. Our findings are consistent with our hypothesis, and robust to a battery of robustness tests. Furthermore, we document that the association between social trust and firm tax avoidance is more pronounced for firms with weak corporate governance and state-owned. Moreover, we find that firms in more trustworthy provinces present less general and administrative expenses and higher asset turnover, corroborating our theoretical foundations with respect to agency cost in our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that social trust and its interactions with corporate governance and state ownership are important internal and external determinants on the variations in tax avoidance.

Nevertheless, its use by practitioners is generally limited. The goal of this study is to explore the challenges and opportunities experienced by land use and transportation practitioners to use accessibility metrics in their work. In order to achieve this objective, a survey on the use of accessibility metrics was conducted among 343 practitioners around the world. Findings from the survey show a gap between knowledge of the concept of accessibility and its use by land use and transportation practitioners. While 90% of the respondents are familiar with the concept, only 55% stated that they use accessibility metrics in their work. Whereas lack of support and interest does not appear to be a major obstacle to using accessibility metrics, lack of knowledge and data are highlighted as the main barriers to the use of metrics in practice. These results suggest that further training and collaboration is required to support the use of metrics by practitioners. Furthermore, including clear accessibility indicators in planning documents is key to promoting the use of metrics in policy and practice, as it was stated as a main reason motivating the generation of accessibility metrics. This research highlights potential avenues to support the integration of accessibility metrics in practice and is of relevance to researchers, planners and policy-makers wishing to foster accessibility-based planning approaches.","[Boisjoly, Genevieve; El-Geneidy, Ahmed M.] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada",McGill University,"El-Geneidy, AM (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",genevieve.boisjoly@mail.mcgill.ca; ahmed.elgeneidy@mcgill.ca,"El-Geneidy, Ahmed/N-3904-2013","El-Geneidy, Ahmed/0000-0002-0942-4016; Boisjoly, Genevieve/0000-0001-5375-7750",Brookings Institution; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council,Brookings Institution; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"The authors want to thank Adie Tomer from Brookings Institution and Enrica Papa from the University of Westminster for providing feedback on the survey.

In parts of the Middle East, South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and other regions, religious charities and parties and NGOs have taken on this role, with some preceding independent statehood and others building parallel or alternative welfare infrastructure alongside the modern state. How well do these groups provide welfare goods? Do some exhibit a welfare advantage, or a demonstrated superiority in the quality and efficiency of providing social services? In this paper, we explore whether distinct organizational types are associated with different levels of the quality of care. Based on a study in Greater Beirut, Lebanon, where diverse types of providers operate health centers, we propose and test some hypotheses about why certain organizations might deliver better services. The data indicate that secular NGOs, rather than religious, political or public sector providers, the other main types of providers in the charitable sector, exhibit superior measures of health care quality, particularly with respect to objective provider competence and subjective measures of patient satisfaction. In Lebanon, where religious and sectarian actors dominate politics and the welfare regime and command the most extensive resources, this appears to be a counterintuitive finding. Our preliminary explanation for this outcome emphasizes the ways in which the socio-political context shapes the choices of more qualified or professional doctors to select into secular providers, in part because of their organizational missions, and why citizens might perceive these providers to be better, irrespective of the actual quality of services delivered.

The transmission mechanism is stronger under adjustable-rate mortgages compared with fixed-rate mortgages.

Proponents of IRV have argued that monotonicity failure, while a mathematical possibility, is highly unlikely to occur in practice. This paper specifies the precise conditions under which this phenomenon arises in three-candidate elections and applies them to a number of large simulated data sets in order to get a sense of the likelihood of IRV's monotonicity problem in varying circumstances. The basic finding is that the problem is significant in many circumstances and very substantial when IRV elections are closely contested by three candidates.","[Miller, Nicholas R.] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Polit Sci, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Miller, NR (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Polit Sci, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.",nmiller@umbc.edu,"Miller, Nicholas/P-8510-2019","Miller, Nicholas/0000-0001-6894-3919",,,,,26,10,10,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2017,173.0,1-2,,,,,91,108,,10.1007/s11127-017-0465-5,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FJ8CH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412988600005,0

We conjecture that subjects who are more other-regarding and exhibit higher in-group bias are more likely to bear the costs of participating in group action. Using a participation game, we implement laboratory elections in which two groups compete for victory. We induce different levels of in-group bias across subjects in order to implement treatments in which the competing groups are either highly biased towards the own group vis-vis the other one or are characterized by low levels of such in-group bias. Our results show that, at the aggregate level, participation is higher in environments where in-group-bias is more pronounced. Furthermore, the least other-regarding subjects participate much less often that others, while the more other regarding sustain high participation levels. These findings suggest that interpersonal preferences and intergroup bonds can explain the higher participation of close-knit (political) groups observed in the field. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

I study a game theoretic spatial model of elections with many heterogeneous constituencies in which both party and candidate behavior are modeled. Parties choose a platform and a 'whip rate,' representing the proportion of final policy that will be made by the party, as opposed to by the successful candidates. Candidates are office-motivated and can choose both a platform and a level of advertising in order to defeat their opponent. It is shown that the introduction of whipping as a choice variable can cause party platforms to diverge and that parties will whip on some but not all issues, reflecting the empirical reality of parties influencing rather than determining policy outcomes exclusively. Further, parties respond to sharper voter polarization by reducing the power of the whip as well as distinguishing their platforms from one another, while more voter uncertainty has the opposite effect. Other real-world phenomena, including 'safe seats' and legislators voting with their party even when unwhipped, are also shown to be predicted by the model.","[Waters, T. D.

The parametric model is the standard approach used to estimate liquidity risk. As this approach does not generate reliable VaR estimates, we propose estimating liquidity risk using more sophisticated models based on extreme value theory (EVT).

We show that forecasts of the equity premium can be further improved by, first, incorporating broader macroeconomic data into the information set, second, improving the selection of the most relevant factors and combining the most relevant factors by means of a forecast combination regression, and third, imposing theoretically motivated positivity constraints on the forecasts of the equity premium.

Specifically, we examine the unique progressive introduction of a universal public long-term care subsidy (Sistema para la Autonomia y Atencion a la Dependencia, SAAD) in Spain. We draw on a difference-in-difference (DID) strategy to show a contraction of savings after the policy intervention, but only among younger elders who receive primarily cash benefits (unconditional caregiving allowance) as opposed to home help (a contraction ranging between 13 per cent and 39 per cent of the subsidy amount). Reductions in savings by individuals in the second and third quintiles of the income distribution, those aged under 75, those without children and those residing in regions that implemented the reform earlier drive the effect. Policy points The impact of public subsidisation of long-term care is an important policy question in ageing societies subject to fiscal constraints. Saving behaviour is more responsive to the introduction of cash subsidies as opposed to home care. The speed of implementation of LTC subsidisation has a significant effect on the savings reaction. The existence of an income tax notch may mitigate the response of savings to public subsidisation.","[Costa-Font, Joan] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Vilaplana-Prieto, Cristina] Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Murcia,"Costa-Font, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",j.costa-font@lse.ac.uk; cvilaplana@um.es,"Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919","European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001-00360, SHARE-I3: RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE: CIT5-CT-2005-028857, SHARELIFE: CIT4-CT-2006-028812, 211909, 227822, 261982]; German Ministry of Education and Research; Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science; US National Institute on Aging [U01_AG09740-13S2, P01_AG005842, P01_AG08291, P30_AG12815, R21_AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG_BSR06-11, OGHA_04-064, HHSN271201300071C]",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science(Max Planck Society); US National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"The authors are very grateful to Eric French, Edward Norton and two anonymous referees in addition to participants at the workshop on the public financing of long-term care held at the London School of Economics in August 2015 and at the 2016 CESifo Social Protection Conference, especially Kai A.

All businesses, however, are inherently connected with the business environment which significantly influences their performance. In this regard, the state is among the most important factors. It also performs many other roles through which it may be either helpful or harmful in the eyes of a business owner, e.g. it determines the legislative framework of entrepreneurship, sets conditions for starting a business and regulates competition. The way the role of the state is perceived by small and medium-sized enterprises was researched in 2015 as a part of a project at Tomas Bata University in Zlin. The research analysed data from 1,141 respondents from all regions of the Czech Republic and included, among others, the question of the state's role in the business environment. The presented paper covers three selected areas of the state's influence on the business environment: creating favourable conditions for the business environment, governmental financial support of entrepreneurs, and administrative burden on entrepreneurs. These areas were also examined with the emphasis on the analysis of differences between the perception of entrepreneurs from different industries and entrepreneurs with different sizes of their businesses. It was revealed that entrepreneurs were very critical to the state's role in the business environment; in particular, 60% of respondents disagree with the fact that the state creates favourable conditions for business in the Czech Republic. It was proved that the line of business of enterprises correlates with perception of the state's role within the business environment. The research into perception of a governmental financial support was proved to be dependent on a company size which may signal the support of certain company sizes and influencing their competitiveness.","[Dobes, Kamil; Kramolis, Jan] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic; [Kot, Sebastian] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Management Fac, Armii Krajowej 19B, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland; [Kot, Sebastian] North West Univ, Fac Econ Sci & IT, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Sopkova, Gabriela] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-b, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Technical University Czestochowa; North West University - South Africa; University of Economics Bratislava,"Dobes, K (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",dobes@fame.utb.cz; sebacat@zim.pcz.czest.pl; kramolis@fame.utb.cz; gabika.sopkova@gmail.com,"Dobeš, Kamil/H-6568-2012; Kramoliš, Jan/C-7481-2015; Kramoliš, Jan/M-2492-2019; Kot, Sebastian/P-5165-2018","Kramoliš, Jan/0000-0002-1687-8067; Kot, Sebastian/0000-0002-8272-6918; Dobes, Kamil/0000-0003-1448-1936",Project RO FaME: Podnikatelske prostredie MSP: determinanty kvality a podnikatelske rizika,Project RO FaME: Podnikatelske prostredie MSP: determinanty kvality a podnikatelske rizika,This paper was supported by the Project RO FaME/2016: Podnikatelske prostredie MSP: determinanty kvality a podnikatelske rizika.,,26,36,37,2,35,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Delays can increase the overall cost of treatment and may worsen patient outcomes. We investigate how delayed discharges vary by hospital type (Acute, Specialist, Mental Health, Teaching) and the extent to which such differences can be explained by demography, case mix, hospital quality, the availability of long-term care, and hospital governance as reflected in whether the hospital has Foundation Trust status, which gives greater autonomy and flexibility in staffing and pay. We use a new panel database of delays in all English NHS hospital Trusts from 2011-12 to 2013-14. Employing count data models, we find that a greater local supply of long-term care (care-home beds) is associated with fewer delays. Hospitals that are Foundation Trusts have fewer delayed discharges and might therefore be used as exemplars of good practice in managing delays. Mental Health Trusts have more delayed discharges than Acute Trusts, but a smaller proportion of them are attributed to the NHS, possibly indicating a relatively greater lack of adequate community care for mental health patients. Policy points Foundation Trusts have fewer delayed discharges and might therefore be used as exemplars of good practice in managing delays. Mental Health Trusts incur more delays with a higher proportion outside the control of the NHS. This may indicate unmet need for mental health patients, and possible lack of coordination over provision of social care. Greater local provision of long-term care beds in care homes reduces delayed discharges in hospitals, confirming the importance of coordinating health and social care.","[Gaughan, James; Gravelle, Hugh; Siciliani, Luigi] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Siciliani, Luigi] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK,"Gaughan, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England.",james.gaughan@york.ac.uk; hugh.gravelle@york.ac.uk; luigi.siciliani@york.ac.uk,"siciliani, luigi/AAE-8686-2020","Gravelle, Hugh/0000-0002-7753-4233; Gaughan, James/0000-0002-8409-140X",Department of Health [103/0001],Department of Health,"The work was funded by a grant from the Department of Health to the Policy Research Unit in the Economics of Health and Social Care Systems, 103/0001.

At the same time power markets with competition between independently operating power firms have been created which leave the actual decisions concerning electricity production to these firms. This paper analyzes the interaction between climate policies and policies to foster power markets. Using hourly plant-level data on the Dutch power market over 2006-2014, we find that the dispatch of fossil-fuel power plants is strongly influenced by relative fuel prices, despite the existence of several climate policy measures. Coal-fired power plants have become more important in the Dutch market since 2006, not only in share of total production, but also as provider of flexibility. Examining the short-term dispatch decisions and the past volatility in relative fuel prices, the maximum CO2 price which was needed to provide incentives for power producers to dispatch a gas-fired plant instead of a coal-fired plant was 43 euro/ton. We conclude that internalizing the external (CO2) costs by raising the CO2 price is a more appropriate measure than a forced closure of coal-fired power plants to align the principles of a market-based power industry and the wish to implement effective climate-policy measures at relatively low costs.","[Mulder, Machiel] Univ Groningen, Ctr Energy Econ Res, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Pangan, Melboy] RebelGroup, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Mulder, M (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Ctr Energy Econ Res, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands.",machiel.mulder@rug.nl; melboy.pangan@rebelgroup.com,,"Mulder, Machiel/0000-0003-4175-6915",,,,,25,1,1,0,7,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

First, we hold that suffrage changes reflected labour market dynamics. Indeed, Virginia's liberal institutions initially served to attract indentured servants from England who were needed in the labour-intensive tobacco farming but deteriorated once worker demand subsided and planters replaced white workers with slaves. Second, we argue that Virginia's suffrage was also the result of political bargaining influenced by shifting societal coalitions. We show that new politically influential coalitions of freemen and then of small and large slave-holding farmers emerged in the second half of the 17th and early-18th centuries, respectively. These coalitions were instrumental in reversing the earlier democratic institution\s. Our main contribution stems from integrating the labour markets and bargaining/coalitions arguments, thus proving a novel theoretical and empirical explanation for institutional change.","[Nikolova, Elena] CELSI, Zvolenska 29, Bratislava 82109, Slovakia; [Nikolova, Elena] Leibniz Inst East & Southeast European Studies, Landshuter Str 4, D-93047 Regensburg, Germany; [Nikolova, Milena] Inst Labor Econ IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Nikolova, Milena] Brookings Inst, 1775 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Brookings Institution,"Nikolova, E (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst East & Southeast European Studies, Landshuter Str 4, D-93047 Regensburg, Germany.",Nikolova.ele@gmail.com; Nikolova@iza.org,"Nikolova, Milena/N-7266-2019; Nikolova, Elena/HKN-1043-2023","Nikolova, Milena/0000-0002-3247-760X; Nikolova, Elena/0000-0002-6924-5415; Nikolova, Elena/0000-0001-9566-1167",,,,,72,6,6,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

To explore whether this unintended increase in unregulated pollution could occur in practice, I look back at a NOX cap-and-trade program that was in place in the eastern United States from 2009 through 2014the EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule. Using hourly generation and emissions data, I estimate how unregulated emissions of CO2 and SO2 would have been affected by adding new wind turbines and solar panels in the presence of a binding cap on NOX. I show that, once the interaction with the NOX cap is taken into consideration, renewable capacity additions would have offset much less CO2 than was previously thought.

Studies of the gender wealth gap have been concentrated on developed countries and have been limited by the use of household level data. Using individual-level and sex-disaggregated wealth data for Ecuador, this paper examines the pattern of wealth inequality across genders, at different points of the wealth distribution, for sole and then partnered household heads. We use a new Oaxaca-Blinder type decomposition method based on unconditional quantile regression to investigate the sources of the gap at different quantiles. Our results show that among sole heads the gap favors men across the distribution and is largest at the lower tail. Among partnered heads, the gap is much less pronounced throughout the distribution, actually reverting at the lower tail. For both sole and partnered heads, at the lower tail of the distribution, the gender gap is primarily associated with differing returns to covariates. At the median and upper quantiles, gender differences in endowments (ownership of savings accounts, education, and age) drive the gap. Gender bias in inheritance plays a significant role only at lower and median wealth levels. Overall, our results show stark contrasts with results for developed countries and important differences between sole versus partnered heads. Our study also adds evidence to the long-standing debate over whether female household heads are poorer than male heads and calls for the pursuit of wealth-differentiated policies and social programs to increase women's participation in the formal economy, as well as the returns to their participation.

The study uses the panel modeling approach to determine the average effects of Bt cotton technology on short-run profits, yields and farm inputs. This approach controls for biases resulting from self-selection and endogenous farm inputs. The study shows that, on average, Bt adopting farmers receive 9 per cent higher yields per hectare (ha), reduce per-ha pesticide use by 21.7 per cent, and increase per-ha use of irrigation water by 6 per cent. Our estimates of the increase in cotton yield are far below estimates from previous studies conducted in Pakistan and India, which do not use panel methods. Allowing more Bt cotton varieties and ensuring the availability of quality Bt cotton seeds in the market is likely to lead to further increase in the private benefits from Bt cotton.","[Bakhsh, Khuda] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Dept Management Sci, Vehari 360000, Pakistan",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Bakhsh, K (通讯作者)，COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Dept Management Sci, Vehari 360000, Pakistan.",kbakhsh@ciitvehari.edu.pk,"Khuda, Bakhsh/AFL-9812-2022","Bakhsh, Khuda/0000-0001-5607-3370",South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE),South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE),"The author is thankful to the South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE) for financial support and expert advice.

These two potential identification strategies have been treated as substitutes. We argue that the two factors should instead be treated as complementary and develop an alternative and unified IV approach that simultaneously accounts for both settlement conditions and colonizer identity to estimate the potential causal impact of a broad cluster of economic institutions on log real GDP per capita for a sample of former colonies. Using population density in 1500 as a proxy for settlement conditions, we find that the impact of settlement conditions on institutional development is much stronger among former British colonies than colonies of the other major European colonizers. Conditioning on several geographic factors and ethno-linguistic fractionalization, our baseline 2SLS estimates suggest that a standard deviation increase in economic institutions is associated with a three-fourth standard deviation increase in economic development. Our results are robust to a number of additional control variables, country subsample exclusions, and alternative measures of institutions, GDP, and colonizer classifications. We also find evidence that geography exerts both an indirect and direct effect on economic development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We describe trends in trade and openness, investigate the proximate causes of changes in openness and estimate the gains from trade from the early nineteenth century onwards. Our results suggest that the conventional wisdom has to be revised. The first wave of globalization started around 1820 and culminated around 1870. In the next century, trade continued to grow, with the exception of the Great Depression, but openness and gains fluctuated widely. They resumed a clear upward trend from the early 1970s. By 2007, the world was more open than a century earlier and its inhabitants gained from trade substantially more than their ancestors did.","[Federico, Giovanni] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Cosimo Ridolfi 10, Pisa, PI, Italy; [Federico, Giovanni] CEPR, London, England; [Tena-Junguito, Antonio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ciencias Soci, Inst Figuerola, Calle Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",University of Pisa; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Tena-Junguito, A (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ciencias Soci, Inst Figuerola, Calle Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",Giovanni.Federico@unipi.it; antonio.tena@uc3m.es,,"Tena-Junguito, Antonio/0000-0002-7845-5406",European Research Council [230484]; [ECO2011-25713]; [ECO2015/00209/001]; European Research Council (ERC) [230484] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ; ; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Funding was provided by European Research Council Advanced Research Grant (Grant No. 230484) and Spanish Minister of Science and Innovation (Grant Nos.

We also consider the subgroup of the countries related to the income levels and run the panel Granger non-causality tests for heterogeneous panels. The empirical results indicate that there is a bidirectional causal relationship between economic globalization and economic growth. There is also a significant causal relationship that runs from all three indices for the diversification of exports to economic growth. After implementing various robustness checks, we observe that diversification of exports and economic globalization are positively related with economic growth merely in the upper middle economies.","[Gozgor, Giray] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Dept Int Relat, Fac Polit Sci, D-100 Karayolu 98, TR-34000 Kadikoy, Turkey; [Can, Muhlis] Hakkari Univ, TR-30000 Hakkari, Turkey",Istanbul Medeniyet University; Hakkari University,"Gözgör, G (通讯作者)，Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Dept Int Relat, Fac Polit Sci, D-100 Karayolu 98, TR-34000 Kadikoy, Turkey.",giray.gozgor@medeniyet.edu.tr,"Gozgor, Giray/K-1372-2017; Can, Muhlis/AAJ-2187-2020; Can, Muhlis/GLR-4974-2022","Gozgor, Giray/0000-0003-1238-8105; Can, Muhlis/0000-0002-7315-2916; Can, Muhlis/0000-0002-7315-2916",,,,,41,60,61,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In this regard, it has been thought appropriate to perform an analysis on how the migration phenomenon is perceived and an empirical study on the economic impact of migration on receiving countries of the European Union. Thus, a linear model has been used with panel data with specific fixed effects for cross section units, and the database has been made up of the values recorded for GDP per capita influence factors in the 28 EU Member States in the period 2008-2014. The results show that migration has positive effects upon economic development.

While structural transformation, associated with technological progress, productivity catching-up, and capital deepening, has contributed to Asia's sustained growth, its effect on income inequality remains uncertain. Our results show that the process of economic transformation has exacerbated inequality in the region by increasing the relative share of high-skilled workers in total compensation. This is mainly due to a shift toward more productive-and more intensive in the use of skilled labor-activities both within and between industries.

CAUSES AND EFFECTS,AMFITEATRU ECONOMIC,,,English,Article,,,,,,labour market; Romania; minimum wage; unemployment; migration,,"Ensuring the set of rights and freedoms that are part of the Treaty of Accession to the European Union (EU) seems to be a double-edged sword. If in 2000s, these rights and freedoms were the main catalyst for accession to the European common market, currently these rights are generating consistent disputes among the Member States (MS). Geopolitical tensions that currently exist, along with the political changes that have occurred in certain MS have fuelled pessimism and lack of confidence in the ability of the European common market and the EU to deliver smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. We reached a point in which the very elements that underpinned the common market create suspicion regarding the future of the EU. Therefore, some opinions, (especially from politics) are in favour of a restricted or controlled access to these rights and freedoms in order to maintain stability in the EU, and the framework for growth. The significant increase of xenophobia, terrorism threats, migration crisis, populism, nationalism, and the Brexit are all elements covered by the public agenda and exerting a major pressure on the organization and functioning of the EU in general, and especially on the future of the Cohesion Policy. The development scenarios for Europe have been recently publicly released for debate, and they are a consequence of the concerns about the inability of the European development model to remain competitive globally. Our analysis was aimeds at the phenomenon of migration of the Romanian labour force in the frame of the current socio-economic climate; concretely, we made an analysis of the Romanian labour market, focused on social tensions manifested at this level, and on the one hand, and on the other hand, we analysed the minimum wage in Romania and other EU member states, namely the unemployment and the factors that influence it. The information we used came from multiple sources, such as economic literature, recent studies of various national and international bodies; statistical institutes of EU member states, etc. The economic analysis of unemployment has been completed by the utilization of a multiple linear regression model. The research first proposes a set of theoretical and methodological elements and aspects related to migration in general, and to international migration, in particular. Then, the paper analyzes the specificity of the labor market in Romania, proposing a more in-depth analysis of unemployment, which also includes an econometric model. The research enumerates the variables that determine and justify, at the same time, the emigration of Romanian workers. Also, the paper presents aspects related to the administration of the labor market in Romania, the social tensions emerging on this market, and the ratio between the minimum wage and the subsistence expenses. The number of Romanian emigrants is analyzed as well, having as source the diplomatic missions of our country in the host countries, and the national statistical institutes.","[Stoian, Mirela; Ladaru, Georgiana-Raluca; Marin, Florian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stoian, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mirela.stoian@eam.ase.ro,,"Stoian, Mirela/0000-0001-6251-5577; Ladaru, Raluca/0000-0003-2124-7590",,,,,18,0,0,1,24,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2017,19.0,46,,,,,901,917,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413856000020,0

In contrast, the relationship between technology adoption and employment has attracted less interest. This systematic review evaluates the diverse yet sizeable evidence base that has remained below the radars of both reviewers and policy makers. We map the qualitative and empirical evidence and report that the effect of technology adoption on employment is skill biased and more likely to be observed when technology adoption favors product innovation as opposed to process innovation. Technology adoption is also less likely to be associated with employment creation when: (i) the evidence is related to farm employment as opposed to firm/industry employment; (ii) the evidence is related to low-income countries as opposed to lower middle-income or mixed countries; and (iii) the evidence is based on post-2001 data as opposed to pre-2001 data. There is also qualitative evidence indicating that international trade, weak forward and backward linkages, and weaknesses in governance and labor-market institutions tend to weaken the job creating effects of technology adoption. We conclude by calling for compilation of better quality survey data and further attention to sources of heterogeneity in modeling the relationship between technology adoption and employment in LDCs.

Such an effect is widely viewed as an economic benefit for property owners and is key to justifying the high cost of building rail transit infrastructure. In recent years, however, concerns have been raised about rail transit acting as a gentrification trigger and causing the affordability paradox. In this study, I evaluate whether rail transit in suburban Portland caused neighborhood gentrification and reduced home affordability through a longitudinal quasi-experimental design. I use the propensity score matching method to identify control neighborhoods for rail-transit-served neighborhoods. I then make pretest-posttest comparisons between rail-transit served neighborhoods and their control neighborhoods at multiple observation points. In general, I did not find consistent evidence for rail-transit-induced gentrification in suburban Portland. I did not find evidence that rail transit reduced home affordability for tenants and home owners in rail transit-served neighborhoods either. I observed more changes in the neighborhoods served by the Eastside line (the oldest rail transit line in Portland) than their control neighborhoods in the past three decades: socially, they attracted older and less-educated population; physically, they experienced densification and faster increases of the share of rental units in their housing stock. Rail transit was more likely to be installed along low-income neighborhoods in suburban Portland, confirming the necessity of constructing appropriate control neighborhoods while evaluating the neighborhood and social effects of rail transit.","[Dong, Hongwei] Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Geog & City & Reg Planning, 2555 E San Ramon M-S SB69, Fresno, CA 93740 USA",,"Dong, HW (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Geog & City & Reg Planning, 2555 E San Ramon M-S SB69, Fresno, CA 93740 USA.",dhw2010@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,78,92,4,85,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our objective is to provide new evidence based on a unified estimation framework that places particular emphasis on separating the effects of diversification (specialised banks vs. diversified banks) from those of bank type (investment banks vs. commercial banks). Consistent with prior studies, we find a significant diversification discount at the end of the 1990s. Our main finding is that it decreases over time and practically vanishes after the financial crisis. We do not find support for the hypothesis that the diversification effect is influenced by geographical or regulatory factors. The valuation impact of bank characteristics varies over time, particularly in the financial crisis, but this structural break does not explain the observed decrease of the diversification discount. We show that the pre-crisis discount is considerably smaller in a robust regression, which in part is driven by banks with a large share of non-interest income. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using an extensive firm-level dataset from Viet Nam, we use a structural Q model of investment estimated using a generalized method of moments technique. We focus on three aspects of financial development: financial depth, state-owned enterprise (SOE) use of finance and, the degree of market-driven, commercial bank financing in the economy. Our data allow us to measure financial development at the province level, providing rich within-country variation. We find that financial development reduces external financing constraints for firms thus facilitating higher investment activity. Financing constraints are decreasing in credit to the private sector, increasing in the use of finance by SOEs and decreasing in the degree to which finance is allocated on market-terms by commercial banks.","[O'Toole, Conor] Cent Bank Ireland, Financial Stabil Div, Dublin, Ireland; [Newman, Carol] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland; Trinity College Dublin,"O'Toole, C (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Financial Stabil Div, Dublin, Ireland.",,"Newman, Carol/J-6421-2012","Newman, Carol/0000-0002-1785-0891",,,,,84,16,16,4,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Much less clear though is what fundamentally determines communities' social capital, or the way individuals in a society interact. This study analyzes how irrigation practices, a key feature of agricultural organization in India, affect different indicators of social capital. To this end, an informative household survey is combined with detailed historical agricultural statistics on irrigation and grain, cultivation. The depth of the datasets allows for fine-grained analysis of effects of different kinds of irrigation on groups with varying degrees of involvement in the agricultural production process. I show a significant negative influence of specific types of irrigation on the prevalence of conflict and an increased likelihood for attendance of public meetings, yet it is not possible to establish a broad and consistent relationship between agricultural indicators and social capital, which contradicts previous research. Furthermore, specific groups with varying incentive structures based on their land-holding status and agricultural engagement appear to be affected by different kinds of irrigation. The results underline the need for a multidimensional analysis of both social capital and agricultural organization, as well as their interaction. I do not find evidence supporting the rice theory of culture. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, we examine the use of SCVaR to measure risk and set these requirements. Assuming elliptically distributed asset returns, we show that portfolios on the mean-SCVaR frontier generally lie away from the mean-variance (M-V) frontier. In a plausible numerical example, we find that such portfolios tend to have considerably higher ratios of risk (measured by, e.g., standard deviation) to minimum capital requirement than those of portfolios on the M-V frontier. Also, we find that requirements based on SCVaR are smaller than those based on both VaR and SVaR but exceed those based on just VaR. Finally, we find that requirements based on SCVaR are less procyclical than those based on either VaR or both VaR and SVaR. Overall, our paper suggests that the use of SCVaR to measure risk and set requirements is not a panacea.","[Alexander, Gordon J.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Investment Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Alexander, Gordon J.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Finance, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Baptista, Alexandre M.] George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Finance, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; George Washington University,"Alexander, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Investment Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Alexander, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Finance, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",gjalex@umn.edu; alexbapt@gwu.edu,"Baptista, Alexandre M/B-5911-2009","Baptista, Alexandre M/0000-0001-9305-8698",,,,,69,3,3,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In this paper, the EPR means that the producers bear the social disposal cost of packaging waste resulting from households' consumption of their product. Disposal of household packaging waste comprises sorting and treatment operations. Therefore, the social disposal cost is the sum of both the sorting and the dumping costs. We confirm that an EPR is not an optimal policy, and then we show that an optimal policy couples an EPR to two bonus/penalty systems: the first one reduces the sorting cost borne by the producers, the second one affects the dumping cost borne by the producers. This optimal policy entails that the producers bear a disposal cost higher (respectively lower) than the social disposal cost when improving packaging recyclability is cost-reducing (respectively costly).","[Arnaud, Brice] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France",Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Arnaud, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",brice.arnaud@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,14,8,9,4,49,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We test the impact of the tsunami shock on generosity of a sample of Sri Lankan affected/unaffected microfinance borrowers seven years after the event. Specifically, we test the effect of the shock at the extensive margin by comparing damaged with non-damaged individuals in terms of giving and expected giving in a dictator game. Moreover, at the intensive margin, we compare the participants based on the amount of damage experienced and recovery aid received. The advantage of this last comparison is that differences in observables between the groups are minimized. We reduce further identification problems by selecting a random sample of damaged and non-damaged borrowers belonging to the same microfinance organization who are, therefore, likely to share some important common traits that are usually unobservable to researchers. We complete our identification strategy with weighted least squares, instrumental variable estimates and a sensitivity analysis on the exogeneity assumption. The main findings of the paper support the hypothesis that the shock affects participants' preferences in the long run. First, the tsunami negatively affects generosity at the extensive margin as those who suffered at least one damage give and expect less than those who did not. Second, while large recovery assistance does not directly affect giving and expected giving, it increases especially the latter indirectly, i.e., when interacted with the number of damages. Our results reconcile that part of the literature showing evidence of natural shocks having a detrimental effect on social preferences (Fleming, Chong, Alberto, & Bejarano, 2011; Cassar, Grosjean, & Whitt, 2013) with that supporting, instead, a positive link (Solnit, 2009; Whitt & Wilson, 2007; Cassar, Healy, & Von Kessler, 2011). Furthermore, since our study focuses on the long-run impact of a natural disaster, previous results on short-run effects are not necessarily inconsistent with ours. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We consider the dynamic relationship between mental and physical health using a sample of 11,203 individuals in six waves (2002-2013) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). We estimate conditional linear and non-linear random-effects regression models to identify the effects of past physical health, measured by Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and past mental health, measured by the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, on both present physical and mental health. We find that both mental and physical health are moderately state-dependent. Better past mental health increases present physical health significantly. Better past physical health has a larger effect on present mental health. Past mental health has stronger effects on present physical health than physical activity or education. It explains 2.0% of the unobserved heterogeneity in physical health. Past physical health has stronger effects on present mental health than health investments, income or education. It explains 0.4% of the unobserved heterogeneity in mental health. These cross-effects suggest that health policies aimed at specific aspects of health should consider potential spill-over effects.

This weighting scheme has been under strong scrutiny since the MPI's inception, given the sensitivity of country rankings to different weights and indicator choices. Therefore, the current study employs Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) for weighting of the indicators and investigates its impact on the scores and relative ranking of 28 countries. The results show that equal weighting of the three dimensions cannot be statistically justified. Moreover, the statistical weights differ systematically across countries, implying differences in deprivations across regions, although household poverty rankings are highly correlated between normative and statistical weights. Given the high correlation between all indicators employed within the MPI, a large overlap is found in the information, implying that there might not actually be so much multidimensionality within the dimensions of the MPI.

First, we argue that entrepreneurial and industry experiences are positively associated with performance. Second, by combining Lazear's jacks-of-all-trades theory with the cognition and learning literatures, an inverted U-shaped experience diversity-performance relationship is predicted. The hypotheses are tested using data from the US National Labor Survey Youth 1979 and O*NET. We find that industry experience is positively associated with performance, but entrepreneurial experience is negatively related. Moreover, experience diversity measured in terms of skills is found to be positively associated with performance up to a certain threshold. After this threshold, an increase in an entrepreneur's experiential diversity lowers performance. Entrepreneurs with 23 different skills have the highest performance. Furthermore, when depreciating for experience, experience diversity measured in terms of both skills and knowledge is found to be positively related to performance.","[Spanjer, Anne; van Witteloostuijn, Arjen] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Witteloostuijn, Arjen] Antwerp Univ, Antwerp Sch Management, Antwerp, Belgium; [van Witteloostuijn, Arjen] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Tilburg University; University of Antwerp; Cardiff University,"Spanjer, A (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",g.a.spanjer@tilburguniversity.edu,,"van Witteloostuijn, A./0000-0002-0287-5965",Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [407-12-008],Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This study was funded by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (grant number 407-12-008).,,59,21,25,6,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This study uses unique data from Linn County, Oregon and a spatial, difference-in-difference identification strategy to test the impact of the discovery and the subsequent decontamination of clandestine methamphetamine (meth) laboratories (labs) on property values. Results suggest that even though meth labs are typically found in less-desirable neighborhoods with lower home prices, the discovery of a lab causes the price of nearby homes to drop by approximately six and a half percent. Further, the decontamination of homes used as meth labs results in an increase in property values by approximately five percent. Overall, these results suggest that beyond the potential direct benefits of reducing domestic meth production (e.g., reductions in crime, child abuse), disrupting domestic meth production has another important benefit in mitigating negative effects on property values. Also, state laws mandating the decontamination of meth labs and corresponding decontamination programs may yield significant positive net benefits. Finally, the fact that meth lab decontamination does not fully offsets the impact of discovery (homes recover about 75%) suggests a potential stigma effect associated with meth lab discovery.

Despite its size and central position in China's current poverty reduction strategy, little is known about the rural dibao program's performance and targeting effectiveness. Our analysis uses annual household survey data from the China Household Income Project matched with published administrative data for the years 2007-09. We find that the program provides sufficient income to poor beneficiaries but does not substantially reduce the overall level of poverty. Conventional targeting analysis reveals large inclusionary and exclusionary targeting errors; propensity score targeting analysis yields smaller but still large targeting errors. Simulations of possible changes to the program design reveal that expanding coverage can potentially yield greater poverty reduction than increasing transfer amounts. Replacing locally diverse dibao lines and transfer amounts with a nationally uniform dibao threshold and transfer could in theory reduce poverty further, but the potential gains are modest without improvements in targeting. This paper makes several contributions. To our knowledge this is the first household-level empirical analysis of China's dibao program in rural areas, so the findings provide new, policy-relevant information. Moreover, the literature has not settled the question. of whether such programs should be centralized or decentralized. We show that in practice the potential gains of centralizing the eligibility rule and transfer amount are conditional on the efficiency of targeting. By varying the program's key design parameters our analysis also yields insights into alternative policy recommendations to improve the program performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a variety of tests, including two quasi-natural experiments that result in exogenous negative industry cash-flow shocks, we find that firms with higher leverage or distress likelihood have a greater probability of a product recall. These firms also face more frequent and severe recalls. Further, firms with more debt due at the onset of the financial crisis experience a greater likelihood and frequency of recalls. We conclude that a firm's financial condition has real effects that impact product safety.","[Kini, Omesh] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Shenoy, Jaideep] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Storrs, CT USA; [Subramaniam, Venkat] Tulane Univ, AB Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Connecticut; Tulane University,"Subramaniam, V (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, AB Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",vencat@tulane.edu,"Subramaniam, Venkat/A-5193-2011",,,,,,44,49,60,8,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

For these, the authors develop a farm-level dynamic mean-variance model combined with a real options approach. Findings show that the conservation of agroforest is responsive to the risk-aversion level of farmers: the greater the level of risk aversion, the greater is the conserved area of agroforest. However, for all risk-averse farmers, additional incentives in the form of MBIs are still needed to prevent conversion of agroforest over the years, and only the combination of MBIs can achieve this target. Implementing fixed MBIs also contributes to stabilizing farmers' incomes and reducing income risks. Consequently, the combined MBIs increase incomes and reduce income inequality between hardly and extremely risk-averse farmers.","[Djanibekov, Utkur] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ ILR, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Villamor, Grace B.] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Bonn,"Djanibekov, U (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ ILR, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",u.djanibekov@ilr.uni-bonn.de; gracev@uni-bonn.de,,,Landscape Mosaic project; REDD-ALERT project,Landscape Mosaic project; REDD-ALERT project,The authors are grateful for the support of the Landscape Mosaic and REDD-ALERT projects implemented by ICRAF.

Car sharing, a more sustainable mode of mobility to private car ownership, has quietly emerged as a viable and popular alternative to private vehicle travel in numerous cities of the world. This paper brings these two phenomena into conversation. We present a novel exploration of the precise moment in which the decision to start car sharing is made - an event which remains under-researched and little understood. Using a qualitative analysis of interview data to explore the period during which the individual adopts car sharing, we ask: how are transport transitions, particularly the uptake of car sharing, catalysed? We find that disruptions can either be single shocks, or a bundling and re-ordering of existing practices. We propose that willingness and ability as two preconditions that are key to enable transition to new ways of being mobile. Willingness is an embrace of new practices through inevitable teething problems. Ability is an aptitude for alternative practices, as well as access to infrastructure.","[Kent, Jennifer; Dowling, Robyn; Maalsen, Sophia] Univ Sydney, Fac Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Kent, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",jennifer.kent@sydney.edu.au; robyn.dowling@sydney.edu.au; sophia.maalsen@sydney.edu.au,"Maalsen, Sophia/AAS-5984-2020; dowling, robyn/IVH-3565-2023; Kent, Jennifer Lee/AAS-9035-2020","Maalsen, Sophia/0000-0001-6384-0785; Kent, Jennifer Lee/0000-0002-3051-7698; Dowling, Robyn/0000-0001-8998-2685",,,,,56,36,39,3,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Based on structural vector autoregressions that incorporate both monetary and macroprudential policy shocks for four inflation targeting economies in Asia and the Pacific, we analyse the role of each policy shock in explaining deviations from the other policy's objective, by applying historical decompositions. The macroprudential measures used in the study affect credit extended to the private sector. We find that there are periods when macroprudential policy shocks have contributed to pushing inflation away from the central bank's inflation target and when monetary policy shocks have contributed to buoyant credit, suggesting that there have been short-term trade-offs between price and financial stability objectives. However, we also find periods when macroprudential policy shocks helped stabilise inflation and monetary policy shocks contributed to financial stability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The firm faces the project, operational, and hazard risks from its investment projects as well as the financial and longevity risks from its DB plan. The firm maximizes its capital market value net of pension contributions subject to constraints that control project, operational, hazard, financial, and longevity risks as well as an overall risk. The analysis illustrates the importance of integrating pension risk into the firm's ERM program by comparing firm value with and without managing pension risk with other risks in an ERM program. An ERM program considering pension effect integrates the risks of the operation and pension divisions and, thus, achieves diversification benefits between and within these two divisions. We also show how pension hedging strategies can impact the firm's net value under the ERM framework. While the existing literature suggests that a longevity swap is less expensive than a pension buy-out because the latter is more capital intensive, this analysis shows that the buy-out is more effective in increasing firm value.","[Lin, Yijia] Univ Nebraska, Dept Finance, POB 880488, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [MacMinn, Richard D.] Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tian, Ruilin] North Dakota State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Accounting Finance & Informat Syst, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Yu, Jifeng] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; National Chengchi University; North Dakota State University Fargo; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Lin, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Finance, POB 880488, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",yijialin@unl.edu,"Yu, Jifeng/N-4499-2018; MacMinn, Richard D/D-1909-2010; Tian, Ruilin/JZJ-6909-2024",,,,,,30,11,13,3,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We determine the impact of asymmetry on mitigation and SRM activities, concentration of GHGs, and global temperature, and we examinewhether a tradeoff actually emerges between mitigation and SRM.

By making use of the Emerging Portfolio Fund Research database, it estimates asset demand equations for emerging markets' equities and bonds for insurance companies and pension funds from advanced countries. These are estimated by using recent advances in the literature on panel autoregressive distributed lag models. Two key results emerge: firstly, consistent with 'search for yield' investment behaviour, weaker balance sheet conditions, measured by the lower funding level of pension funds, positively affect the asset allocation to emerging markets. Secondly, the accumulation of reserves by emerging markets is a significant attractor of foreign institutional investment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We compare American metropolitan areas with analogous geographic units in Brazil, China and India. Both Gibrat's Law and Zipf's Law seem to hold as well in Brazil as in the U.S., but China and India look quite different. In Brazil and China, the implications of the spatial equilibrium hypothesis, the central organizing idea of urban economics, are not rejected. The India data, however, repeatedly rejects tests inspired by the spatial equilibrium assumption. One hypothesis is that spatial equilibrium only emerges with economic development, as markets replace social relationships and as human capital spreads more widely. In all four countries there is strong evidence of agglomeration economies and human capital externalities. The correlation between density and earnings is stronger in both China and India than in the U.S., strongest in China. In India the gap between urban and rural wages is huge, but the correlation between city size and earnings is more modest. The cross-sectional relationship between area-level skills and both earnings and area-level growth are also stronger in the developing world than in the U.S. The forces that drive urban success seem similar in the rich and poor world, even if limited migration and difficult housing markets make it harder for a spatial equilibrium to develop.

To this end, we adopt a number of nonlinear unit root tests and propose a new test for the null hypothesis of a unit root against the alternative hypothesis that encompasses the asymmetric adjustment and two smooth breaks in the trend at the same time. Among the main results, it is found that the hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected for the logarithm of the dividend yields of these stock markets based on the conventional linear unit root tests. However, empirical results favor the presence of a structural break for the indexes of the DAX 30, FTSE Denmark and Nikkei 500. With the exception of BEL 20, the empirical results do not demonstrate strong evidence of an asymmetric adjustment for the logarithm of the dividend yield, implying that the hypothesis of the periodically collapsing bubbles is not empirically verified for these stock markets.","[Chen, Shyh-Wei] Tunghai Univ, Dept Int Business, Taiwan 1727,Sec4,Taiwan Blvd, Taichung 40704, Taiwan; [Xie, Zixiong] Jinan Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Inst Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev Res, Coll Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Tunghai University; Jinan University,"Xie, ZX (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Inst Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev Res, Coll Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",shyhwei.chen@gmail.com; zixiong.xie@gmail.com,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 105-2410-H-029-002],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"We would like to thank the editor, Professor Hamid Beladi, and an anonymous referee of this journal for helpful comments and suggestions.

The analysis is based on a New Keynesian model with a financial sector and a financial friction a la Gertler and Karadi (2011). When the friction affects the financing of all factors of production equally, macroprudential policy is shown to be a powerful additional tool, fully eliminating inefficiencies, regardless of the source of the shock and no matter whether the central bank and the regulator cooperate. But when trade-offs are present and policy is discretionary, the institutional arrangements become crucial. While coordination leads to higher welfare than a setting in which each authority takes the decision rule of the other as given (namely, the Nash equilibrium), our analysis shows that a noncooperative setting in which the macroprudential authority acts as a leader within the period can be superior to cooperation. Finally, our conclusions are unaffected by whether the macroprudential instrument affects funding costs or acts as a liquidity requirement.","[De Paoli, Bianca] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Paustian, Matthias] Fed Reserve Board, Div Res & Stat, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"De Paoli, B (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA.",bianca.depaoli@ny.frb.org; matthias.o.paustian@frb.gov,,,,,,,29,56,59,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Our results demonstrate the importance that government pay attention to regional heterogeneity when formulating childcare policy and also suggest that a combination of better access to childcare, together with other pro-family measures, is needed to support Japanese women in the early-career demands of balancing work and family.

Using residential billing data for electricity and natural gas over 11 years, the analysis is based on comparisons between residences constructed just before and just after a building code change in Florida. While an earlier study using 3 years of data for the same residences showed savings for both electricity and natural gas, new results show an enduring savings for natural gas only. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for all sources of energy consumption when conducting evaluations of building codes. More broadly, the results provide a counterpoint to the growing literature casting doubt on whether ex ante forecasts of energy efficiency policies and investments can provide useful information about actual energy savings. Indeed, more than a decade after Florida's energy code change, the measured energy savings still meets or exceeds the forecasted amount.","[Kotchen, Matthew J.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kotchen, Matthew J.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kotchen, MJ (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Kotchen, MJ (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",matthew.kotchen@yale.edu,,,,,,,15,31,33,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

These gendered patterns of production and reproduction, while central to Asia's neoliberal 'miracle' economies, have also generated powerful discourses that devalue women and their work. Drawing on case studies from across the region, this paper examines the links between these globalising dynamics and provocative local depictions of Asian women as active, desiring, and immoral. These gendered morality tales' reveal the complex cultural and ideological work that sustains neoliberal models of national economic development.

We derive closed-form results for the value of risky debt, credit spread, default threshold, and for optimal capital structure with moral hazard. The numerical results indicate that the firm issues more debt with higher coupon ex ante and defaults earlier ex post than without manager moral hazard. The different initial values of firms' cash flow induce different risk preferences of the manager to his value and consequently the manager acts in the opposite approaches especially when the firm is on the verge of bankruptcy.

Using establishment-level data on workplace safety from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, we document significantly higher injury/illness rates in firms that meet or just beat analyst forecasts compared to firms that miss or comfortably beat analyst forecasts. The higher injury/illness rates in firms that meet or just beat analyst forecasts are associated with both increases in employee workloads and in abnormal reductions of discretionary expenses. The relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety is stronger when there is less union presence, when workers' compensation premiums are less sensitive to injury claims, and among firms with less government business.

We analyse 10 European Union (EU) life insurance markets over the post-deregulation period 1999-2011. The results indicate that competition increases the soundness of the EU life insurance markets. Since the Boone indicator measures competition based on the reallocation of profits from inefficient insurers to efficient ones, our results suggest that efficiency is the mechanism through which competition contributes to insurer solvency.

Self-selection implies that households locate in places that provide them with conducive conditions for their preferred way of travelling. In these studies, it is assumed that attitudes toward different travel modes are an important factor in location choice, and that households are unconstrained in choosing their preferred residential location. This paper challenges these assumptions, by distinguishing between the more passive travel attitude and travel considerations as a deliberate reason to locate in a certain place. Based on a survey among 355 recently relocated households in Dutch TOD locations, we find that the association between travel attitude and residential environment is weak, and that the association between travel attitude and travel as a factor in location choice is moderate at best. Multivariate models show that both travel attitude and travel being a reason for location choice influence travel mode use, suggesting that travel attitude is insufficient to fully reflect selfselection processes. In comparison to other travel modes, train travel is most influenced by the fact whether residents deliberately chose to live in an environment conducive to using this mode. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The study reveals that climate change adversely affects mainly downstream Egypt and to a lesser extent Sudan, while it results in a limited impact in the upstream countries Ethiopia and the Equatorial Lakes region, where irrigated agriculture is still limited. The economic consequences for Egypt are especially substantial if the river basin countries pursue a unilateral irrigation development strategy. In order to prevent water use conflicts and ease water scarcity conditions, a cooperative water development strategy is needed as well as economic diversification in favor of less water-intensive sectors, combined with investments in water-saving infrastructure and improved irrigation efficiency.","[Kahsay, Tewodros Negash; Kuik, Onno] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kahsay, Tewodros Negash; Van Der Zaag, Pieter] UNESCO IHE, Delft, Netherlands; [Brouwer, Roy] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Brouwer, Roy] Univ Waterloo, Water Inst, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Van Der Zaag, Pieter] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo; Delft University of Technology,"Kahsay, TN (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Kahsay, TN (通讯作者)，UNESCO IHE, Delft, Netherlands.",t.n.kahsay@vu.nl,"Kuik, Onno/K-9530-2013; van der Zaag, Pieter/B-8247-2008; Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Kuik, Onno/0000-0001-7495-2934; van der Zaag, Pieter/0000-0002-1215-2656; Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050",,,,,51,9,9,8,34,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Furthermore, it analyzes the upside and downside short-and long-run risk spillovers between oil and stock markets by quantifying three market risk measures, namely the value at risk (VaR), conditional VaR (CoVaR) and the delta CoVaR (6.CoVaR). The results show that there is a tail dependence between oil and all stock markets for the raw return series. By considering time horizons, we show that there is an average dependence between the considered markets for the short-run horizons. However, the tail dependence is also found for the long-run horizons between the oil and stock markets, with the exception of the S&P500 index which exhibits average dependence with the oil market. Moreover, we find strong evidence of up and down risk asymmetric spillovers from oil to stock markets and vice versa in the short-and long run horizons. Finally, the market risk spillovers are asymmetric over the time and investment horizons. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this paper is to compare the seasonality in the tourist activities from Romania and Bulgaria and, on this basis, to define the tourist profile of these countries. We consider that our approach draws the attention to a few elements. We selected a representative indicator for the tourist traffic, i.e. the total number of overnight stays, per three categories (total number, resident and non-resident). Moreover, we processed a comprehensive database (made up of the monthly values of these indicators, from January 2005 to December 2016) through a combination of methods (moving average method and graphic method), using EViews as a software support. Each indicator provided information on different but complementary aspects in terms of understanding seasonality. The interpretation, by aggregating the results obtained for each indicator, was the basis for a detailed and comparative analysis of the seasonality in the tourist activities from Romania and Bulgaria. The research results can draw the attention of the tourism decision makers at national level, in designing a strategy for the attenuation of seasonality in tourist activities, but also of the economic agents that carry out tourist activities. The paper also constitutes an interdisciplinary case study, useful in higher education teaching.","[Aivaz, Kamer-Ainur; Juganaru, Ion Danut; Juganaru, Mariana] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Constanta, Romania",Ovidius University,"Aivaz, KA (通讯作者)，Ovidius Univ Constanta, Constanta, Romania.",kamer_aivaz@yahoo.com; mjuganaru@univ-ovidius.ro,"Juganaru, Ion Danut/AAC-2632-2021",,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,FILODIRITTO PUBLISHER,BOLOGNA,"INFOROMATICA SRL, VIA CASTIGLIONE, 81, BOLOGNA, 40124, ITALY",,,978-88-95922-97-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,6,14,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6KN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426793600001,0

These indicators are presented in the form of the coefficients. For the sustainable development of the vertically-integrated association of enterprises, it is necessary to monitor the performance indicators of current (operating), financial and investing activities constantly. This monitoring should be carried out at the level of organizations (enterprises), sectors and the integrated association of enterprises as a whole.

We develop and quantify a multi-city general equilibrium model to address this question at three different levels: Do spatial frictions matter for the city-size distribution? Do they affect individual city sizes? Do they contribute to the productivity advantage of large cities and the toughness of competition in cities? The short answers are: no; yes; and it depends.

We show that the CA achieved the goal of increasing transparency: investors were able to detect weak banks at the announcement of the procedure (23rd October 2013), but gained full information on the amount of the capital shortfall only at the disclosure of the results (26th October 2014). Furthermore, at the official launch of the SSM (4th November 2014), banks under direct European Central Bank (ECB) supervision registered a more negative market reaction with respect to banks maintaining their national supervisors. Using a regression model including possible confounders and allowing for treatment effect heterogeneity, this negative reaction is confirmed. These findings suggest that, at least in the short run, investors penalized banks subject to direct ECB supervision, probably because of the fear of regulatory inconsistencies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the case study of the company Goodbaby. The primary data sources are two semi-structured interviews with one of the firm's managers, which have been triangulated with point of sale visits, interviews with industry experts, and secondary data such as corporate records, patent and trademark data, industry reports and news articles. Findings - Both the home-country and foreign markets act as sources of learning to support the development of CFs' marketing capabilities. Learning at home is triggered by the complexity of the national market and the exposure to foreign entrants. Foreign learning is stimulated by the relationships with leading foreign partners and the exposure to advanced final markets. Moreover, each learning source has a positive effect on the development of CFs' marketing capabilities in both market contexts in which they compete, i.e. the home-market and international markets. Practical implications - CFs' managers should be simultaneously receptive to the domestic and foreign contexts, as both may support the development of marketing capabilities. CFs' managers should recognize the learning opportunities embedded in each of these contexts, and identify the markets where these can be effectively redeployed. Originality/value - The authors distinguish between different sources of learning in the context of CFs' internationalization, and explore their triggering factors and their role in the development of an underinvestigated type of capabilities, i.e. the marketing capabilities.","[Checchinato, Francesca; Hu, Lala; Perri, Alessandra; Vescovi, Tiziano] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Checchinato, F (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Venice, Italy.",f.checchinato@unive.it,"Checchinato, Francesca/HZL-2607-2023","Checchinato, Francesca/0000-0002-0248-9001; Hu, Lala/0000-0001-5492-3706",,,,,76,6,7,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

However, in a global environment where economic growth is sluggish, the French government has to face with tremendous pressure, both inside and out, and the reform process is still struggling.","[Chen, Lu] Harbin Univ Commerce, Sch Econ, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lu] Harbin Univ Commerce, Sch Foreign Language, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Harbin University of Commerce; Harbin University of Commerce,"Chen, L (通讯作者)，Harbin Univ Commerce, Sch Econ, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.;Chen, L (通讯作者)，Harbin Univ Commerce, Sch Foreign Language, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",chenluhit@sina.com,,,,,,,1,2,2,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,4,7,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200002,0

A.P. standard in the environmental area and sustainable agriculture in the CR with emphasis on fruit producers. Its partial goal includes evaluation of discrepancies of environmental nature according to the GLOBALG. A.P. standard by inspecting domestic fruit producers' certification. The methodology is based on summarizing, synthesizing and analyzing the protocols containing the findings from the conducted certification audits of the GLOBALG. A. P. standard between 2007 and 2015 in 25fruit-producing enterprises in total. The number is limited by the number of the certified subjects in the given period. Overall, 285 environmental discrepancies have been identified. The conducted analysis suggests that, during the period of the enterprise's continuous retention of certification, the number of discrepancies within the framework of environmental aspects of agricultural activity of the GLOBALG. A. P. standard has been continually decreasing (from 68% in 2008 to 15% of overall discrepancies in 2015). A significant number of these deficiencies that is the failure to fulfil the requirements of the GLOBALG. A. P. standard, can be characterized as conflicting with the legal code of the CR. The potential value of sanctions per producer based on the discrepancies discovered has been calculated. Their extent on average and in total for individual sub-areas reaches liquidating amounts for producers. However, it has been confirmed that continual application of the GLOBALG. A. P. standard reduces the occurrence of such sanctioned discrepancies and thus contributes to the creation of competitive advantage for certified fruit producers in Czech and consequently European agricultural conditions.","[Dedina, Daniel; Sanova, Petra] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic; [Laputkova, Adriana] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Languages, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Dedina, D (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic.",dedina@pef.czu.cz; sanova@pef.czu.cz; laputkova@pef.czu.cz,"Laputkova, Adriana/AAV-7801-2020; Sanova, Petra/K-6669-2015","Laputkova, Adriana/0000-0001-6483-9081; Sanova, Petra/0000-0001-7175-5118",,,,,21,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,49,56,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400006,0

In order to answer this, the purpose of creating a decision-making model to support the management decisions of an agricultural company is taken into consideration. Seven strategic objectives were identified, operationalized by 57 performance indicators, for the levels of reference set by the decision maker; fourteen performance indicators are at a compromising level, showing the need for intervention.

To test these predictions, we use a large panel of firms in 41 countries with heterogeneous debt enforcement characteristics. Consistent with our model, we find that the relation between debt enforcement and firms' investment and risk depends on the firm-specific probability of default. A differences-indifferences analysis of firms' investment and risk taking in response to bankruptcy reforms that make debt more renegotiable confirms the cross-country evidence.

To test this hypothesis, we use banic-level data from the UK-a country at the heart of the global financial system. Our results suggest that increases in microprudential capital requirements tend to reduce international bank lending and some forms of unconventional monetary policy can amplify this effect. Specifically, the UK's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) significantly amplified the effects of increased capital requirements on cross-border lending. Quantitative easing did not appear to have a similar effect and countries with stronger prudential capital regulations were partially insulated against the effects of these changes in UK policy. We find that this interaction between micro prudential regulations and the FLS can explain roughly 30% of the contraction in aggregate UK cross-border bank lending between mid-2012 and end-2013, corresponding to around 10% of the global contraction in cross-border lending. This suggests that unconventional monetary policy designed to support domestic lending can have the unintended consequence of reducing foreign lending. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This article explores the extent to which the homeownership experience for families who purchased homes between 2004 and 2008 is a potentially important factor in explaining this finding. During the housing boom, the increase in homeownership for Blacks and Hispanics was very similar, but the second group had a smaller decline. Despite these differences, the Great Recession was far more destructive for these minorities regardless of income. Logit regressions show that underwriting standards and loan structure explain a significant amount of the non-White-White gap in foreclosures. However, geographic concentration was most significant in explaining the gap for Hispanic borrowers. Despite accounting for these factors, sizable gaps in the likelihood of foreclosure remain between Blacks and Hispanics relative to Whites.

Resilience depends on effectively managing the contradictions of the ESM. Flexicurity is an example of managing contradictions between security and flexibility. The contribution of flexicurity to the resilience of the ESM is determined by the development of the abilities necessary for resilience. Our research evaluates the performance of these abilities using statistical and document analyses. The results show that flexicurity policies perform satisfactorily relative to their resilience abilities. Still, the ability to respond is less effective due to significant differences among the Member States (regarding the implementation of flexicurity policies) and to insufficient openness and functionality of the European labour market. Nevertheless, the European flexicurity policies redefine the ESM by adding a touch of a more mobile, autonomous and free-spirited approach, thus representing a solution to both preserve valuable tradition and modernise the ESM.","[Ghebrea, Georgeta] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Ghebrea, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",georgeta.ghebrea@fspub.unibuc.ro,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,1,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",2392-8867,2393-2384,978-606-714-428-4,EURINT,,,2017,,,,,,,72,89,,,,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BK0YX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393300004,0

The empirical results show that with the exception of South Korea, Free countries exhibited no significant causality running from most dimensions of governance to economic growth. For Partly Free countries, with the exception of Indonesia and Thailand, rule of law Granger causes economic growth. As for Not Free countries, there exists a significant causality running from most dimensions of governance, especially for government effectiveness and rule of law, to economic growth. Generally speaking, various dimensions of governance lead to more significant economic growth in Not Free countries when compared to Free and Partly Free countries. The findings of this study indicate that policy makers in Not Free countries should opt to pay more attention on the quality of governance, specifically around government effectiveness and rule of law, in order to promote the future growth rate of real GDP per capita.

Given that BiH has been experiencing a decline or a slight growth of gross domestic product (GDP) for several years, along with steady growth in external debt and inadequate growth in tax revenues and exports, the growing debt of BiH will, in the coming period, most likely lead to an increasing budget deficit, i.e. the discrepancies between total public revenues and public expenditures. In order for fiscal policy to be long-term sustainable, these two fiscal variables need to be in balance, i.e. to co-integrate with each other or revenues exceed expenditures. On these stands and facts that intuitively suggest that the current fiscal policy of BiH is long-term unsustainable, the hypothesis of research is based. The empirical analysis, using the co-integration tests used in dynamic time series analysis, verified the consistency of this assertion. As for the analysis of fiscal sustainability (primarily long-term sustainability), a co-integration analysis will be used by determining the long-term relationship between state revenues and state expenditures.","[Huric-Bjelan, Jasmina] Tax Adm Federat BiH, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",,"Huric-Bjelan, J (通讯作者)，Tax Adm Federat BiH, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",jasmina.huric@libero.it,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,171,188,,,,,,18,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900010,0

That a child is most appropriately raised in a family environment, without interference of the outer subjects, is also an underlying principle of the Slovak legislation related to the child care and child rights protection. However, there are occasions when the safety or upbringing of a child may be seriously endangered and when removal of a child from its birth family becomes unavoidable. In these cases, the system of public care for children plays critical role. The Slovak system adopted several forms of alternative care to temporarily replace original family and substitute for the primal parental care. The objective of the paper is to emphasize positive achievement in the Slovak system of the substitute care, in terms of a change in the structure of the provision of alternative care for children. The paper advocates for a transition towards more family-like forms of substitute care, even when the institutional/residential form was necessary. Examining recent statistics, we aim to indicate that the process of deinstitutionalisation of the substitute care is already (and successfully) underway in Slovakia. Besides this, the topic of alternative care is supplemented here by the wider (demographic and economic) context of the changing family behaviour (as a part of larger societal change); and the paper points out particularly the most profound features of these changes.","[Hvozdikova, Veronika] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia",Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Hvozdíková, V (通讯作者)，Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia.",veronika.hvozdikova@savba.sk,"Hvozdíková, Veronika/HOF-1935-2023","Hvozdíková, Veronika/0009-0005-8339-8556",VEGA (Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic) [2/0182/17]; VEGA (Scientific Grant Agency of Slovak Academy of Sciences) [2/0182/17]; IVF (International Visegrad Fund) [21650186],VEGA (Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic)(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); VEGA (Scientific Grant Agency of Slovak Academy of Sciences); IVF (International Visegrad Fund),This paper was supported by VEGA (Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic and of Slovak Academy of Sciences) under the project contract [nr. 2/0182/17] and by IVF (International Visegrad Fund) under the contract [nr. 21650186].,,6,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,298,308,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700032,0

One of them is the proces of better understanding the very dynamic customer needs; this involves that a high quality for goods and services does not only mean they provide higher satisfaction in a classical way, but they generate experiences. Specific literature reveal that creating memorable events can become one of the most competitive advantage for companies. Nowadays, higher education institutions have to become more and more attractive to potential candidates and even to new coming students. It is no longer true the fact that having a certain number of students as new entrants means aproximately the same number of graduates. Fluctuations affect the annual number of students because of many reasons - difficulty to accomodate in another city, financial issues when the city is more expensive than the home town, the profile of study is not what he or she expected to be etc. Since information and communication have accelerated the knowledge, new generations of students have developed higher standards about what they get, no matter what it is about - goods or services, including education. Therefore, in order to become more attractive, higher education institutions must look for a new type of competitive advantage. A solution to this is the investment in the customer capital. In the quality management approach, students are the higher education institutions' clients. Therefore, customer capital becomes student capital. The purpose of this paper is to reveal the importance of the student capital in the proces of creating a high competitive advantage for higher education institutions. The main objectives of the paper are: to define and describe the student capital, to identify the perceptions of the young generation on short and long term about student-higher education institution relationship and to reveal strategic decisions for effective management and leadership in higher education institutions.","[Iordache-Platis, Magdalena] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Iordache-Platis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",magdalena.platis@unibuc.ro,"Platis, Magdalena Iordache/AAJ-5337-2021",,,,,,11,2,2,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,133,141,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000017,0

The results indicate that the market for fresh mushrooms is larger than that for processed mushrooms. However, the market for processed mushrooms has a larger portion of potential consumers which might indicate more potential if appropriate marketing strategies are applied. The results also suggest that the decisions to participate in the market or not and the consumption frequency are driven by structurally different factors.

As changing potential sellers is easier than ever in the online environment, companies should optimize their website based on the customers' preferences in order to provide them with the experience that will drive the growth in purchases and generated profit. The main objective of this paper is to determine factors that affect the consumers' willingness to purchase product from an online store in the condition of Slovak market. We administered a survey questionnaire among 232 university students in order to make them evaluate the criteria they tend to when purchasing online. Afterwards, we conducted principal components analysis in order to reduce the number of these criteria and create meaningful factors (components). Although we needed to exclude several variables from analysis, we were able to extract 7 components that explains almost 80% of the variance in the data: the factor of price, availability, social proof, scarcity, product details, conditions and social media activity.

We measure the effectiveness of a firm's internal control system based on the material weakness disclosure under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Using several measures to capture different dimensions of product market competition, we find that firms operating in competitive markets are more likely to have material weakness under Section 404 of the SOX; further, they are more inclined to disclose multiple internal control weaknesses. These results are robust after controlling for both internal and external governance mechanisms. The results indicate that market competition reduces the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and hampers the quality of a firm's information environment.","[Kim, Seon Mi] Chonnam Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Gwangju, South Korea; [Kim, Yura] Univ Seoul, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Chonnam National University; University of Seoul,"Kim, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Seoul, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea.",yurak0@uos.ac.kr,,,,,,,50,9,13,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The objective of this study is to identify the best performing healthcare system among the states of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). For this purpose, the public health status has been assessed on the basis of three health indicators expressed as a composite health index. Next, the relative efficiency of CEE states has been evaluated using a Data Envelopment Analysis. The study clearly indicated the Czech Republic as the state consistently achieving excellent results both in health status of its population as well as in terms of efficiency.

The structure of employment and gender-based employment problems in Yekaterinburg megacity is analyzed further. The professional structure of women's employment is described, and the indicators of female unemployment are analyzed. Then the methods used for conducting the author's research are justified. The study was conducted using the questionnaire in two stages. At the first stage, women with children younger than three years were surveyed in Yekaterinburg, at the second stage -a survey of employers' representatives was conducted. Directors of 10 companies in Yekaterinburg took part in the study. A women's survey revealed their attitudes toward work and women's employment; preferences for the end of maternity leave; the difficulties in the course of employment and the organization of childcare; the most effective assistance measures in hiring. In the process of interviewing employers, it was found out that there was gender discrimination in hiring. The discussion revealed the main stop-factors in the development of employment of women with children. In conclusion, a contradiction among such factors as the shortage of skilled labor resources, the desire of women with children to work and the reluctance of employers to employ them for discriminatory reasons was determined.","[Kulkova, Inna A.; Plutova, Mariia I.] USUE, Dept Labor Econ & HR Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia",,"Kulkova, IA (通讯作者)，USUE, Dept Labor Econ & HR Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",i.a.koulkova@mail.ru; MPlutova@yandex.ru,"Kulkova, Inna/H-5953-2015",,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,386,391,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600064,0

We first extend existing theory and show that offsets allow a reduction in effective environmental pollution levels while not necessarily extending the consumption of a polluting good. We further discuss the impact of an increased environmental preference on purchases of offsets and mitigation activities. Several theoretical results are then econometrically tested using a novel dataset on activities to reduce emissions for the case of vehicle purchases in the U.S. and Germany. We show that environmental preference triggers the stated use of offsetting and mitigation channels in both countries. However, we find strong country differences for the stated purchase of offsets. While such activities are mainly triggered by a high general awareness of the climate change problem in the U.S., the perception that road travel is responsible for emissions to a large extent is more important for driver's license holders in Germany.","[Lange, Andreas] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Ziegler, Andreas] Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 5, D-34109 Kassel, Germany",University of Hamburg; Universitat Kassel,"Lange, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",andreas.lange@wiso.uni-hamburg.de; andreas.ziegler@uni-kassel.de,,,,,,,23,13,14,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Although it is argued that there does not exist a specific family type which leads to vulnerability, most experts agree that there are some types which have a higher possibility of being vulnerable - the most noticeable of them are families with single parents and families with many children. Discussions are also related to the specific vulnerability of migrant families and families who include members in need, especially disabled children. (Mynarska et al., 2016, Mynarska et al., 2015) The aim of the study is to analyse the relationship between these factors in the context of Latvia. The research shows how different socio-economic factors of the woman influence the poverty risk of her family. Data and methods: 10 877 women whose first child was born in 2006 and their families are included in the study cohort and observed in ten years' period. The preliminary results show a significant correlation between the vulnerability risk and the level of educational attainment of the woman The vulnerability risk is similar in families with one to three children, and it increases starting from the fourth child. In single mother's families, state benefits are important. In Latvia, it is not possible to see a link between vulnerability risk and a past of immigration. In families with disabled children, the level of income does not differ from other families; however, they have larger expenses and other risks of vulnerability. A continuity of vulnerability from one generation to the next in relation to the level of educational attainment can be seen, but the level of educational attainment of the woman is more related to the level of educational attainment of her spouse than the level of educational attainment of her parents. The analysis is based on data from the Population and Housing Census 2011, the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs, the Ministry of Education and the State Revenue Service.","[Lece, Kristine] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Lece, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,315,321,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400032,0

(2) For left-behind children of different genders, there are significant differences between male and female students ((t=1.991, P<0.05), and girls need special guidance. There was no significant difference between genders for non-left-behind children (t=0.957, P>0.05). Conclusion: in the future teaching, attention should be paid to the left-behind children' learning anxiety, especially the correct guidance to the female left-behind children.","[Li, Xiaofang] Yanan Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Yanan, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Yanan University,"Li, XF (通讯作者)，Yanan Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Yanan, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",1765229450@QQ.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,2,56,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,209,212,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200045,0

The human capital theory postulates that investment in education enhances the productive capacity of individuals, while according to the signalling hypothesis the value of a graduation diploma follows from the fact that it signals innate abilities of its holder. We apply the approach proposed by Wiles to test for the signalling hypothesis and, in particular, to find out if there is a positive relation between education and productivity. For this purpose, we construct a job match index based on information if school provided knowledge and skills are useful at work and the job performed is relevant to the field of study. Then we check if the quality of job matching is related to wages of graduates in Poland. To answer this question, a wage equation was estimated using OLS on the basis of data from a representative, nationwide tracer survey of Poles who left secondary schools or graduated from higher education institutions over the period of 1998-2005. We find out that knowledge and skills acquired in the course of formal education bring wage benefits only to university graduates. Besides, this group receives a wage premium, which may be attributed to their high innate abilities. In sum, the outcomes are consistent with the weak signalling hypothesis, since they show that tertiary education signals a high level of innate abilities and at the same time it provides knowledge and skills which enhance individual productivity at work. Besides, we find evidence of the strong signalling hypothesis with regard to the secondary vocational schools leavers.","[Liwinski, Jacek] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Liwinski, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Liwiński, Jacek/H-3350-2018","Liwiński, Jacek/0000-0002-3572-2973",,,,,20,0,0,0,4,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-32-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,189,201,,10.20472/EFC.2017.007.011,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6MP,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854900011,0

The amendment to the Waters Act in preparation, along with other amendments, will lead to increased prices of water and sewerage charges, thereby being reflected in household expenditures. The effect of the changes in preparation is examined in the article among the lowest-income households in the South Bohemian Region. Based on micro models, it turns out that the lowest decile of households in the South Bohemian Region would expend an additional 0.5-1% of its incomes on water after all the changes are adopted. The impacts on different cities in this region differ the most due to existing infrastructure and wastewater treatment technologies. The presented results thus bring a more accurate estimate of the impacts than those presented by the study of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, based on average data for the entire country.

According to the experience of the United States and Britain, standard automobile extended warranty insurance is an inevitable trend in the future. There is an urgent need to design an actuarial approach to rating for it. Given the selective samples with left truncated and right censored data, translate repeatable failure process into unrepeatable survival process by assuming that system failure process is a renewal process. It is very difficult to combine warranty data from manufacturer with actuarial pricing approach from insurer, resulting in limited sample data which has stunted the development of extended warranty actuarial science. To tackle this problem, this paper creates a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate posterior parameters of system survival time which is assumed to follow Weibull distribution based on MCMC methods. In second hierarchy, following the mature principle of pricing for vehicle insurance, estimate system survival time according to properties of the policyholders, the insured objects and the geographic region. However, too many factors introduced will lead to the lack of data in many cells and even the curse of dimensionality and operability is not strong. Create a Weibull mixed-effects model of which fixed effects include region, model and system to describe the differences among cells and random effects describe all the other factors as Gamma distributed individual heterogeneity. Moreover, limited sample data results in failure in identification of competitive risk among parts in the same system. Before translating system survival time into times of failures within the time specified, proper adjustments need to be made to parameters of the distribution of system survival time. Then the actuarial approach can be made based on failure times and average maintenance costs. An empirical study is done to price a two-year automobile extended warranty base on real data from some authorized dealer. A detailed MTTF ( Mean Time to Failure) and rating for 2 regions and 8 models comprehensive automobile extended warranty contract between 3 and 5 years is presented by SAS and Winbugs. MTTF ranges from 387 days to 417 days and the premium ranges from 2479 to 8878 which are both close to reality. The innovations of this paper are as followed: firstly, it creates a hierarchical Bayesian model based on selective samples to estimate the distribution of system survival time with a further Weibull mixed effects model introduced which indicates that this paper, integrating information from sample and priori based on Bayesian analysis, is actually a perfect unification of two main types of actuarial pricing approaches, that is, GLM and credibility model, which is able to avoid over penalty and rewards effectively. Secondly, it realizes the estimation of non-normal distributed random effects in Weibull mixed effects model, assuming that individual random effects are under Gamma distribution, which makes a progress in comparison with previous papers. Thirdly, considering competitive risk, it makes proper adjustments to posterior parameters. Results of Bayesian MCMC methods based on Gibbs sampling indicate that this method is of better convergence. This paper provides a practical way to rate for automobile extended warranty contract and offers support of actuarial pricing for the promotion of related insurance.","[Mao Yu] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Insurance & Econ, Room 809,Bo Xue Bldg,10 Huixin Dongjie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Mao, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Insurance & Econ, Room 809,Bo Xue Bldg,10 Huixin Dongjie, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",yuyinfengting@163.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,5,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,423,436,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700029,0

We measured the affordability of pension benefits in terms of governments' ability to make the required contributions based on existing tax and revenue bases. We conducted a historical analysis of government pension contributions at national and state level over a 20-year period 1992-2011 and found that the real pension burdens have increased over this period. We also found substantial variation in pension burdens among the 50 states. The results of our empirical analysis showed that employee contribution share, investment return, size of the public workforce, and pension benefit level had significant effects on pension burdens. Based on these findings, we proposed several strategies for reducing pension burdens, including increasing employee pension contribution, reducing size of workforce, and improving pension investment performance.","[Peng, Jun] Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policyn, 315 Social Sci, Tucson, AZ USA; [Wang, Qiushi] Rutgers Univ Newark, Sch Publ Affairs & Adm, 111 Washington St, Newark, NJ 07102 USA",University of Arizona; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark,"Wang, QS (通讯作者)，Rutgers Univ Newark, Sch Publ Affairs & Adm, 111 Washington St, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",qshwang@rutgers.edu,,,,,,,33,7,9,2,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

In addition, it attempts to evaluate the different wage systems observed in reality and better understand under which conditions they are reformed. It does so by contrasting the experience of two extreme cases representing fast and slow reform advance, East Germany and North Kazakhstan. The primary data for the analysis comes from cross-sectional farm surveys conducted by various researchers in both countries. East German farmers quickly replaced the inherited Soviet-style piece rate payment system by simple time rate schemes, augmented by wage premia for certain performance parameters, especially in livestock. To the contrary, the piece rate approach persists in many farms in North Kazakhstan. Moreover, the latter rarely use non-wage incentives to motivate their workers. In Kazakhstan, farms using either mixed systems or pure piece rates were more productive than the reference group using pure time rates. Labour cost per worker were lowest for pure time rate systems in both countries, followed by mixed bonus systems, whereas pure piece rate systems implied the highest cost in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstani managers tend to move away from the Soviet piece rate system if external investors become engaged in farming operations.","[Petrick, Martin] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Petrick, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",petrick@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019; Petrick, Martin/AAI-1154-2020",,,,,,33,9,10,0,7,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

This paper shows that zero time preference does not restrict present consumption to nil even if positive interest rate enables future consumption to be very large. Dynamic neoclassical model is applied to confirm that low intertemporal elasticity of substitution leads to positive present consumption even in the case of patient consumers. Determinants of the optimum present consumption are derived, and it is proved that labour income might not be increasing over time to confirm the approach of Olson and Bailey and to disprove the Mises theory.","[Potuzak, Pavel] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Potuzak, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Potuzak, Pavel/C-2954-2019","Potuzak, Pavel/0000-0003-2561-5768",,,,,12,1,1,0,2,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-32-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,296,310,,10.20472/EFC.2017.007.019,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6MP,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854900019,0

And to what extent have they prioritised or balanced economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection? We conclude that the state has never been absent from the palm-oil industry but has had different and changing financing roles that are historically contingent and shaped by the evolving economic and political landscape. Furthermore, these roles reflect Indonesia's priorities of achieving economic growth through palm-oil development, furthering social equity, and, recently, promoting environmental sustainability. Dengan menganalisis perbedaan peran negara (Indonesia) dalam mengelola skema keuangan untuk pengembangan kelapa sawit sejak 1945, tulisan ini bertujuan untuk menjawab dua pertanyaan. Pertama, peran-peran apakah yang dimainkan oleh negara? Kedua, sampai dimana berbagai peranan tersebut telah memprioritaskan atau menyeimbangkan pertumbuhan ekonomi, pemerataan sosial, dan perlindungan lingkungan? Penulis berkesimpulan bahwa negara belum pernah absen dari industri kelapa sawit meski telah menjalani berbagai perubahan dalam peran keuangannya yang senantiasa adaptif dan dibentuk oleh perubahan ekonomi dan politis. Selain itu, peranan ini merefleksikan prioritas Indonesia dalam mencapai pertumbuhan ekonomi melalui pengembangan industri kelapa sawit yang pada gilirannya juga meningkatkan pemerataan sosial, dan baru-baru ini, meningkatkan kesinambungan lingkungan hidup.","[Pramudya, Eusebius Pantja; Hospes, Otto; Termeer, C.

High-yielding commodity exporters' currencies appreciated, boosting carry trade profits. The Global Recession sharply reversed these trends. We interpret these facts with a two-country general equilibrium model that features specialization in production and endogenous fluctuations in trade costs. Slow adjustment in the shipping sector generates boom-bust cycles in freight rates and, as a consequence, in currency risk premia. We validate these predictions using global shipping data.

The comparison of effectiveness of these two organizational forms has been dealt with in several studies, however, their results have been vague. At the same time there are only a few research papers which have concentrated on a comparative methodology. The objective of the contribution is thus to introduce some partial conclusions of the author's dissertation connected with a comparative methodology of different legal forms by way of an example of a specific research project in the field of secondary general education in the Czech Republic. The possibility to compare effectiveness of profit firms and nonprofit organizations is very limited for two reasons. Nonprofit organizations represent a highly heterogeneous group thanks to which the comparison is made more difficult. Nonprofit organizations occur sporadically with other types of providers in mixed markets, the markets are usually separated. The main recommendation in case of comparison of two types of organizational forms is to, first of all, carry out a thorough analysis of environment and markets and define factors which are different for each type of an organization. Conclusions concerning nonprofit organizational effectiveness can only be drawn for a specific area of public services at a specific time.","[Rosenmayer, Tomas] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Rosenmayer, T (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",z3z87@mail.muni.cz,"Rosenmayer, Tomas/P-4637-2016",,,,,,17,0,0,1,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,347,355,,,,,,9,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100045,0

Data on municipal level for the year 2011 were analyzed using global and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation. We detected significant positive spatial autocorrelation for municipal solid waste and municipal mixed waste production, there are no spatial patterns in the case of recyclable waste streams (glass and plastic). With map visualization we could detect particular clusters of high or low amount of produced municipal solid waste and mixed municipal waste. Even though the majority of municipalities does not show any spatial distribution, we identified clusters of high waste production in Central Bohemia, Usti nad Labem and Moravia-Silesia region and clusters with low waste production in Central Bohemia, Hradec Kralove, Pardubice, South Bohemia and Vysocina regions.

The result shows that there is a significant negative correlations between banking deposits with GB volumes indicating a shifting from banking deposit to GB. Whereas spread between GB yield and banking deposits rate, both in long and short term, reveals a significant negative correlation. This finding also indicates that investors' portfolio decisions are affected by the spread between GB yield and banking deposits rate. Furthermore, the VECM result demonstrates varied responses among investors towards fiscal shock. Foreign, insurance and mutual funds investors responded by increasing their GB and decreasing their banking deposits. This finding confirms the first result, i.e. indication of shifting from banking deposits to GB.

Capital Markets Union (CMU) is an attempt to redesign the structure of funding by the European corporates and gradually transform European economies towards market-based economies. Activation of a corporate bond market is one of the main targets of CMU. Latvian corporate bond market showed moderate development till year 2012, when it took off and in 2017 reached 94% weight of the number of the Baltic bonds quoted. Scarce presence of the non-financial sector companies (4 out of 14 (Nasdaq Baltic, 2017)) represents their limitations for public debt listing from both supply and demand side thus making CMU introduction relevant and desirable for Latvian corporate bond market. The aim of this article is while investigating the essence, progress and challenges of CMU introduction, explore the impact and relevance of CMU for Latvian corporate bond market. The article reveals that CMU focuses on securitization, infrastructure finance and providing financing alternatives to SMEs, where the main obstacles are present on the level of market fragmentation, standardisation of accounting and taxation practices. The study defines securitisation, cross border trades and increased retail segment participation as CMU actions affecting Latvian corporate bond market to the most extent. The article concludes that Latvian corporate bond market while not being the first one to benefit from CMU introduction will gradually increase the number of non-financial sector issuers following the examples of bigger scope countries. The methods used in this article are scientific publication analysis, document analysis, data evaluation, and case study.","[Tocelovska, Natalja; Purmalis, Karlis] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Tocelovska, N (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Tocelovska, Natalja/HZK-0053-2023","Tocelovska, Natalja/0000-0002-1235-6579",,,,,27,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,671,680,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400067,0

In this paper we show that labor market integration strongly affects these returns for poor workers in Vietnam. Using seven representative household surveys, it is shown that while regional labor markets have become increasingly integrated over the period 1993-2010 considering market wages of workers in wage employment, there remains a strong lack of integration considering shadow wages of workers in farm self-employment. Shadow wages have been increasing as a proportion of market wages during 1993-2010, but they remain only 22-28% of rural market wages by 2010. Using a decomposition technique, it is shown that the lack of integration between the farm self-employment segment with various segments of wage employment (regional, urban versus rural, non-farm household versus other enterprises), explains primarily the gap in returns to labor between poor and non-poor workers.

The results show that the MSCE between the stock indexes and the oil price decreases as the time scale increases. It implies that they are more synchronous at greater time scale. Under the same condition, the MSCE between SSE and oil price is smaller than the value between SZSE and oil price. This indicates that SSE is more synchronized with world oil price than SZSE.

Vergara-Camus' grassroots approach, which involved periods of living with peasant families, concludes that the MST's strategies for building alternative, autonomous rural communities is more realistic - more universalistic - than that of the Zapatistas, whose military tactics tend to reinforce the group's isolation in the forests of Mexico's southernmost state.

The analysis focuses especially on the interaction between CEO reputation and corporate reputation to identify which dimension of reputation is more relevant to firm performance. We show that, though both corporate reputation and CEO reputation have an individual impact that benefits the financial performance of the company, the impact of CEO reputation is more persistent across different time periods and more comprehensive across different industries. Furthermore, we find that CEO reputation still has a positive impact on firm performance when corporate reputation is poor, indicating that CEO reputation is more important to firm performance. To pursue better financial performance, should a company make greater effort to build a good corporate reputation, or merely recruit a CEO with a good reputation?

The pre and after sales process so-called the Sales Cycle is still underestimated. Consumers increasingly indicate what has the greatest impact on their satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Many international studies prove that consumers' satisfaction increases when companies meet their four key needs: the personnel professional competences, the ease of purchase, the initiative from the customer service employees in relation to the customer and the personalization of the offer. Consumers, in the majority, expect more initiative from the customer service side and the organization as a whole and this may cause some mistakes. The authors defined them as main sins in the customer service, based on the secondary and own researches. These sins can be viewed from the point of the sales process and from the overall organizational management. It has been discussed in various researches that the fewer mistakes made during the sales process the higher customers' retention and larger profit growth in the organization. Based on the limitations of this study, future research could expand by conducting a much larger survey across other Voivodships in Poland and a greater number of organizations in different activity areas.","[Wereda, Wioletta] Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, 2 Konarskiego, PL-08110 Siedlce, Poland; [Grzybowska, Monika] Coll World Econ, Warsaw Sch Econ, 162 Al Niepodleglosci, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Wereda, W (通讯作者)，Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, 2 Konarskiego, PL-08110 Siedlce, Poland.",weredawioletta@tlen.pl; monika.grzybowska@tlen.pl,"Wereda, Wioletta/ABC-1459-2020","Wereda, Wioletta/0000-0002-6948-0239",,,,,32,1,1,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,523,536,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800040,0

Under the circumstance of severer aging of population, the government has faced increasingly severe pension burden which cannot be figured out by traditional pension systems easily. Therefore, the supplementary pension function of enterprise annuity has been highly concerned. Improving the investment income of the enterprise annuity fund and achieving the hedge and increment of enterprise annuity is the key to alleviate the pension crisis. This paper is divided into 4 parts. In the beginning, this paper introduces the DC (Defined Contribution) and trust model of investment operation of enterprise annuity fund in China. We also analyze the operating status of the fund, whose investment restriction is strict, policy orientation is conservative, investment income fluctuates greatly and income level is low. In the second part, we discuss the influencing factors on the yields of the enterprise annuity fund in China. Since there are large differences between the investment direction of fixed income enterprise annuity portfolio and equity enterprise annuity portfolio, we consider these two investment portfolios separately. After comparing several indicators of the macroeconomic systems in several different countries, we think one country's Benchmark Interest Rate is the most important factor towards this question. We choose Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate(Shibor) as the indicator represented China's Benchmark Interest Rate. To consider the trends of macro-environment comprehensively, we also select Gross Domestic Product(GDP) and consumer price index(CPI) as control variables and these data all come from China Economic Information Network Statistical Database. Now, we have five variables in total, named fixedrate, equityrate, dshibor, gdp, cpi. In the third part of the paper, based on the VAR(Vector Autoregressive) model, we analyzed the impact of varied China's Interbank Offered Rate on the investment income rate of fixed income portfolio and equity portfolio of the enterprise annuity fund. We also examine the stability of the investment income rate of these two portfolios when macroeconomic indicators change. We use quarterly time series data for 2013-2016 from the website of Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China(MOHRSS). In the part of empirical test, we set up two dummy variables to analyze the increase and decrease of the benchmark interest rate respectively. At first, we test the stability of data. The results of the unit root test show that each of the five variables in the VAR model is a non-stationary sequence, but change to a stationary sequence after the first order difference. The results of cointegration test show there is an equilibrium relationship between the linear combinations of these five variables. Generally speaking, there existed a co-integration relationship among variables. Secondly, we perform the parameter estimation of the VAR model. Hence, we perform an impulse response function analysis. The result shows that the fluctuation of the Inter Bank Offered Rate has significant asymmetric effects on these two portfolios. For the fixed income portfolio, the inhibiting effect of rising interest rate on the yield ratio is weaker than the promotional effect of declining interest rate. For equity portfolio, declining interest rate will have a strong effect in promoting the yield rate in a short term, but this promotional effect will slow down in a long term and show a negative impact, which is caused by the overreaction of the stock market itself. The impact of rising interest on the yield rate of equity portfolio is not significant. This means the stability of the equity portfolio is superior to the fixed income portfolio. At the end of this paper, we give corresponding recommendations on China's enterprise annuity fund asset configuration based on the empirical result. At first, the government should to broaden the scope of investment in enterprise annuity fund and diversify types of the investment fund. Second, according to the empirical result, the government ought to increase the proportion of equity investment in the enterprise annuity fund portfolio appropriately; for it has been proved that the interest rate has a weaker impact on this investment direction. At last, the government should be optimistic about the impact of interest rate risk and increase the investment leverage prudentially to enhance the yield rate.","[Wu Fei; Mou Shanshan] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Wu, F (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wufeicufe@163.com; xsy_33@sina.com,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,0,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,319,337,,,,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700023,0

After the undue efforts of Guzheng players and researchers, the present Guzheng playing has inherited the traditional techniques and has undergone relevant innovations and evolutions, presenting a diversified trend. At the same time, this development of Guzheng playing technique has been fully utilized to the music teaching. This article explores and thinks about it, hoping to promote the further development of the teaching of Guzheng playing.","[Wu, Nan] Xian Univ Arts & Sci, Coll Art, Xian 710065, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University,"Wu, N (通讯作者)，Xian Univ Arts & Sci, Coll Art, Xian 710065, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",nan_wu83725@163.com,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,589,592,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200118,0

In recent years, the music teaching in colleges and universities has been paid much attention by the society, and the existing problems are also exposed in the public field of vision. How to do the work of music education in colleges and universities is a realistic problem to be solved in front of every teaching worker. This article briefly analyzes the role of musical and cultural factors in music teaching. The teaching of music in colleges and universities should not be only the learning of music, but also a kind of cultural perception and learning. Music teaching in colleges and universities is an important part of cultivating students' comprehensive quality. It is an important way to export professional music talents. After the development of these years, the music teaching in colleges and universities has made extraordinary achievements in our country, but we also should see the problems in it. At present, many educators in related fields have made some theoretical and practical research and exploration on how to improve the effect of music teaching in colleges and universities, and achieved certain results. As a first-line teaching teacher, the author also has carried on the long-term tracking and research to the related theory and practice progress. In this process, the author finds that musical and cultural factors in our music teaching is a long-term neglected part. Music is a highly integrated art form. At present, music teaching in colleges and universities is mainly focused on the basic professional theory, performance, teaching basic skills and other aspects. And there is a shortage of exposure and inculcation of musical and cultural factors. Music teaching needs the right idea firstly. The author thinks that music teaching can not be simply regarded as teaching, but should be regarded as the exploration in the related fields. We should lead students to explore their past and explore their future, and try to explore the soluble elements in this field in teaching, and make the teaching and application elements in this field more colorful. Under the background of quality education, the goal of college education teaching is to cultivate the overall quality of students, not only to teach students a single skill. The introduction of music culture factors into college music teaching can not only cultivate comprehensive music perception ability of students, but also improve their cultural literacy.","[Yu, Ruihua] Xian Univ, Teachers Coll, Xian 710065, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University,"Yu, RH (通讯作者)，Xian Univ, Teachers Coll, Xian 710065, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,721,725,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200147,0

Also, in research, the evaluation results of entrepreneurship development methods of Lithuanian students are summarised. The research aims to identify what methods of entrepreneurship development that have been implemented are the most important for students. In order to receive required information for a study, the survey method was employed. During the study, the questionnaires were distributed directly to students and alsosent by e-mails asking them to fill in the presented questionnaire There were accumulated 420 questionnaires received from higher education institutions of Lithuania, i.e., from college and university students studying in Management or Administration studies. Having evaluated the results, it was concluded that active methods of entrepreneurship development are more valuablethan the passive ones. The authors came to a conclusion that in developing the features of entrepreneurship all methods are necessary and important, however, only when used in a general complex of development methods, i.e., not excluding unused methods too.","[Zuperka, Aurimas; Simanskiene, Ligita; Zuperkiene, Erika] Klaipeda Univ, Klaipeda, Lithuania",Klaipeda University,"Zuperka, A (通讯作者)，Klaipeda Univ, Klaipeda, Lithuania.",,"Zuperkiene, Erika/AAB-7774-2021; wen, sen/Q-6113-2018; Šimanskienė, Ligita/AAA-2764-2021","Zuperkiene, Erika/0000-0002-1505-0962;",,,,,29,0,0,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,764,774,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400076,0

We show that a solvency problem in one bank can be transmitted to another if they lend to the same borrower. The novelty is that the channel for the transmission involves banks' monitoring incentives. The intensity with which all banks monitor a common borrower is reduced when one of the banks suffers a solvency shock. The reduced effort intensity affects the borrower's probability of success and creates a contagion (endogenous correlation) from the balance-sheet of the affected bank to the balance-sheet of the other banks lending to the same borrower. Banks hit by a solvency shock have lower incentives to monitor borrowers because less is left after paying depositors. Banks not hit by a solvency shock face borrowers' risks entirely on their own, which increases the expected cost of lending. As a consequence, they respond by reducing the monitoring intensity for the common borrower. Bank equity can mitigate the risk of contagion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

(iii) Both exercises and failure to exercise differ significantly among investor groups, are related to their personal characteristics as well as product characteristics and environmental circumstances, and are subject to cognitive biases.

The median (mean) fund IRR, net of fees, is 9.0% (51.7%), based on a sample that controls for survivorship bias. Fund IRRs are neither related to fund own characteristics, such as fund size, nor to overall market conditions around the time when the fund is raised. Competition reduces fund performance: returns are lower when there are many competitors entering the industry at the same time. Although experienced partnerships are more likely to raise a follow-on fund and to raise more capital, fund performance is not related to general partnership (GP) investment experience. Further, there is no performance persistence across funds managed by the same GP. Lastly, there is some evidence of investor maturity when judged on GPs' historical performance.

Nevertheless, it is still necessary to concentrate on this field, especially in the Slovak Republic. SMEs are very sensitive to changes in the business environment which are always reflected in the quantitative characteristics of this sector in a certain time interval. According to various global surveys and studies, risk management represents a significant contribution to the increasing competitiveness of enterprises in changes of the business environment. The aim of this paper is to statistically assess the dependence of perceived key business risks of SMEs on their size in Slovakia based on own empirical research carried out in 2017. The contribution also includes an assessment of key risk sources and an evaluation of the survey results compared to the results of surveys taken last year. Based on the results, market, financial, economic and personnel risks comprise the four most important risks that negatively affect the business environment of SMEs. Dependence perceived by the SME entrepreneurs was found among market factors, personnel risks, and business size. No dependence was found among the financial, economic and business risks. The overall results of the empirical research point to the need and importance of addressing the assessment of key risks and their resources in SMEs in Slovakia. The goal of the paper is to highlight through a relevant study the need to apply risk management in the SMEs and to bring the results of the research in Slovakia closer to world trends.","[Hudakova, Maria; Masar, Matej] Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Dept Crisis Management, Zilina, Slovakia; [Luskova, Maria] Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Dept Tech Sci & Informat, Zilina, Slovakia; [Patak, Milan Robin] Univ Coll Business, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Hudakova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Dept Crisis Management, Zilina, Slovakia.",maria.hudakova@fbi.uniza.sk; matej.masar@fbi.uniza.sk; maria.luskova@fbi.uniza.sk; patak@vso-praha.eu,"Masár, Matej/P-2763-2019; Masár, Matej/A-6373-2019; Luskova, Maria/H-9117-2018; Hudakova, Maria/S-6206-2017","Masár, Matej/0000-0003-4189-2984; Luskova, Maria/0000-0003-3975-4654; Hudakova, Maria/0000-0002-0756-0962",Scientific Grant Agency - project VEGA [1/0560/16]; project KEGA [030ZU-4/2018],Scientific Grant Agency - project VEGA; project KEGA,Publication of this paper was supported by the Scientific Grant Agency - project VEGA No. 1/0560/16 (Risk Management of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in Slovakia as Prevention of Company Crises) and project KEGA No. 030ZU-4/2018 (Research of Risk Management in Enterprises in Slovakia to create a new study program Risk Management for the FBI University of Zilina).,,47,48,51,4,39,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

In a multi-period partial equilibrium model of lending to households, we compare such savings-linked relationship lending with arm's-length lending. Our model shows that savings-linked relationship lending leads to a Pareto improvement or an increase in the allocative efficiency of the financing market compared to arm's-length lending in markets of low time preference or low average borrower quality. In these markets, savings-linked relationship lending can overcome financing market failure due to adverse selection, which is especially true for financing volumes that are large in comparison to households' incomes. Hence, savings-linked relationship lending can in particular support housing purchases of low-income households and is able to increase home ownership rates. Our work provides, to our knowledge, the first theoretical relationship lending explanation for CSH. Further, our results add a novel economic explanation for synergies between the two main activities of traditional commercial banking, deposit-taking and lending.","[Kirsch, Steffen; Burghof, Hans -Peter] Univ Hohenheirn, Dept Banking & Finance, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany",,"Kirsch, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheirn, Dept Banking & Finance, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",skirsch@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,15,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

Using the 2011 China Household Finance Survey, we examined factors influencing stock and fixed-income investments in the cities. Couples with urban residency were more likely to invest than couples without urban residency. Compared to traditional couples with highly-educated husbands only, couples with only highly-educated wives invested similarly, whereas couples with two highly- (less-) educated spouses were more (less) likely to invest. Further, we investigated how these relationships were mediated by household income and wealth, financial literacy, information acquisition, and risk tolerance.

For example, the percent of firms using e-mail to interact with clients/suppliers has a positive effect on the annual employment growth of medium enterprises, but not the case of small enterprises. The proportion of investments financed by equity or stock sales has an adverse impact on small enterprises, while there is no such effect on medium enterprises.

The majority of Norwegian cod is landed during a few winter months. Moreover, most of the catch is landed fresh by a fleet consisting primarily of many smaller vessels with limited operational radius. This makes landing patterns and potentially markets regional. However, there are also landings in the remainder of the year, primarily by larger oceangoing vessels such as trawlers with a larger operational radius that may ensure market integration between the regions. Market integration can also be ensured through landings of a potential substitute; frozen cod, which is less perishable. In this paper we investigate the degree of market integration between different regions for fresh cod in Norway, and between fresh and frozen cod. We find that the markets for fresh cod are integrated but not all regions adhere to the Law of One Price. Markets for fresh and frozen cod are also integrated, but not to the extent that the Law of One Price holds. Finally, there is evidence of frozen cod leading the fresh cod prices.","[Pettersen, Ingrid Kristine] Capia AS, Postboks 109, N-9252 Tromso, Norway; [Braekkan, Eivind Hestvik] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Myrland, Oystein] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Sch Business & Econ Fisheries & Econ, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Pettersen, IK (通讯作者)，Capia AS, Postboks 109, N-9252 Tromso, Norway.",ingrid@capia.no; Eivind.h.brakkan@uit.no; oystein.myrland@uit.no,"Hestvik Brækkan, Eivind/ABD-7248-2021","Braekkan, Eivind Hestvik/0000-0002-3286-9865",,,,,37,9,9,0,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

Following its development became a difficult task with the success of cryptocurrencies (CCs) other than Bitcoin. For fiat currency markets, the IMF offers the index SDR and, prior to the EUR, the ECU existed, which was an index representing the development of European currencies. Index providers decide on a fixed number of index constituents which will represent the market segment. It is a challenge to fix a number and develop rules for the constituents in view of the market changes. In the frequently changing CC market, this challenge is even more severe. A method relying on the AIC is proposed to quickly react to market changes and therefore enable us to create an index, referred to as CRIX, for the cryptocurrency market. CRIX is chosen by model selection such that it represents the market well to enable each interested party studying economic questions in this market and to invest into the market. The diversified nature of the CC market makes the inclusion of altcoins in the index product critical to improve tracking performance. We have shown that assigning optimal weights to altcoins helps to reduce the tracking errors of a CC portfolio, despite the fact that their market cap is much smaller relative to Bitcoin.

This paper asks whether experimentally induced group identity affects players' decisions to conform, even when payoffs are only a function of individual actions. As motivation for the experiment, we show that U.S. Supreme Court Justices in preliminary hearings are more likely to conform to their same-party predecessors when the share of predecessors from their party is high. Lab players, in turn, are more likely to conform to the decisions of in-group members when their share of in-group predecessors is high. We find that exposure to information from in-group members increases the probability of reverse information cascades (herding on the wrong choice), reducing average payoffs. Therefore, alternating decision-making across members of different groups may improve welfare in sequential decision making contexts.","[Van Parys, Jessica] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Econ, 695 Pk Ave,HW1534, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ash, Elliott] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Law Econ & Data Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Van Parys, J (通讯作者)，CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Econ, 695 Pk Ave,HW1534, New York, NY 10065 USA.",jessica.vanparys@hunter.cuny.edu; ashe@ethz.edu,,,Columbia Experimental Lab for the Social Sciences (CELSS),Columbia Experimental Lab for the Social Sciences (CELSS),"We thank Alessandra Casella, Navin Kartik, Stephan Meier, and the political economy colloquium at Columbia University for their helpful comments.

To fill this gap, this study proposes location-based space-time accessibility measures to capture the temporal variation of location-based accessibility. Using the space-time utility perspective, the accessibility of a location is conceptualized as the space-time utility offered by a set of facilities accessible from the location. Individuals' facility choice behaviors among multiple alternatives are explicitly considered. A time dependent facility attractiveness function is introduced to represent the temporal variation of individuals' needs to perform activities at a certain facility. The introduced function is formulated as two components: a time invariant component representing individual satisfactions derived from activity participation at the facility, and a time-varying component expressing individuals' dynamic intensities to perform a certain type of activities at different times of day. To demonstrate the applicability of these proposed measures, a comprehensive case study has been carried out in Wuhan, China. The results of the case study show that the proposed measures can well capture the temporal variation of accessibility, due to the dynamics both of traffic conditions and of individuals' intensities in performing activities at different times of day. The proposed measures require moderate level of data, in terms of rich facility information; and most of these data could be extracted from social media applications.","[Wang, Yafei; Chen, Bi Yu; Yuan, Hui] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yafei; Chen, Bi Yu; Yuan, Hui] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Donggen] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yafei; Chen, Bi Yu; Lam, William H.

The objective of this paper is to investigate how bank ownership influences cyclicality of lending in Africa. We are then able to assess how changes in bank ownership influence the economy. To this end, we measure the sensitivity of bank loan growth to GDP per capita growth of the host country with dynamic GMM estimations. We use panel data from 190 commercial banks covering 20 African countries spanning the period from 2002 to 2015. We find that lending of African banks is procyclical for all types of banks. However, we observe that Pan-African banks are the least procyclical banks, while no significant difference in procyclicality is observed between state-owned banks, domestic private banks, and other foreign banks. In addition, we find evidence that foreign banks are influenced by GDP per capita growth of their home country. Therefore, our findings support the view that the expansion of Pan-African banks contributes to reduce cyclicality of lending. However, foreign bank entry can enhance the transmission of external shocks.","[Zins, Alexandra] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France; [Weill, Laurent] Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, Strasbourg, France; [Weill, Laurent] MGIMO Univ, Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Moscow, Russia",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; MGIMO University,"Weill, L (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France.",azins@unistra.fr; laurent.weill@unistra.fr,,,,,,,25,13,14,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1566-0141,1873-6173,,EMERG MARK REV,Emerg.

Employing a factor-augmented vector auto regression (FAVAR), we model US economic policy uncertainty jointly with the latent factors extracted from equity prices, exchange rates, and commodity prices. We find that US economic policy uncertainty affects these factors significantly. A country-level analysis shows heterogeneous responses to an increase in US economic policy uncertainty. With regard to equities, US economic policy uncertainty adversely affects equity prices. However, its impact on the Chinese equity market is relatively small. As for foreign exchange markets, while many currencies depreciate in response to an increase in US economic policy uncertainty, the US dollar and the Japanese yen appreciate, reflecting their safe-haven status. The Chinese yuan, whose nominal exchange rate is closely linked to the US dollar, also appreciates in response to uncertainty shocks.","[Kido, Yosuke] Bank Japan, Chuo Ku, 2-1-1 Hongokucho Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1038660, Japan",Bank of Japan,"Kido, Y (通讯作者)，Bank Japan, Chuo Ku, 2-1-1 Hongokucho Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1038660, Japan.",yousuke.kido@boj.or.jp,,,,,,,8,37,39,2,38,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

Given the focus of Islamic stock screening on the debt ratio, we use data from 320 firms for eight European countries which were classified according to their level of debt and size. For this, the portfolio optimisation based Mean-Variance Efficient Frontier (MVEF), the Sharpe Ratio and the Capital Market Line (CML) were employed. Our findings tend to demonstrate that, under shocks, high leverage worsens the portfolio return, volatility, and value at risk. The results further point out that optimal portfolio composition is obtained through a high proportion of low debt funds in the case of two separate equity funds, of low debt and high debt portfolios respectively. The systematic risk of several portfolio strategies is further explored with regards to a benchmark of European index and market-wide, return and volatility shocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike previous studies, we separately identify parental absence and remittances, with careful consideration of self-selection into migration and endogeneity of remittances. Using a two-step estimation strategy, we show that parental absence has a substantive disruptive effect on education of children left behind, while remittances have a positive effect. In addition, we show that non-parental absence has no effect on education. Further, we provide supporting evidence about the channels to disruption. Finally, we show some heterogeneity results by the child's gender and education status of the mother. The results by child's gender confirm that remittances relax the liquidity constraints of households by investing in education of the girls. Further, the results by education status of the mother provide evidence that an educated mother can play a role in neutralizing or mitigating the negative effects of parental absence.","[Raut, Nirmal Kumar] Tribhuvan Univ, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Raut, Nirmal Kumar] GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Tanaka, Ryuichi] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",Tribhuvan University; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; University of Tokyo,"Raut, NK (通讯作者)，Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Econ, GPO 3821, Kathmandu, Nepal.",phd12101@grips.ac.jp,"Raut, Nirmal/R-2259-2019","Raut, Nirmal/0000-0002-4234-4739; , Ryuichi/0000-0002-3483-5175",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24330077],"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant/Award Number: 24330077",,40,4,5,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Used primarily in psychology, the RAI measures the extent to which an individual's actions are intrinsically or extrinsically motivated, where higher scores indicate greater autonomy. On aggregate, we find differences between men and women, and across countries, in the significance of association between the individual's level of participation in decision-making and autonomy. In addition, we find heterogeneity in the strength of this association, depending on the domain (e.g., productive versus personal decisions) and whether partners agree on who normally makes decisions. These findings imply that details related to context and measurement matter for understanding individual decision-making power. We argue that all research using information on decision-making should include a careful analysis of men's and women's perceptions of decision making within the household, which may be useful for calibrating indicators to suit specific contexts.

Depending on the difference between a child's actual and potential health status, the effects of investment in early childhood nutrition can differ across child health status distributions. To establish a causal inference, I merge village-level rainfall data with a child-level longitudinal survey-the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey-and apply a Correlated Random Effect quantile regression for panel data model. The findings suggest that a standard deviation increase in a village-level precipitation z-score has heterogeneous effects across the weight-for-height and weight-for-age z-score distributions and gender. The positive effects are more pronounced at the lower end of health status distributions and on girls. To the extent that the increase in a village-level precipitation z-score increases investment in child nutrition, its stronger effect on girls and at the lower end of the health status distribution implies that policy interventions that aim to promote nutritional investment reduces the health inequality gap across health status and gender.

The role of smallholders in agriculture differs among transition countries, and this diversity is due to a combination of factors, including capital, labour and land endowments, income levels, scale economies, market imperfections, and reform choices. Institutions to access inputs and sell outputs affect the efficiency and survival of smallholders. In the past decade, the share of smallholders in land use and production has declined significantly as younger and more dynamic smallholders have become integrated in modern value chains, whereas older, less dynamic farmers have (semi-)retired, producing only for household consumption.","[Burkitbayeva, Saule; Swinnen, Johan] Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Waaistr 6,Bus 3511, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Burkitbayeva, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Waaistr 6,Bus 3511, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",saule.burkitbayeva@kuleuven.be,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978; Burkitbayeva, Saule/0000-0003-4045-3787",Methusalem research fund of the KU Leuven,Methusalem research fund of the KU Leuven,Methusalem research fund of the KU Leuven,,38,20,24,1,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

By examining changes in resource allocation and rural development between 1982 and 2005 in the region worst affected by desertification in China-the Minqin oasis in Gansu-we argue that changes in macro-level fiscal and commodity grain policies contributed to severe regional disparity and a reduction in local state capacity in hinterland China. Inter-governmental competition over fiscal revenue encouraged cash cropping and land reclamation, and the continuous decline of the oasis ecology further reduced legitimacy in rural governance. These institutional and ecological constraints shaped the behaviour of grassroots cadres and formed the conflicting interests of the state in resource distribution and environmental conservation that continued to exist until the implementation of a centralized conservation program in 2006.

This review asks why addressing caste-based inequality and discrimination does not feature in intergovernmental commitments such as the Sustainable Development Goals, and whether it should. Taking India as its focus, it finds that caste has been treated as an archaic system and source of historical disadvantage due compensation through affirmative action in ways that overlook its continuing importance as a structure of advantage and of discrimination in the modern economy, especially post-liberalization from the 1990s. A body of recent literature from anthropology, economics, history and political science is used to explore the modern life of caste in society, economy and development. Questions are asked about caste as social hierarchy, the role of caste in post-liberalization rural inequality, in urban labor markets and in the business economy, and the effect of policies of affirmative action in public-sector education and employment. Caste is found to be a complex institution, simultaneously weakened and revived by current economic and political forces; it is a contributor to persisting national socioeconomic and human capital disparities, and has major impacts on subjective wellbeing. Caste effects are not locational; they travel from the village to the city and into virtually all markets. Caste persists in the age of the market because of its advantages - its discriminations allow opportunity hoarding for others; and the threat of the advancement of subordinated groups provokes humiliating violence against them. The evidence points to the need for policy innovation to address market and non-market discrimination and to remove barriers, especially in the informal and private sector; and to ensure caste has its proper place in the global development policy debate.

In the economics literature, most scholars agree that being middle class entails being free from poverty, which means being able to afford the basic things in life - not only today, but also tomorrow. In consequence, there is an increasing tendency to define the middle class based on a lack of vulnerability to poverty. In this paper, we strengthen and expand on these existing approaches in three ways: First, we incorporate the differentiation between the middle class and a (non-poor) vulnerable group into a broader social-stratification schema that additionally differentiates between transient and chronic poverty. Second, in estimating the risk of poverty, we employ a multivariate regression model that explicitly allows for possible feedback effects from past poverty experiences and accounts for the potential endo-geneity of initial conditions, unobserved heterogeneity, and non-random panel attrition - four factors insufficiently addressed in existing studies. Third, we highlight the value of paying attention to these conceptual and modelling issues by showing that class divisions based on monetary thresholds inadequately capture a household's chances of upward and downward mobility. We then apply our conceptual framework to the South African case. We find that only one in four South Africans can be considered stably middle class or elite. Access to stable labor market income is a key determinant of achieving economic stability. A lack of jobs as well as the prevalence of precarious forms of work drive high levels of vulnerability, which in turn constrains the development of an emergent middle class - not only in South Africa but potentially also in other parts of the developing world that face similar labor market challenges.

However, research on local climate perceptions to date has tended to focus on what changes are perceived, not on how those changes are interpreted in particular socio-cultural contexts and given meaning within local worldviews and systems of values and beliefs. Based on fieldwork in agro-pastoral communities in highland Cusco, Peru, this study examines climate perceptions in terms of how local community members understand and explain changing climatic conditions. Specifically, two local climate narratives are identified and found to relate to Andean re-interpretations of Catholic and Evangelical religious traditions. The Andean practice of ritual offering to the earth (pago a la tierra) is found to play a key role both in the shifting religious identifications encountered at the local level, and in giving meaning to changing climatic conditions. The article further explores how these perspectives are rooted in diverging ontological and epistemological foundations. While in the local Catholic view the earth is conceived of as a non-human sacred/social person (pachamama or Santa Tierra) with whom a relationship of reciprocity must be maintained, the local Evangelical perspective instead conceives of the earth as an object, not a subject, more closely mirroring modernist Nature/Culture dualism. More broadly, the study suggests that how people interpret changing climatic conditions cannot simply be extracted and purified from the contexts of meaning production, and proposes the concept of 'entangled narratives' as a way of accounting for the social and cultural embeddedness of climate perceptions. Fulfilling our obligation to address climate change in socially just ways will require deepening our understanding of its human dimensions, including taking seriously what these changes may mean to the impacted groups.

It aims to minimize the difficulties that working women face because of giving birth and to protect the health of mothers and their babies. Most research on MP around the world is carried out in larger organizations in developed countries. This cannot be applied uncritically to developing countries, where work in small firms and the informal economy tends to dominate and enterprises are more influenced by their local communities and environment. This paper explores different forms of MP found in various forms and sizes of enterprise in Ghana. Specifically, it examines 1) how workplaces in the formal and informal economy manage MP and 2) how reciprocity shapes workers' access to the different forms of MP support. The paper draws on 63 qualitative interviews with employers and women employees across three geographic regions of Ghana. The findings show that there are a range of measures related to pregnancy, maternity leave, family-friendly flexible working conditions, breastfeeding and childcare. While large formal economy organizations mostly offer MP measures corresponding to regulatory entitlements, women working in small informal economy businesses often only benefit from informal MP support. However, neither statutory nor informal supports alone provide adequately for women's needs. The paper highlights the important roles of reciprocity and relationships built on trust as conditions for family-friendly MP provisions, particularly in the informal economy workplaces. It concludes by identifying lessons that can be learnt by both formal and informal economy businesses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The increased risk exposure to nontraditional banking assets, e.g., trading and merchant banking assets, has a nontrivial impact on traditional loan portfolios and, in particular, on the supply of short-term credits. The findings show that confronted with the market-wide shock of the financial crisis, commercial-focused banks which hold larger amounts of risky nontraditional banking assets gravitate their loan portfolios away from business and consumer loan sectors. The results from a quasi-natural experiment reveal that in response to an exogenous regulatory shock of FAS No. 166 and 167, which required banks to transfer off-balance sheet securitized loans onto bank balance sheets, securitizer banks tend to reduce business credits substantially more due to their pre-existing exposures to nontraditional assets.

The strong negative partial relation between macroeconomic uncertainty and the distant forward-rate slope remains reliably evident in a multivariate setting that includes expected bond yield volatility (as a control for convexity's influence), economic growth, expected inflation, and five other well-known uncertainty and risk measures. Beyond the well-known bond convexity channel for promoting a downward sloping distant forward-rate slope, our findings suggest that higher macroeconomic uncertainty can promote a more downward slope in distant forward rates through a hedge channel in the sense of Campbell et al. (2017). Consistent with the hypothesized hedge channel, we also document striking cross-sectional variation in how bond returns are related to macroeconomic uncertainty, both across mid- and long-horizon T-bonds and across high and low credit-risk corporate bonds.","[Connolly, Robert] Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Sch Business, Finance Area, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Dubofsky, David; Stivers, Chris] Univ Louisville, Coll Business, Dept Finance, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Louisville,"Connolly, R (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Sch Business, Finance Area, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",Robert_Connolly@unc.edu; dadubo02@louisville.edu; chris.stivers@louisville.edu,"Stivers, Chris/AAA-9246-2019",,,,,,47,6,6,1,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

The bivariate VAR model identifies liquidity premia for 12 bond yields that are mean-stationary. A state-space representation for a dynamic factor model captures three well-known latent factors for the term premium curve - level, slope, and curvature. The latent factors are able to aggregate the information from the 12 term premia to accurately identify a term premium curve that increases in maturity on average to 117 basis points. The dynamic factor estimations with macroeconomic variables capture important links from the macroeconomy to the term premium factors that indicate the term premium curve responds to higher inflation and interest rates and to higher expectations of future inflation due to excess demand. Regime-switching estimations for the variances of the latent factors stochastically divide the sample period into high- and low-variance regimes.

Reinitiations are associated with a significant short-term market response, in particular when the same analyst is assigned to the stock. However, I show that this market response is incomplete. Interestingly, the price patterns that follow the issuance of regular upgrades of recommendation and reinitiations differ significantly. Prices adjust quickly after a regular upgrade, while reinitiations are followed by a sustained price increase in the following six months, which does not revert during the following two years. I assess the economic magnitude of this initial underreaction by setting up a trading strategy. I show that reinitiations of coverage are the only type of recommendation that delivers significant positive abnormal returns after transaction costs with a three- and six-month investment horizon. I study and reject several candidate explanations in relation to momentum, and PEAD. Then, I investigate an information/superior ability hypothesis. I find that reinitiations are a more accurate signal than other recommendation types. Besides, the earnings conference call transcripts show that those analysts were able to maintain active relationships with the firms, even during the interruption of coverage. Their activity level is associated with more informative reinitiations of coverage. In particular, their participation rank in conference calls, which can be seen as a proxy for ability and proximity to the management appears to be a strong predictor of the drift after the reinitiation takes place.

Asset markets have frozen, in the wake of the confidence crisis, linked to the asymmetry of information between banks, sellers of these securitized assets and investment funds, their buyers. In this context, this paper proposes a sequential equilibrium in which the central bank can intervene to revive the asset market. However, this role of the central banker is that of a risk taker of last resort due to the fiscal cost. The paper then shows that the mission of supplying liquidity must be supplemented by a risk management policy of the central bank balance sheet, on the extreme risks of the assets. The risk management policy defines a macroprudential policy. A comparison is made between the normative model and the practical management of the crisis by the central banks.","[Rieu-Foucault, Anne-Marie] Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX, UPL, CNRS, F-92000 Nanterre, France; [Rieu-Foucault, Anne-Marie] Banque France, 39 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Rieu-Foucault, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX, UPL, CNRS, F-92000 Nanterre, France.;Rieu-Foucault, AM (通讯作者)，Banque France, 39 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, France.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

However, theory remains inconclusive regarding these effects under partial decentralization. The aim of this study is to examine this hypothesis by evaluating the effects on educational outcomes of the partial fiscal decentralization reform that took place in Spain during the 1980s. Since education competences were devolved to the regions at different points in time, we can consistently estimate the effects of this reform by applying the differences-in-differences method and by using the non-decentralized regions as the comparison group. We find that the reform had a sizeable impact on the percentage of students dropping out early from school. The effects are much stronger for regions with a high level of revenues. We also find that the effects are concentrated in the high-school program and that the reform was not able to improve educational outcomes in the vocational program. We interpret these results as evidence that decentralization improved the match between education policy and population preferences.","[Salinas, Paula] UAB, Edifici B Despatx B3-158, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Salinas, Paula] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, BGSE, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Fac Econ & Empresa, Edifici B Despatx B3-158, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Sole-Olle, Albert] UB, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Sole-Olle, Albert] Univ Barcelona, IEB, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Empresa, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics; University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Salinas, P (通讯作者)，UAB, Edifici B Despatx B3-158, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain.;Salinas, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, BGSE, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Fac Econ & Empresa, Edifici B Despatx B3-158, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain.",paula.salinas@uab.cat; asole@ub.edu,,,Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [ECO2015-68311-R]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014SGR420],Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya),This research has received funding from projects ECO2015-68311-R (Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia) and 2014SGR420 (Generalitat de Catalunya).,,32,25,30,2,44,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

Our paper argues that the age-limit effect in China may result in a similar lame-duck effect: an official facing binding age limits has fewer incentives to put effort into work, resulting in contractionary fiscal policies. Using data from 30 Chinese provinces from 1980 to 2006, the empirical analysis finds a provincial leader over official retirement age but still in office has an incentive to decrease tax revenue and expenditures. Specifically, a provincial leader prefers to decrease public spending on capital construction, public goods and agricultural subsidies. Also, a provincial leader's age is negatively correlated with the public spending in his or her jurisdiction. Our empirical results indicate that career concerns of politicians in China created by the age-limit rules of the cadre management system may hinder local economic prosperity.","[Tsai, Pi-han; Ye, Jianliang] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ye, Jianliang] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Res Private Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Ye, JL (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Ye, JL (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Res Private Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",jianliangye@zju.edu.cn,"Ye, JL/G-4597-2010","Tsai, Pi-Han/0000-0001-5292-0659",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China; National Social Science Fund of China [13CJY105]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71773112],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Social Science Fund of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We would like to thank two anonymous referees for their very constructive comments.

J,"Wong, M",,,,"Wong, Maisy",,,A tractable approach to compare the hedonic and discrete choice frameworks,JOURNAL OF HOUSING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hedonic; Discrete choice; Sorting; Demand,PREFERENCES; CONSUMERS; DEMAND; PRICES,"The two primary approaches to estimate marginal willingness-to-pay (MWTP) are hedonic (Rosen, 1974) and discrete choice (McFadden, 1974). While both approaches rely on revealed preference methods to estimate MWTP, the primitives underlying both models are different, making it difficult to compare them. This paper establishes the assumptions needed to develop a tractable framework to compare both approaches. I begin with a discrete choice model and show how to derive the gradient of the equilibrium price function implicitly. I then incorporate Rosen's insight that the price gradient is equal to the MWTP of the marginal individual whose indifference curve is tangent to the price function in equilibrium. However, with discrete choices, some individuals may be inframarginal and their indifference curves will not be tangent to the price function. The analytical mapping I derive formalizes this intuition and shows that the price gradient depends on weighted averages of marginal utilities where higher weights are assigned to individuals whose choice probabilities indicate more uncertain choices (marginal individuals). As this choice becomes more certain, the weights start to decrease. This result shows how choice probabilities and other moments of choice data can be used to distinguish marginal versus inframarginal individuals.","[Wong, Maisy] Univ Penn, Wharton Real Estate,3620 Locust Walk,1464 SHDH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Wong, M (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Real Estate,3620 Locust Walk,1464 SHDH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",maisy@wharton.upenn.edu,,,Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton,Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton,"I am indebted to Fernando Ferreira for his guidance and time.

In this paper, we utilize links between management companies and their institutional clients to explore variation in execution costs within management companies. For a subset of management companies, we find that systematic differences in execution costs exist across clients; these differences are comparable to the variation documented across management companies and persist over time. Clients who receive lower execution costs reward management companies with an increase in dollar trading volume. We find no evidence that the results are driven by broker commissions or differences in trading practices. Given the economic significance of our findings and implications for institutional investors, this aspect of execution should be recognized regardless of the ultimate source of the differences.","[Ben-Rephael, Azi] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Israelsen, Ryan D.] Michigan State Univ, Broad Coll Business, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business; Michigan State University,"Ben-Rephael, A (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,,43,7,9,2,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Recently, scholar attention has focused on the importance of education in subjects such as science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) for the promotion of entrepreneurial activity. To our knowledge, empirical evidence for this link is scarce, despite the emphasis made in the literature and by policy makers on the choice of study at the tertiary level. Given that differences in STEM education are particularly large between men and women, we utilize data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor for 19 European countries and the USA. We study the role of these differences in STEM education at the national level for three stages of the entrepreneurial process: entrepreneurial awareness, the choice of sector for entrepreneurial activity, and entrepreneurial growth aspirations. We also test whether the effects of gender differences in education is moderated by the nature of the institutional environment in which entrepreneurs operate. Our findings show that individual-level explanations including education account for the gender differences during all three stages of early-stage entrepreneurial activity. Moreover, countries with greater gender equality in science education are characterized by higher entrepreneurial activity in knowledge-intensive sectors and high-growth aspirations. Thus, next to individual-level education, closing the gender gap in science at the national level can benefit a country as a whole by stimulating innovative entrepreneurial activity.","[Dilli, Selin; Westerhuis, Gerarda] Univ Utrecht, Social & Econ Hist, Drift 6, NL-3512 BS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Dilli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Social & Econ Hist, Drift 6, NL-3512 BS Utrecht, Netherlands.",s.dilli@uu.nl; g.k.westerhuis@uu.nl,,,,,,,75,48,53,8,80,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

World literature presents a variety of models for intellectual capital (IC) measurement, but so far IC in local government units such as counties (2nd tier local government unit in Poland) has been non-recognized. The purpose of this paper is to fill in this gap. The authors propose an original IC measurement concept developed on the basis of already existing models. The model was created following an analysis of the results of studies performed in local government units (counties) in Poland. The authors are of the opinion that the model can be used for developing IC measurement models for local government units in other countries.","[Fazlagic, Jan; Szczepankiewicz, Elzbieta Izabela] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Fazlagic, J (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",jan.fazlagic@ue.poznan.pl,"Szczepankiewicz, Elżbieta/P-7833-2019","Szczepankiewicz, Elżbieta/0000-0002-9463-1174; Fazlagic, Jan/0000-0003-1968-2163",Polish National Science Centre [2013/09/B/HS4/00476],Polish National Science Centre,This paper has been funded by Polish National Science Centre (grant number: 2013/09/B/HS4/00476; Kapital intelektualny powiatow polskich (Intellectual Capital of Polish County Counties).

The doubly altruistic agents choose amounts of intergenerational transfers to their old parents and children as well as private savings. The government specifies amounts of public transfers from working adults to the dependents. The model also takes the effects of demographic transition on the burdens of supporting the elderly and children into account. Using 23 countries' data from the National Transfer Accounts (NTA), we estimate the degrees of filial and parental altruism and adjust them for their respective life expectancy and fertility rates. The findings suggest that people in developing countries are more parentally altruistic than those in developed ones while the adjusted degree of filial altruism tends to be low in developing Asia. Our welfare analyses reveal that the developing Asian countries must introduce more comprehensive public welfare programs for the elderly to maximize social welfare. Moreover, their low adjusted degree of filial altruism may trap the developing Asian countries at the low levels of public old-age support and social welfare as the further demographic transition ensues.","[Koda, Yoshitaka; Uruyos, Manachaya] Chulalongkorn Univ, Bangkok, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,"Koda, Y (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, 254 Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",yoshitaka.k@chula.ac.th,,,Chulalongkorn University [CU-58-073-AS],Chulalongkorn University(Chulalongkorn University),"This research was funded by the Ratchadapisek Sompoch Endowment Fund (2015), Chulalongkorn University (CU-58-073-AS).",,24,3,4,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We use descriptive statistics and regression analysis as well as a factor decomposition method to explore the role of various factors affecting household private tutoring expenditure. Empirical results suggest that household private tutoring expenditure have continuously risen over the years. The household socioeconomic status is factor with strong influence and relative importance affecting household private tutoring expenses. There appears to be ethnic disparities in household private tutoring expenditure. Moreover, results also suggest that spending on private tutoring could be reduced if standardized school teacher rates at a district level are increased. If the observed trends in private tutoring continue, they can have social implications for education equity, which can undermine the objective of the free education policy in Sri Lanka.","[Pallegedara, Asankha] Wayamba Univ, Makandura, Sri Lanka; [Pallegedara, Asankha] Passau Univ, Passau, Germany",Wayamba University of Sri Lanka; University of Passau,"Pallegedara, A (通讯作者)，Wayamba Univ Sri Lanka, Dept Ind Management, Kuliyapitiya, Sri Lanka.;Pallegedara, A (通讯作者)，Passau Univ, Chair Dev Econ, Passau, Germany.",asankap@wyb.ac.lk,"Pallegedara, Asankha/AAJ-9612-2020",,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,,46,5,5,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Therein, it sheds light on state depoliticizing practices and local populations' contestations thereof. We argue that participation in the extraction sector has not enabled effective participation and has instead been used to pave the way for expanding the extractive frontiers. We find that the state entity responsible for carrying out the events applied three main depoliticizing practices: (a) the organization of exclusionary participatory processes, (b) the provision of pro-extraction information, and (c) the identification of critical actors and discourses in order to formulate recommendations on how to weaken resistance against the planned activities. This study also reveals that local populations often contested the participatory events and identifies subnational patterns of local contestation. We find that higher degrees of contestation were fueled by previous negative experiences with extraction activities and the existence of local economic alternatives. To assess the histories and results of contestation over specific extractive activities over time, the study draws on monthly conflict reports produced by the Peruvian ombudsperson (2007-2016). We find that local contestation was quite influential, leading to increased social investment programs in the affected areas, the withdrawal of several extraction corporations, and Peru's adoption of the Law on Prior Consultation (2011). However, the long-term prospects of the transformations provoked by repoliticizing processes need to be evaluated in the years to come. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike previous studies, we distinguish between wives and husbands as caregivers and between one's own and one's spouse's parents as care recipients. We find women's depressive state is negatively associated with caregiving for spousal parents both in our instrumental variable estimations and fixed-effect panel analysis, and also find women's life satisfaction is negatively associated with caregiving for spousal parents in our fixed-effect panel analysis, though only marginally so. However, as our results are marginally significant, caregiving for either own or spousal parents does not seem to matter much for caregiver's health or life satisfaction. All that can be said for certain in our paper is that men's subjective health, depressive state, and life satisfaction are generally less sensitive to informal care, for both spousal and own parents, than that of women.","[Wakabayashi, Midori] Tohoku Univ, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Kureishi, Wataru] Natl Inst Populat & Social Secur Res, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan",Tohoku University,"Wakabayashi, M (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Aoba Ku, 27-1 Kawauchi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808576, Japan.",midwak@tohoku.ac.jp,,,[16H03607]; [16K03730],;,"A Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research, Grant/Award Number: 16H03607, 16K03730",,22,5,5,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

To do so, we use the case of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) as a laboratory, in which both stocks and c-bonds are traded by an LOB mechanism. Contrary to the OTC market in the USA, the TASE c-bond market is liquid with narrow spreads and low price dispersion. The short-term traders (STT), who are the analog of the market makers in the LOB, have small trading rents and unconcentrated activity (a low Herfindahl index). In the cross-section of bonds, the low concentration is related to low spreads, low price dispersion, and small STT rents. The non-STT [including retail investors (RIs), whose participation is significant] competes with the STT on quotation and tends to tighter quotes.

The return predictive power of innovative originality is stronger for firms with higher valuation uncertainty, lower investor attention, and greater sensitivity of future profitability to innovative originality.

The pre-switching abnormal accruals are negatively associated with post-switching stock and operating performance, with the association driven mainly by firms with poor earnings in both current and future periods. The results suggest that pre-switching earnings management behavior, on average, supports the managerial opportunism, but not the signaling, intent. In further analysis, we find some evidence that firms with good performance in both current and future periods tend to choose income-decreasing reporting to avoid competition and/or mitigate adverse political attention.","[Liao, Tsai-Ling] Natl Formosa Univ, Coll Management, Dept Business Adm, 64 Wunhua Rd, Huwei 632, Yunlin, Taiwan; [Lin, Wen-Chun] Natl Taipei Univ Business, Dept Finance, 321,Sec 1,Jinan Rd, Taipei, Taiwan",National Formosa University; National Taipei University of Business,"Liao, TL (通讯作者)，Natl Formosa Univ, Coll Management, Dept Business Adm, 64 Wunhua Rd, Huwei 632, Yunlin, Taiwan.",fnwjlin@ntub.edu.tw; tlliao@nfu.edu.tw,,,National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 96-2416-H-126 -012 -MY2],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We appreciate the feedback of seminar participants at the 2011 Asian Finance Association Annual Conference, 2011 American Accounting Association Annual Meeting and 2011 Financial Management Association Annual Meeting.

Since its establishment in 2003, a large number of resource-dependent countries have committed to the EITI Standard, and support of the EITI from donors, nongovernmental organizations, and extractive industry companies has been vast. To understand whether and how adherence to the EITI Standard can affect resource governance and development, it is crucial to examine what factors influence a country's decision to join and implement the Standard. This article examines why and how rapidly countries adopt the Standard using survival analysis methods and a global dataset on countries' progress in implementing the EITI Standard. It finds that several factors influence progress and proposes that these can be categorized as internal motivation, internal capacity, and external pressure to implement the Standard. This article contributes to understanding why the EITI Standard implementation stalls in some countries whereas it progresses in others. Importantly, it outlines which factors need to be controlled for in studies that seek to evaluate the impact of the EITI on resource governance and societal development, and argues that such impact evaluations need to correct for the selection biases in countries' decisions to commit to and implement the EITI Standard.

Access to credit increases likelihood of entry to international markets; however, credit does not increase export volume. Size is a robust indicator of exporting status and the volume of exports.

However, it is puzzling that Japan's trade balance has remained long in deficit even during the sharp depreciation of the Japanese yen beginning at the end of 2012. As a contribution of this study, we provide consistently constructed indices for price and quantity, decomposed at the country and industry level for Japanese exports and imports between 1988 and 2014. Income elasticity, price elasticity, and pass-through elasticity are estimated at the country and industry disaggregated levels. The estimated results support that Japanese trade experienced a structural change both in income and exchange rate pass-through elasticity. After the crisis, Japanese exports became more unresponsive to exchange rate fluctuations, whereas Japanese import prices rose more proportionately with the depreciation of the Japanese yen, and income elasticity of imports rose sharply. The difference in income elasticity between Japan and the rest of world is reminiscent of the Houthakker-Magee effect and suggests that the trade balance of Japan is likely to deteriorate. The decomposition of Japanese trade revealed that almost every element shifted, resulting in the deterioration of the external balance.","[Sasaki, Yuri] Meiji Gakuin Univ, Minato Ku, 1-2-37 Shiroganedai, Tokyo 1088636, Japan; [Yoshida, Yushi] Shiga Univ, 1-1-1 Banba, Hikone, Shiga 5228522, Japan",Shiga University,"Yoshida, Y (通讯作者)，Shiga Univ, 1-1-1 Banba, Hikone, Shiga 5228522, Japan.",yurissk@eco.meijigakuin.ac.jp; yushi.yoshida@biwako.shiga-u.ac.jp,,"Yoshida, Yushi/0000-0003-1938-1053","KAKENHI [15K03557, C26380295]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03557] Funding Source: KAKEN","KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank the editior of IREF, Dr. Hamid Beladi and an annonymous referee for their constructive comments on revising this paper.

Using this particular event to test the effect of the anticorruption regulation, we find that this regulation costs firms with banned directors on average 4%. This cost cannot be explained by the typical cost of losing a director or by damage from a political vendetta conducted by the leadership. We further show that the anticorruption regulation impedes firm value not only through political connections but also through the anticorruption disincentive, the incentive to act passively for fear of being accused of corruption. Finally, affected firms reduce their investments, hire more employees and have poor performance afterwards. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that firm age and firm size are positively linked to SMEs' access to bank loans, but only firm size is positively related to the provision of trade credit. The results also provide empirical support for a complementary rather than a substitutive effect between bank loans and trade credit. Manufacturing SMEs have a significantly higher likelihood of receiving bank loans and trade credit than non-manufacturing SMEs. We find differences across countries in terms of the relevance of firm age and firm size for obtaining capital. In addition, we point at specific country-level variables that explain why obtaining credit is easier in some countries.

It explains and shows how different measures such as shareholder value, economic value added (EVA), return on capital employed (ROCE), return on equity (ROE) and others are calculated and how they correlate to show long-term value added and, therefore, competitive differentiation. As part of the highly professionalized corporate governance approach, the German Corporate Governance Codex (Regierungskommision Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex, 2015) asks for sustainable creation of value. The analyses of 2015 and 2016 annual reports of all 30 corporations state that 80% of the firms show financially relevant value added data and as such measurable competitive advantage on the long run. The paper focuses on which measures are used to quantify the competitive value addition and then shows how EVA or company specific EVA-like measures in addition to ROCE are the most used ones. Furthermore, the paper shows that ROCE with a factor of 0.97 in 2015 and 0.74 in 2016 correlates best with EVA and, in absence of an EVA calculation, is the best measure to represent value creation as a competitive differentiator. The results can be useful to strengthen competitiveness for policymakers both in non-profit and for-profit social economy entities.","[Blendinger, Guenter] Tech Univ Kosice TUKE, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia; [Blendinger, Guenter] Univ Appl Sci Heilbronn, Dinkelweg 28, D-74523 Schwabisch Hall, Germany; [Michalski, Grzegorz] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Engn & Econ, Komandorska 118, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Technical University Kosice; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Blendinger, G (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice TUKE, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia.;Blendinger, G (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Heilbronn, Dinkelweg 28, D-74523 Schwabisch Hall, Germany.",guenter.blendinger@web.de; grzegorz.michalski@ue.wroc.pl,"Michalski, Grzegorz/A-4771-2010","Michalski, Grzegorz/0000-0002-8211-4057",National Science Centre; [UMO-2015/19/B/HS4/01686]; [DEC-2015/19/B/HS4/01686],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland); ;","The presented work with is results is part of a monothematic cycle done as part of the grant, Determinants of capital structure in non-profit organizations''.

We show that this program was equally accessible to African-American applicants, except between 1995 and 2000, when African Americans' conditional probability of purchasing a home through the program was lowered by 10% compared to that of other applicants, maybe as a temporary response to the sudden surge in African American applicants that occurred at that time, even though we cannot rule out that this may also have reflected changes in applicant behavior. Turning to the outcome of the allocation process, we show that African American MPDU beneficiaries purchase homes located in cheaper neighborhoods and that the spatial allocation of beneficiaries does reflect preference-based sorting patterns observed on the private housing market at the neighborhood level. However, we also show that the program seems to induce some scattering of different ethnic groups at the most local level: when comparing beneficiaries living in the same housing development, but at different addresses, we find that African American beneficiaries have fewer African-American neighbors.","[Diagne, Adji Fatou; Kurban, Haydar] Howard Univ, Washington, DC 20059 USA; [Schmutz, Benoit] Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France; [Schmutz, Benoit] CREST, Palaiseau, France",Howard University; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Schmutz, B (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France.;Schmutz, B (通讯作者)，CREST, Palaiseau, France.",adji.f.diagne@bison.howard.edu; haydar.kurban@howard.edu; benoit.schmutz@polytechnique.edu,,,"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation [AE000103]","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation","This paper update work registered as CREST Working Paper 2017-47.

Such regulatory initiatives presuppose that excess speculation is indeed responsible for excess volatility. Our results debunk this presupposition and show the opposite effect: speculative activity reduces price volatility, particularly during times of distress. Our findings are based on a cross-section of wheat futures contracts, traded at five different commodity exchanges with various degrees of speculative activity. Volatility is estimated based on a Conditional Autoregressive Range Model (CARR), which is further augmented with exogenous excess-speculation shocks (CARRX). These models capture herding, feedback and noise trading, and a threshold version (TCARRX) identifies regimes in which the anatomy of the volatility process changes according to the level of excess speculation.

J,"Johnson, M",,,,"Johnson, Marianne",,,Rules versus authorities,PUBLIC CHOICE,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,James M. Buchanan; Henry C. Simons; Rules; Authorities; History of public choice,JAMES M. BUCHANAN; CHICAGO SCHOOL; PUBLIC CHOICE; ECONOMICS,"I present a brief history of modern public choice analysis as told through the lens of rules versus authorities, a dichotomy initially formulated by Henry C. Simons, University of Chicago professor to James M. Buchanan. Framing political decision-making as a choice between rules and authorities allows us to identify two necessary, motivating ideas for the emergence of public choice: (1) Governments are not monolithic, omniscient, social calculating machines, but are instead a collection of individuals with various and possibly competing interests. (2) Rather than empowering bureaucracies, economists and political scientists should devise rules that constrain government experts and protect democratic decision-making. Lurking behind both ideas is the legacy of Simons and his antipathy to expert management of the economy. In that antipathy, Simons makes an important contribution to the intellectual history of public choice and to Buchanan's research program.","[Johnson, Marianne] Univ Wisconsin, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Johnson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",johnsonm@uwosh.edu,"Johnson, Marianne/CAF-5068-2022",,,,,,59,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2018,175.0,3-4,,,,,219,228,,10.1007/s11127-018-0544-2,0.0,,,10,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GG9QZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433037400001,0

Considering national and international legislation, and best practices, audit committees' adequacy involves the issues regarding committees and the responsibilities of committees. Interviews and questionnaires in 6 deposit banks were carried out to investigate the adequacy of the audit committees. The data, collected through the interviews and questionnaires, were analyzed by frequency analyses, alfa test and t-tests. According to the results, a variety of deficiencies were determined in the audit committees' structure and responsibilities of internal control, risk management, accounting and financial reporting, independent auditing, valuation services, and rating bureaus. Although all the banks examined in the study were deposit banks, the adequacy of the audit committees varied according to the banks. Banks' board of directors and the audit committees should update their approach in order to carry out their duties more efficiently. Copyright (C) 2018, Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi.
