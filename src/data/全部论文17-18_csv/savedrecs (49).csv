More specifically, this study tested a relationships between hotel employees' tourism and job involvement and their customer orientation. Moreover relationships between customer orientation and both role-prescribed and extra-role customer service were also examined. The study was conducted in hotels located in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, which is a tourist destination in Northern Poland with extensive accommodation infrastructure. The research hypotheses were tested using data from employees who deal directly with hotel guests. The study results revealed that a higher level of employees' job involvement may strengthen their customer orientation, and similarly, the more hotel employees are interested in tourism and receive pleasure from it, the higher customer-orientation they display. Additionally, customer orientation may have positive consequences for employees' customer service, both prescribed and extra role. The research value of this study may result from the fact that so far few studies have examined the impact of non-job related factors on service employees' attitudes and behaviors at work. Specifically tourism involvement has not been widely explored in the management literature. This study is among the first that examine the relationships between tourism and job involvement and employees' customer orientation and its consequences for service performance in the context of hospitality industry in Poland.","[Grobelna, Aleksandra] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Grobelna, A (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",a.grobelna@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Grobelna, Aleksandra/R-3357-2018","Grobelna, Aleksandra/0000-0002-1765-6757",,,,,46,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,347,357,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300035,0

While regulation did not play a meaningful role in the recent housing market boom and bust in California, this paper finds that where housing demand increased through the expansion of subprime lending, land constraints exacerbated the run-up and subsequent crash of local housing prices.","[Jackson, Kristoffer Kip] Off Comptroller Currency, Irvine, CA 92612 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,"Jackson, K (通讯作者)，Off Comptroller Currency, Irvine, CA 92612 USA.",kip.r.jackson@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,20,28,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

One of the optional CSR topics is animal welfare. Our exploratory qualitative study reveals which factors of communication stimulate an attitude of responsibility towards animals in the animal-based food industry. It shows that a manager who is made responsible for animal welfare can strengthen the company's ethical position in two ways. The first one is to connect with stakeholders within and outside the company. The second way is to facilitate, as a moderator, connections between these stakeholders in which the manager is not involved per se. In both cases, if these connections take the form of personal meetings, this is extra helpful for enhancing a responsible attitude towards animals, because that is how insight, trust and collaboration are gained and sustained.","[Janssens, M.

Hence, the regulation explicitly excluded recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) from organic certification. Yet no definition of the crucial normative criterion 'closeness to nature' is provided. For clarifying the term, we suggest to regard 'closeness to nature' being the outcome of a mixed ethical judgment: a multi-step procedure, which depends on descriptive premises as well as normative judgments. In order to obtain evidence of whether and how RAS may meet the criterion, it is necessary to consider ways on how 'closeness to nature' in (organic) aquaculture can be determined. This paper shall discuss three different perspectives. A first perspective can be assigned from nature conservation. There, concepts of naturalness and liemeroby' were developed to measure human impacts on ecosystems. In a second perspective, 'closeness to nature' in animal livestock is associated with indicators for animal welfare. The third perspective deals with existing approaches for 'natural' livestock farming, which were developed throughout the foundation of different organic farming associations. In particular, these approaches stress the importance of closed natural cycles and the resilience of natural systems. We will investigate different possibilities and constraints concerning the 'closeness to nature' criteria focusing on organic aquaculture in the EU We first clarify the understanding of 'closeness to nature' resulting from a mixed ethical judgment. Then, the different approaches for defining grades of 'closeness to nature' will be contrasted, scrutinising possibilities as well as constraints regarding the application of these criteria. In conclusion, we argue that 'closeness to nature' as such cannot be sufficient to exclude RAS from organic certification completely.","[Kerr, M.; Potthast, T.] Univ Tubingen, Int Ctr Eth Sci & Humanities, Fac Math & Sci, Wilhelmstr 19, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Potthast, T.] Univ Tubingen, Fac Math & Sci, Chair Eth Philosophy & Hist Life Sci, Wilhelmstr 19, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Kerr, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Int Ctr Eth Sci & Humanities, Fac Math & Sci, Wilhelmstr 19, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",matthias.kerr@posteo.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture [2815OE026],German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture,"This paper further develops aspects of the project Stakeholder-Studie 'Kreislaufanlagen -Positionen des Okosektors' (Bergleiter et al., 2017) funded by German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (project no. 2815OE026).",,18,3,3,1,2,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,450,455,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_71,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000071,0

The data used in the analysis of this paper has been obtained from the official OECD database and we have been analyzing the data between 2005 and 2015. We use the health indicators to point out the performance of healthcare systems of individual OECD countries. The efficiency results are obtained by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). DEA is an analysis of the efficiency of production units, which give us the efficiency score of the specified individual units. DEA is also used for the examination of the efficiency in the services sector. In this way, we can point to the level of efficiency of the health systems of the individual OECD countries.

The pursuit of sustainable agricultural development requires the use of optimum manufacturing processes, which should be cost-effective and environmentally-friendly. To do so, it is useful, if not necessary, to supplement a farm's production potential. The use of production services is an alternative to investing in technical farming equipment or to purchasing some productive inputs. It is therefore worth considering how, and to what extent, production services in agriculture may support the pursuit of sustainable manufacturing processes. The aim of this paper is to present the changes in the use of selected production services in agriculture against the background of the concept of sustainable agriculture. Also, this paper attempts to answer the question of the role of services in pursuit of sustainability in the agriculture sector. The following was considered: the relationships between production services and the implementability of the sustainable agriculture model; and the level of (and changes to) the use of these services in EU countries demonstrating different levels of economic development, different natural conditions and different agricultural production patterns. The analysis was based on a deductive method and correlation analysis. The study was based on relevant literature and statistical data. The average use of production services is greater in the agriculture of EU-15 than in EU-10 countries. This suggests a relationship between economic development levels (including agricultural ones) and the use of production services. In EU-15 countries, there is evident correlation between the use of services and fixed capital formation. In the EU-10, that correlation is weaker for agricultural services, but tends to be stronger for veterinary services. The use of production services may support the pursuit of sustainable agricultural development, provided that farm managers take sustainability into consideration in their decisions.","[Kolodziejczak, Malgorzata; Poczta, Walenty] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Kolodziejczak, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Poznan, Poland.",malgorzata.kolodziejczak@up.poznan.pl; poczta@up.poznan.pl,"Kołodziejczak, Małgorzata/ABE-9746-2020","Kołodziejczak, Małgorzata/0000-0001-5615-5560",,,,,27,0,0,0,4,STANISLAW STASZIC UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES PILA,PILA,"UL PODCHORAZYCH 10, PILA, 64-920, POLAND",,,978-83-62617-89-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,121,139,,10.14595/CP/01/009,0.0,,,19,Development Studies; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BM3DE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461899000009,0

Materiality in financial audit determines financial and non-financial misstatements. The level of materiality, in turn, enables the auditor to define the scope of financial audit procedures and constitutes an important reference for the assessment of the effect of the misstatements in the financial statements revealed by the auditor and their impact on the reliability of financial statements.

In this paper, we study three-candidate elections and we identify, under various conditions, which SER minimizes the probability that a monotonicity paradox occurs. We also analyze some strategic aspects of these monotonicity failures.

This has not gone unnoticed by philosophers who critically appraise the concept and its normative assumptions (cf. Capps and Lederman, 2015; Thompson and List, 2015; Verweij and Bovenkerk, 2016). Though applauded for bringing together a diversity of disciplines to deliver solution to multifarious problems, the concept involves ambiguity. On the one hand, its added value sometimes remains unclear when narrowly understood as cooperation between veterinary professionals and their human health counterparts, on topics such as zoonotic disease and antimicrobial resistance. On the other hand, more broadly interpreted, One Health encompasses everything related to health, which may lead some to question its relevance and applicability. To address these vulnerabilities of the One Health concept we suggest a four-way distinction of functions. This avoids a narrow understanding by pointing out the relevance of health promotion, while at the same time putting flesh on the bones of OH as a full-fledged perspective on interspecies health policy. We believe these functions provide a compelling specification of One Health, enriching practical application as well as ethical reflection. We complement this proposal with an outline for an ethical framework to support decision-making at different levels within a One Health perspective.","[Meijboom, F. L.

To be prepared to respond to evolving requirements of employers and accounting profession in general, students should be enabled to develop a range of specific analytical and IT skills and competencies.

The external changes impose the necessity of flexible activity with keeping the priorities coming from strategic goals of the organisation. The sheer strategy also undergoes perpetual changes. These changes are both adaptable and developmental. In this context management of change grows to the rank of key competence. It is the competence of entire organisations which have to know how to activate their resources and support high level of organisational energy. So that implemented changes are the source of competitiveness and values. It is also the competence that is assigned to managers who make decisions about dynamics and process of changes. That is why diagnosing of managerial staff's opinion about the conditioning of change management had been considered as cognitively interesting. The inquiry form has been used as a research instrument. Middle and senior management (60 people) that represent corporate sector were involved in the research. It comes from the research that in the Polish enterprises adaptable changes (including mainly adjustment to changing rules of law) and the changes that constitute the answer to the crisis found in an enterprise dominate in Polish enterprises. Changes in the employment pattern, in organisational structure and technological ones are the most often made changes. The stakeholders who initiate changes are primarily the executive, the owners and also competing enterprises. Wrong policies of informing about the changes, making adjustments chaotically and employees' reluctance to the changes have been stated by the respondents as the most important barriers in management of change.","[Moczydlowska, Joanna M.] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland; [Wiacek, Marta] Krynica Vitamin SA, Warsaw, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Moczydlowska, JM (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",joanna@moczydlowska.pl; mwiacek3@poczta.onet.pl,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,90,97,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300011,0

Scientists and specialists, economists, geographers, demographers, town planners engaged in the theory and practice of forming suburban area, determining their boundaries, proposed different approaches, and therefore there is no generally recognized unified methodology and methods. In the article the approaches of scientists concerning the definition of the suburban area boundaries are analyzed: the radius of production and transportation of agricultural products, pendulum migrations, functional connections, the city as a center of gravity, the application of normative indicators, the location of suburban buildings and places for mass recreation of the population. Nowadays the issue remains relevant and open. To solve it, one should pay attention to the effectiveness of the ties between the city and the adjacent territory. The suburban area is formed under the influence of the city, its territory can be determined only on the basis of integrated accounting of functional ties with the city, the tightness and stability of these links, and the appointment of suburban space to meet the needs of the city. The main goal when allocating the border of the suburban area should be to consider it as a territory in the suburban space, which functions with the city as a whole. For this, it is necessary: to conduct a general analysis of the development of the territories surrounding the city, including the study of demography, economics, production, land use, ecology on the basis of statistical information; substantiation of factors and indicators affecting the emergence of ties between the city and the suburbs; the establishment of functions; the allocation of territories located in the zone of influence of the city; the definition of the border of the suburban area on the basis of complex zoning, which reflects the main functional connections.","[Oliinyk, V.

A Study of the Politics of German Employers,NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Business and politics; welfare state politics; political economy of entrepreneurship; history of economic ideas; P12; P16; H50; H70; J58,SOCIAL-SECURITY; STRUCTURAL POWER; CAPITALISTS,"Social scientists dealing with business and politics have tended to focus mostly on the power of business and less on the political challenges and constraints that business interest groups face. This paper analyses how business interest groups respond to political initiatives that challenge their interests, using four episodes of political conflict in Germany. The paper elaborates a model of response strategies and their likely impact on political outcomes. The model suggests that business interest groups can respond to political challenges in two ways: by seeking confrontation or by pursuing adaptation. The paper illustrates these two response strategies with four episodes of political conflict in the political-economic history of Germany: (i) the adoption of social insurance under Bismarck, (ii) the adoption of unemployment insurance in the 1920s, (iii) the adoption of board-level codetermination in the early 1950s, (iv) and the Agenda 2010 labour market reforms of the early 2000s. These four case studies show that adaptation facilitates social compromise, while confrontation results in a bifurcated outcome, producing either dominance or defeat of business interests, depending on what side government takes. Furthermore, the analysis finds that confrontation tends to be associated with a unity of interests within the business community, while adaptation tends to be associated with a fragmentation of interests. The discussion emphasises that the role of business in politics should not be seen solely in terms of business influencing' politics, but also as potentially adaptive.","[Paster, Thomas] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Paster, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark.",paster@sam.sdu.dk,"Paster, Thomas/F-3787-2015","Paster, Thomas/0000-0001-9762-5813","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [705677]; Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne; Central European University, Institute for Advanced Study, Budapest; Collegio Carlo Alberto, Turin; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [705677] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(Marie Curie Actions); Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne; Central European University, Institute for Advanced Study, Budapest; Collegio Carlo Alberto, Turin; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions)","Research for this paper was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 705677.

For the vendors who has become online, it is a challenge to transfer all their knowledge and practise from traditional trading to the online. It is impossible to do business only with already used traditional approaches because purchase as a process and customers behaviour in the online dimension differs from traditional one. As a result, authors will show the main approaches that will be useful for the company strategies building a long-term relationship with their customers and making them loyal.

Findings show that the three main areas in which Albanian companies intend to develop their business are: (i) Increase annual turnover by opening new markets; (ii) Develop and market new products/ services; (iii) To develop staffing skills. Anyway, the interest to invest and to develop seems to vary widely based on the sector. One of the limitations of this study includes the fact that questionnaire is self-evaluative and the veracity of their responses is questionable.","[Ruxho, Filip] European Univ Tirana, Tirana, Albania",European University of Tirana,"Ruxho, F (通讯作者)，European Univ Tirana, Tirana, Albania.",routzio@gmail.com,"Ruxho, Filip/AAY-6245-2021",,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,48,55,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300006,0

There is no compelling reason for choosing the normal distribution. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to find out the real distributions based on the concept of copulas and then better quantify the credit risk. There is a portfolio that consists of ten bonds issued by quoted companies in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) with a 10-million-euro total nominal value over one year, from January 9th, 2017 to January 8th, 2018. The credit risk of the portfolio is quantified under the framework of the CreditMetrics (TM) model, a typical industry example of the threshold models. Two main types of copulas include elliptical copulas and Archimedean copulas. The parameters of a parametric copula are estimated by MLE and then the copula is selected by computing AIC and BIC. Compared with the original CreditMetrics (TM) model with an assumption of normal distribution, the probability density curve obtained based on copulas are more right-tailed and the credit risk of the portfolio is better quantified.","[Tian, Yuan] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Tian, Y (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.",yuan.tian@vsb.cz,,,project SGS VSB-TUO [SP2017/148],project SGS VSB-TUO,The research is due to the support provided by the project SGS VSB-TUO SP2017/148.

Among the main problems Croatia is facing in seeking to exploit the full potential of what it can offer on the global tourist market is the seasonal character of its tourism and the predominance of mass tourism during the summer months. Thus, the need to position Croatia as a year-round destination has often been a topic of great discussion. In order to achieve this goal, Croatia must continue to develop its continental tourism offer, which, although diverse, is still recognized only locally. Introducing and enhancing the offer to include regions in which tourism is less developed will not put a widely recognized coastal tourism oft at risk from cannibalization, but rather complement it, and, initially, fill in the gap in the off season. In order to gain a better insight into the needs of modern tourists, the paper analyses the attributes of tourists who visited coastal Croatia as one of the vital elements for designing a competitive strategy for enhancing its tourism product. This analysis and its conclusions are merely preliminary research efforts in a series of activities of a complex process. Secondary data from TOMAS Summer 2017 publication by the Ministry of Tourism and eVisitor web platform data are used for the purpose of this research. Some attributes of the behaviour, attitudes, and habits of international tourists have been identified and used to make the recommendations necessary to encourage a constructive dialogue on the development of continental Croatia.","[Turkalj, Davorin; Bilos, Antun] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Bogovic, Ivan] Hotel Savus, Slavonski Brod, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Turkalj, D (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",davorin@efos.hr; abilos@efos.hr; ibogovic.savus@gmail.com,"Biloš, Antun/AAF-9709-2020","Biloš, Antun/0000-0003-1676-5959",,,,,15,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1652,1666,,,,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300092,0

However, there are also situations where this mutual benefit is not that evident. For instance, when restrictions of veterinary use of antimicrobials to protect public health negatively affects animal health. This confronts veterinarians with a conflict of professional responsibilities. Society expects veterinarians to safeguard animal health and welfare as well as veterinary public health. But if a One Health strategy to combat zoonotic disease threats leads to a conflict of these interests, whose health should veterinarians protect? Working in the context of the food industry, veterinarians are sometimes forced to favour the economic interests of farmers over those of animals. With the One Health framework emphasizing the threat of zoonotic diseases for public health, veterinarians seem to have yet another reason to let human interests prevail. Our claim is that a more holistic perspective on One Health gives veterinarians an opportunity to strengthen their position as animal advocates. We will argue that the best way to safeguard human health is to promote the health of animals and the environment because prevention is better than cure. This implies the veterinary profession should promote animal husbandry systems in which the health and welfare of animals are integrated with attention to public health and the environment. We will substantiate this empirical claim by elaborating the role of veterinarians in antimicrobial resistance policies in the Netherlands and conclude that to serve public health, the central responsibility of veterinarians should be to champion animal health and welfare.","[van Herten, J.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Herten, J.] Royal Vet Assoc Netherlands, Molen 77, NL-3995 AW Houten, Netherlands; [Meijboom, F.

The paper presents an overview of six cumulative stages of management development within the police, and the principles of management, i.e. by its traditional and proactive approaches we explain the duties of the police: to respond, to regulate, to restrain, to recover, to suppress and to intensify. Over the years, the police have developed and passed on newer models of duties. Therefore, the paper presents the profile of the manager in the traditional, business and community policing model. The community policing model, in post-socialist countries, was used to transform the militia into a modern democratic police force. In this way, the community policing was adopted and enforced by decree without adequate personnel, material or legal resources. Several studies conducted on police officers' samples (Karlovie, 2012, Cajner Mraovie, Faber, 2016, Borovec, Prpie, 2017) showed that one part of the reform or planned projects within the community policing model was not implemented or did not achieve sustainable results, it is precisely about projects concerning the internal democratization of the police. Given that these researches are carried out on different instruments, at different times and on ihfferent samples of police officers in the Republic of Croatia, it is necessary to unify them and to collectively observe to date results and knowledge about the implementation of modern democratic police such as the community policing model. In addition to lacking researches on police and management in Croatia, there is also a lack of research on the implementation of democratic models of police, such as community policing.","[Vitez, Drazen] Minist Interior, Zagreb, Croatia; [Prpic, Marko] Univ Zagreb, Dept Croatian Studies, Zagreb, Croatia; [Pucar, Marin] Podravka, Koprivnica, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Vitez, D (通讯作者)，Minist Interior, Zagreb, Croatia.",dvitez@mup.hr; prpic.marcus@gmail.com; marin.pucar@podravka.hr,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1701,1703,,,,,,3,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300095,0

The article sums up the main features of recent European nationalisation and reveals similarities and differences in this context. It argues that although current ownership changes in Hungary are outwardly consistent with those that have occurred in other European countries (and in the United States), they in fact reflect the particular agenda of the post-2010 Orban government.

The goal of this council or board, is to encourage a responsible attitude towards the woods on the planet, through the awareness of those who are managing forests, timber and manufacturing industries as well as consumer awareness of the importance of sustainable development, which will contribute to increasing the company's image with FSC certified that engaged in trade, processing and wood processing. Certification of forest resources involves meeting certain standards that have been defined. Standards can vary to some extent depending on the program of certification, but it could generally be said that they are unique and common to most forest types, regardless of the character of the property and the attitude of the management. Most of the standards described principles (principles), criteria and indicators. The conclusion is that the business improvement of forests is necessary, but also inevitable, because of significant achievements of modern management, and constantly changing economic environment and environmental conditions. Furthermore, business improvement is the most important operational support forthcoming the restructuring of the company, where it has to rely on human resources, which are rated as highly qualified, but they need to be stimulated by organizational and motivational tools. The decentralization of planning and decision-making is the key to improving forestry business because of the adaptation of the objectives of a modern multi-functional forestry, which increasingly involves socially responsible forest management. Any improvement of the forestry business must start from its place and position of basic unit where basic public and commercial activities of the forestry sector are performed, and to evaluate possible contributions to the improvement of a particular management function should be considered the best practices of the realization practice in comparable activities, and only promotion must be equally referred to the economic activity of the forestry, but also to the public educational function of forestry in the environment.","[Vukoja, Bozo] Revident Doo, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg; [Kozina, Goran] Univ North, Koprivnica, Croatia; [Tunjic, Duro] TUV Croatia Doo, Zagreb, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Vukoja, B (通讯作者)，Revident Doo, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg.",bozo.vukoja@tel.net.ba; gkozina@unin.hr; dtunjic@tuv-croatia.hr,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,190,196,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540718700019,0

The fluid effects of outbound FDI oppose the popular dollar-for-dollar hypothesis. Although lower corruption and higher human capital strengthen, weaken, or do not change the degree of these FDI effects, the data are inconsistent with the hypothesis of a global optimum for corruption or human capital.

As a result of 'Brexit', the EU may find that the impetus for further harmonization and integration in this field is lost, such as with the EU unitary patent. However, the consequences for the UK are likely to be more severe - a loss of influence, both over laws that govern it and in exporting IP norms internationally, as well as a loss of access to certain protections, agencies and market sectors that are within the UK's economic interests.","[Fanand, Benjamin] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Fanand, B (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",b.farrand@warwick.ac.uk,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023",,,,,,42,3,4,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Stimulated by such policies, sales of EVs exceeded 500,000 in 2016. However, the subsidies for EVs will be abrogated after 2020. In order to maintain market stability, the EV-related policy system needs innovation. Nonetheless, it is still unclear how effective different policy incentives are. By conducting a discrete choice experiment involving 247 respondents and using a mixed logit model, this paper investigates the effectiveness of several potential policy incentives except subsidization policies, as well as the influence of socio-psychologist determinants. The results help to offer suggestions for the EV-related policy reformation. As expected, the probability of stated EV-acceptance increases if policy incentives are provided in the choice experiment. EVs are exempted from purchase restrictions (license plate control policy) and driving restrictions in China, and these two transport policy incentives have the most significant positive effects on the EV-acceptance. Discounted/free electric charging also has great contribution. Preferential bus lane access gains increasing attention. Vehicle purchase tax exemption should be resumed because of its positive influence. Comparatively speaking, the financial incentives (e.g., reduced parking fees) in the EV using stage play a weaker role.","[Wang, Ning; Tang, Linhao; Pan, Huizhong] Tongji Univ, Sch Automot Studies, Room B204,4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Tongji University,"Tang, LH (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Sch Automot Studies, Room B204,4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wangning@tongji.edu.cn; tanglinhao228@outlook.com; huixhong_pan@hotmail.com,,", Wang/0000-0002-9300-9308",Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2015BAG11B00]; Shanghai Soft Science Research Project [16692103700],"Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); Shanghai Soft Science Research Project",This study was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (Grant no. 2015BAG11B00) and the Shanghai Soft Science Research Project (Grant no. 16692103700).,,32,106,114,7,114,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

To promote the adoption of EVs, great efforts have been made and a series of policy measures have been introduced. However, the widespread adoption of EVs is likely to be insufficient. This study divides policy measures into three catalogs (i.e., financial incentive policy measures, information provision policy measures and convenience policy measures) and investigates how these policy measures motivate consumers to adopt EVs and how such effects are moderated by consumers' environmental concern. The results of a survey of 324 respondents suggest that three catalogs of policy measures are positively and significantly related to EVs adoption intention, and convenience policy measures are the most important policy measures to promote EVs. In addition, the results indicate that consumers' environmental concern plays a moderating role in the relationships between two catalogs of policy measures (financial incentive policy measures and convenience policy measures) and EVs adoption intention.

Analysis of serial dependence can reveal the impact of current tourism demand on the future. This is important for tourism demand forecasting, as the prediction of future tourism demand relies highly on the historical demand information. However, serial dependence, especially its structure, has received very little attention in previous tourism research. The copula method is flexible as it provides various functions to specify different serial dependence structures and allows arbitrary distributions of tourism demand. We used five types of copulas to analyse two-dimensional serial dependence structure for 10 arrivals series to Singapore. The empirical findings show that serial dependence structures of arrivals can be non-linear.

Drawing on interviews with 39 women sex workers in Australia and Canada, we explore three key contrasts between dominant narratives and interventions that frame 'exiting' as escape from trauma or exploitation, and sex workers' assessments of 'exiting' as a personal or professional strategy. First, we explore sex workers' perceptions of sex work as temporary work. Second, we analyse the symbiosis between exit plans and current work practices. Third, we examine workers' assessment of the value of 'exiting' sex work in the context of changing market forces within the sex industry, the 'square' labour market (or non-sex work sectors) and exiting interventions (i.e. programmes to assist workers in leaving sex work).","[Ham, Julie] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Sociol, Room 9-08,Jockey Club Tower,Centennial Campus, Pokulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gilmour, Fairleigh] Univ Otago, Criminol & Gender Studies, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Hong Kong; University of Otago,"Ham, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Sociol, Room 9-08,Jockey Club Tower,Centennial Campus, Pokulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jham@hku.hk,,,,,,,26,15,17,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

On the other hand, survey expectations can accurately predict yields, but they are typically not available for all maturities and/or forecast horizons. We show how survey expectations can be exploited to improve the accuracy of yield curve forecasts given by a base model. We do so by employing a flexible exponential tilting method that anchors the model forecasts to the survey expectations, and we develop a test to guide the choice of the anchoring points. The method implicitly incorporates into yield curve forecasts any information that survey participants have access to-such as information about the current state of the economy or forward-looking information contained in monetary policy announcements-without the need to explicitly model it. We document that anchoring delivers large and significant gains in forecast accuracy relative to the class of models that are widely adopted by financial and policy institutions for forecasting the term structure of interest rates.","[Altavilla, Carlo] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Giacomini, Raffaella] UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Ragusa, Giuseppe] Luiss Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; University of London; University College London; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Giacomini, R (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",r.giacomini@ucl.ac.uk,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017","Ragusa, Giuseppe/0000-0002-6964-6278",British Academy Mid-career Fellowship,British Academy Mid-career Fellowship,"We would like to thank the Editor, two anonymous referees and M.

Specifically, we investigate whether the merged municipalities rapidly increase their expenditures and bonds just before mergers. Because the likelihood of Japanese municipal mergers depends on a municipality's characteristics such as population size, area, and fiscal conditions, municipal mergers are a non-voluntary and non-random phenomenon in Japan. Therefore, we identify causal effects by applying propensity score matching within a differences-in-differences framework to address the problems of endogeneity bias and sample selection bias. In particular, we focus on the subordinate merger partner in absorption-type mergers. Our results show that the subordinate merger partner suffers from adverse fiscal conditions and creates a fiscal common pool problem in public projects just before mergers.","[Hirota, Haruaki] Musashi Univ, Fac Econ, Nerima Ku, 1-26-1 Toyotama Kami, Tokyo 1768534, Japan; [Yunoue, Hideo] Univ Hyogo, Sch Econ, Nishi Ku, 8-2-1 Gakuen Nishi, Kobe, Hyogo 6512197, Japan",University of Hyogo,"Hirota, H (通讯作者)，Musashi Univ, Fac Econ, Nerima Ku, 1-26-1 Toyotama Kami, Tokyo 1768534, Japan.",hirota@cc.musashi.ac.jp; yunoue@econ.u-hyogo.ac.jp,"Hirota, Haruaki/GNH-5124-2022","Yunoue, Hideo/0000-0002-7831-0266; Hirota, Haruaki/0000-0002-0978-8629","Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance [1527]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26780181, 17K13752, 161113371, 151103361]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K13752, 15H03361, 26780181] Funding Source: KAKEN","Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank Shiro Armstrong, Geoffrey Brennan, Bjorn Griesbach, Kazuld Hiraga, Shigemichi Kanasaka, Takashi Kuramoto, Isamu Matsukawa, Tomomi Miyazald, Hiroshi Nakano, Katsuyoshi Nakazawa, Shigeharu Okajima, Kazuki Onji, Kimiyoshi Kameda, Kuniaki Nemoto, Tatsuyoshi Okimoto, Ilde Rizzo, Hitoshi Saito, Shin Saito, Kenta Tanaka, Akiyuki Tonogi, Rei Yamamoto and Kazufumi Yugami for their helpful comments and suggestions.

This lack of an indicator can be acute when the project selection process requires consideration of how a given investment supports increased multimodality. In response to this need, this research reports on a taxonomy for classifying the degree of multimodality for transportation projects. Probability theory was employed with principal component analysis to create a new indicator based on both demand (modal shares) and supply (monetary investment for each mode). The indicator offers three main benefits in the area of performance measurement: (1) it is applicable in cases when some data are missing; (2) it provides a way of comparing multimodality from diverse projects such as high occupancy toll lanes or multimodal centers; and (3) it can help decision-makers quantify how multimodality has changed over time. For example, application of the indicator to six U.S. public-private partnership projects in Colorado, Florida, Rhode Island, and Virginia showed that the degree of multimodality increased by an average value of 57%. (While the manner in which the impact boundary is defined affects this calculation for specific projects, the average value remained relatively stable whether the impact boundary was equal to the average commute trip length- or less than half that amount.) Given that some planners view multimodality as societally beneficial, the indicator proposed herein can help one evaluate the multimodal potential of proposed transportation investments.

The results produced by the dynamic generalised method of moments estimator provide some evidence for a linear and inverse U-shape' relationship between financial development and income inequality, and increasing the relative importance of financial markets to banks helps to reduce income inequality. Furthermore, the results of panel threshold regressions show that the benefits of financial development only occur if the stock market activity has reached a threshold level and disappear if the stock market capitalisation has reached a certain scale. Meanwhile, the impact of the financial structure weakens as the financial development expands and the proportion of financial markets increases.

We estimate a collective labor supply model with distributional factors which is extended to include preferences over marketable public goods (including child goods). In this way, unlike previous research, we consider the impact of such transfers on the intrahousehold allocation of resources and distinguish between the labeling and recipient effects. We exploit the UK experience and find evidence in favor of the collective model with separable preferences over labor supplies and public goods. This finding implies a recipient effect and not a labeling effect of child benefits. Given the household's unearned income, the bigger the wife's bargaining power, the more the resources allocated to public goods (including child goods) and the wife's private consumption. The results can be useful in the design of family policy which aims to improve the relative welfare of children within the family and alleviate any intrahousehold consumption inequalities.","[Lyssiotou, Panayiota] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus,"Lyssiotou, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",p.lyssiotou@ucy.ac.cy,,,University of Cyprus,University of Cyprus,"I am very grateful to the Editor, Associate Editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

F., and J. R. Russell. 1998. Autoregressive Conditional Duration: A New Model for Irregularly Spaced Transaction Data. Econometrica 66: 1127-1162). ACD models are useful for modeling the time between the events, especially, in financial context, the time between trading of stocks. In this paper, we propose a specific type of nonstationary ACD model, viz., time varying ACD model (tvACD), by allowing the parameters of the usual ACD model to vary as functions of time. Some probabilistic and inferential aspects of such models have been investigated. We also develop a local polynomial procedure for the estimation of the parameter functions of the proposed tvACD model. Asymptotic properties of the estimators have been investigated, including the asymptotic normality. The asymptotic distribution being dependent on the parameters of the original distribution, a weighted bootstrap estimator is suggested and its validity is established. Simulation study and empirical analysis using high frequency data (HFD) from National Stock Exchange (NSE, INDIA) illustrate the application of the proposed tvACD model.","[Mishra, Anuj; Ramanathan, Thekke Variyam] Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Dept Stat, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India; [Mishra, Anuj; Ramanathan, Thekke Variyam] Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Ctr Adv Studies, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India",Savitribai Phule Pune University; Savitribai Phule Pune University,"Ramanathan, TV (通讯作者)，Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Dept Stat, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.;Ramanathan, TV (通讯作者)，Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Ctr Adv Studies, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.",ram@unipune.ac.in,,"Ramanathan, Thekke/0000-0003-1836-6169","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India; Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India [SR/S4/MS:866/13]","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India","Authors are thankful to the editor and the referee for their comments.

Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the standard GMM estimation is inconsistent and susceptible to Type II errors (incorrect nonrejection of false models).

The key independent variable was height measured in centimeters, which was included as a series of dummy indicators of height per 5 cm span (<155 cm, 155-160 cm,160-165 cm, and >= 165 cm for women; <165 cm, 165-170 cm, 170-175 cm, 175-180 cm, and >= 180 cm for men). We controlled for household- and individual-level random effects. We used a random-effect quantile regression model for monthly wages to assess the heterogeneity in the height wage relationship, across the conditional distribution of monthly wages. We found a non-linear relationship of height with monthly wages. For men, the magnitude of the height wage premium was overall larger at the upper quantile of the conditional distribution of log monthly wages than at the median to low quantile, particularly in professional and semi-professional occupations. The height wage premium was also larger at the 90th quantile for self-employed women and salaried men. Our findings add a global dimension to the existing evidence on height-wage premium, demonstrating non-linearity in the association between height and wages and heterogeneous changes in the dispersion and direction of the association between height and wages, by wage level.

This approach uses a CUSUM-like methodology and requires us to construct an index, that we call the Economic News Index, from real-time data that shows how the economy is functioning.

In both studies, it is argued that in addition to broad regional trends, more remote and less famous destinations benefit most. We test this statement with a choice experiment at a small, remote, national park in northeast Germany. We find a per-person increase in willingness to pay of Euro4.70 which translates into an overall value increase of Euro3.8 million annually. Additionally, 9% of the visitors report they only know of the park because of the media coverage of its WH inscription and 15% report to have been convinced about the park's quality by its WH status.","[Wuepper, David] Tech Univ Munich, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Wuepper, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Agr Prod & Resource Econ, Alte Akad 14,Room 41, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",david.wuepper@tum.de,,"Wuepper, David/0000-0002-1344-6023",,,,,27,16,19,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The research presented here examines the short term effects of school being in-session on crime. We begin by confirming the findings of Jacob and Lefgren (2003) that teacher in-service days lead to a reduction in violent crime, consistent with a role for social interactions in school. We extend this result by showing that schools populated with more high crime risk students have larger decreases in crime on teacher in-service days but that this effect is reversed for schools with mostly low crime risk students. These results provide evidence that concentrating high crime risk students into particular schools increases local crime.","[Billings, Stephen B.] Univ Colorado, Dept Finance, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Phillips, David C.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Wilson Sheehan Lab Econ Opportun, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Notre Dame,"Billings, SB (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Finance, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",stephen.billings@colorado.edu; David.Phillips.184@nd.edu,,,,,,,18,5,8,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Yet trade policy and the EU's values-based foreign policy are often in tension. Scholarship on the social dimension of trade policy has emphasized the tension between values and the EU's commercial interests. Human rights and conditionality clauses have not been the focus of analysis, yet conditionality is one of the EU's most visible links between the trade agenda and its values-based foreign policy. Analyzing the EU's decision-making in negotiating human rights conditionality, this paper employs the EU-Singapore free trade agreement and its negotiation as an in-depth single case study. The tension between commercial interests and values results in decision-makers promoting incoherent interests. We argue that organizationally defined preferences and issue salience circumscribed the Parliament's impact on decision-making, resulting in concessions on human rights conditionality with Singapore.","[McKenzie, Lachlan] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Meissner, Katharina L.] Univ Vienna, Inst European Integrat Res EIF, Strohgasse 45-DG, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",University of Melbourne; University of Vienna,"McKenzie, L (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",lachlan.mckenzie@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,58,40,40,3,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using data on bilateral British lending, this article finds that such a relationship did exist, with British ex ante lending preceding merchandise exports by 2 years. A case study of New Zealand, which had an extraordinarily high share of Britain in its imports, reveals that the relationship was conditional upon the lending being allocated to social overhead capital.","[Varian, Brian D.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ Hist, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Varian, BD (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ Hist, London, England.",b.varian@lse.ac.uk,,"Varian, Brian/0000-0001-6369-591X",,,,,52,2,2,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

However, it is quite debatable whether transport infrastructure promotes economic development and urbanization, or economic development and urbanization create demand first which leads to investment in transport infrastructure. Each of the views has theoretical support. Therefore, apart from theory, empirical evidence is required to establish direction of causality, which bears serious policy implications. This study looks into different sub-sectors of transport infrastructure to find its long-run relationship and direction of causality with economic development and urbanization. It first finds the order of integration of the variables and then tries to find their causal relationship using cointegration and Granger causality test approach for India between 1990 and 2011. It uses Vector Auto-Regression and Vector Error Correction model to find short-run and long-run causality. Results showed existence of long-run relationship between transport infrastructure and economic development, and the direction of causality is from economic development to transport infrastructure in most of the cases, thus drawing support in favor of Wagner's law.

We show that on average, hospitals are less likely to admit publicly insured children than privately insured children who present at the ER and the gap grows during high flu weeks, when hospital beds are in high demand. This pattern is present even after controlling for detailed diagnostic categories and hospital fixed effects, but does not appear to have any effect on measurable health outcomes such as repeat ER visits and future hospitalizations. Hence, our results raise the possibility that instead of too few publicly insured children being admitted during high flu weeks, there are too many publicly and privately insured children being admitted most of the time.

The authors identify 400 large-scale investment events for firms in the restaurant, hotel, and recreation industries. During these events, firms increase their size substantially through building or acquiring assets. The authors determine that a combination of market and firm-specific factors lead to such events. Firms are more likely to engage in large investments when they have experienced strong recent sales growth and when they have lower existing leverage. These investments are more likely when the market is less volatile and when general economic conditions indicate strong consumer demand. Finally, the authors show that firms are more likely to rely on a combination of cash flow and debt financing to complete such investments, though firms experiencing higher sales growth are prone to use more equity financing.","[Dewally, Michael; Flaherty, Susan M.

Foreclosure rehabilitation projects in Dallas County produced an average 15% increase in neighborhood home prices that sold up to 30 months after the rehabilitated property sale and within 0.1 miles of the rehabilitated property. Foreclosure rehabilitation that involved significant exterior repairs was associated with the largest estimated effect sizes.

Previous research has demonstrated the positive impact of continued independent mobility on older adults' quality of life, through improvements in health, and community engagement. Restricted driver licensing policies have been mandated in several countries, with the goal of facilitating traffic safety and independent mobility for older drivers. Studies testing the effectiveness of these policies have produced mixed findings; a systematic examination of the impact of restricted driver licensing policies on reducing morbidity and mortality among senior drivers is warranted. Aims: The objectives of this study were to examine if restricted driver licenses are more effective than unrestricted driver licenses in (1) reducing crashes; (2) reducing traffic violations; and (3) facilitating continued independent mobility for older drivers. Methods: A systematic review was completed. A comprehensive electronic database search was conducted to identify all literature related to restricted driver license policies. A total of 3331 abstracts and 39 full text articles were reviewed. Seven papers met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated for quality and risk of bias assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). All seven studies reported motor vehicle collisions as the primary outcome, which included more than 2.1 million participants with or without a driving restriction. The search resulted in a heterogeneous set of included studies, meaning that meta-analysis was not appropriate. A narrative interpretation and discussion of the seven individual studies is presented. Results: Results demonstrated that restricted driver licensing may be effective at reducing crash risk for older drivers who have few health conditions, and those requiring few driving restrictions. It was noted that medically-restricted drivers incur fewer traffic violations than non-restricted drivers, or drivers with non-medical restrictions. Overall, evidence on both crash risk and traffic violations yielded mixed, yet promising results. Only one included study assessed the impact of restricted licenses on older adults' independent mobility, with results indicating a positive impact. A major limitation of this body of research is a failure to consider if, and how, restricted licenses facilitate older adults' independent mobility. Discussion: Restricted driver licensing has the potential to improve traffic safety among the general population and positively impact independent mobility of older Canadians. Efforts should be focused on providing education to health care professionals and motor vehicle licensing authorities on this topic, so that they may advise their clients appropriately, and avoid making premature driving cessation recommendations. Moving forward, more evidence is needed on the direct impact of restricted licensing on older adults' independent mobility and, more generally, quality of life. Conclusion: Supporting older drivers to safely remain independent and engaged in the community has positive impacts on all strata of society. Restricted licensing is one approach that has the potential to promote road safety for all and contribute to improved quality of life for older adults. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This conflicting pattern suggests that the gender absenteeism gap arises partly from factors unrelated to objective health. An overlooked explanation is that men and women might have different preferences for absenteeism due to different attitudes to, for example, risk. Using detailed administrative data on absenteeism, hospitalizations, and mortality, we evaluate the existence of gender-specific preferences for absenteeism and analyze whether these differences are socially determined. We find robust evidence of gender differences in absenteeism that cannot be explained by poorer objective health among women.

However, the factors that drive their usage and the amount of rebalancing they require are not known precisely. A knowledge of these factors would allow cities to design or modify their systems to increase usage while lowering rebalancing costs. We collect station-level occupancy data from two cities and transform station occupancy snapshot data into station level customer arrivals and departures to perform our analysis. Specifically, we postulate that arrivals and departures from stations can be separated into: (i) arrivals (and departures) due to consumers, and (ii) arrivals (and departures) due to the system operators for rebalancing the system. We then develop a mixed linear model to estimate the influence of bicycle infrastructure, socio-demographic characteristics and land-use characteristics on customer arrivals and departures. Further, we develop a binary logit model to identify rebalancing time periods and a regression model framework to estimate the amount of rebalancing. The research is conducted using bike sharing data from Barcelona and Seville, Spain. The resulting modeling framework provides a template for examining bicycle rebalancing in different contexts, and a tool to improve system management of bicycle sharing systems.","[Faghih-Imani, Ahmadreza] McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Appl Mech, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hampshire, Robert] Univ Michigan, Transportat Res Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marla, Lavanya] Univ Illinois, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Champaign, IL USA; [Eluru, Naveen] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",McGill University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Marla, L (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Champaign, IL USA.",seyed.faghihimani@mail.mcgill.ca; hamp@umich.edu; lavanyam@illinois.edu; naveen.eluru@ucf.edu,"Eluru, Naveen/B-2965-2012; Imani, Ahmadreza Faghih/AAF-5947-2019","Eluru, Naveen/0000-0003-1221-4113; Imani, Ahmadreza Faghih/0000-0001-9687-3188",,,,,46,157,169,10,208,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Agents vote in favor of or against the proposal and, if the number of agents in favor is greater than a certain threshold, the proposal is accepted. Conformist agents vote based on not only their opinion but also the votes of other agents. Independent agents consider only their own opinions. If all agents are conformists and vote simultaneously, there are undominated Nash equilibria in which the decision is different from that obtained if all agents vote for their opinions. Next, we provide the number of independent agents sufficient to obtain, in any equilibrium, the decision obtained when all agents vote for their opinions. This number depends on the total number of agents, the threshold, and the conformity measure. If agents vote sequentially, the voting behavior of conformist agents does not affect the decision.","[Moreno, Bernardo; Ramos Sosa, Maria del Pino] Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Ramos Sosa, Maria del Pino] Univ Malaga, PhD Program Econ & Business, Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Universidad de Malaga,"Moreno, B (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",bernardo@uma.es; mapi.ramos@uma.es,"Moreno, Bernardo/K-4602-2014; Ramos Sosa, Maria del Pino/HKM-4939-2023","Ramos Sosa, Maria del Pino/0000-0001-8704-2745","Junta de Andalucia [SEJ4941, SEJ-5980]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2014-57673-REDT, ECO2014-53767-P]",Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"We are grateful to anonymous referees and many colleagues (Salvador Barbera, Dolors Berga, Jose Luis Garcia Lapresta, Ricardo Martinez-Rico, Juan D.

The data contain six age cohorts (ages 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18, in 1980) with the average age of 31.7, in 2001, and with the female share of 54.7. We find that taller people earn higher earnings according to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. The OLS models show that 10 cm of extra height is associated with 13% higher earnings. We use Mendelian randomization, with the genetic score as an instrumental variable (IV) for height to account for potential confounders that are related to socioeconomic background, early life conditions and parental investments, which are otherwise very difficult to fully account for when using covariates in observational studies. The IV point estimate is much lower and not statistically significant, suggesting that the OLS estimation provides an upward biased estimate for the height premium. Our results show the potential value of using genetic information to gain new insights into the determinants of long-term labor market success. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The quantile of continuous order defines the production profile and the quantile-based individual technical efficiency relative to the quantile order. Quantile-based production frontier and efficiency are easy to derive and estimate and do not envelop all sample observation points. A quantile-based production frontier is more robust to extreme observations than DEA or FDH. Furthermore, quantile regression does not make a distribution assumption. It is more robust to the misspecification of error structure than DFA or SFA. In this paper, the quantile regression methods are extended to semiparametric smooth coefficient models. A local linear fitting scheme to estimate the smooth coefficients is proposed in the quantile framework. An empirical application of the model to the Taiwan manufacturing industry demonstrates the potential for the estimation of production technology and efficiency measures.","[Huang, Cliff J.] Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Fu, Tsu-Tan] Soochow Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lai, Hung-Pin] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Yang, Yung-Lieh] Ling Tung Univ, Taichung, Taiwan",Vanderbilt University; Soochow University; National Chung Cheng University,"Fu, TT (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",cliff.huang@vanderbilt.edu; tfu@scu.edu.tw; ecdhpl@ccu.edu.tw; lyang0811@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

City logistics are aimed at reducing the negative effects of distribution while supporting city development. Over the past two decades, many city logistics initiatives have failed in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. As many actors and stakeholders are involved in the complex organizational process of city logistics, it is important to investigate and understand the causes of these failures. This is the purpose of this article, which considers Italian experiences of city logistics. Evaluation of city logistics initiatives is necessary to ensure success in future implementation, to achieve sustainable urban freight transport development. Multi-agent systems (MAS) have been applied to evaluate different fields, such as supply chain, stock market, freight distribution, and traffic management. We conducted a review on city logistics projects in the main Italian cities with experience in these initiatives, in particular, in the case of failure. Our analysis considered the MAS, which utilizes multiple stakeholders' points of view with different effects to improve city logistics feasibility. The study considers Italian experiences in city logistics, but other countries may have different backgrounds and different situations. Therefore, predictions may be valid only for Italy and not in other contexts. Our perspective is quite original compared with the existing literature as it focuses on the failures of city logistics projects rather than best practices.","[Borghesi, Antonio] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Borghesi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Verona, Italy.",antonio.borghesi@univr.it,,,,,,,61,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,385,400,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_28,0.0,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400028,0

After reviewing some basic concepts, including the definition of a partially identified model and the identified set, we turn our attention to the construction of confidence regions in partially identified settings. In our discussion, we emphasize the importance of requiring confidence regions to be uniformly consistent in level over relevant classes of distributions. Due to space limitations, our survey is mainly limited to the class of partially identified models in which the identified set is characterized by a finite number of moment inequalities or the closely related class of partially identified models in which the identified set is a function of a such a set. The latter class of models most commonly arises when interest focuses on a subvector of a vector-valued parameter, whose values are limited by a finite number of moment inequalities. We then rapidly review some important parts of the broader literature on inference in partially identified models and conclude by providing some thoughts on fruitful directions for future research.","[Canay, Ivan A.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Shaikh, Azeem M.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Northwestern University; University of Chicago,"Canay, IA (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [DMS-1308260, SES-1227091, SES-1530661]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This paper was prepared for an invited talk at the Eleventh World Congress of the Econometric Society in Montreal, Canada.

The main requirements for statutory auditors are mandatory audit firm rotation and prohibition of non-audit services for the audit clients. In addition, the amending directive sets out a framework for the statutory audit and tries to improve the public oversight of the audit profession and the cooperation between authorities in the field of the statutory audit in the EU. In this context, the purpose of this study is to discuss the state of the art, the challenges, and the trends of the statutory audit in European Union. Because the primary objective of the reform of the statutory audit is to increase the quality of this important service for the orderly functioning of markets, this study contributes to the literature by identifying new changes that are necessary for the audit profession.","[Chersan, Ionela-Corina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Chersan, IC (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",corina.chersan.macovei@gmail.com,"Chersan, Ionela-Corina/AAT-8442-2020","Chersan, Ionela-Corina/0000-0001-7566-415X",,,,,10,0,0,2,7,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,481,491,,,,,,11,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300039,0

Even though organizations acknowledge the importance of HR policies and practices, we cannot help but wondering if organizations actually believe in the strategic role of HRM and create HR strategies integrated into organizational strategies in order to prove it. The current study is based on in-depth interviews with general managers / HR managers from 10 companies present in Romania - 5 multinational companies (MNC) and 5 local companies - in an attempt to identify similarities and differences between MNC and local companies from the point of view of their HR strategies. The research methodology is a qualitative type, relying on sociological inquiry, as method and semi-structured interview, as technique. Results show that all companies included in the study have HR policies and practices in place, but differences reside mainly in the industry specificity and in the importance awarded to HR strategies. Results can be used both by Romanian companies to improve their HR strategies by using 'best practices' from MNCs and also by foreign companies entering Romania in order to improve their knowledge concerning HR specificity in the country.","[Ciulu, Ruxandra; Arustei, Carmen Claudia] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania; [Apetrei, Andreea] Catholic Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Universidad Catolica de Valencia San Vicente Martir,"Ciulu, R (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",ruxandra.ciulu@uaic.ro; carmen.arustei@feaa.uaic.ro; andreea.apetrei@ucv.es,"Aruștei, Carmen Claudia/B-5499-2015; Ciulu, Ruxandra/AAG-2871-2021",,,,,,41,0,0,0,3,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,286,306,,,,,,21,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300022,0

Drawing on personal interviews, documentary sources, and historiographical research, this paper attempts to reveal the institutional set-up that allowed economics to gradually transform itself from << an endeavour plagued by bourgeois ideology >> to a unidimensional preoccupation with planning, subordinated to strict political values. Additional insight is revealed by following the career of one outstanding economist who began his work at the very outset of communism: Emilian Dobrescu, the author of the first Romanian econometric models and admittedly << the most capable linear planner >> of the communist regime.","[Cojanu, Valentin] Acad Studii Econ Bucuresti, Piata Romana 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Cojanu, V (通讯作者)，Acad Studii Econ Bucuresti, Piata Romana 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",,"Cojanu, Valentin/B-9414-2011","Cojanu, Valentin/0000-0002-2933-2522",,,,,35,0,0,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The attempts to define the foreign companies, as well as the rights conferred upon them, culminated with the appearance of two theories for the establishment of the nationality, which refer to the theory of the incorporation and to the theory of the head office. Therefore, starting from this double determination, there are two main conceptions within the Community, based on which lex societatis is established. A first theory applied by the member states of the European Union is the incorporation theory, based on which a company is established and operates according to the law of the state on whose territory it has declared its statutory offices, the place where it does business or the place where the decision-making bodies are locate being irrelevant. This theory has been adopted in the Community, among others, by Great Britain, the Netherlands and Ireland (Drury, 1999, pp. 354-358). According to the second theory, the real seat theory, head office theory or siege reel, and respectively sitztheorie in the German law - promoted in its pure form by Germany, the law applicable to a trading company is the law of the state on whose territory the central management bodies of that company are located. Therefore, a state applying the real seat theory shall recognize a trading company as being subject of its own legal system if that company has its central management bodies in its territory, independent of the state where it has declared the statutory office. As we shall see further, the real seat theory is a form of excessive limitation of the freedom to establish trading companies within the internal market (Menjucq, 2001, pp. 19-26).","[Cojocaru, Violeta] State Univ Moldova, Kishinev, Moldova",Moldova State University,"Cojocaru, V (通讯作者)，State Univ Moldova, Kishinev, Moldova.",violetacojocaru@yahoo.fr,"Cojocaru, Cojocaru Violeta/JFB-2182-2023",,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,215,228,,,,,,14,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300016,0

Calculations of economic distance were based on the level of GDP, whereas in spatial regression data of previously calculated mobility indices were used. Because of the availability of homogeneous, highly aggregated sectoral data only for the period 1994-2011, the analyses were performed for 20 selected OECD countries. The use of spatial error model (SEM) and spatial lag model (SLM) improved explanatory abilities of the analysis and revealed that the higher level of interindustry wage mobility is accompanied by increased movement of labor force across sectors.","[Flisikowski, Karol] Gdansk Univ Technol, Dept Stat, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Flisikowski, K (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Dept Stat, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",karflisi@pg.gda.pl,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,76,83,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000008,0

As a result of financial and political uncertainty, cash is still highly demanded as a means of payment, as well as a store of value, although it only plays a minor role regarding transactions involving larger payment amounts. However, external effects, such as the cohort effect, still need to be reviewed. It is not clear whether the younger generations will use cash as frequently as the older generations. A substantial argument for abolishing cash seems to be its high costs, but there is no evidence that other payment options are significantly less expensive. Moreover, the high circulation of higher banknotes in other countries creates doubts that an issuance stop of the 500 (sic) banknote will lead to a significant decline in illegal activities. In addition, cashless payment options are also used for tax evasion or the financing of terrorism. Cash allows for data protection and operates as a back-up solution if cashless systems fail. Lastly, it is of huge importance to analyse the advantages of cash as performed in this chapter before making imprudent assumptions about the declining influence of cash.","[Gladisch, Erwin] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Gladisch, E (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany.",erwin.gladisch@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0921-8580,2197-1889,978-3-319-59846-8; 978-3-319-59845-1,FINAN MON P,,,2017,44.0,,,,,,133,151,,10.1007/978-3-319-59846-8_9,0.0,,,19,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL1NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447914500009,0

However, hedging this risk is challenging because of a lack of financial derivatives on China's housing assets. We suggest that the short sale of futures contracts for construction raw materials, i.e., iron ore or/and steel, can act as useful tools to hedge the systematic risk of China's new home price. We first present evidence that there is a strong and stable correlation between changes in China's housing prices and global steel/iron ore prices. Using a hedging strategy model, we then show that, during the sample period between 2009 and 2015, 20.6% of the total unpredicted variance in Chinese housing prices can be hedged by shorting rebar and iron ore futures. We further examine this strategy with an event study based on the announcement of the home-purchase restriction policy in April, 2010. The cumulative abnormal returns show that both steel and iron ore prices reacted significantly to this negative shock, and therefore the proposed strategy could substantially help investors offset losses in the housing market.

Daily data for oil spot prices are from May 1987 till January 2015. The contribution of the study is in a comparison of oil spot prices' development and impacts of the Euro sovereign debt crises, recent global financial crises, and also the historical affairs as the military conflict in the Persian Gulf in 1990, or particular incidents after the start of the new millennium. The estimation method for short-run forecasting is the volatility model GARCH (1,1). While it has been proven that there was higher volatility during the global financial crisis within American WTI oil prices, higher errors were examined within European Brent oil prices. There was no higher volatility due to the euro crisis in the last 4 years. Nonetheless, both investigated oil prices were affected by highest volatility during military conflict in 1990 in our estimated period. It was clearly concluded that military conflicts can affect oil prices in a much higher way than recent financial crises.","[Heryan, Tomas] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Heryán, T (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Opava, Czech Republic.",heryan@opf.slu.cz,"Heryan, Tomas/J-6424-2015","Heryan, Tomas/0000-0003-2027-7149",Silesian University in Opava [IGS/4/2015],Silesian University in Opava,This paper is supported by Silesian University in Opava within the project IGS/4/2015 Vliv dluhove krize na vyvoj ceny ropy a zemniho plynu.,,10,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,285,296,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_22,0.0,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400022,0

Surprisingly, however, at a time when its competitors are increasing their use of this policy tool, state-backed export credit has become the subject of a hotly contested political battle in the US. As a result of opposition from the Tea Party, the US Export-Import Bank was forced to halt its lending operations for five months in 2015 and subsequently limited to financing only the smallest transactions. In this article, I show that the disruption of export credit is undermining the competitiveness of key US industrial sectors and encouraging the movement of advanced, high-value-added manufacturing overseas. The case of export credit therefore presents an important puzzle: Why is the US moving in the opposite direction of other states and taking steps that undermine its economic interests? I argue that the internal US attack on export credit is fueled by the prevailing market fundamentalist ideology that has obscured the role of an active state in fostering the US's economic success. This article demonstrates how the rise of a powerful anti-state movement is hindering the ability of the US to conduct effective industrial policy and maintain its economic primacy in the face of growing global competitive pressures.","[Hopewell, Kristen] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Hopewell, K (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",kristen.hopewell@ed.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N017390/1]; ESRC [ES/N017390/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N017390/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/N017390/1].,,71,17,19,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Given the difficulty these ends-oriented approaches face when explaining institutional inefficiencies and pathologies, this article develops an alternate perspective based on anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss's concept of bricolage. Design by bricolage starts from the premise that actors are means-focused, seeking to recombine and redeploy tools from their existing environment. Designers constantly experiment, adapting institutional elements from cognate fields, with the aim of creating novel institutional arrangements. The outcomes of international cooperation are a function of the design process, more than the initial problem type. To illustrate the usefulness of this perspective, the paper examines the evolution of the International Financial Architecture, with a focus on the evolution of the international securities regime. A design by bricolage perspective is well positioned to make sense of enduring International Relations puzzles such as why second-best solutions often persist yet later succeed, and, importantly, re-opens the conversation on agency in international institutional design that has been downplayed by conventional, structural approaches. The design of international institutional elements is frequently experimental where form trumps function.","[Kalyanpur, Nikhil; Newman, Abraham] Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Kalyanpur, N (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,91,16,17,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Five middle-range hypotheses in organizational setting derived from this conceptualization were supported by Chinese and Japanese sample.

So, electric bicycle virtual assembly and performance simulation method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a 3D-part database is established. Secondly, virtual assembly of the electric bicycle is done based on the database, and the performance of the new design is analyzed. By this way, it can detect assembly errors and design defects.

We argue that the EU suffers from a specific type of disaggregation in its foreign and security policy. While the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy has increased its capacities over time, the EU still lacks the power to prevent Member States from pursuing their own independent policies. In the face of the Ukraine crisis, for instance, the EU marshaled a surprisingly strong sanctions regime, but could not prevent Member States from pursuing divergent pro-Russia policies, such as signing new energy deals or granting port access for Russian naval forces. As EU foreign and security powers grow, foreign powers face increasing incentives to cultivate Trojan horses among the EU Member States.","[Orenstein, Mitchell A.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kelemen, R.

The studies assume that the level of bankruptcy threat depends not only on the assessment of the financial condition of a given company, but it may also change depending on the economic situation in a given country or industry. The purpose of the work is to compare the predictive accuracy of selected bankruptcy prediction models built on the basis of financial data derived from various years, with the predictive accuracy of a corresponding aggregate model consisting of models built on the basis of data referring to individual years. The analysis uses the financial data of companies operating in the industrial processing sector in Poland in the years 2005-2008. The research covered selected data classification methods such as: a classification tree, k-nearest neighbours algorithm, support vector machine, a neural network, random forests, bagging, boosting, naive Bayes, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis.

Thus, special needs, targeted assistance in emergencies, but also security related issues like the separation of rivaling groups can be facilitated.

Discussion: Development of administrative and territorial entities of various countries depends on positions of various institutional groups as to the possibilities provided by external and internal environment. With a certain degree of convention, it is possible to suppose that expectations are realized in actions of various groups. The performed analysis is based on the idea that the most significant groups of the Russian society at the regional level are public authorities and large business. They accumulate the two most important resources-administrative power and capital. Small business is represented in this chapter as a background. Voronezh Oblast is a specific object of the research, represented in the country. However, most of position that reflect the possibilities of socio-economic development of the region are not specific and could be viewed as common for most of Russian regions. Results: This chapter analyzes positions of representatives of public authorities and business as to possibilities of region's development. The received results allow stating that all groups of experts think that the strongest and most probable possibility is increase of financing of defense and military complex enterprises. Significant possibilities are the following: expansion of scales of financing of region's economy development, performed by private investors; growth of demand for products of enterprises of agro-industrial complex of the region in the world market; realization of the federal programs of development of import substitution perspective directions; federal authorities' making decisions on creation of territories with subsidized conditions of economic activities. As for expansion of business's participation in solving social problems, the positions are different. The least significant and least probable possibilities are the following: growth of demand for educational services of regional universities; using the existing recreational resource and converting the income of shadow economy into open financial resources.","[Risin, Igor E.; Treshchevsky, Yuri I.; Tabachnikova, Maria B.; Franovskaya, Galina N.] Voronezh State Univ, Voronezh, Russia",Voronezh State University,"Treshchevsky, YI (通讯作者)，Voronezh State Univ, Voronezh, Russia.",risin@mail.ru; utreshevski@yandex.ru; gmasha3@gmail.com; fgnvrn@yandex.ru,"Risin, Igor/AAF-2644-2019; Treshchevsky, Yuri/N-8128-2016","Treshchevsky, Yuri/0000-0002-0039-5060",,,,,8,4,4,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-60696-5; 978-3-319-60695-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,55,62,,10.1007/978-3-319-60696-5_8,0.0,,,8,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ5OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426114200008,0

Since from a theoretical perspective such association regarding expenditures for passive labour market policies may be doubtful, we additionally tested some hypothesis. We conclude, that countries with higher GDP per capita have higher expenditures for passive labour market policies.

In developed countries, the offer of credit is generally made as if such a duty of care were recognized: this paper argues, originally, that it is the use of the group liability system in microfinance that explains why this is often not the case in developing countries. The paper argues for two criteria to be met to establish a duty of care. and concludes that microfinance meets these. and specifies how microflnance institutions might meet it. The importance for policymakers and regulators is that much more must be done to flesh out what is required by way of client protection for microfinance lenders to fulfill their moral duty of care.","[Sherratt, Lesley] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Sherratt, L (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, London, England.",ls@riversdale.demon.co.uk,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,0,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

For employees and employers, the assessment basis corresponds to employee's gross salary, for self-employed this basis is determined by the income, for the voluntarily insured person and for state insured persons the basis of assessment is defined by the average gross salary in the national economy.

To achieve this goal, two analyses based on 25 real-world datasets are carried out. In the first one, groups of economic and non-economic datasets are compared from the point of view of their internal characteristics based on HCA results; in the second one, homogenous groups of datasets are recognized and they are further examined by internal characteristics and graphical outputs. For each group of datasets, the most appropriate similarity measures are identified. The results show substantial differences between economic and non-economic datasets, primarily in terms of the within-cluster variability decrease. We were also successful in classification of the examined datasets into easily interpretable groups, for which suitable similarity measures were identified.","[Sulc, Zdenek; Cibulkova, Jana; Prochazka, Jiri; Matejka, Martin] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Sulc, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",zdenek.sulc@vse.cz; cibj00@vse.cz; jiri.prochazka@vse.cz; martin.matejka@vse.cz,"Sulc, Zdenek/A-2681-2019",,"University of Economics, Prague [IGA F4/41/2016]","University of Economics, Prague","This work was supported by the University of Economics, Prague under Grant IGA F4/41/2016.",,15,0,0,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",2453-9902,,978-83-7695-693-0,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2017,,,,,,,461,471,,10.15611/amse.2017.20.38,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BP1SD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540714200038,0

Police and judges deliberately violate existing legal provisions to prevent women from divorcing or filing charges against their husbands in cases of domestic violence. While the law does not recognize religious marriages in Tajikistan, judges often rule to protect women's living space after the dissolution of such unions. Drawing on rich interview and archival data, this behavior is explained by showing that judicial and police behavior reflects their biases, which in turn are a reflection of majoritarian norms in these countries. Since current laws are derived from Soviet codes, which were never internalized by the population, police and judges bend them to fit their understanding of social justice.","[Wilson, Sophia] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Polit Sci, Edwardsville, IL 62025 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Wilson, S (通讯作者)，Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Dept Polit Sci, Edwardsville, IL 62025 USA.",sowilso@siue.edu,,,International Research and Exchange Board (IREX); National Endowment for the Humanities; United States Department of State; IREX Scholar Support Fund; University of Washington; Jerome Hall Postdoctoral Fellowship from Indiana University Maurer School of Law,International Research and Exchange Board (IREX); National Endowment for the Humanities; United States Department of State; IREX Scholar Support Fund; University of Washington(University of Washington); Jerome Hall Postdoctoral Fellowship from Indiana University Maurer School of Law,"Research for this article was supported in part by the following grants: the International Research and Exchange Board (IREX) with funds provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities; the United States Department of State, which administers the Title VIII Program and the IREX Scholar Support Fund; the University of Washington Dissertation Write-Up Fellowship; and the Jerome Hall Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Indiana University Maurer School of Law.",,39,2,3,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Broad implementation of information and communication technologies and cyber-physical systems in all spheres should be ensured by the availability of appropriate competencies among graduates of higher educational institutions. At the same time, revolutionary changes in the production sphere and the economy necessitate a radical modernization of the structure and content of processes in education itself The result of such innovations should be quite predictable, and the achievement of educational goals - manageable. Formalization of the management of processes in the educational sphere within the framework of the systemic and cybernetic approaches is carried out on the basis of mathematical models. The content of this publication is devoted to modeling and forecasting of managed learning processes, as well as ensuring the effective formation of professional skills in the context of widespread introduction of ICT tools and integration of students into the information and educational environments of the higher educational institutions.

We show that tariff reduction, due to trade liberalisation, has different effects on firms' profit. Input tariff reduction generates a cost-saving effect which benefits firms whilst output tariff reduction results in a competition effect which may hurt domestic firms. Given the fair wage argument, trade liberalisation may affect wages across firms due to the joint effects on firm profit. Using detailed Chinese manufacturing firm data from 1998 to 2007, we conduct empirical tests to investigate how trade liberalisation affects Chinese firm wages. In particular, we measure the joint effects of input and output tariff reduction by the applying the new measurement on the effective rate of protection. Furthermore, we also control for the effect of the iterated use of inputs with an index of a firm's position on value chain. We found that from 1998 to 2007, Chinese manufacturing firms paid higher wages due to higher tariff protection when firms' status on value chain was controlled.

SES aims to organize the airspace uniformly, with air traffic control areas based on operational efficiency rather than national borders. One of the main aspects of SES is performance evaluation in four areas namely cost efficiency, capacity, safety and environment. This paper focuses on the latter using a two-round Delphi approach. The sample consists of thirty experts from airlines, Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), Civil Aviation Authorities, Individual experts/consultant/academics, Governmental institutions, EUROCONTROL and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The Delphi analysis is also supported qualitatively by five interviews with senior experts from the European Commission, EUROCONTROL and IATA. Among others, delays in implementation and the slow progress of the policy scheme are highlighted. Policy recommendations are also provided in the paper to effectively deal with the identified problems.","[Efthymiou, Marina] Dublin City Univ, Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Papatheodorou, Andreas] Univ Aegean, Dept Business Adm, 8 Michalon St, Chios 82132, Greece",Dublin City University; University of Aegean,"Efthymiou, M (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Business Sch, Dublin 9, Ireland.",marina.efthymiou@dcu.ie,"wang, toby/AFU-6392-2022; Papatheodorou, Andreas/T-8784-2019; Efthymiou, Marina/Q-6891-2019","Efthymiou, Marina/0000-0001-8611-5973; Papatheodorou, Andreas/0000-0001-9484-7517",,,,,37,12,12,0,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Comprehensive analysis of port competitiveness is of great significance for effectively guiding the flow of such resources. Conventional models mainly consider statistical indices for port operation, while neglecting the real operational status of these ports and their position in the changing global maritime transport network. To fill this gap in existing research, we designed a comprehensive evaluation CCPE model measuring port competitiveness by 18 factors related to conditions, capacity, potential, and efficiency using big data related to the geographical environment, cargo vessels trajectories, port infrastructure, and regional socioeconomics. This model was then used to evaluate the competitiveness of 99 ports in 51 countries along the Maritime Silk Road, with several important results. First, a port's status in the global maritime transport network was the most influential of all competitiveness indices. Second, competitive ports were mainly concentrated in the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Hormuz Strait, with Singapore, Marsaxlokk, and Algeciras ranking as the top three. The least competitive ports were mainly concentrated in East Africa, with Rangoon, Berbera, Lamu, Songkhla, Mtwara, and Sittwe ranking lowest. Third, port competitiveness was clearly polarized in that the most competitive ports stood far above all others due to significant gaps in their network status index.","[Peng, Peng; Lu, Feng; Cheng, Shifen] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Peng, Peng; Yang, Yu; Lu, Feng; Cheng, Shifen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Lu, Feng] Fujian Collaborat Innovat Ctr Big Data Applicat G, Fuzhou 350003, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Lu, Feng] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Mou, Naixia; Yang, Ren] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Shandong University of Science & Technology","Lu, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Yang, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yangyu@igsnrr.ac.cn; luf@lreis.ac.cn,"Peng, Peng/T-5845-2019; MOU, Naixia/AAA-9625-2022; Cheng, Shifen/GPT-3652-2022; yang, yu/D-6527-2013; yuhao, luo/HGC-3140-2022; Cheng, Shifen/GNW-6056-2022","MOU, Naixia/0000-0003-1700-5943; Cheng, Shifen/0000-0002-9553-8318; Cheng, Shifen/0000-0002-9553-8318; Yang, Yu/0000-0001-9283-0068; Peng, Peng/0000-0003-2838-2111","Key Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [ZDRW-ZS-2016-6-3]; Natural Science Foundation of China [41871118]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the CAS [XDA20040400]; Institute of Geographic Science and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences [2016RC202]","Key Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the CAS; Institute of Geographic Science and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This research is supported by grant from the Key Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (ZDRW-ZS-2016-6-3), Natural Science Foundation of China (41871118), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the CAS (XDA20040400).

The difference-in-differences method was applied to investigate the short-term impact of the MOR's reform on rail exports from China and its underlying mechanisms. The findings suggested that within a short period after the reform, Chinese rail export declined by 10.94%. Moreover, we found that the reform caused marked decreases in the number of export firms and the price of export goods by rail. The near-monopolistic market structure of the Chinese rail transport industry would not change in the short term, and the overhaul of the governance structure of the MOR would induce noticeable trade effects. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the influence of the MOR's reform followed on from the monopolistic nature of the industry and the extra market transaction costs associated with stringent government-pricing regulations. Accordingly, the Chinese rail transport sector should be further reformed by promoting its marketization and relaxing government-pricing regulations.","[Wang, Cong; Yang, Hangjun; Yuan, Hang] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 10 Huixindong St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Yang, H (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 10 Huixindong St, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",hangjunyang@uibe.edu.cn,"wang, cong/ABI-3775-2020","wang, cong/0000-0002-3103-1884","National Nature Science Foundation of China [71433002, 71671043]",National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank the three anonymous reviewers and the editor (John Rose) for helpful comments on earlier versions of the paper.

The naturally occurring or inherited tourism resources within the territory, together with productive resources and the relationships between them, are the determining elements of the capacity of the economy to grow. The analysis of this new conceptual framework implies the need to assess the productive factors on the one hand, and the tourism capital (TC) on the other, the latter being measured by some kind of indicator that is not affected by the productive factors. In this study, a TC index is developed for the first time in the literature. It is calculated for the Spanish provinces in 2014, by using synthetic indicators constructed from a weighted average of the initially proposed indicators, where the weight of each of these is obtained through a confirmatory factor analysis. The TC index may allow future empirical studies to analyze how tourism affects economic growth, in relation to other productive factors.","[Antonio Camunez, Jose; Pablo-Romero, Maria P.; Sanchez-Rivas, Javier] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Pablo-Romero, Maria P.] Univ Autonoma Chile, Providencia, Chile",University of Sevilla; Universidad Autonoma de Chile,"Pablo-Romero, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Anal Econ & Econ Polit, Ramon y Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain.;Pablo-Romero, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Chile, Dept Invest & Postgrad, Pedro de Valdivia 425, Santiago, Chile.",mpablorom@us.es,"Pablo-Romero, Maria del P./D-8391-2013","Pablo-Romero, Maria del P./0000-0001-9546-0840",,,,,43,2,2,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Design optimizes function, value, and appearance. Although the value and impacts of product design resist quantification, there is evidence that increased attention to and support for design-oriented manufacturing will stimulate growth and generate wealth. This evidence, drawn from patent, industry, and occupational data, surveys, case studies, and anecdotal information from across the United States and other countries, demonstrates that aesthetics, values, and experiences embodied in the designs of products create sustainable market advantages. While many manufacturers recognize the value of design, the dearth of educational programs in industrial design, insufficient support for design-based innovation, and lack of recognition of design in industrial policies and strategies impede many companies, in particular, small and midsized manufacturers from taking greater advantage of design.","[Rosenfeld, Stuart A.] Southern Growth Policies Board, Durham, NC USA; [Rosenfeld, Stuart A.] Southern Technol Council, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA",,"Rosenfeld, SA (通讯作者)，113 Essex Dr, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.",stu.rosenfeld@gmail.com,,,,,,,53,5,6,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Using the R statistical language instead, we found that our estimates are similar to those of CS using data for single-member households and married couples without children, but differ for households with one child. (All replicated estimation tables in CS, as well as our full implementation, are available as supplementary material in the online version of this paper.) However, using a more flexible copula model, a total of 168 possible specifications for each type of household and their resulting gasoline own-price elasticities are also estimated.

Observers blamed miners for neglecting safety in their haste to load coal, for which they were paid on piece. Using a panel of about 500 coal mines, the elasticity of fatalities with respect to speed or intensity of work is estimated to be about one-half, implying a marginal cost of a statistical life to miners of about $400 thousand in 1921 dollars. This likely exceeded their value of a statistical life, so preventing accidents was expensive for miners.

Local authorities also recognize IPS as the new solution to reduce cruising-for-parking in urban areas. While many cities are considering to invest in the system, the potential of IPS in reducing cruising is often unknown. This makes it very difficult to assess the investment and evaluate the performance of IPS. This paper provides a generalized methodology to evaluate the potential cruising time savings generated by using IPS. Based on probability theory and a macroscopic parking model, the cruising conditions with and without IPS are emulated. By comparing these two sets of conditions, the total cruising time savings can then be estimated. The model requires very few data inputs; the main inputs being the parking occupancy and the number of cruising vehicles over time. To illustrate the methodology, an application example based on an area within the city of Zurich, Switzerland, is provided. It is shown that, in this small downtown area (0.28 km(2)), IPS can save up to 15.6 h of cruising time (17%) in a typical working day. The authors hope that this study can be used to establish a systematic tool for IPS evaluation. The use of such a tool could further support practitioners' decisions on parking management.","[Cao, Jin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Transport Planning & Syst, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Menendez, Monica] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Div Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Menendez, Monica] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, New York, NY 10003 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; New York University Abu Dhabi; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Menendez, M (通讯作者)，New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Div Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",monica.menendez@nyu.edu,,"Menendez, Monica/0000-0001-5701-0523",ETH Research Grant MacroPark [ETH-40 14-1],ETH Research Grant MacroPark,This work was partially supported by ETH Research Grant MacroPark ETH-40 14-1.,,39,25,26,0,24,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

(J Econ Dyn Control 32:101-136, 2008) as a prototype agent-based model that allows reproducing the main stylized facts of financial returns. The model does so by combining fundamental news driven by Brownian motion with a minimalistic mechanism for generating boundedly rational sentiment dynamics. Since we can approximate the herding component among an ensemble of agents in the aggregate by a Langevin equation, we can either simulate the model in full at the micro level, or via an approximate aggregate law of motion. In the simplest version of our model, only three parameters need to be estimated. We explore the performance of a simulated method of moments (SMM) approach for the estimation of this model. As it turns out, sensible parameter estimates can only be obtained if one first provides a rough mapping of the objective function via an extensive grid search. Due to the high correlations of the estimated parameters, uninformed choices will often lead to a convergence to any one of a large number of local minima. We also find that the efficiency of SMM is relatively insensitive to the size of the simulated sample over a relatively large range of sample sizes and the SMM estimates converge to their GMM counterparts only for large sample sizes. We believe that this feature is due to the limited range of moments available in univariate asset pricing models, and that the sensitivity of the present model to the specification of the SMM estimator could carry over to many related agent-based models of financial markets as well as to similar diffusion processes in mathematical finance.","[Chen, Zhenxi] South China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Commerce, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Jaume 1, Computat Econ, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",South China University of Technology; University of Kiel; Universitat Jaume I,"Lux, T (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany.;Lux, T (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Computat Econ, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",lux@economics.uni-kiel.de,,"chen, zhenxi/0000-0001-9743-7994",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [612955],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under Grant Agreement No. 612955.

While transit land use integration and disintegration has received much research interest, conclusions remain mixed. This paper aims to clarify this area, using the large city of Beijing, China, as a case study. It evaluates whether and how Beijing's land and metro developments have disintegrated according to the basic principles of the Alonso-Muth-Mills model. A before-and-after approach is applied during a period of rapid transit development: 2008-2015. The results show that metro development, generally, was not clearly integrated with land use. Although newly transferred land parcels were geographically concentrated around metro stations, land use types and the degree of land intensification were unrelated to metro development; rather, the road system had a greater influence on these aspects. In addition, metro development led to more fragmented land use in the core areas (< 1.5 km) of metro stations than in the fringe areas (1.5-3 km away). This situation was mainly caused by institutional barriers to land-metro integration, such as revenue-oriented land development, the remaining centrally planned system of infrastructure investment, improper urban planning, and the fragmentation of development management that has occurred following China's political decentralization and marketization. Improving the integration of transit and land development will be difficult unless further reforms and institutional capacity-building are achieved.","[Zhao, Pengjun; Yang, Hanzi; Kong, Lu; Liu, Yunshu; Liu, Di] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Room 3267,Yifu 2 Bldg,5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hanzi] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Dept Architecture, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Peking University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Zhao, PJ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Room 3267,Yifu 2 Bldg,5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",pengjun.zhao@pku.edu.cn,"Zhao, Peng/HDO-7507-2022",,NSFC [41571147],NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is funded by the NSFC project No. 41571147.,,59,23,27,7,116,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We explain this surprising result and show that for technical reasons, disproportions between sectors can prevent the system from reproducing itself. But, in Marx's reproduction schemes, such a crisis is not only due to purely technical factors and one must wonder what role is played by the relative price in the reproduction of the system. The answer is given by comparing two models having a similar structure but quite different rules for the determination of the relative price. In Marx's model, the price is given by the labour values and thus, it is exogenously fixed. We contrast Marx's analysis with an endogenous price model in which the price depends on the conditions of the accumulation of capital. The Appendices point out the complete accordance of Engels' corrections with Marx's model and Marx's unfruitful quest for a balanced growth path as a tool for the analysis of crises.","[Benetti, Carlo; Rebeyrol, Antoine] Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX, Nanterre, France; [Beraud, Alain] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Cergy Pontoise, France; [Klimovsky, Edith] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",CY Cergy Paris Universite; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"Béraud, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, Cergy Pontoise, France.",beraud@u-cergy.fr,"Béraud, Alain/AAH-5712-2021; Beraud, Alain/IQT-1087-2023; Béraud, Alain/AAH-8042-2020","Beraud, Alain/0009-0008-8822-6819;",,,,,26,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Since Ramadan rotates on solar calendars, we pool demographic and health survey data from numerous developing countries to increase the number of birth years and fairly control for potential seasonal effects. Our results suggest that Ramadan-induced nutritional stress during early- and mid-gestation may negatively affect the height of 3 and 4 years old Muslim male children. The effect tends to be stronger in West Africa and Central Asia. It also tends to be stronger in more religious countries. We do not detect consistent negative effects on height in female children.

Using data on the issue-specific positions of all heads of state and government at the Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon conferences, I identify a common policy space with latent preferences and outcomes on two integration dimensions, the design of governance and the pooling of policy competences. The findings show that partisan ideology characterizes leaders' preferences for the pooling of policy competences, which helps to find compromise among the leaders from large/rich and small/poor countries on governance design. Due to their credible referendum threat, leaders from smaller countries dominate interstate bargains in the post-Maastricht era. This implies institutional choices for a separation of powers with a bicameral legislature, which promotes functionalist responsibility at the expense of responsiveness to the concerns of the voters.","[Koenig, Thomas] Univ Mannheim, A5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"König, T (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, A5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",koenig@uni-mannheim.de,"Koenig, Thomas/AGG-0521-2022","Koenig, Thomas/0000-0002-1797-6662",German Research Foundation (DFG) in support of the collaborative research centre 'The Political Economy of Reforms' [SFB 884],German Research Foundation (DFG) in support of the collaborative research centre 'The Political Economy of Reforms'(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I thank Stephanie Daimer, Daniel Finke, Elena Frech, David Hilpert, Xiao Lu, Brooke Luetgert and Moritz Marbach for their support.

By means of a pseudo-real-time forecasting exercise, we show that our model outperforms univariate benchmarks, and it does comparably well with predictions of market operators.

The main assumption is that a group will choose not to participate when their participation costs exceed the expected benefits. This leads to a more biased participation pattern. We expect this to hold when the proposal discussed in a consultation is more complex, whereas the opposite is the case if the proposal is more salient. Furthermore, we expect there to be an interaction effect between complexity and salience.

It argues that this evidence presents a strong case for the use of a market mechanism to control access and more specifically for the use of periodic auctions to allocate limited term slot leases. It then shows that the existing body of knowledge and practical experience with the use of combinatorial auctions lead naturally to highly viable auction designs for the airport slot context.

We further develop a Method of Successive Average (MSA)-based sequential optimization algorithm for large-scale evacuation problems. Both the proposed model and the solution algorithm are tested and validated through a set of numerical tests on a small network, and a detailed case study on the Lower Manhattan network. The results of the paper can provide insight on modeling flow interactions of different transportation modes and useful guidance on developing evacuation strategies to reduce the system evacuation time and losses from disasters.","[Yang, Xia] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 110 Eighth St,Room JEC 5107, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Ban, Xuegang (Jeff)] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Room 121G,More Hall, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ban, Xuegang (Jeff)] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, 1550 Haigang Ave, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Mitchell, John] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Math Sci, 110 Eighth St,Room Amos Eaton 325, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Shanghai Maritime University; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Ban, XG (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Room 121G,More Hall, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",banx@uw.edu,"Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023",,National Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-1055555]; US Department of Transportation (USDOT); Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Transportation (USDOT); Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning,"The authors are grateful to the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments to the earlier versions of the paper.

The model reveals significant potential to improve rental company profitability by improving the strategic timing of equipment replacement. The gains from the optimal replacement strategy come from exploiting seasonal variation in rental demand and the timing of the business cycle due to their effects on rental revenues and the cost of replacement. For some machines we find the optimal replacement strategy is procyclical, but for others we find that a countercyclical replacement strategy - where replacements are concentrated in slow periods of the business cycle - can significantly increase firm profits.","[Rust, John] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [McClelland, John] Amer Rental Assoc, Washington, DC USA",Georgetown University,"Rust, J (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",John.McClelland@ararental.org; jr1393@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,11,0,1,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We use data drawn from government records from 1929 to 1939 which report the mean heights of boys and girls in school at each age (6-18) for each of Japan's 47 prefectures. We focus on two key questions: (1) how important was the disease environment in infancy in shaping the growth pattern of children? and (2) were shocks to child health more salient in the first thousand days of life, often held as a critical window to prevent stunting, or at later ages? We quantify the characteristics of the growth pattern of birth cohorts using the SITAR growth model and then relate the predicted SITAR parameters to infant mortality in the year of birth. In addition, we test for instantaneous effects of morbidity, proxied by infant mortality, on growth at ages 6-11. We find that infant mortality in early life did not have a strong influence on the growth pattern of children, but there were statistically significant and economically meaningful instantaneous effects of infant mortality on child height at ages 6-11 for both boys and girls. This suggests that interventions outside of the thousand-day critical window can be effective and that the secular increase in height in interwar Japan was more strongly influenced by cumulative responses to the health environment across child development rather than simply improvements in early life health.","[Schneider, Eric B.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Econ Hist Dept, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ogasawara, Kota] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Inage Ku, 1-33 Yayoi Cho, Chiba 2638522, Japan",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Chiba University,"Schneider, EB (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Econ Hist Dept, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",e.b.schneider@lse.ac.uk,,"Schneider, Eric/0000-0001-7682-0126","ESRC [ES/L010267/2]; Tokyo Institute of Technology; JSPS KAKENHI [16K17153]; ESRC [ES/L010267/1, ES/L010267/2] Funding Source: UKRI; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K17153] Funding Source: KAKEN","ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Tokyo Institute of Technology; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors wish to thank Jean-Pascal Bassino, Tim Cole and Yukitoshi Matsushita, participants at the CEPR-NYUAD Economic History Workshop 2017, Fifth CEPR Economic History Symposium London, World Congress of Cliometrics Strasbourg, European Historical Economics Society Congress Tuebingen, Stunting: Past, Present and Future Conference London and Class, Gender and Childhood in Economic Development Conference Oxford and seminar participants at Hitotsubashi University and the University of Barcelona for helpful comments on the paper.

RU maximizes the sum of proportional gains, or, equivalently, minimizes the sum of proportional losses. RU is scale invariant and compared to the Nash (Econometrica 18:155-162, 1950) and Kalai and Smorodinsky (Econometrica 43:513-18, 1975) solutions, it is ex ante efficient when the bargaining problem is considered as a lottery of future bargaining problems.","[Baris, Omer F.] Nazarbayev Univ, Grad Sch Publ Policy, 53 Kabanbay Batyr Ave, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan",Nazarbayev University,"Baris, O (通讯作者)，Nazarbayev Univ, Grad Sch Publ Policy, 53 Kabanbay Batyr Ave, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan.",omer.baris@nu.edu.kz,"BARIŞ, Ozlem/B-7628-2015","BARIŞ, Ozlem/0000-0002-2679-5599",,,,,30,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUN,2018,84.0,4,,,,,547,556,,10.1007/s11238-017-9640-x,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GF1IK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431687300003,0

As DTAs shift taxing rights from capital-importing to capital-exporting countries, the latter inherently benefit more from the agreements. In this paper, we argue that capital exporters use foreign aid to incite capital importers into signing DTAs. We demonstrate in a theoretical model that in a deal, one country does not trump the other, but that the deal must be mutually beneficial. In the case of an asymmetric DTA, this requires compensation from the capital-exporting country to the capital-importing country. Examining DTAs that are signed between donor and recipient countries between 1991 and 2012, and using a fixed effects Poisson model, we find that bilateral foreign aid commitments increase by 22% in the year of the signature of a DTA. Evaluated at the sample mean, this translates into around US$ six million additional aid commitments in a DTA signatory year.","[Braun, Julia] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Zagler, Martin] UPO Univ Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy; [Zagler, Martin] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Braun, J (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.",,"Zagler, Martin/C-5677-2016","Zagler, Martin/0000-0003-0863-7375",Universita del Piemonte Orientale; Norwegian Science Fund; OeNB Jubilaumsfonds [16017]; MannheimTaxation (MaTax) Science Campus; Leibniz Association,Universita del Piemonte Orientale; Norwegian Science Fund; OeNB Jubilaumsfonds; MannheimTaxation (MaTax) Science Campus; Leibniz Association,"Universita del Piemonte Orientale; Norwegian Science Fund; OeNB Jubilaumsfonds, Grant/Award Number: 16017; MannheimTaxation (MaTax) Science Campus; Leibniz Association",,43,4,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2018,41.0,6,,,,,1478,1507,,10.1111/twec.12628,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GI6XL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434646400001,0

In this regard, aviation can act as a means of both transporting traded goods and providing complementary services of labor mobility. The Lombardy region in Italy is an interesting case, as it is one of Europe's wealthiest and most industrialized areas with almost 10 million inhabitants. It has three of the top four Italian airports-Milan Malpensa (MXP), Bergamo Orio al Serio (BGY), and Milan Linate (LIN)-as well as a small airport in Brescia Montichiari (VBS) mainly used for cargo flights. On March 31, 2008, Malpensa Airport experienced the de-hubbing of Alitalia. This exogenous event allows us to study the relation between international trade and civil aviation by exploiting a quasi-natural experiment without endogeneity problems. We investigate this relation by estimating a before/after augmented gravity-econometric model applied to a panel data set for the period of 2004-2014. The data set includes, for each of the considered 30 European countries, information on trade flows divided by commodities sector, distance from Lombardy, GDP per capita, population, transport infrastructures and a set of other control variables. We estimate the gravity model under three different econometric specifications: random effect panel data, PPML, and PPML with fixed effects to include countries' multilateral resistance. Furthermore we estimate a DID model as a robustness check for possible endogeneity among trade and aviation, using the region of Veneto (similar to Lombardy but not affected by the de-hubbing) as a control case. We find that civil aviation has a positive impact on international trade, with elasticity ranging from +0.003% to 0.13% in the different econometric specifications, and that this effect is stronger in high tech- and medium-tech manufacturing sectors.","[Brugnoli, Alberto; Martini, Gianmaria] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy; [Dal Bianco, Antonio] Eupolis Lombardia, Milan, Italy; [Scotti, Davide] Univ Brescia, Brescia, Italy",University of Bergamo; University of Brescia,"Martini, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.",gianmaria.mariini@unibg.it,"Scotti, Davide/AGX-5924-2022; Martini, Gianmaria/N-6165-2016","Scotti, Davide/0000-0001-9670-0199; Martini, Gianmaria/0000-0001-9503-4999",,,,,32,24,24,9,43,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Yet, despite Tunisia was at forefront of introducing them, the uptake of SWCT by farmers has been less broad than desired. This study aims to identdy and analyze those factors that have affected the rate of adoption of SWCT within the Sidi Bouzid governorate of Central Tunisia; a region that is representative of resource-poor environments within the country, and one where land degradation is of both historical and contemporary concern. Employing a binary logistic regression model, with data obtained from a survey of 250 farmers, our results suggest that socio-economic and institutional factors play an important role in the adoption of SWCT. Membership within an agricultural cooperative was positively correlated with adoption. Surprisingly, however, participation in organized trainings for SWCT was negatively correlated with adoption, similarly to livestock holdings. We provide plausible explanations for this counterintuitive finding, together with an argument that conventional processes for knowledge transfer and dissemination are in need of reform.","[Dhehibi, Boubaker] ICARDA, RALSP, Amman, Jordan; [Zucca, Claudio] ICARDA, ILWMP, Rabat, Morocco; [Frija, Aymen] ICARDA, RALSP, Tunis, Tunisia; [Kassam, Shinan N.] Caritas Switzerland, Dushanbe, Tajikistan",CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA),"Dhehibi, B (通讯作者)，ICARDA, RALSP, Amman, Jordan.",b.dhehibi@cgiar.org,"Frija, Aymen/D-8296-2016; Zucca, Claudio/K-9167-2013","Frija, Aymen/0000-0001-8379-9054; Dhehibi, Boubaker/0000-0003-3854-6669; Zucca, Claudio/0000-0002-8636-0511",CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems; Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) within the water scarcity initiative of the Near East and North Africa,CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems(CGIAR); Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) within the water scarcity initiative of the Near East and North Africa,"This work was undertaken as part of, and funded by, the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems (http://drylandsystems.cgiar.org/) led by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA: http://www.icarda.org).

Through the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), a multiscale event analysis approach is proposed for exploring the effect of an economic crisis on the European carbon market. Firstly, we determine the appropriate carbon price data of the estimation and event windows to embody the impact of the interested economic crisis on carbon market. Secondly, we use the EEMD to decompose the carbon price into simple modes. Hilbert spectra are adopted to identify the main mode, which is then used to estimate the strength of an extreme event on the carbon price. Thirdly, we perform a multiscale analysis that the composition of the low-frequency modes and residue is identifying as the main mode to capture the strength of the interested economic crisis on the carbon market, and the high-frequency modes are identifying as the normal market fluctuations with a little short-term effect on the carbon market. Finally, taking the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and 2009-2013 European debt crisis as two cases, the empirical results show that contrasted with the traditional intervention analysis and event analysis with the principle of one divides into two, the proposed method can capture the influences of an economic crisis on the carbon market at various timescales in a nonlinear framework.","[Zhu, Bangzhu] Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ma, Shujiao] Hunan Univ, Sch Business & Management, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xie, Rui] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Hunan University; Hunan University; IPAG Business School; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Zhu, BZ (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Chevallier, J (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",wpzbz@126.com; julien.chevallier@ipag.fr,"Chevallier, Julien/AAY-9567-2020; XIE, rui/JXR-6421-2024","Chevallier, Julien/0000-0002-4423-9502; Xie, Rui/0000-0001-9300-7145; Chevallier, Julien/0000-0001-9109-0205","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473180, 71201010, 71303174]; National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China [14AZD068, 15ZDA054]; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong [2014A030306031]; Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar [[2016] 95]; Department of Education of Guangdong [[2013]246, [2014]145]; Guangdong key base of humanities and social science: Enterprise Development Research Institute; Guangdong key base of humanities and social science: Institute of Resource, Environment and Sustainable Development Research; Guangzhou key base of humanities and social science: Centre for Low Carbon Economic Research","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong; Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar; Department of Education of Guangdong; Guangdong key base of humanities and social science: Enterprise Development Research Institute; Guangdong key base of humanities and social science: Institute of Resource, Environment and Sustainable Development Research; Guangzhou key base of humanities and social science: Centre for Low Carbon Economic Research","We express our gratitude to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71473180, 71201010 and 71303174), National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China (14AZD068, 15ZDA054), Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong (2014A030306031), Guangdong Young Zhujiang Scholar (Yue Jiaoshi [2016]95), Department of Education of Guangdong ([2013]246, [2014]145), Guangdong key base of humanities and social science: Enterprise Development Research Institute and Institute of Resource, Environment and Sustainable Development Research, and Guangzhou key base of humanities and social science: Centre for Low Carbon Economic Research for funding supports.",,19,91,92,3,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

To purge the unemployment rate from demographic factors, labor force shares are routinely used to control for compositional changes. This paper shows that this approach is ill defined, because the labor force share of a demographic group is mechanically linked to that group's unemployment rate, as both variables are driven by the same underlying worker flows. We propose a new demographic-adjustment procedure that uses a dynamic factor model for the worker flows to separate aggregate labor market forces and demographic-specific trends. Using the U.S. labor market as an illustration, our demographic-adjusted unemployment rate indicates that the 2008-2009 recession was much more severe and generated substantially more slack than the early 1980s recession.","[Barnichon, Regis] San Francisco Fed, Barcelona, Spain; [Barnichon, Regis] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain; [Barnichon, Regis; Mesters, Geert] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Mesters, Geert] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Pompeu Fabra University,"Barnichon, R (通讯作者)，San Francisco Fed, Barcelona, Spain.;Barnichon, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain.;Barnichon, R (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Barnichon, Regis/B-4650-2013; Mesters, Geert/A-2917-2015","Mesters, Geert/0000-0001-6996-9520","Marie Curie FP7-PEOPLE-2012-COFUND Action grant [600387]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-68136-P]; FEDER, UE","Marie Curie FP7-PEOPLE-2012-COFUND Action grant(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FEDER, UE(European Union (EU))","We thank Katharine Abraham, Tomaz Cajner, Mary Daly, Bart Hobijn, Oscar Jorda, Kris Nimark, Rob Valletta, Yanos Zylberberg, and seminar participants for helpful comments and Roger Gomis for excellent research assistance.

An inaccurate inter-arrival time distribution likely causes traffic congestion or resource wastage at service facilities. In this study, to obtain accurate inter-arrival time distribution, we collected an inter-arrival time of passengers at existing service facilities in three underground subway stations of a metropolitan city, Chengdu, China. We fitted eight types of distributions, including Hyper-Erlang distribution (HErD), which is firstly introduced in the capacity design of service facilities in an underground subway station, to the observed data set based on maximum likelihood estimation. Results showed that the HErD works the best in terms of fitting quality and flexibility. We also fitted eight types of distribution to the observed inter-arrival time data at service facilities of seventy-seven underground subway stations of another metropolitan city-Shenzhen, China-to confirm our findings. Results also showed the HErD still performs the best. Simulation is also conducted to examine the effect of inter-arrival distributions on the performance of service facilities. To estimate future inter-arrival time based on HErD for the capacity design of service facilities to be constructed in the planning period, we developed a basic parameter estimation model according to two given design parameters namely, long-term peak-hour volume and peak-hour factor. However, the proposed model did not work well because the HErD has many free parameters to be estimated. Thus, we derived a method to reduce the number of free parameters, and then we proposed an improved parameter estimation model of HErD to describe future inter-arrival time distribution based on given long-term peak-hour volume and peak-hour factor.","[Chen, Yanru] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 111,1st Sect,Northern 2nd Ring Rd, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yi, Bing] ChongQing Urban Integrated Transportat Pivot Inve, 128,Zhongshan 3rd Rd, Chongqing 400000, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yangsheng] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Transportat & Logist, 111,1st Sect,Northern 2nd Ring Rd, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jidong] Beijing Aerosp Dacheng Wisdom Syst Technol Dev Ct, Dept Intelligent Transportat, 5 Minzuyuan Rd, Beijing 100086, Peoples R China; [Wahab, M.

In order to explore this attractiveness, a zero-inflated count-data model is estimated. The analysis uses a unique data set where information from the International Congress and Convention Association on international association meetings is linked to a set of specific characteristics for 943 cities in Europe for the period 2012 to 2016. Approximately one out of five cities hosts five meetings or more in a single year. Estimations reveal that cultural offerings, quality of local universities, attractiveness as a location for international research and development and foreign direct investments (FDI) in hotels as well as size are factors of importance for the probability of becoming a host city as well as for the extent of meetings. Infrastructure, such as an airport nearby and sea border in the proximity, is crucial only for becoming a host city. A comparison of actual and potential number of meetings reveals that large cities like Copenhagen, Edinburgh, Lisbon, Porto, Munich and Barcelona all host far more meetings than would have been expected given their destination attributes.","[Falk, Martin] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Hagsten, Eva] Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Falk, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",martin.falk@wifo.ac.at,"Falk, Martin Thomas/T-8325-2019; Hagsten, Eva/AAH-7574-2019; Hagsten, Eva/AAL-7086-2020","Falk, Martin Thomas/0000-0003-0518-6513; Hagsten, Eva/0000-0001-7091-1449;",,,,,42,13,14,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

First, using a test of symmetry, I evaluate whether the relationship between oil prices and state unemployment rates is symmetric. I find no evidence against the null of symmetry after accounting for data mining. Second, I use a symmetric structural VAR model to analyze the effect of oil supply shocks, aggregate demand shocks and oil-specific demand shocks on state unemployment. I find that an adverse supply shock triggers increases in unemployment, whereas a positive aggregate demand shock reduces the unemployment rate across most U.S. states. I also show that oil-specific demand shocks have little effect on state unemployment. Finally, I dig into the historical contribution of the various oil shocks to the changes in state unemployment rates during the shale boom period. I find that aggregate demand shocks contributed the most to the change of unemployment.

By adopting the Habermasian understanding that legitimacy is a prerequisite for NPE and through employing a focus group methodology novel to NPE research, the article finds that a certain segment of the Turkish public views the EU as a normative power, suggesting that claims for the existence of NPE need to be qualified both by the level of analysis and by the local context which comprises socio-cultural factors as well as government/opposition dynamics. The article also shows that contestation of the EU's actorness takes place over moral and ethical-political arguments rather than utility-based debates, demonstrating that polarization is noticeably present as far as the EU's normativity is concerned, and not on the perceived costs and benefits of EU accession.","[Aydin-Duzgit, Senem] Sabanci Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University,"Aydin-Düzgit, S (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Univ Caddesi 27 Tuzla, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",saduzgit@sabanciuniv.edu,,,,,,,34,10,10,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Besides, we provide a granger causality test conducted in a non-linear framework. We find that a rise in misalignment increases significantly the output in the short-run when currencies are close to equilibrium. When they are highly misaligned, the impact on growth is reduced. However, no significant impact of output on misalignment was found in the short-run. We provide evidence that misalignment granger causes the output at any given level of misalignment both in the short and long-run. Weaker granger causality was found between output and misalignment. This raises some important policy implications. Although emerging economies can use undervaluation as a growth strategy, the benefits are smaller when currencies are highly undervalued. There is, therefore, an incentive to keep exchange rates closer to their equilibrium.","[Tipoy, Christian K.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa; [Breitenbach, Marthinus C.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Zerihun, Mulatu F.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Finance, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Pretoria; Tshwane University of Technology,"Zerihun, MF (通讯作者)，Tshwane Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Finance, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",Tipoy@ukzn.ac.za; Martin.breitenbach@up.ac.za; Zerihunmulatufekadu606@gmail.com,"Breitenbach, Marthinus C/AAO-7736-2020; Zerihun, Mulatu Fekadu/W-8810-2019","Breitenbach, Marthinus C/0000-0003-4623-2379; Zerihun, Mulatu Fekadu/0000-0003-4797-928X; Tipoy, christian/0000-0002-3893-500X; Tipoy, Christian Kakese/0000-0003-4243-8652",,,,,48,8,8,0,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Limited institutional capacities for collecting and transmitting information about the domestic win-set may prevent domestic constituents from exerting influence on the negotiator. This perspective sheds new light on the outcomes of negotiations in two-level games, as they do not necessarily reflect actual win-sets, but more likely the negotiator's (mis)perceptions or (mis)representations thereof. The article builds on an explorative case study of the Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations between the EU and the West African (2003-14) and the Caribbean (2003-07) regions. It relies on qualitative data, including over 60 interviews. The findings demonstrate that detachment meant that these controversial North-South trade agreements primarily reflected the negotiators' perceptions of the regions' interests or their own preferences, which raises doubts about their developmental impact and complicates their implementation.","[Weinhardt, Clara] Hertie Sch Governance, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Moerland, Anke] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Hertie School; Maastricht University,"Weinhardt, C (通讯作者)，Hertie Sch Governance, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",c.weinhardt@hertie-school.org,,"Moerland, Anke/0000-0001-6902-9774; Weinhardt, Clara/0000-0003-1830-1189",,,,,46,9,11,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This paper assesses empirically the contribution of such search for safe assets to the size and composition of emerging economies' international asset portfolios. Excess demand for safe assets in financially less-developed countries would imply that these countries hold disproportionately high shares of their total portfolios in foreign assets. Moreover, financially less-developed countries would hold disproportionately high shares of their foreign portfolios in financially developed countries, which are the major producers of ostensibly safe assets. This paper finds little empirical support for these predictions. Financially less-developed countries allocate a larger proportion of their total holdings to domestic assets. Even when focusing on their foreign portfolios, there is no evidence of a general bias towards the assets of financially developed countries. Overall, asset mismatches do not appear to explain the assetallocation of financially less-developed countries.","[Ahrend, Rudiger; Saia, Alessandro; Schwellnus, Cyrille] OECD, Paris 16, France; [Saia, Alessandro] Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, Lausanne, Switzerland",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Lausanne,"Ahrend, R (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris 16, France.",,,"Saia, Alessandro/0000-0002-2034-1879",,,,,31,0,1,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2018,41.0,2,,,,,573,603,,10.1111/twec.12526,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FV9WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424941800009,0

The study further finds that establishments receiving MEP assistance are more likely to survive than those that do not receive MEP assistance.","[Lipscomb, Clifford A.] Greenfield Advisors, 102-A E Main St, Cartersville, GA 30120 USA; [Youtie, Jan] Georgia Inst Technol, Enterprise Innovat Inst, Policy Res Serv, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Shapira, Philip] Georgia Inst Technol, Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Shapira, Philip] Univ Manchester, Innovat Management & Policy, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Arora, Sanjay] Amer Inst Res, Washington, DC USA; [Krause, Andy] Greenfield Advisors, Seattle, WA USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Manchester; American Institutes for Research,"Lipscomb, CA (通讯作者)，Greenfield Advisors, 102-A E Main St, Cartersville, GA 30120 USA.",cliff@greenfieldadvisors.com,"Youtie, Jan/Q-4180-2016; Shapira, Philip/E-4638-2011","Shapira, Philip/0000-0003-2488-5985; Krause, Andy/0000-0002-4771-5623",NIST-MEP [SB1341-11-SE-1446],NIST-MEP,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: NIST-MEP, Contract # SB1341-11-SE-1446.",,17,6,6,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

However, one could also argue that the personalist view of humans as connected entities should not only be interpreted as connectedness to other humans. More than ever, there are good reasons to also consider the bonds between humans and animals, and even the environment. This line of reasoning gives us a unique opportunity to value animals, and nature, without having to sacrifice the focus on humans. By that, personalism provides a realistic framework to engage with the pressing issues in animal and environmental ethics in the 21st century. One of the main problems with a classic anthropocentric ethic is that it tends to focus on short-term and narrow interpretations of human interests. That environmental problems can have an impact on humans is quite evident, but similar connections can also be found between animals and humans (individually and collectively). In 2015, even Pope Francis has alluded to this in Laudato Si'. Recognising the interconnectedness of all human and non-human life forms in the biosphere is a major step towards a personalism that awards dignity or intrinsic value to animals and the environment. Then, stewardship - another important concept - becomes important, but no longer only because of the importance of animals and the environment for humans. Following these arguments in depth, we are confronted with a moral framework that implies (or facilitates) fundamental changes in our mentality, not only for the animals and the environment themselves, but also because it is important for humans. A value and person based philosophy such as personalism guides us to a moderate anthropocentrism that allows for concrete steps forward for animals and the environment.","[Aerts, S.] Odisee Univ, Coll Ethol & Anim Welf, Hosp Str 23, B-9100 St Niklaas, Belgium",,"Aerts, S (通讯作者)，Odisee Univ, Coll Ethol & Anim Welf, Hosp Str 23, B-9100 St Niklaas, Belgium.",stef.aerts@odisee.be,"Aerts, Stein/A-1100-2009","Aerts, Stein/0000-0002-8006-0315; Aerts, Stef/0000-0001-9049-4419",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,361,364,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_56,0.0,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000056,0

Our central estimate of the elasticity of scrappage with respect to vehicle prices is -0.4, which is substantially different than values adopted in simulation models. These estimates imply that many policies aimed at reducing gasoline consumption, including Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards and gasoline taxes may produce changes in the used vehicle market that are different than prior studies suggest.

It does so through separating a narrow view of austerity as fiscal consolidation from actually existing austerity as a broader political economic process ongoing in different ways in different countries. Through a case study of crisis, austerity and contestation as it relates to housing in Spain, the paper argues that to contest actually existing austerity it is necessary to contest both the wealth and power of the actors that have gained from austerity, not least finance capital. Through bank bailouts and the creation of a bad bank, the reforms demanded by the troika have opened up Spanish housing to direct wealth extraction by global finance capital whilst half a million households have been evicted and hundreds of thousands live with insurmountable debt. The Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca (PAH, Platform for the Mortgage-Affected) has contested austerity in Spanish housing by contesting finance capital through civil disobedience whilst campaigning for anti-austerity reforms to housing and mortgage legislation, aiming to limit how housing can be a sphere of wealth extraction for finance capital.","[Berglund, Oscar] Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, 11 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Berglund, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, 11 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",oscar.berglund@bristol.ac.uk,"Berglund, Oscar/AAZ-2966-2020","Berglund, Oscar/0000-0003-0068-8194",Economic and Social Research Council [SPAI SC3203],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by Economic and Social Research Council [grant number SPAI SC3203].,,85,9,10,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In the last twenty years, many and fundamental changes impacted the content, format, and reliability of business information that is exchanged in the capital markets. For a long time, the public interest entities (PIEs) were associated with listed companies. The auditors were seen as confidence providers for the information published by PIEs. At the same times, a fall in confidence in the integrity of the financial market was caused by a number of financial reporting and auditing failures. For these reasons, the role and responsibilities of auditors in the recent financial crisis are still under the scrutiny. As a consequence, in European Union have been adopted new rules on statutory audit and this adoption generated a revised definition of the public interest entities (PIEs) in most European countries. In this context, the purpose of this study is to identify the changes and the challenges for the audit profession in Europe. Because the primary objective of the European reform on the statutory audit for PIEs is to increase the quality of audits, we will also analyze the direct and indirect implications of new rules on the public oversight of statutory auditors and audit firms in EU member states. For this purpose, we identified the current state of affairs regarding the organization of public oversight of statutory auditors and audit firms in European countries and the characteristics of these activities.","[Chersan, Ionela-Corina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Chersan, IC (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",corina.chersan.macovei@gmail.com,"Chersan, Ionela-Corina/AAT-8442-2020","Chersan, Ionela-Corina/0000-0001-7566-415X",,,,,17,0,0,0,4,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-492-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,389,401,,,,,,13,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL8FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456271700029,0

The hospital under perspective, provides diagnostics, therapy, care, specialist advice, education prevention and health promotion. Efficiency of hospital departments was measured using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The distribution of efficiency and the ranking of clinical departments was compared across surgical and non-surgical department's profile. Input and output data was collected from the hospital database for 19 578 patients admitted to 14 departments between January and June 2017. The research shows that only 5 clinical departments (35.71%) run efficiently. These were the Departments of Hematology, Gynecology, Vascular Surgery, Rehabilitation and Ophthalmology. Most of them provide surgical procedures. The least efficient was the Department of Transplantology and General Surgery.

Water management problems stem from the mismatch between a multitude of individual decisions, on the one hand, and the current and projected status of water resources on the other. Economics can provide valuable incentives that drive individual decisions, and can design efficient instruments to address water governance problems in a context of conflicting interests and relevant transaction costs. Yet, instruments such as water pricing or trading are mostly based on general principles of welfare economics that are not readily applicable to assets as complex as water. A flaw in welfare economic approaches lies in the presumption that economic instruments may be good or bad on their own (e.g., finding the right price). This vision changes radically when we focus on the problem, instead of the instrument. In this paper, we examine how economic instruments to achieve welfare-enhancing water resource outcomes can realize their full potential in basin-scale management contexts. We follow a political economy perspective that views conflicts between public and private interest as the main instrumental challenge of water management. Our analysis allows us to better understand the critical importance of economic instruments for reconciling individual actions towards collective ambitions of water efficiency, equity and sustainability with lessons for later-adopting jurisdictions. Rather than providing panaceas, the successful design and implementation of economic instruments as key river basin management arrangements involves high transaction costs, wide institutional changes and collective action at different levels.","[Gomez Gomez, Carlos Mario] Univ Alcala, Dept Econ, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Gomez Gomez, Carlos Mario] Madrid Inst Adv Studies Water Technol IMDEA Water, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Perez-Blanco, C.

Facilitating return migration is one of the ways to minimize negative economic and social consequences of emigration in Latvia and other sending countries. According to survey of return migrants, detailed information on employment possibilities and earnings in Latvia targeted on emigrants has a potential to increase return migration. This paper analyzes determinants of earnings of return migrants using very rich information on jobs and earnings in Latvia, as well as foreign experience of more than 1000 returnees surveyed in 2016. After controlling for personal characteristics and hours worked, we find significant and sizable positive effects on returnees' earnings at the main job for various components of specific human capital accumulated abroad: duration of work abroad in particular sector and occupation; any knowledge acquired abroad which is used at the job in Latvia; foreign experience in occupation related to one's education or qualification; specific skills which make the respondent a difficult-to-replace employee at his workplace. These results hold true also after controlling for a rich set of job characteristics. By contrast, general experience accumulated abroad (proxied by duration of stay abroad) positively affects earnings in Latvia only for those return migrants who have completed abroad (in EU or OECD country) some tertiary education. Higher education obtained abroad (in EU or OECD) is shown to positively affect post-returning earnings also through number of other channels.","[Hazans, Mihails] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Hazans, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Hazans, Mihails/N-7043-2017","Hazans, Mihails/0000-0001-8107-2767",,,,,37,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,235,245,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500022,0

However, Structuralist Economists show that there may be an inverse relationship between exchange rate and economic growth. Particularly in developing countries, the input structure of production depends on the imported capital and intermediate goods, so an increase in the exchange rate negatively affects the economic growth by making imported production inputs more expensive. Turkey, leaving exchange rates free to fluctuate, have adopted Inflation Targeting (IT) as a monetary regime since 2001 and thus exhibited a genuine experience to be analysed the role of exchange rate in economic growth. Accordingly, using quarterly data from 2002 to 2017 and employing Johansen cointegration and Granger causality tests, the nexus between exchange rate and economic growth has been investigated in this study. Empirical findings indicate that, as argued by Structuralist Economists, there is a negative causal relationship from exchange rates to economic growth. From the policy perspective, it can be concluded that monetary policy applications in Turkey should provide both price and exchange rate stability together under inflation targeting regime.","[Karahan, Ozcan] Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Merkez Yerleskesi, TR-10200 Bandirma Balikesir, Turkey",Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University,"Karahan, Ö (通讯作者)，Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Merkez Yerleskesi, TR-10200 Bandirma Balikesir, Turkey.",okarahan@bandirma.edu.tr,"Karahan, Özcan/D-9357-2018",,Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University [BAP-18-IIBF-1009-038],Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University,This work was supported by Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University.

The level of interregional inequality in banking sector was assessed for its assets, financial results, attracted deposits and provided loans, which were calculated both per capita and as their ratio to GRP of regional economies. To eliminate the effect of price level on the variables in time series we determined their real values using the cumulative GRP-deflator indices. The inequality in spatial distribution of assets, liabilities and financial results of banking sector was evaluated by means of the weighted coefficients of Gini and variation and tested for beta- and sigma-types convergence. We found significant growth of the spatial concentration of ownership and management of assets in Russian banking sector accompanied by low and cyclical concentration of financial results (net profits) within the sector, which meantime increased noticeably last year. At the same time, banking activity demonstrated much lower and sometimes diminishing regional disparities. First of all, we observed decrease in spatial inequality in the level of lending to enterprises and population, and the both types of convergence were proved for them. This trend was opposite to the growth of interregional disparities in the average personal deposits and almost nil change in inequality of the deposits of enterprises. We concluded that discrepancy between distribution of ownership on assets and actual implementation of banking activity, in combination with high interest rate (cost of capital), contributed to further redistribution of financial resources of the periphery in favor of the center and prevented the improvement of financial position of backward regions.","[Malkina, Marina] Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhni Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Macroecon & Microecon Ctr, Bolshaya Pokrovskaya St 37, Nizhnii Novgorod 603000, Russia",Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Malkina, M (通讯作者)，Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhni Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Macroecon & Microecon Ctr, Bolshaya Pokrovskaya St 37, Nizhnii Novgorod 603000, Russia.",mmuri@yandex.ru,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,387,394,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800050,0

In this article, I analyse a surprising and unexpected actor playing an important role in shaping WTO rules on agriculture-the United Nations (UN). While UN actors do not have a seat at the bargaining table, I argue that they invoke their delegated and moral authority and initiate actions to shape global trade rule-making. I demonstrate that UN actors have influenced the discourse, agenda and outcomes of trade negotiations by analysing three cases: (1) the Food and Agriculture Organization orchestrating a Uruguay Round agreement in favour of food insecure developing countries; (2) the World Food Programme's blocking of trade rules on international food aid during the Doha Round negotiations; (3) a proposal by the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food for a legal waiver to protect public food stockholding that was taken up by WTO member states in 2013.","[Margulis, Matias E.] Univ Stirling, Div Hist & Polit, Polit Econ, Stirling, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Margulis, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Div Hist & Polit, Polit Econ, Stirling, Scotland.",,,"Margulis, Matias/0000-0003-0931-6581",,,,,101,24,25,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Although the universally binding health care right for a minimum uniform set of services can be guaranteed by the state, this is not a certainty, especially for people who do not have compulsory health insurance. Thus, the higher the minimum set of health services taken into account as the basis and the number of people who do not contribute to the mandatory national health insurance system, the higher the cost of services and, implicitly, the contributions of the contributing this sense.

At the heart of most discussions is the question of whether blockchain is a threat to the existence of traditional banking or whether it will transform the latter, causing a strong impetus in its evolution? Syndicated loans are one of the areas of traditional banking in which the upcoming application of blockchain based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is undoubted. This argument is supported by the steadily growing number of leading banks in syndicated lending which are actively experimenting pilot DLT platforms for a syndicated lending community. The results of the comparative analysis of the currently used technologies and blockchain based on DLT and smart contracts show that their implementation will lead to significant positive changes in database security, transaction and settlement speed, service automation, acceleration of the credit process and ultimately to a significant reduction in operating costs. Some objective DLT restrictions are also correctly analyzed. In conclusion, we can summarize that, at this stage, the expectations that blockchain technology shall disrupt the traditional bank lending seem to be exaggerated. It is argued that blockchain should be viewed not as a threat, but as a real prerequisite for banking in general, and syndicated lending in particular, to accelerate to a new evolutionary stage of their development.","[Petrov, Dancho] Univ Econ Varna, Varna, Bulgaria",University of Economics Varna,"Petrov, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Varna, Varna, Bulgaria.",,"Petrov, Dancho/AAC-7557-2019","Petrov, Dancho/0000-0001-6085-1702",,,,,29,0,0,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,500,510,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500046,0

To differentiate the incentives from the ability to innovate, we distinguish the inputs of innovation (R&D and training), from the outputs. Our findings highlight a virtuous circle between the three components of innovation, as well as between firms' R&D, innovation and exports. The results suggest a positive effect of R&D on innovation (product innovation in particular), of innovation on exports (product and marketing innovation especially), and of exports on R&D. Furthermore, it would seem that training and R&D reinforce each other in the Indian firms' innovation process: doing R&D incites firms to train their workers, and training stimulates R&D in return. Productivity of the Indian manufacturing firms seems to benefit from that dynamics, as exporting and innovating would improve firms' total factor productivity. As for the investment climate, our results suggest that the differences in the Indian firms' environment participate in their performance gap. These results are all the more important in the context of the Make in India program and the Indian business environment deficiencies.","[Plane, Patrick; Veganzones-Varoudakis, Marie-Ange] Univ Clermont Auvergne UCA, CNRS, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Veganzones-Varoudakis, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Clermont Auvergne UCA, CNRS, CERDI, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",veganzones@aol.com,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,125,139,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300015,0

To analyze zero coupon bonds, it is necessary to determine their present value, yield to maturity and duration. Since zero coupon bonds do not pay any interests the yield to maturity and present value are calculated by discounting the nominal value of such a bond. The duration is a measure of the average life of a bond and can be defined as the weighted average of the times until each payment is made, with weights proportional to the present value of the payment. To solve this valuation problem for annual and semiannual compounding of zero coupon bonds new models were developed and a special spreadsheet programmed using only plain vanilla Excel with its basic financial functions.

The method decomposes differences between an estimated transition matrix and a benchmark transition matrix into portions attributable to differences in characteristics between individuals from different households (a composition effect) and portions attributable to differing returns to these characteristics (a structure effect). A detailed decomposition based on copula theory further decomposes the composition effect into portions attributable to specific characteristics and their interactions. To examine potential drivers of economic persistence in the USA, we apply the method to white males from the 1979 US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Depending on the transition matrix entry of interest, differing characteristics between sons from different households explain between 40% and 70% of observed income persistence, with differing returns for these characteristics explaining the remaining gap. Further, detailed decompositions reveal significant heterogeneity in the role played by specific characteristics (e.g., education) across the income distribution.","[Richey, Jeremiah] Off Comptroller Currency, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA; [Rosburg, Alicia] Univ Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, IA USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; University of Northern Iowa,"Richey, J (通讯作者)，Off Comptroller Currency, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA.",Jeremiah.richey@occ.treas.gov,,"Rosburg, Alicia/0000-0002-5116-0501",,,,,53,7,9,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

Within the industrial paradigm the purpose of agriculture is seen as producing commodities as efficiently as possible, whereas in the alternative paradigm agriculture is seen as having a wider significance for society beyond commodity production. The use of theory can help elucidate values underpinning debates. However, when does theorising different positions in terms of paradigms of agriculture and their theoretical lineage serve to pigeonhole professionals in agriculture rather than open up the complexity of values involved in debates ? Professionals, including farmers and stakeholders within the agricultural sector, often hold a multiplicity of values about agriculture which may get lost if we theorise agriculture in terms of overarching paradigms. This paper explores this question in relation to indoor dairy farming in the UK. Indoor dairy farming is a growing though controversial trend in the UK. It can be seen to be within the industrial paradigm of agriculture as it is driven by economies of scale and greater use of scientific and technological innovation. However, it is often defended with appeal to the importance of the farmer-animal relationship which is framed as more important to animal welfare than the type ofproduction system. This argument appeals the importance of care within livestock farming and traditional norms of good stock keeping which, in theory, are not an obvious fit within industrial agriculture. This paper argues that understanding debates in terms of paradigms of agriculture can provide theoretical insights which help elucidate values for professionals involved and wider stakeholders. But that such theorising must be responsive to the complexity of professionals' different values and identities.","[Shortall, O.] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",James Hutton Institute,"Shortall, O (通讯作者)，James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",orla.shortall@hutton.ac.uk,,,British Academy early career fellowship; Scottish Government's Centre for Expertise on Animal Disease Outbreaks (EPIC) [2.4.1],British Academy early career fellowship; Scottish Government's Centre for Expertise on Animal Disease Outbreaks (EPIC),"This work was funded by a British Academy early career fellowship and the Scottish Government's Centre for Expertise on Animal Disease Outbreaks (EPIC), project 2.4.1.",,21,0,0,0,2,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,66,71,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_8,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000008,0

However, the large information gap between individual and institutional investors unduly impairs individual investors, which may negatively influence the market. In this study, we propose a new investment index that focuses on the relationships among stocks to help manage the risk of individual investors. The relationships among stocks have often been analyzed by a cross-correlation matrix method. However, such methods are strongly influenced by irregular events, including drawdowns. Therefore, we employed a transfer entropy method to analyze the relationships among stocks. Transfer entropy is a sequence analysis method proposed by Schreiber that is robust for irregular events. First, we applied the partial correlation and transfer entropy methods to test the data and confirm robustness for unexpected events. Next, we generated stock-networks by transfer entropy that represents the relationships among stocks. Finally, we proposed an investment index that is calculated from stock-networks which are generated from transfer entropy. We compared the proposed investment index with long positions and obtained higher performance investment by our proposed method than with a long position.","[Toriumi, Fujio; Komura, Kazuki] Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Toriumi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo, Japan.",tori@sys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Toriumi, Fujio/L-5551-2019","Toriumi, Fujio/0000-0003-3866-4956",,,,,12,4,4,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In tourism, even something that does not have the characteristics of goods and services can be sold and that significantly affects the distribution and points to the importance of marketing knowledge and activities for the development of any form of tourism. As the fastest growing form of rural tourism, especially in the international context, agritourism gains more and more importance both from the academic, as well as the tourism public. In the academic sense, there is a modest base of theoretical and empirical notions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to terminologically define the key terms at the theoretical level that will surely contribute to a clearer and more accurate understanding of this highly confusing terminology. The modern tourism market is characterized by a more diversified tourism offer of products and services. The lack of market placement as well as market communication, especially market advertising, certainly has a negative indication for the further development of rural activities in such market conditions, In order to identify and analyze the general characteristics of the current marketing activities and advertising means and channels, to evaluate the quality levels of advertising activities arising from the cooperation with other stakeholders and to analyze the websites of the economies at the empirical level, a research will be conducted on a suitable sample. The survey will include 13 counties of the Continental region of the Republic of Croatia, and the respondents will be TFF owners, The research instrument will be a survey questionnaire and the collected data will be analyzed according to standard scientific methods.","[Tubic, Dejan; Bakan, Rikard; Randelj, Juraj] Coll Management Tourism & Informat Virovitica, Virovitica, Croatia",,"Tubic, D (通讯作者)，Coll Management Tourism & Informat Virovitica, Virovitica, Croatia.",dejan.tubic@vsmti.hr; rikard.bakan@vsmti.hr; juraj.randelj@vsmti.hr,"Bakan, Rikard/JDW-9938-2023",,,,,,30,1,2,0,5,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1162,1174,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300063,0

TETP fully takes the student as the main character, puts more emphasis on the cultivation of different thinking, and guides the students to find forwardly a problem, ponder independently the one, explore cooperatively the issues, and be good at expanding a new problem from multiple perspectives. Moreover, TETP not only emphasizes the process of repeated explorations which can encourage each student to master knowledge and improve the problem-solving abilities, but also focus on each student's learning situation in each step which is used to evaluate the achievement of learning objectives.

It is required to conduct state financial policy, taking into account the innovative character of changes in all spheres of life. It is necessary to find a balance between the effective functioning of the budget system in the conditions of economic volatility, limited financial resources, fierce competition and often unavailability of borrowed funds and the inevitable transition to the model of innovative development in the knowledge economy. The study aims at developing a methodology for assessing the region's budget potential, taking into account the innovative development of high-tech industries to increase the population's well-being. The authors developed a methodology for assessing the region's budget potential, taking into account the innovative development of high-tech industries based on a number of principles and a specially developed system of indicators. Indicators should comprehensively characterize the region's budget potential from the standpoint of financial sustainability and the region's economic development through high-tech industries. It is proposed to form two blocks of indicators: Revenues, Economy, Innovations and Expenses, Socio-Economic Indicators. The methods of economic, system analysis and mathematical statistics were used. Approbation of the methodology was carried out on the official open data of the Federal State Statistics Service and the Federal Treasury of Russia for 2016. Practical implementation of the methodology makes it possible to rank the regions on the basis of a consolidated standardized indicator of the region's budget potential including the innovative development of high-tech industries. Monitoring the rank and analysis of the numerical value of the region's consolidated indicator allow: to establish that the problems of the region's budget potential development are related to the lack of a developed innovation environment and a unified productive system for managing budget resources; to develop effective managerial decisions considering innovative character's transformations to increase the population's well-being.","[Yashin, Sergey] Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Management & Publ Adm Dept, Bolshaya Pokrovskaya St 37, Nizhnii Novgorod 603000, Russia; [Yashina, Nadezhda; Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya; Kashina, Oksana] Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Dept Finance & Credit, Bolshaya Pokrovskaya St 37, Nizhnii Novgorod 603000, Russia",Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Yashin, S (通讯作者)，Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Management & Publ Adm Dept, Bolshaya Pokrovskaya St 37, Nizhnii Novgorod 603000, Russia.",jashinsn@yandex.ru; sitnicof@mail.ru; pronat89@mail.ru; oksana_kashina@mail.ru,"Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/AAH-2583-2021; Kashina, Oksana/O-8961-2017; Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/HIR-3846-2022","Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/0000-0002-8924-2991; Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/0000-0002-8924-2991",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [18-010-00909],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),The reported study was funded by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research according to the research project No 18-010-00909.,,17,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,849,856,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800108,0

J,"Lee, W; Yoon, Y",,,,"Lee, Woojin; Yoon, Younghoon",,,Capital in South Korea: 1966-2014,SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Using a recently released consistent set of data on stocks of wealth, we estimate wealth and its associated variables in South Korea during the period of 1966-2014. We find the following. First, with some fluctuations, the capital-income ratio has been steadily rising from 1966 to 2014. The level of the capital-income ratio in South Korea is also high relative to other OECD countries. A part of the reasons for it is a high level of government wealth in South Korea; the government in South Korea played an important role in capital accumulation. Another reason is that housing and land prices in South Korea have been high relative to national income levels; the capital-income ratio is likely to fall if housing and land prices fall in the future. Second, the capital income share has also been increasing over the last half century, and it moves largely in the same direction as the top decile income share. Third, the rate of return on capital (r) has been lower than the income growth rate (g) until the late-1990s, but inequality is reversed after the late-1990s. That g having been bigger than r in South Korea for a long period of time (30 years) is sharply in contrast with the tendencies observed in other OECD countries, and is due to unusually fast economic growth in South Korea. Fourth, it appears that the capital gains-induced wealth growth is more important than savings-induced wealth growth in South Korea. In particular, the period of 1966-1979 exhibits the most significant capital gains-induced wealth growth; about 79% of the wealth growth is due to capital gains in that period.","[Lee, Woojin; Yoon, Younghoon] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, W (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",woojinlee@korea.ac.kr; yhyoon@korea.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF2016S1A3A2924944],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),Woojin Lee's researchwas financially supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF2016S1A3A2924944).,,23,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,DEC,2017,49.0,3-4,,,SI,,671,708,,10.1007/s00355-017-1040-1,0.0,,,38,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FN5QB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416061600012,0

As a result, evaluation of public transportation systems is a strategic decision making problem for both private and public sections. In this paper, the problem of public transportation passengers in Tehran is addressed and their satisfaction levels are assessed by using passenger satisfaction survey. An integrated MCDM approach is proposed for evaluation of public transportation systems based on Delphi method, group analytic hierarchy process (GAHP) and preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE). The proposed model provides more reliable and realistic results and introduces directions for future improvements of public transportation service quality. A sensitivity analysis is applied to investigate the influence of criteria weights on the decision making problem. As a conclusion, the most important public transportation systems in Tehran orderly are: metro, taxi, BRT, bus and van. Therefore, Tehran Municipality and policy makers should encourage and support the previously mentioned systems.","[Nassereddine, M.] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran; [Eskandari, H.] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University; Tarbiat Modares University,"Nassereddine, M (通讯作者)，Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran.",m.nassereddine@modares.ac.ir,,"Eskandari, Hamidreza/0000-0002-5515-9399",,,,,59,88,90,7,57,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

An alternative explanation is statistical discrimination, which implies that judges rely on race to predict a felon's latent criminality in the absence of perfect information. This paper uses an empirical approach that distinguishes between taste-based and statistical discrimination. The intuition is that if the rank order of judicial incarceration rates depends on race, then this is symptomatic of taste-based discrimination. The rank-order test results imply that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no taste-based discrimination.","[Park, Kyung H.] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA",Wellesley College,"Park, KH (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA.",,,,,,,,56,5,6,1,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Using data on college football games from 2002 to 2010, I find that a team's chances of winning are 5.3-15.6% greater in the game following their victory over a cream puff. In my preferred estimation, this cream puff effect is roughly half as large as the estimated home field advantage. I also show that the U.S. Today/Sagarin rating system, which I use to control for team abilities, penalizes teams for playing vastly inferior opponents. I devise two empirical strategies that deal with this potential problem and show that the cream puff effect is not simply an artifact of the rating system. These results contribute to the literature on dynamic contests by showing that not only does the timing of one's efforts within a contest matter but so does the schedule of one's opponents.","[Simundza, Daniel] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",University of Southern California,"Simundza, D (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",simundza@marshall.usc.edu,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The transnational character of the security threats and the challenges identified by the EU have led to progressive integration between internal and external security concerns. These concerns have often led to calls for greater coherence within EU security policies. The literature, however, indicates that this need for coherence has, so far, not been systematically operationalized, leading to a fragmented security field. This article has two main aims: To devise a framework for the analysis of the EU's coherence as a security actor, and to apply it to the cybersecurity field. By focusing on EU cybersecurity policy, this article will explore whether the EU can be considered a coherent actor in this field or whether this policy is being implemented according to different and unco-ordinated rationales.","[Carrapico, Helena] Aston Univ, Sch Languages & Social Sci, Aston Triangle, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Barrinha, Andre] Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Sch Psychol Polit & Sociol, N Holmes Rd, Canterbury CT1 1QU, Kent, England; [Carrapico, Helena; Barrinha, Andre] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Estudos Sociais, Coimbra, Portugal",Aston University; Canterbury Christ Church University; Universidade de Coimbra,"Carrapico, H (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Sch Languages & Social Sci, Aston Triangle, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.;Barrinha, A (通讯作者)，Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Sch Psychol Polit & Sociol, N Holmes Rd, Canterbury CT1 1QU, Kent, England.",h.farrand-carrapico@aston.ac.uk; andre.ban-inha@canterbury.ac.uk,"Barrinha, Andre/ABG-2958-2020","Barrinha, Andre/0000-0002-6650-3730; Carrapico, Helena/0000-0003-0015-9110",Aston Centre for Europe; RILE from Canterbury Christ Church University (QR funding for Politics and International Relations),Aston Centre for Europe; RILE from Canterbury Christ Church University (QR funding for Politics and International Relations),They would also like to thank the Aston Centre for Europe and the RILE funding 2016/2017 from Canterbury Christ Church University (QR funding for Politics and International Relations) for supporting their fieldwork through financial support.,,31,42,46,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

These methods extend the literature on power laws in the social sciences in several directions. First, we show that any stationary distribution in a random growth setting is shaped entirely by two factors: the idiosyncratic volatilities and reversion rates (a measure of cross-sectional mean reversion) for different ranks in the distribution. This result is valid regardless of how growth rates and volatilities vary across different economic agents, and hence applies to Gibrat's law and its extensions. Second, we present techniques to estimate these two factors using panel data. Third, we describe how our results imply predictability as higher-ranked processes must on average grow more slowly than lower-ranked processes. We employ our empirical methods using data on commodity prices and show that our techniques accurately describe the empirical distribution of relative commodity prices. We also show that rank-based out-of-sample forecasts of future commodity prices outperform random-walk forecasts at a 1-month horizon.","[Fernholz, Ricardo T.] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, 500 E Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School,"Fernholz, RT (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, 500 E Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",rfernholz@cmc.edu,,,,,,,33,7,8,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

Evidence from Latin America,TOURISM ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,agency theory; credit constraint; information asymmetry; Latin America; SMEs,SMALL FIRMS; FINANCING CONSTRAINTS; BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT; DETERMINANTS; GROWTH; SIZE; BEHAVIOR; MARKETS; PERFORMANCE; ENTERPRISES,"Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the service and hospitality industries are critical for economic development in Latin America. However, due to information asymmetries, access to capital is a major obstacle for SMEs to expand their activities. Drawing from agency theory, the purpose of this study was to examine the financial constraints of SMEs in the service sector, particularly the case of hospitality firms in Latin America, due to requirements associated with mitigating information asymmetries. Using a logit model, we investigated whether financial requirements acting as mechanisms to mitigate information asymmetries, such as fixed asset collateral requirements and financial statement audits, would be associated with credit constraints for small- and medium-sized firms. We further investigated whether, due to their unique financing characteristics, SMEs in the hospitality industry would be less credit constrained than other industries in the service sector. Results suggest that SMEs subjected to collateralized fixed assets and auditing requirements, separately, were more likely to be credit constrained. However, our findings indicate that both financial requirements, when used together, decreased the likelihood of credit constraint for SMEs in the hospitality industry.","[Motta, Victor] Fundacao Dom Cabral, Ave Princesa Diana 760, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",,"Motta, V (通讯作者)，Fundacao Dom Cabral, Ave Princesa Diana 760, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",victor.damotta@gmail.com,,,,,,,93,9,11,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Based on the theoretical development of maritime cluster evolution in the current research literature, components and functions of maritime clusters are observed to have changed over time. However, very few empirical studies have been conducted on maritime cluster evolution that reflect the diverse components and their interactions within a cluster. Particularly, there is insufficient literature that systematically studies the relationship between ports and other maritime sectors, though the port is deemed to play an important role among sectors in maritime cluster development. This paper aims to fill these research gaps by analysing two cases - London and Hong Kong. London is considered as an international maritime service centre, while Hong Kong is en route to be an international maritime service centre, with the latter cluster possesses a supportive port while the former does not. Grounded on the symbiosis theory, this paper examines the evolution of maritime clusters empirically through investigating the interactions between a port and other sectors within a maritime cluster with the Lotka-Volterra model. Empirical results show that advanced maritime services, namely marine insurance and shipbroking, benefit from port development in London. However, these maritime services sectors are in pure competition with the port sector in Hong Kong. The research provides reference for policy makers on the dynamic development path of maritime clusters in practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted a retrospective questionnaire survey whose respondents were university students of two universities located in the center of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area (TMA), two in the suburbs of the TMA, and three in major local cities outside of it. We asked them to consider their experience of past travel mode for going to upper-level elementary, middle, and high school as well as general-purpose travels from their mobility biography. We also asked about possible factors affecting their future intentions, such as their degree of concern about the environmental damage that car use might entail and their daily use of information and communication technology (ICT) tools. Responses from 351 university students were successfully collected. We found that experience of past bicycle use for going to high school affected the intention of future car purchase positively, while rail use for attending high school showed a statistically significant negative correlation. We also modeled the degree of young university students' intention to purchase a car in future by estimating ordered probit model. As a result, we found that experiences of past school travel by bicycle as high school students showed a positive relation, and of general-purpose travel by rail showed negative relation to intentions of purchasing a car in future. The latter implies that the policy measures for promoting a less car-dependent lifestyle by locating schools in the areas that are easily accessible by rail and conducting mobility management programs for molding school students' experiences of rail travel.

Recent literature has affirmed that the source of these contradictions and other controversies in education economics may be due to the fact that test scores contain only ordinal information. In this paper, I propose a normalization of test scores that is invariant to monotonic transformations. Under fairly weak assumptions, this metric has interval properties and thus solves the ordinality problem. The measure can serve as a valuable robustness check to ensure that any results are not simply statistical artifacts from the choice of scale.","[Penney, Jeffrey] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia",Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Penney, J (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.",,,,,,,,16,9,10,1,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In this paper, we revisit this question and present evidence on how the mode of transit station access/ egress (by walking, bicycling, or driving) can importantly influence the gap between car and transit accessibility in the San Diego region. We construct two accessibility measures to analyze low-wage job access by transit: (1) the number of low-wage jobs accessible within a 30-min commute and (2) the number of low-wage jobs within a 30-min commute adjusted by the number of potentially competing workers who live within 30 min. We then simulate several policy changes that could reduce the difference in transit vs car accessibility. Examples include using faster station access/egress modes such as bicycling and driving to or from transit stations and reducing transit service wait time. Our results demonstrate that in the San Diego region, if transit riders walk to/from transit stops, low-wage job accessibility by car is almost 30 times larger than low-wage job accessibility by public transit. We find that changing the mode of access and egress to and from stations is more effective at improving transit access to low-wage jobs than policies that reduce transit wait time or improve service headway. Given the transition of transportation to a service or sharing economy, these results have important implications for how to improve access to employment in low income neighborhoods.

Among country-level macro variables, GDP growth and the policy environment are significantly positively correlated with project outcomes. Among project-level micro variables, shorter project duration and the presence of additional financing are significantly correlated with better project outcomes. In addition, the track record of the project manager in delivering successful projects is highly significantly correlated with project outcomes.

The data were generated from contingent behaviour experiments on South African residents at KTP and three other parks deemed as either substitutes or complements for visitors to KTP. Our results suggest that there is sheer underselling of the recreational opportunity at KTP, which implies that there is room for generating extra revenue to support benefit sharing arrangements with the local communities. The conservation fees at KTP can increase by as much as 115%, thereby almost doubling current revenue after accounting for the drop in visitation which will be triggered by the increase.","[Dikgang, Johane] Univ Johannesburg, PEERC, Dept Econ & Econometr, Kingsway & Univ Rd, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Muchapondwa, Edwin] Univ Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa; [Muchapondwa, Edwin] Lulea Univ Technol, Lulea, Sweden",University of Johannesburg; University of Cape Town; Lulea University of Technology,"Dikgang, J (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, PEERC, Dept Econ & Econometr, Kingsway & Univ Rd, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",jdikgang@uj.ac.za,"Dikgang, Johane/ABB-7214-2021","Dikgang, Johane/0000-0002-8076-4443",Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA); FORMAS; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA); FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The Funding from Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA), FORMAS and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) is gratefully acknowledged.

The proposed threefold methodology to test for causal linkages integrates (1) lag-augmented VAR Granger causality tests, (2) Breitung-Candelon causality tests in the frequency domain, and (3) testing for causal inference based on a fully modified OLS (FMOLS) approach. For 12 of 24 countries in the sample, the three tests yield uniform results in terms of causality presence (absence) and direction. Causality running from credit depth to economic growth is found for the UK, Australia, Switzerland, and Greece. The findings lend no support to the view that financial development shifts from a supply-leading to demand-following pattern as economic development proceeds.

Our demand estimation results suggest that a higher commodity price increases the traffic volume in markets where the local economy is heavily reliant on mineral resources and that appreciation of the Australian dollar decreases the passenger flow in tourism-dependent areas. The presence of leading airlines and low-cost carriers and the availability of international services all contribute positively to market growth. Airport entry analysis reveals that the major carriers engage in clear strategic interactions. The Qantas airline group uses Jetstar as a fighting brand, such that Jetstar flies to a destination if and only if the regional airport is also served by Virgin Australia, the group's major competitor. Unlike the routes connected to major airports, the demand at regional airports is not sensitive to flight frequency. Our empirical results support the introduction of a consistent aviation policy across Australia, especially for issues related to airline competition and demand stimulation. However, special consideration needs to be paid to regional airports to help them deal with economic shocks and cover fixed costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing studies generally tend to choose a city or an entire region as the research object. For this reason, these kinds of studies can neither analyze the differences in the vehicle emission effects of road charging on regions with different built environment attributes, nor distinguish how different built environment attributes affect the vehicle emission effects of road user charging. To fill in the research gap, this paper focuses on the influences of road charging on the vehicle emissions of regions with different built environment characteristics. In order to achieve the above mentioned goal, this paper first applies a method which combines the land use and transport interaction model with a vehicle emission model to simulate the automobile emissions under different road pricing schemes. Then, using multiple regression analysis, this paper establishes the association between the built environment attributes and the vehicle emissions under different road charging levels. Additionally, using factor analysis and cluster analysis, this research further distinguishes the vehicle emission effects of road pricing based on attributes of the built environment. The results confirmed that road pricing affects vehicle emissions in different regions differently. More importantly, not every region will experience decreases in vehicle emissions after the implementation of a road charging policy. The presence of retail amenities, good street design, and public transportation, the more significant the effect of road pricing in reducing vehicle emissions. Furthermore, a healthy jobs-housing balance is also conducive to the decline of regional automobile emissions as well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, those who were imprisoned in the 1930s had significantly lower BMI values (by between 0.72 and 1.01) than those who were incarcerated at the end of the 19th century. This corresponds to a decrease in weight of some 2.25 kg (4.95 lbs) for a man of average height of 173.86 cm (68.5 inches). The diminution in nutritional status among this lower-class sample is hardly surprising, given the high level of unemployment at the time but has not been verified until now. In marked contrast, the BMI values of Citadel cadets increased by 1.5 units in the 1930s.

This article draws on in-depth interviews with senior human resources professionals in British public sector organizations to examine shifting discourses of WLB in an austerity context. Three main discourses were identified: WLB practices as organizationally embedded amid financial pressures; WLB practices as a strategy for managing financial pressures; and WLB as a personal responsibility. Despite a discourse of mutual benefits to employee and employer underpinning all three discourses, there is a distinct shift towards greater emphasis on economic rather than institutional interests of employers during austerity, accompanied by discursive processes of fixing, stretching, shrinking and bending understandings of WLB.

In general, they overestimate the extent of poverty relief undertaken by government. Given that poverty relief programs are a public good and likely underprovided, overestimation of the level of income redistribution is likely to exacerbate this under-provision by reducing giving to private charities. This paper considers if this misperception affects giving to poverty-relief charities. We report a real-donation experiment investigating links between contributions to poverty-relief charities and perceptions of federal transfers to low income households. We also ask participants to self-identify political affiliation, religiosity, race, and gender. We find that donations to our poverty relief charities are inversely related to the perceived transfers made to the poorest quintile. Donations are approximately $0.20 less for each $1000 of perceived transfers. Interestingly, we find little correlation between giving and political beliefs.","[Luccasen, R.

SMEs tend to serve local rather than global markets. However, several obstacles prevent greater participation of SMEs in the economy. Among them, crime is a major issue that negatively affects local development in developing countries, as robbery, theft, vandalism and arson increase the cost of doing business. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between crime and firm performance for Latin American SMEs in both service and hospitality sectors, using labor productivity as a measure of firm performance. Labor productivity is a key concern in Latin America as institution-related issues of corruption, infrastructure, regulations, trade policies, access to finance, and human capital may reduce the efficiency of firms in developing economies.

We use early-life economic conditions and regional circumstances as instruments for poverty later in life to account for endogeneity issues. After controlling for a large set of covariates at the individual, household, regional and country level, the results show that poverty significantly increases the probability of being obese and the Body Mass Index (BMI), for men and women. The results show that, accounting for endogeneity with a bivariate probit model, poor individuals are from 10 to 20% points more likely to be obese than non-poor individuals. The effect on BMI ranges from 0.295 points (2.39 kg) to 0.395 points (2.75 kg). These results are robust to a series of checks and suggest that anti-poverty interventions might have positive side effects in terms of reducing food-related health inequalities.

Previous studies quantify the benefits and costs of land-use regulations by comparing properties subject to differing degrees of regulatory intensity. A separate, but related, issue is how housing and land markets will evolve over time when a set of regulations remains in place. We examine how the value of developed land changes over time in cities that have adopted urban growth boundaries (UGBs). We present a theoretical model that combines equilibrium sorting, spatially-varying amenities, and urban growth controls. The model is used to examine how prices for developed lands inside and outside the UGB change with growth in the city's population. The UGB is shown to increase relative prices of exurban lands outside the UGB if new residents prefer the amenities in this area. The UGB also affects relative prices by influencing the quality of developed lands. We use a parcel-level panel data set on developed land values to quantify the scarcity and quality effects of UGBs in Oregon.

We find significant differences with external REITs being significantly more transparent relative to internal REITs, and these differences are reflected in the loan contract terms and loan syndicate structure of loans made to these two types of REITs. We find that the relatively more transparent externally advised REITs are offered more favourable loan contracts in terms of lower loan rates and lower likelihood of collateral requirement. Further, loans to external REITs have syndicates that are larger in size and the lead lender retains a smaller portion of the loan, reflecting lower information asymmetry.","[Deng, Yongheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Finance, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore; [Deng, Yongheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore, Singapore; [Hu, Maggie (Rong)] Univ New South Wales, Sch Banking & Finance, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Srinivasan, Anand] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Dept Finance, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; University of New South Wales Sydney; National University of Singapore,"Hu, M (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Banking & Finance, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",ydeng@nus.edu.sg; m.hu@unsw.edu.au; bizas@nus.edu.sg,"Deng, Yongheng/A-4272-2010; Srinivasan, Anand/L-8913-2015","Deng, Yongheng/0000-0002-4438-5171; Hu, Maggie/0000-0002-1693-6730",,,,,49,5,5,2,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In addition, the apprehension of many BSS operators to share data further hinders comparison. This paper estimates the number of daily trips from publicly available data for 75 BSS case studies across the world and provides trips per bike per day scores as a comparison of performance and success. Results reveal that a third of case studies have fewer than the psychologically important one trip per bicycle per day. To ascertain what factors are associated with this metric we estimate models with independent variables related to system attributes, station density, weather, geography and transportation infrastructure. Our analysis provides strong evidence undermining the 'network effect' promoted by influential BSS policy makers that expanding system size increases performance. Finally our results describe and discuss causal variables associated with higher BSS performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We provide an approximation of the labour market effects of immigrant workers in four European countries during the global economic crisis after briefly analysing native and foreign-born worker conditions for the most recent period. Our analysis focuses on the correlation between the stock of immigrant workers and the number of native labour market workers across several segments of the labour market using a simple model approach. Using Eurostat and LFS (Labour Force Survey) data, we estimate a structural dynamic model using the generalised method of moments (GMM) to examine adjustment dynamics in the labour market and labour market segment and worker educational levels, countries of origin and genders. Overall, the empirical results suggest that immigrant labour force effects on native-born worker employment rates have been persistent and but weak throughout the business cycle. These effects are globally positive, and immigrant origins do not appear to change the nature of their impact. We offer some explanations for these findings related to dual labour markets and to differences in levels of substitution among native and immigrant workers.","[Fromentin, Vincent] Univ Lorraine, CEREFIGE, Nancy, France; [Fromentin, Vincent] Univ Lorraine, CREA, Nancy, France; [Damette, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, BETA, Nancy, France; [Zou, Benteng] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",Universite de Lorraine; Universite de Lorraine; Universite de Lorraine; University of Luxembourg,"Fromentin, V (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, CEREFIGE, Nancy, France.;Fromentin, V (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, CREA, Nancy, France.",,,"Damette, Olivier/0000-0002-7520-3780; FROMENTIN, Vincent/0000-0003-4103-5341",Regional Council; University of Lorraine,Regional Council; University of Lorraine,We acknowledge Michel Beine and Gautam Tripathi for offering useful suggestions during the early stages of this paper's development.

The durations examined included those associated with working schedule/location alterations, home-to-work trip delays, telecommuting time, and the alteration of commuting patterns. Accelerated failure time fully parametric duration models, based on the Weibull distribution were used. The models' significant variables differed. Commuters with higher income or who were highly educated were more likely to prolong the time to return to normal working schedules and increase telecommuting duration. Longer commutes under normal circumstances (based on trip time) prolonged trip delays and the number of days that the commute was changed. Prolonged service recovery periods increased the duration of commute changes and delays, emphasizing the importance of timely transit service restoration. Policies like gas purchase restrictions were found to have trade-offs, since they can prolong the duration of commute changes and create queues at gas stations. Telecommuting can allow commuters to keep their productivity levels high during post disaster periods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To identify causal effects, we utilize an age-eligibility rule followed from 1980 to 1992 that limited sponsorship to children twelve years old or younger when the program was introduced in a village, allowing comparisons of sponsored children with older siblings who were slightly too old to be sponsored. Estimations indicate that international child sponsorship increased monthly income by $13-17 over an untreated baseline of $75, principally from inducing higher future labor market participation. We find evidence for positive impacts on dwelling quality in adulthood and modest evidence of impacts on ownership of consumer durables in adulthood, limited to increased ownership of mobile phones. Finally, our results also show modest effects of child sponsorship on childbearing in adulthood.","[Wydick, Bruce] Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, 2130 Fulton St, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA; [Glewwe, Paul] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Rutledge, Laine] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, 319 Savery Hall, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of San Francisco; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Glewwe, P (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",wydick@usfca.edu; pglewwe@umn.edu; lainemr@u.washington.edu,,"Wydick, Bruce/0000-0003-3619-9026",BASIS/USAID,BASIS/USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"We would like to thank Wess Stafford, Joel Vanderhart, Scott Todd, Alistair Sim, Herbert Turyatunga, Jose-Ernesto Mazariegos, Ester Battz, Noel Pabiona, Rowena Campos, Sofia Florance, Catherine Mbotela, Sam Wambugu, Boris Zegarra, Marcela Bakir, and other local Compassion staff and enumerators in Bolivia, Guatemala, India, Kenya, the Philippines, and Uganda for logistical help and support in carrying out our field research.

Consistent with the literature, I find that receiving an MTO voucher had no effect on outcomes like earnings, employment, and test scores. However, after studying the assumptions identifying neighborhood effects with MTO data, this paper reaches a very different interpretation of these results than found in the literature. I first specify a model in which the absence of effects from the MTO program implies an absence of neighborhood effects. I present theory and evidence against two key assumptions of this model: that poverty is the only determinant of neighborhood quality and that outcomes only change across one threshold of neighborhood quality. I then show that in a more realistic model of neighborhood effects that relaxes these assumptions, the absence of effects from the MTO program is perfectly compatible with the presence of neighborhood effects.

The former refers to support for institutional arrangements aimed at sharing economic risks at the individual level, while the latter entails public agreement to share economic risks at the Member State level. We explore the joint role of cross-border interactions and political attitudes in fostering solidarity ties among Europeans through multilevel modelling based on the 2012 Eurobarometer 77 survey. The article shows that transnational experiences do not have the same effect on different forms of European solidarity, limiting transnational and enhancing international solidarity. Egalitarian individuals are more prone to EU-wide solidarity, with cross-border practices affecting their level of solidarity, while not altering those of the rest of the population. In particular, we find that cross-border practices make egalitarians more inclined to international and less to transnational solidarity.","[Ciornei, Irina] Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Recchi, Ettore] Sci Po, OSC, CNRS, Paris, France",University of Bern; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Ciornei, I (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",irina.ciornei@soz.unibe.ch,"Recchi, Ettore/AEN-6472-2022; Ciornei, Irina/M-3286-2019","Ciornei, Irina/0000-0002-8008-1335; RECCHI, Ettore/0000-0001-7497-2150",,,,,55,47,48,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The designation of a metropolitan area as a Difficult Development Area (DDA) by the U.S. Government increases the generosity of the subsidy that private developers receive under the program, but does not increase the aggregate dollar amount of tax credits available to be allocated. Regression discontinuity methods are used to compare how DDA designation affects the quantity, composition, and location of LIHTC units based on the restriction that no more than 20% of metropolitan areas can receive the designation annually.

Certain Dutch unions have developed strategies inspired by the US 'organizing model' and have been relatively successful in recruiting and mobilizing under-represented workers. Despite some tensions emerging, the introduction of organizing resulted in the greater representation of workers in sectors such as cleaning, which has to an extent complemented social dialogue-based strategies. At the same time, the narrative and tactics of organizing have stimulated internal debate on union purpose and identity and indirectly contributed to a process of reform and democratization within parts of the union movement. The research demonstrates the pragmatic features of organizing as a strategy for union renewal in a context of regulated social partnership, but also points towards the potential for organizing to encourage shifts in the dominant sources of union legitimacy and power.","[Connolly, Heather] De Montfort Univ, CERC, European Employment Relat, Leicester, Leics, England; [Marino, Stefania] Univ Manchester, Comparat Employment Relat, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Lucio, Miguel Martinez] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",De Montfort University; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Connolly, H (通讯作者)，De Montfort Univ, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.",hconnolly@dmu.ac.uk,,"Martinez Lucio, Miguel/0000-0001-7090-9007",Leverhulme Trust [ID20070094]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001752/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001752/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K001752/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The primary research for this article was funded by the Leverhulme Trust (grant number ID20070094) and the Economic and Social Research Council (grant number ES/K001752/1).,,49,28,29,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Climatic shocks are employed as an instrument for endowment, measured as height-for-age, allowing for the identification of the impact of quasi-exogenous variation in endowment on parental allocations conditional on household fixed effects. The results suggest that educational expenditure is directed to the relatively weaker child; in response to the mean difference in height-for-age between siblings, parents redirect around 25% of discretionary educational spending to the child with the lower height-for-age, and this effect is robust to the potentially confounding effects of gender and birth order. There is some evidence that time allocation may also be a relevant margin of compensation but no evidence that medical expenditure responds to differences in height-for-age.","[Leight, Jessica] Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Leight, J (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",jessica.leight@williams.edu,,"Leight, Jessica/0000-0002-1691-9682",,,,,37,7,8,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

The model has two spatially lagged variables: one for units that are still in state 0 and one for units that had already transferred to state 1. The parameters are estimated on observations for those units that are still in state 0 at the start of the different time periods, whereas observations on units after they transferred to state 1 are discarded, just as in the literature on duration modeling. Furthermore, neighboring units that had not yet transferred may have a different impact from units that had already transferred.

With increasing deployment and renewable energy policy costs, a means to precisely apportion this risk becomes of greater importance. Option pricing theory is used to calculate efficient FiT prices and expected policy cost when investors are exposed to elements of market price risk. Expected remuneration and policy cost is equal for all FiTs while policymaker and investor exposure to uncertain market prices differs. Partial derivatives characterise sensitivity to unexpected deviations in market conditions. This sensitivity differs by FiT type. The magnitudes of these effects are quantified using numerical examples for a stylised Irish case study.

While previous research has pointed to the wider and deeper legal commitments under regional agreements as proof that it can, no previous study has assessed the impact of such agreements on applied policies. This paper focuses on the ASEAN region, where regional integration of services markets has been linked to the thriving regional supply chains. Drawing upon surveys in 2008 and 2012 of applied policies in the key services sectors of ASEAN countries, we assess the impact of the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) and the ambitious ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint, which envisages integrated services markets by 2015. We find that ASEAN is not integrating faster internally than vis-a-vis the rest of the world: policies applied to trade with other ASEAN countries are virtually the same as those applied to trade with rest of the world. Moreover, the recent commitments scheduled under AFAS have not produced significant liberalisation and, in a few instances, services trade policy has actually become more restrictive. The two exceptions are in areas that are not on the multilateral negotiating agenda: steps have been taken towards creating regional open skies in air transport, and a few mutual recognition agreements have been negotiated in professional services. These findings suggest that regional negotiations add most value when focused on areas that are not being addressed multilaterally.","[Gootiiz, Batshur; Mattoo, Aaditya] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Gootiiz, B (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,World Bank's Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Partnership on Economic Development,World Bank's Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Partnership on Economic Development,"This paper is based on research carried out for the ASEAN Services Integration Report, ASEAN Secretariat and the World Bank, 2015.

Taking into account censoring and endogeneity, we compute censored quantile instrumental variable estimators and compare them with estimates from uncensored quantile regressions. The estimation results indicate that not accounting for censoring of interest rates tends to result in downwardly biased estimates. Moreover, our censored quantile regressions lead to relatively flat coefficients of inflation and insignificant coefficients of the output gap over the conditional interest rate distribution, suggesting that monetary policy in Japan may be well described by a linear rule.","[Chen, Jau-er] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Chen, Jau-er] MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kashiwagi, Masanori] Gakushuin Univ, Fac Int Social Sci, 1-5-1 Mejiro, Tokyo 1718588, Japan",National Taiwan University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Gakushuin University,"Chen, JE (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;Chen, JE (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jauer@ntu.edu.tw; masanori.kashiwagi@gmail.com,"Chen, Jau-er/ABY-3817-2022",,,,,,22,5,5,2,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We are just beginning to understand its consequences for child obesity. This paper addresses one important component of the crisis; namely the extent to which adiposity, or more specifically, BMI, is passed down from one generation to the next We find that the intergenerational elasticity of BMI is very similar across countries and relatively constant - at 0.2 per parent. Our substantive finding is that this elasticity is very comparable across time and countries - even if these countries are at very different stages of economic development. Quantile analysis suggests that this intergenerational transmission mechanism is substantively different across the distribution of children's BMI; more than double for the most obese children what it is for the thinnest children.

This study investigates whether this is also the case for player effort in professional soccer which had no significant effect on players' market values in previous research. Specifically, it examines the effect of effort on team performance in soccer using team-game day data from three seasons (N = 1,514) of the German Bundesliga. Two effort measures are applied: (1) total distance run and (2) number of intensive runs (>20 km/hr) per player and per match. The results of probit models show that both effort measures have a significant positive effect on whether the observed team won the observed match in separate estimations. In the full model, only the effect of running distance remains positive, while intensive runs become negative. Given the insignificant effect of effort on players' market values in previous research, we suggest that there may be a Moneyball phenomenon in soccer in the sense that the soccer labor market undervalues running distance. The findings imply that decision makers in professional soccer should consult player statistics to a greater extent.","[Weimar, Daniel] Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Dept Managerial Econ, Lotharstr 53, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany; [Wicker, Pamela] German Sport Univ Cologne, Dept Sport Econ & Sport Management, Cologne, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; German Sport University Cologne,"Weimar, D (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Dept Managerial Econ, Lotharstr 53, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.",daniel.weimar@uni-due.de,"Wicker, Pamela/K-7265-2019","Wicker, Pamela/0000-0001-5818-8470",,,,,44,31,36,3,39,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

This issue is particularly important in household financial markets where consumers may be unable to evaluate products on their own. While reforms attempting to limit commission payments have been undertaken worldwide, little research has evaluated the impact of these reforms. We study a major Indian investor protection reform that attempted to reduce commissions tied to mutual fund sales by banning the distribution fees that mutual funds had previously earmarked for commissions. We analyze the policy impact by comparing funds charging high versus low distribution fees pre-reform and find no evidence that the reform itself reduced fund flows. We argue that the most plausible explanation is that the Indian asset management industry maintained substantial commissions to brokers through other revenue sources apart from the banned distribution fees.","[Anagol, Santosh] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Marisetty, Vijaya] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Sane, Renuka] Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata, India; [Venugopal, Buvaneshwaran] Univ Houston, CT Bauer Coll Business, Houston, TX 77004 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Anagol, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",anagol@wharton.upenn.edu; vijayabhaskar.marisetty@rmit.edu.au; renukas@gmail.com; bgvenugopal@uh.edu,,,ACE Fintech Pvt Ltd; Karvy Computershare Limited; Center for the Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania and Wharton,ACE Fintech Pvt Ltd; Karvy Computershare Limited; Center for the Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania and Wharton,"We thank Shawn Cole, James Choi, Ruchi Chojer, Mark Duggan, Fernando Ferreira, Keith Gamble, Ginger Jin, G.

This is one reason why the financial crisis has spread so fast and was able to affect a significant number of countries and the majority of studies are focusing on how a financial shock on one market can lead to contagion on several other countries. In order to achieve or maintain financial stability and reach sustainable economic growth, we believe it is essential to evaluate whether markets also respond to political or social shocks that occur on other markets as these are becoming important factors in preserving a healthy and stable market. This theme is of great interest to economists, investors, researchers in the field and for the political sector. Our paper proposes an analysis using the representative stock market index of each of the 28 EU countries over the period 2010-present. In order to obtain a stability index which takes into account the evolution of each particular country we are following the methodology described by Diebold & Yilmaz (2009) by forecasting the error variance decomposition of a VAR model to see what fraction of the 10-step-ahead error variance in forecasting is caused by shocks to the same variable or shocks to another variable. We are setting 4 null hypothesis in order to see whether political or social shocks have a negative impact on the markets and we are considering 4 such events: the conflict in Ukraine, the main events that followed the Brexit announcement, ISIS intensified terrorist attacks and Donald Trump's election as US president. Our results show that indeed shocks such as terrorism or the UK's announcement to leave the EU or even the US election results have a negative impact and are generating high volatility on all studied markets.","[Armeanu, Dan; Pascal, Carmen Emilia] Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Armeanu, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",darmeanu@yahoo.com; carmen.emilia.pascal@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,28,39,,,,,,12,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300002,0

The Paris Agreement requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts. This includes requirements that all Parties report regularly on their emissions and on their implementation efforts. Moon Jae-in government, which was launched in May, declared an environment-friendly energy policy with a focus on expanding renewable energy. Also, in order to respond proactively to the global issue of climate change, the government of the Republic of Korea is constantly striving to strengthen its national science and technology capacity. In this paper, we introduce the change of environment and energy technology policy which is the core of responding to climate change, and the investment direction of national R&D in Korea. The total amount of government R&D investment in the environment and energy sector in FY 2015 was $2.07 billion (1.9% increase from the previous year) which the investment in the power generation sector was high, 25.7% of renewable energy, 19.3% of nuclear power and 10.3% of electric power respectively. According to the energy policy paradigm of the new government, the share of renewable energy and gas power generation is increasing but the share of nuclear and coal-fired thermal power generation is decreasing in the energy mix.

However, existing concepts and language in the broader literature on diffusion limit our ability to analyze and assess the contestation of ideas, especially as it is sustained and transformed over time. In this paper, we develop the concept of grafting as a post-equilibrium approach to analyze the ongoing contestation of global finance at the level of market practice. We apply our conceptual framework to analyze the complex dynamics of a class of financial assets that in recent years has made significant inroads in global financial markets: sukuk, often referred to as Islamic bonds. We highlight dynamic differences in the grafting of ideas and practices from Islam and conventional finance and suggest that the grafting of sukuk is an ongoing contestation of the diffusion of global finance that contributes to the emergence of an increasingly pluralistic global economy.","[Lai, Jikon] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Rethel, Lena] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Steiner, Kerstin] La Trobe Univ, Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Warwick; La Trobe University,"Lai, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,"Lai, Jikon/A-8682-2015; Rethel, Lena/G-9574-2011","Lai, Jikon/0000-0003-2886-1403; Steiner, Kerstin/0000-0003-3082-8178; Rethel, Lena/0000-0002-7396-2054",Melbourne School of Government at The University of Melbourne; Department of Business Law and Taxation at Monash University; Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Warwick; Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies,Melbourne School of Government at The University of Melbourne; Department of Business Law and Taxation at Monash University; Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Warwick; Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies,"We acknowledge generous support from the Melbourne School of Government at The University of Melbourne, the Department of Business Law and Taxation at Monash University, the Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Warwick and the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies.

As the recent crisis emerged, it showed that the solidity of public finances has reached an impasse it needs to be enhanced. One of the paths to do this is by using fiscal rules, institutions and mechanisms that put constraints on policy-makers. There are two key currents in the specific literature on subject. The first one states that putting restraints on governments by limiting public debt, expenditure and deficits levels, and therefore the size of public investments, determines lower economic growth levels. The second view suggest that putting restraints on governments determines them to spend more efficient, invest more wisely, and therefore obtain better results regarding economic growth. This paper analyses the impact of fiscal discipline measured through fiscal rules indexes and a fiscal discipline score on economic growth rates throughout the European Union, the period sample being years 1994-2015. Our results strongly indicate that enhancing fiscal discipline and the solidity of public finances by using fiscal rules, institutions and mechanisms (our calculated fiscal discipline score) determines higher growth rates for European states - GDP per capita, gross national product and gross national income, thus confirming the second point of view found in the literature. Also, one of our results indicates that restraining policy-makers power by using fiscal rules may also conduct to lower economic grow rates measured through the grow rate of the gross national income. These results confirm a fact that we have stated with other occasions: designing fiscal constraints and enhancing the solidity of public finances is a fact easier said than done - it needs to take into consideration many variables: development degree, debt levels, existing institutions and framework, other national and international regulations.","[Macsim, Florin-Alexandru; Oprea, Florin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Macsim, FA (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",florin.macsim1@yahoo.ro; foprea@uaic.ro,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,64,76,,,,,,13,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300005,0

Current perception of managers in Slovenia about economic situation is negative which may have a significant impact on investment and positive outlook of future business. Therefore, we propose that AI which focuses on positive aspects of doing business needs to be investigated and implemented into management education of future managers and we provide empirical evidence of thinking patterns of three generations of students at the Faculty of Economics University of Ljubljana. AI means researching what gives success to human systems when they function at their best. It represents discovery process of optimum identity and a way to the best possible future. Positive core of existing situation is chosen as the focus of AI process. AI is researching into stories that give energy for further action. Purpose of this paper is to offer an alternative approach to tackling challenges, based on analyzing the causes of previous successes. Further, we aim to offer the scientific community a new methodology that solves real business, relational or individual challenges. In the Winter semester during study years 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15 we invited our students to be in a state of inquiry about themselves, their life and their work. We asked them: What is the best future you can imagine? In a longitudinal study we have gathered 171 AI pair interviews documentations. Students' AI data was analyzed in three thematic segments: 1) favorite quotes; 2) preservation of past and present into the future and 3) vision of the future. Analysis of all three generations' AI interviews revealed emphasis in their favorite quotes on the people component and the need of the students to understand life and make sense of gained knowledge and experiences. They also stress the need to think about contemporary issues and gain practical experiences. Students would most like to preserve in the future their work ethics, dedication to hard work, creativity, family members around them, experiences and knowledge gained. Their visions are focused on balancing successful international careers and family lives. New ways of communication represent an important consideration for the students. They expressed their wish to be driven by intrinsic motivation and being respected in their profession. Theoretical advantages of our paper are in elaborating on AI in management education. Practical implications are in helping students to clarify their strategic goals and visions through introspection and qualitative methodology. Professors can implement and adjust the AI questionnaire based on their own developmental objectives and also based on the needs of their students. Contribution of our paper is in the field of management education and AI field.","[Peterlin, Judita] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Pranicevic, Daniela Garbin] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; University of Split,"Peterlin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",judita.peterlin@ef.uni-lj.si,"Praničević, Daniela Garbin/E-1315-2017","Garbin Pranicevic, Daniela/0000-0002-9341-7598",,,,,24,0,0,1,6,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,14,27,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.644,0.0,,,14,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200002,0

Promoting walking and cycling has been recognised as one of the means of mitigating such negative effects. Various approaches have been taken to enhance walking and cycling levels and to reduce the use of automobiles. This paper examines the effectiveness of infrastructure interventions in promoting walking and cycling for transport. Two related sets of panel data, covering elapsed time periods of one and two years, were analysed to track changes in travel behaviour following provision of new walking and cycling infrastructure so that modal shift from private car use to walking and cycling can be investigated. Two types of exposure measures were tested: distance from the infrastructure (a measure of potential usage), and actual usage of the infrastructure. Only the latter measure was statistically significantly associated with modal shift. This in turn suggested that infrastructure provision was not a sufficient condition for modal shift, but may have been a necessary condition. Along with the use of new infrastructure, the loss of employment, higher education, being male and being part of the ethnic majority were consistently found to be significantly and positively associated with modal shift towards walking and cycling. The findings of this study support the construction of walking and cycling routes, but also suggest that such infrastructure alone may not be enough to promote active travel. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Application of the ecosystem approach to the study of venture capital financing allows for deeper research from the positions of interaction of participants, factors, and mechanisms that influence nonlinearity of innovational processes. The article views the role of the venture ecosystem as a source of innovational process development. The main characteristics of the national venture ecosystems at the modern stage are analyzed. It is noted that against the background of growth of the global market of venture capital, the Russian venture ecosystem is peculiar for outflow of investors, depreciation of portfolios of many Russian venture funds, and domination of investments into projects of late stages. It is partially caused by influence of international sanctions on the domestic market of venture capital that led to the economic isolation of Russia from the external world. Analysis of existing problems of the Russian venture ecosystem showed that its sustainable development will be achieved only by systemic interaction of all members in the conditions for the development of entrepreneurial environment that corresponds to specifics of economic relations in Russia. The article shows perspectives of development of the Russian venture ecosystem, based on effective symbiosis of government and private initiative against the background of favorable institutional conditions.","[Ugnich, Ekaterina A.; Kazakova, Aminat M.] Don State Tech Univ, Rostov Na Donu, Russia",Don State Technical University,"Ugnich, EA (通讯作者)，Don State Tech Univ, Rostov Na Donu, Russia.",ugnich77@mail.ru; aminat_mka@mail.ru,"Ugnich, Ekaterina/AGB-6651-2022; Ugnich, Ekaterina/N-6432-2019","Ugnich, Ekaterina/0000-0002-9028-5518;",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-60696-5; 978-3-319-60695-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,47,53,,10.1007/978-3-319-60696-5_7,0.0,,,7,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ5OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426114200007,0

Focusing on SMEs, it was observed that R&D infrastructure of them is extremely weak. Research conducted in 2015 in Turkey, according to R&D expenditures of firms showed that first ten enterprises in the list were multinational, so not SMEs. Open innovation is very fundamental for SMEs to keep their competitive advantages. Nowadays, important multinational firms have left their closed structure about R&D and innovation practices. As a result of this; firms have started to behave accordingly to open innovation systems. In open innovation, all the external partners should participate in the business processes. However, there are not enough researches about it. The purpose of this paper is to design product development processes of SMEs using mobile technologies. The system which was allowed the effects of external partners was designed for it. According to data collected through in-depth interviews with experts and literature review, the points are given by customers were taken into account and analyzed. The analysis process was applied according to selection criteria specified. Recently, open innovation has been provided by the contestification method. Contestification is the method that enables users to participate in an ideation contest and all the users have right to vote for ideas. As a result of this, innovative ideas come to realize. Despite of the importance as mentioned, there are few researches about the application of contestification method via mobile technologies. For this reason, contestification method was used to accelerate the product development process in this study. This research sheds light on the contribution of the users for the product development process. In the measurement process, it was observed that SMEs needed this kind of research for the efficient decision making with less financial resources and method developed made the analysis process easier.","[Unal, Ceyda; Tecim, Vahap] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Ünal, C (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Izmir, Turkey.",ceyda.unal@deu.edu.tr,"Tecim, Vahap/AAC-4081-2019; Ünal, Ceyda/ABB-5754-2020",,,,,,18,0,0,1,9,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,307,318,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.665,0.0,,,12,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200023,0

In the recent past it was enough for companies to meet their needs in a profitable way to stay in the market, but that scenario has changed dramatically. Currently, it is necessary to be one step ahead towards the future, because the strategies that have worked well in the past are not guarantees of forthcoming sustainable success. The key to longevity and business competitiveness lies in innovation. Accordingly, the main objective of this research is to present a research model of innovation in Micro and Small Enterprises to analyse: first, the degree of innovation of Micro and Small Enterprises, and second, how the innovation is handled by existing Micro and Small Enterprises as a result of its business environment. The research made is based on a sample of 550 MSE distributed over 6 cities across the Brazilian State of Piaui. The data was collected using the Innovation Radar application, which is owned by the SEBRAE Local Innovation Agents program. Statistical techniques of descriptive, exploratory and inferential nature were used for corresponding data treatment and results validation.

Thus, this study aims to propose a procedure to assess the selection of the optimum control strategies among two-way stop, roundabout and signalization using average intersection vehicle delay as the evaluation criterion. The impact of turning traffic on the major and minor streets as well as the impact of pedestrians are integrated into the developed analytical methodology for the estimation of average intersection vehicle delay. A typical layout of isolated four-leg two-way intersection is assumed for the model development. It is concluded that turning traffic and pedestrians play essential roles in the performance of intersections. As pedestrian flow increases, signal control becomes prevailing over the other control types.","[Arshi, Abubeker N.; Nakamura, Hideki; Zhang, Xin] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan; [Alhajyaseen, Wael K.

The aim of this study was to explore how travellers evaluate seven transport choices. We compared the evaluative spaces of two distinct groups of transport users: predominantly non-car users and above-average mileage car users. The Repertory Grid technique was used to elicit 448 constructs from 15 non-car users and 15 high-mileage car users. Thematic analysis, content analysis, cluster analysis, analysis of means and principal component analysis were used to identify similarities and differences between the construct systems. Results revealed that non-car users and high-mileage car users apply broadly similar constructs to evaluate transport modes. They differ, however, in the structure of their construct systems. Both groups share constructs related to time and route flexibility. Effects on the environment and benefits of physical activity were important for non-car users but not for high-mileage car users. Non-car users view travel modes with greater differentiation, while high-mileage car users use a looser construal of travel modes.

Exploiting a comprehensive Finnish employee-employer dataset, this study examines both displaced and retained workers and compares their seven-year labour market attachment after downsizing. Advanced statistics, including trajectory analysis, are used to identify groups characterized by 'immediately weakening', 'gradually weakening' and 'strong' employment. Workers displaced in major downsizings have a significantly higher risk of immediately weakening employment than those retained. Sequence analyses were performed for those on weakening employment trajectories and it was found that the pathway 'unemployment - unemployment pension - old age pension' was quite common among displaced workers but also among those retained. The results support the segmentation theory hypothesis of a dualism in outcomes, but surprisingly there is little difference in the labour market outcomes of retained and displaced workers in the long run.","[Jolkkonen, Arja; Kurvinen, Arja] Univ Eastern Finland, Karelian Inst, Kuopio, Finland; [Koistinen, Pertti] Univ Tampere, Social Policy & Labour Market Studies, Tampere, Finland; [Lipiainen, Liudmila] Univ Tampere, Work Res Ctr, Tampere, Finland; [Nummi, Tapio] Univ Tampere, Stat, Tampere, Finland; [Virtanen, Pekka] Univ Tampere, Fac Social Sci, Tampere, Finland",University of Eastern Finland; Tampere University; Tampere University; Tampere University; Tampere University,"Koistinen, P (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Tampere 33014, Finland.",pertti.koistinen@uta.fi,,,Finnish Work Environment Fund,Finnish Work Environment Fund,This research project was partly funded by Finnish Work Environment Fund.,,59,5,5,2,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We provide new evidence to show that the Law of One price (LOP) holds in the context of China which is experiencing substantial trade liberalisation. First, by accounting for heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence, our results show that prices converge to the LOP for most goods, and industrial materials converge faster than non-perishable goods. Second, in comparison with the earlier analysis with static evidence, our results with the moving window show that convergence is escalating. Third, we find that the price dispersion across products at the city level is increasing with distance, but it is decreasing with openness and economic development. Our findings show China's market integration is going well under its ongoing market-oriented reforms, and cast doubt on the proposition that incremental reform in China has led to the fragmentation of the domestic market.","[Li, Jianan] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianan] Xiamen Univ, WISE, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhiyuan] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Inst Int Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Sun, Puyang] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Puyang] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Fudan University; Shanghai Institute of International Finance & Economics; Nankai University; University of Birmingham,"Li, JN (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China.;Li, JN (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, WISE, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",,,"Li, Jianan/0000-0002-7208-8908","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503223, 71773020]; key project of key institute on humanities and social science of Ministry of Education of China [16JJD790026]; Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of China [161080]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); key project of key institute on humanities and social science of Ministry of Education of China; Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of China(Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation),"Jianan Li and Zhiyuan Li appreciate the financial support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 71503223 and No. 71773020 respectively.

To foster the expected behavior change, one should appropriately conceive, deploy and manage gamification. The paper addresses the problem of gamification design by proposing an advanced user-centered approach accounting for players' heterogeneous preferences. This is performed using stated preference methods and is applied to a reverse logistics case study. By comparing the results obtained with the proposed approach to those derived from the traditionally adopted ones, the paper shows that the former would provide considerable new insights with respect to players' heterogeneous preferences, thus, possibly, increasing the chance of achieving satisfactory results. The paper suggests that, whenever designing gamification to foster engagement and behavior change in transport, one should adopt a user-centered approach based on stated choice experiments to maximize its probability of success.","[Marcucci, Edoardo] Molde Univ Coll, Dept Logist, POB 2110, N-6402 Molde, Norway; [Marcucci, Edoardo; Gatta, Valerio] Univ Rome Tre, Dept Polit Sci, Via Gabriello Chiabrera 199, I-00145 Rome, Italy; [Le Pira, Michela] Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Via Santa Sofia 64, I-95125 Catania, Italy",Molde University College; Roma Tre University; University of Catania,"Le Pira, M (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Via Santa Sofia 64, I-95125 Catania, Italy.",michela.lepira@uniroma3.it,"marcucci, edoardo/AAJ-6539-2020; MArcucci, Edoardo/AAP-5143-2021; Le Pira, Michela/M-8220-2015","marcucci, edoardo/0000-0002-9813-3973; Le Pira, Michela/0000-0002-5963-0854; Gatta, Valerio/0000-0003-1631-1797",EU [635898]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [635898] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,EU(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),This work was supported by and developed within the framework of the EU H2020 CITYLAB project (grant agreement no 635898).

We find that interventions in the foreign exchange market by the BCRP have been effective in moving the sol/USD in the intended direction during both the past managed floating regime and the current IT regime. Interventions have, however, increased the volatility of the sol/USD, and this increase has continued very strongly under the IT regime.

The findings reveal a robust long-run relationship between financial development, economic growth, inequality and poverty. Results show that financial development and economic growth help in poverty reduction in India, whereas income inequality and inflation aggravate poverty. Empirical evidence of the Granger-causality test supports the presence of unidirectional causality from financial development and economic growth to poverty. Moreover, bidirectional causality exists between inequality and poverty. The present study provides evidence on which the policymakers may proceed with detailed investigation of how specific financial sector policies and interventions can be deployed as effective instruments for achieving favorable economic growth and income distribution. The study recommends that policies geared toward increasing financial development and economic growth should be adopted to reduce the high level of poverty and inequality currently prevailing in India.","[Sehrawat, Madhu] TA Pai Management Inst, Dept Finance & Econ, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India; [Giri, A.

The complex urban systems not only create more socioeconomic output (such as GDP), but also bring more infrastructural costs and environmental losses. Thus, urban research has concentrated on urbanization efficiency toward efficient and spatially coordinated instead of urban size. In this paper, we use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to estimate how well districts in Shanghai utilize their resources. Based on data for five inputs and three outputs, we applied an input-oriented BBC Model and an output-oriented CCR Model for Decision Making Units (DMUs) assessment and urbanization efficiency analysis. In addition, the spatial pattern of relative urbanization efficiency is examined by spatial autocorrelation model. The research result indicates that it is in downward trend mainly affected by technical constraints, 11 out of 17 districts in Shanghai are efficient, and the urbanization efficiency gap between Pudong New district and Huangpu district is significant. The districts'urbanization efficiency in south areas are higher than that in middle and northeast area.","[Zhan, Jinyan; Zhang, Fan; Li, Yifan] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Jia, Siqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jia, Siqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Chu, Xi] Hubei Univ, Fac Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430062, Hubei, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Hubei University","Zhan, JY (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhanjy@bnu.edu.cn,"Li, Yifan/HGA-6843-2022; LI, yi/HKO-0480-2023; Liu, Yi/HTN-4916-2023; Zhan, Jinyan/GYU-4910-2022","Li, Yifan/0000-0002-3249-1778;",National Natural Science Funds of China for Distinguished Young Scholars [71225005]; state key program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71533004]; National Natural Science Foundation of International/Regional Cooperation and Exchange Programs [71561137002],National Natural Science Funds of China for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); state key program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of International/Regional Cooperation and Exchange Programs,"This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Funds of China for Distinguished Young Scholars (Grant no. 71225005), the research funds from state key program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.71533004), and the National Natural Science Foundation of International/Regional Cooperation and Exchange Programs (Grant No. 71561137002).",,53,31,32,2,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Given the huge effects of the oil proceeds on these economies, the study separates the effects of oil on the fiscal balance from its effect on the current account balance. The investigation took a further step by grouping these countriesbased on their fiscal policy actions over the period of years under reviewinto pro-cyclical and counter-cyclical fiscal countries. In line with the existing literature, the impact of fiscal balance on the current account balance takes into consideration the contemporaneous effects brought about by exchange rate fluctuations, the growth in GDP, rate of openness and the growth in money supply. The models are estimated based on a panel of 31 oil-exporting countries over the period 1984-2013, using the two-stage least squares estimation techniques. The results from all countries estimations reveal the existence of twin-deficit in the total economy. In the non-oil economy, on the other hand, the evidence of twin-deficit disappears. This evidence is also reported in the counter-cyclical fiscal countries. Results from pro-cyclical fiscal countries indicated the total opposite, revealing the existence of twin-deficit in the non-oil economy, while this evidence does not occur in the total economy. The indisputable conclusion is that oil dominance continues to blur the existence of twin deficits among the oil-exporting countries.","[Akanbi, Olusegun Ayodele] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Fiscal Operat Div 1, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Sbia, Rashid] Minist Finance, Macrofiscal Dept, POB 1565, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",International Monetary Fund,"Akanbi, OA (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Fiscal Operat Div 1, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",OAkanbi@imf.org; rasbia@mof.gov.ae,"sbia, rashid/IYJ-6719-2023; akanbi, olusegun ayodele o.a/I-3763-2013","sbia, rashid/0000-0003-2277-0455;",,,,,44,2,3,1,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The high earnings increased the profitability of developing the power loom by raising the value of the labour that it saved. Consequently, less efficient-hence, cheaper to develop-power looms could be brought into commercial use than would have been the case had the golden age not occurred.

(i) To what extent econometric modelling estimates and predictions derived from responses to hypothetical choice scenarios differ from those of an equivalent-realistic choice context (i.e. hypothetical bias)? (ii) To what extent econometric modelling estimates and predictions differ as a result of postulating regret minimisation as the decision rule as opposed to the utility maximisation assumption (i.e. decision-rule effect)? The magnitude of these two effects are also compared relatively. Methods: We explore the two aforementioned problems in the context of discrete directional choices. Disaggregate experimental observations are collected from both stated-choice (SC) and realistic (or experimentally revealed) choice (RC) settings. We perform our analyses on the basis of four distinct criteria: parameter estimates, parameter ratios, predictions and prediction errors (in terms of disaggregate (i.e. individual-level) choice probabilities)). Results: (i) Our results displayed a great degree of resemblance between the parameter estimate patterns emerged from both data sources including a perfect match between the sign and significance of the SC and RC estimates. Major observed discrepancies, however, were related to the scale of the estimates as well as certain coefficient ratios. In terms of the predictions (i.e. simulated probabilities) and prediction errors (i.e. based on a hold-out part of the sample), SC based models performed surprisingly similar to those of their RC-based counterparts. (ii) The assumption of the decision rule made even a much less noticeable modelling difference (compared to the hypothetical bias) in both parameter estimates and predictions. The shift from utility to regret model led to only marginal differences in estimates, simulated probabilities and prediction errors. Compared to the hypothetical bias in particular, decision-rule specification was a much less impactful modelling component. Applications: These findings contribute to the accumulation of the empirical evidence that can determine how and when one can make best use of the SC methods which, in essence, demands the creation of links between hypothetical and real data in various contexts of choice. Our results suggested that, at least in certain contexts and applications, choice elicitation outcomes are reasonably consistent between the hypothetical and realistic settings. The findings also add to the existing evidence that point at the virtual neutrality of the discrete-choice modelling outcomes to the use of utility versus regret optimisation assumption as the choice rule. Future directions: The study also leaves us with the further question of how the observed similarity/dissimilarity patterns (SC versus RC; and regret versus utility) would materialise if aggregate prediction measures are of main concern (as opposed to the use of disaggregate measures). The question has particular bearings on applications in which discrete-choice models are applied to simulate or predict a whole system (i.e. when discrete choice models perform as part of a broader model) as a common practice in transport studies. This question will be investigated in a subsequent work.","[Haghani, Milad; Sarvi, Majid] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Haghani, M (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",milad.haghani@unimelb.edu.au; majid.sarvi@unimelb.edu.au,"sarvi, majid/A-2397-2009; Haghani, Milad/AAD-8691-2020","Haghani, Milad/0000-0003-3904-5196",Australian Research Council [DP160103291],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The authors acknowledge that this study was financially supported by Discovery Project research grant DP160103291 awarded by Australian Research Council.,,107,23,24,0,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

It remains unclear, however, whether this preference for compensation is stable or specific to certain situations. In six experimental studies, we find that adjustments in the characteristics of the situation or in the available behavioral options hardly modify the preference of compensation over punishment. This preference for compensation was found even in cases where punishment might refrain a perpetrator from acting unfairly again in the future, and even when punishment has a greater impact in restoring equity than compensation does. Thus, the preference of compensation over punishment appears to be quite robust.

A particular focus lies on the representation and contribution of transmission capacities as well as variable renewable resources. Calibrating our model with a comprehensive dataset for Europe, we find that there are substantial benefits from regional cooperation. The amount of firm generation capacity to meet a perfectly reliably system could be reduced by 36.2 GW (i.e., 6.4%) compared to an isolated regional approach, which translates to savings of 14.5 bn EUR. Interconnectors contribute in both directions, with capacity values up to their technical maximum of close to 200%, while wind power contributions are in the range of 3.8-29.5%. Furthermore, we find that specific reliability targets heavily impact the efficient amount and distribution of reliable capacity as well as the contribution of individual technologies.","[Hagspiel, Simeon] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Univ Str 22a, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Knaut, Andreas; Peter, Jakob] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ EWI, Vogelsanger Str 321a, D-50827 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne; University of Cologne,"Peter, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ EWI, Vogelsanger Str 321a, D-50827 Cologne, Germany.",jakob.peter@ewi.uni-koeln.de,,,DFG Zukunftskonzept [ZUK 81/1],DFG Zukunftskonzept(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors want to thank Felix Hoeffler, Marc Oliver Bettzuege and three anonymous referees for their helpful comments, Marius Overath for his support, and the participants of the workshops 15.

This paper examines how the permanent output loss during the Great Recession has affected the ability of the Phillips curve to explain US inflation dynamics. We find great similarity among several established trend-cycle decomposition methods: potential output declined substantially after the Great Recession. Due to the fact that a lower level of potential output implies a lesser deflationary pressure, we then show that the Phillips curve does predict a period of mild inflation. This finding is largely consistent with the observed data.","[Huang, Yu-Fan; Luo, Sui] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business,"Huang, YF (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.",yufanh.cueb@gmail.com; suiluocueb@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71601129],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Huang acknowledges support from National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71601129.,,35,5,5,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In spite of the fact that these activities are the three principal growth determinants in modern economic integration theory, growth studies based on this theory's structural framework, while highly appropriate, have hardly been undertaken. This article proposes to fill the gap by formally developing an endogenous causal model of simultaneous growth and tourism for policy analysis. In this model, trade, FDI and tourism are specified as the main contributing factors to growth. Simultaneously, gravity theory (including growth) and the Ironmonger-Lancaster new consumer demand theory determine tourism, while economic conditionality' potentially affecting both growth and tourism in the sense of Johansen is recognized and incorporated. The model is then applied to Australian and Chinese data for the important post-Japanese tourist boom period 1992-2015, to provide substantive findings on three questions: the impact of Chinese tourism to Australia, Chinese tourism determination and the effects of Chinese trade and key macroeconomic indicators on Australian economic growth. Significant policy implications are then developed for use by government tourism planners and policymakers.","[Tran Van Hoa; Turner, Lindsay; Vu, Jo] Victoria Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Victoria University,"Turner, L (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Coll Business, CNR Geelong Rd, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",wenturn@bigpond.com,,,,,,,32,9,9,2,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The impact arises from a purely external shock because of changes in linked countries. A vulnerability index proposed by Kelejian and Mukerji (Pap Reg Sci 90(4):693-702, 2011) is used to measure the spillover. This paper proposes a novel method to split the vulnerability into two parts: one arising from international linkages and another from prevailing domestic conditions determining sensitivity to spillovers.

It is well established that more productive firms engage in trading activities and as a result have higher profit levels. We use two theoretical models (the Melitz model and the Egger-Kreickemeier model) to clarify the relationship between productivity, trade activity, and profit margins and derive three hypotheses: (I) profit margins rise as productivity rises for domestic firms; (II) profit margins rise as productivity rises for trading firms; and (III) profit margins are not higher for trading firms than for domestic firms. We test these hypotheses using detailed micro-data for Finland (2005-10) and the Netherlands (2002-10).

In this paper, we provide new results on urban patenting covering more than twenty years of European patents invented by nearly one hundred thousand inventors located in France. Elaborating on the recent economic literatures on peer effects and on games in social networks, we assume that the productivity of an inventor's efforts is positively affected by the efforts of his or her partners and negatively by the number of these partners' connections. In this framework, inventors' equilibrium outcomes are proportional to the square of their network centrality, which encompasses, as special cases, several well-known forms of centrality (Degree, Katz-Bonacich, Page-Rank). Our empirical results show that urban inventors benefit from their collaboration network. Their production increases when they collaborate with more central agents and when they have more collaborations. Our estimations suggest that inventors' productivity grows sublinearly with the efforts of direct partners, and that they incur no negative externality from them having many partners. Overall, we estimate that a one standard deviation increase in local inventors' centrality raises future urban patenting by 13%. We also find that geographically close relations are up to two third more beneficial to inventors than distant ones.","[Berge, Laurent] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Campus Limpertsberg,BRA 4-09,162A Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Carayol, Nicolas; Roux, Pascale] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GREThA, UMR 5113, Avenure Leon Duguil, F-33608 Pessac, France",University of Luxembourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Carayol, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GREThA, UMR 5113, Avenure Leon Duguil, F-33608 Pessac, France.",laurent.berge@uni.lu; nicolas.carayol@u-bordeaux.fr; pascale.roux@u-bordeaux.fr,"Carayol, Nicolas/C-1079-2013","Berge, Laurent/0000-0003-2736-1917",Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-06-JCJC-0076]; Aquitaine Region (AAP program) [20101402006]; Fulbright commission; Bordeaux IdEx [ANR-10-IDEX-03-02]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-06-JCJC-0076] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Aquitaine Region (AAP program); Fulbright commission; Bordeaux IdEx; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank the participants of the 2016 Barcelona Workshop on Regional and Urban Economics, the 3rd Geography of Innovation Conference in Toulouse, the Strategic Interactions, Information Transmission and Externalities in Networks conference held in Paris 2016, the 2015 NetWorkshop in Pecs and the 55th congress of the European Regional Science Association in Lisbon.

An integrated framework to investigate loyalty by integrating Satisfaction-Loyalty Theory with Expectation-Confirmation Theory (ECT) is conceptualized and empirically examined in this study. A hierarchical structure is established to characterize the multidimensional features of public transit services from the passengers' point of view, which might help service providers obtain a systematic picture of public transit services by measuring overall service performance through sub-dimensional service domains. The rationale for developing this comprehensive framework for customer loyalty is justified by the significant relations between constructs, an excellent model fit, the greater share of variance explained for loyalty than that of the model without the two ECT concepts, as well as the difference regarding the confirmation-satisfaction-loyalty paradigm between male and female groups. It is expected to contribute to an improved understanding of customer loyalty in the public transit services context.","[Fu, Xue-mei] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiang-hua] Shandong Univ, Sch Management, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chan, Felix T.

To accomplish this goal, a structural equation model (SEM) is introduced to construct the theoretical model. A comprehensive set of hypotheses is tested to explore the relationships between service quality, passenger satisfaction, switching costs, attraction of alternatives, and passenger loyalty. This study uses the Shanghai PT in China as the case study to apply the theoretical model. The results reveal that PT service quality is the most important factor that influences a passenger's willingness to remain loyal. In addition, both switching costs and the attractiveness of cars are significantly related to passenger loyalty. Furthermore, this study proposes some critical suggestions as to how to improve the competitiveness of the Shanghai PT in its ongoing development. Decision makers assisting in the formation of PT policies and strategies will find this information useful.","[Li, Linbo; Wu, Bing] Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Bai, Yufang] Hangzhou Urban Comprehens Transport Res Ctr, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Song, Ziqi] Utah State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Chen, Anthony] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Tongji University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Song, ZQ (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ziqi.song@usu.edu,"CHEN, Anthony/IWM-5418-2023; Chen, Anthony -/F-9242-2011","CHEN, Anthony/0000-0003-4363-5041; Song, Ziqi/0000-0002-9693-3256",Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project [2017BGL029]; Chang Jiang Chair Professorship Program - Ministry of Education in China,Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project; Chang Jiang Chair Professorship Program - Ministry of Education in China,"This study was supported by the Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project (No. 2017BGL029), and the Chang Jiang Chair Professorship Program sponsored by the Ministry of Education in China.

Numerous studies suggest that actors can successfully manage these resources through cooperation, especially in hybrid governance structures, if they are able to design and enforce their own rules. Thereby, certain factors, such as the composition of a group of resource users, influence the likelihood of cooperation and the performance of self-managed resource systems. This study employed an economic framed field experiment to compare the effects of externally imposed and self-set rules of water distribution on homogeneous and heterogeneous groups of irrigation users who differ in their economic endowment. The experiment was conducted with 20 farmers in an Uzbek community. Furthermore, questionnaires, group discussions and interviews complemented the analytical method. The results show that groups, homogeneous in their economic endowment are more inclined to comply with self-designed rules than groups that are economically heterogeneous. Thus, homogenous groups achieve a better performance in terms of resource maintenance and water harvest under self-governance. However, water distribution was more equal and the illegal activities decreased in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous groups with self-implemented rules. It was found that trust was a crucial factor regarding both greater individual rule adherence and more cooperative behavior within homogeneous entities compared to heterogeneous groups of irrigation users. Finally, the results support the argument that economic heterogeneity among resource users lowers the likeliness of cooperation in self-governed common-pool resource systems.","[Rossner, Robert] Hsch Tech & Wirtschaft Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Zikos, Dimitrios] Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, THESys, IRI, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Zikos, D (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, THESys, IRI, Berlin, Germany.",dimitrios.zikos@agrar.hu-berlin.de,,,Volkswagen Foundation; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; fiat panis foundation; InDeCA project; NAREMACA project,Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); fiat panis foundation; InDeCA project; NAREMACA project,"First and foremost, we would like to thank Prof. Dr. Ulrich Wurzel and the InDeCA (funded by the Volkswagen Foundation) and NAREMACA (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) research groups of the Division of Research Economics, Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin, who supported the research over the course of nearly one year.

Large REITs with more free cash flows have a higher propensity to engage in bad growth activities. We find evidence that institutional investors play an effective role in discouraging managerial opportunism and empire building. Independent directors and external creditors, however, do not appear to be effective in discouraging REIT managers from making bad growth decisions.","[Xu, Ruoran] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Secur & Futures, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ooi, Joseph T.

We demonstrate that the two methods reveal significantly different mean values for the measured risk attitudes. Participants are classified on average as moderately risk-averse using the TCN method, whereas the same individuals are classified as nearly risk-neutral using the WD method. Moreover, we find that on average, participants overweight low probabilities and underweight high probabilities to a greater extent with the WD method than with the TCN method. Therefore, the different elicitation methods, that both consider probability weighting, can lead to different measured values of risk attitude and probability weighting.","[Bauermeister, Golo-Friedrich; Hermann, Daniel; Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Bauermeister, GF (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",golo-friedrich.bauermeister@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021; Hermann, Daniel/HNI-8466-2023","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Hermann, Daniel/0000-0003-0023-3675",,,,,44,12,12,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUN,2018,84.0,4,,,,,627,644,,10.1007/s11238-017-9616-x,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GF1IK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431687300007,0

We argue that both unobservable phenomena are closely linked to each other, as the creation of a fiscal illusion may be helpful if governments want to control shadow economic activities. Using a MIMIC model with two latent variables, we confirm previous findings on the driving forces of the shadow economy and identify the main determinants and indicators of fiscal illusion. Most importantly, we find that fiscal illusion negatively affects the shadow economy and that the shadow economy positively affects fiscal illusion. Concealing the real tax burden, we find that an increase in taxation increases both shadow economic activities and fiscal illusion.","[Buehn, Andreas] Univ Cooperat Educ Bautzen, Dept Publ Management, Loebauer Str 1, D-02625 Bautzen, Germany; [Dell'Anno, Roberto] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Dell'Anno, Roberto] Univ Salerno, CELPE, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Schneider, Friedrich] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria",University of Salerno; University of Salerno; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Dell'Anno, R (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.;Dell'Anno, R (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, CELPE, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",rdellanno@unisa.it,"Dell'Anno, Roberto/AAB-6385-2022","Dell'Anno, Roberto/0000-0001-7441-8328",,,,,43,15,18,1,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We discuss these issues through the lens of a job search model and then conduct an empirical analysis following a random effects approach to deal with selectivity. We find that notification has a strong positive effect on the training probability but a negative one on the probability of leaving unemployment. This attraction effect highlights the importance of accounting for notifications in the evaluation of active labor market policies.","[Crepon, Bruno; van den Berg, Gerard J.] INSEE, CREST, Malakoff, France; [Crepon, Bruno; van den Berg, Gerard J.] J PAL, Cambridge, MA USA; [Ferracci, Marc] French Minist Labor, Paris, France; [Ferracci, Marc] Univ Paris II, Paris, France; [Ferracci, Marc] Paris Inst Polit Studies, Paris, France; [Jolivet, Gregory; van den Berg, Gerard J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] IFAU, Uppsala, Sweden; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [van den Berg, Gerard J.] CEPR, London, England",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; University of Bristol; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"van den Berg, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",gerard.vandenberg@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,8,8,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

This paper argues that such policies have negative effects on net consumers of such products due to higher prices. With 70 percent of poor households' budget spent on food, and about 13 percent of the total budget devoted to products subject to import bans, poor households are vulnerable to such trade policies. Prices of some import prohibited food products are found to be higher than what they would be in the absence of such bans. The elimination of import bans is estimated to reduce national poverty rates by as much as 2.6 percentage points.","[Dabalen, Andrew; Nga Thi Viet Nguyen] World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Dabalen, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",adabalen@worldbank.org; nnguyen3@worldbank.org,,,United Kingdom's DFID-Nigeria,United Kingdom's DFID-Nigeria,"The authors thank Jed Friedman, Zurab Sajaia, two anonymous reviewers and participants at the March 2014 African Development Conference, Centre for the Study of African Economies, Oxford University for insightful comments.

Environmental problems emanating from economic activities targeted at achieving higher economic growth rate have become a controversial issue. In this study, the effects of financial development and trade on environmental quality in Iran were investigated. To this purpose, statistical data collected between the periods of 1970 and 2011 were used. In addition to using the autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL), the short-term and long-term relationships between the variables were estimated and analyzed. Moreover, the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis was evaluated using various pollutants. The results show that financial development accelerates the degradation of the environment; however, an increase in trade openness reduces the damage to the environment in Iran. Furthermore, the results did not agree with the EKC hypothesis in Iran. Error correction coefficient showed that in each period, 49% of imbalances were justified and approached their long-run procedure. Structural stability tests showed that the estimated coefficients were stable over the period.","[Moghadam, Hadi Esmaeilpour] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Tehran, Iran; [Dehbashi, Vahid] Univ Zabol, Zabol, Iran",Allameh Tabataba'i University,"Moghadam, HE (通讯作者)，Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Tehran, Iran.",hadies1369@gmail.com,"Esmaeilpour Moghadam, Hadi/L-9521-2016","Esmaeilpour Moghadam, Hadi/0000-0003-4400-5535",,,,,52,77,77,0,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In this situation, waste occurs when an agent's assignment turns out to exceed his realized need. How should the resource be divided in the face of possible waste? This is a question out of the scope of the existing rationing literature. Our main axiom to address the issue is no domination. It requires that no agent receive more of the resource than another while producing a larger expected waste, unless the other agent has been fully compensated. Together with conditional strict endowment monotonicity, consistency, and strong upper composition, a class of rules which we call expected-waste constrained uniform gains rules is characterized. Any such rule is associated with a function that aggregates the two types of cost generated by an agent at an allocation: the amount of the resource assigned to him and the expected waste he generates. The rule selects the allocation that equalizes as much as possible the cost generated by each agent. The subclasses of rules associated with homothetic and linear cost functions are also characterized. Lastly, to appreciate the role of no domination, we establish all the characterizations with a decomposition of no domination into two axioms: risk aversion and no reversal. They respectively capture the ideas that a rule should not be unresponsive to uncertainty, and that neither should it be overly responsive to it.","[Xue, Jingyi] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Xue, JY (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore.",jyxue@smu.edu.sg,,,,,,,62,8,8,2,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2018,51.0,1,,,,,105,136,,10.1007/s00355-018-1109-5,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GG9NE,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433027000006,0

Consistent with incentives, roughly 3.7 percent of sales concluded in the first 10 business days of January are thus attributable to timing responses among the subset of properties listed by the largest 25 percent of firms by sales volume. Underlying this effect is a willingness to stretch the number of days between contract and closing dates by an average of 2 to 4 business days per $1000 of tax savings among transactions otherwise likely to conclude immediately prior to the end of the year. A small proportion of taxpayers assisted by more experienced real estate brokers hence appear to respond in a sophisticated manner to the timing incentives inherent to Michigan's assessment limit system when confronted with the possibility of near-immediate increases in taxable basis. Though specific to Michigan, these findings emphasize. the importance of behavioral distortions around the types of tax discontinuities that are inherent to the implementation of most property tax and assessment system policies.","[Bradley, Sebastien] Drexel Univ, LeBow Coll Business, 1023 Gerri C LeBow Hall,3220 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Bradley, S (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, LeBow Coll Business, 1023 Gerri C LeBow Hall,3220 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",sbradley@drexel.edu,,,,,,,39,4,5,2,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

However, there is no evidence of a gender gap in infant health among the children of Indian immigrants. I provide evidence suggesting that the poor outcomes of Indian children at birth may be attributed to the low endowments of Indian mothers, while the absence of a gender gap may be driven by the fact that the parents who would invest less in girls are less likely to carry the pregnancies of girls to term (more likely to practice sex-selective abortion), combined with the lower cost of prenatal investments in Spain (compared with India).

Given the variations in resource endowments, governance structures and degree of infrastructure availability in MENA countries, one would expect these variables to affect an MNE's choice of FDI location. We do find that domestic non-spatial factors such as own country inflation and governance measured by bureaucratic quality as well as infrastructure affect a host country's inward FDI. We also found that only one measure of natural resource endowment; that is, oil and gas exports were instrumental in attracting FDI. This non-spatial result is generally robust and invariant to the two methodologies employed in this study, that is the spatially autoregressive (SAR) model and the spatial Durbin model (SDM). We found that neighbouring countries' infrastructure availability measured either by electricity used or energy used affected FDI inflows in a host country. However, this spatial impact was found only in the SDM model. The spatial effects of neighbouring countries' economic and political conditions and resource endowments were, however, not observed on a host country's inward FDI. The insignificance of both the surrounding market potential and the spatially weighted FDI suggests a purely horizontal motive of MNE investments in the MENA region.","[Siddiqui, Anjum] Sulaiman AlRajhi Sch Business, Dept Finance & Risk Management, Bukairiyah, Saudi Arabia; [Iqbal, Asim] Univ Educ, Dept Econ, Lahore, Pakistan",,"Siddiqui, A (通讯作者)，Sulaiman AlRajhi Sch Business, Dept Finance & Risk Management, Bukairiyah, Saudi Arabia.",,"Iqbal, Asim/AAO-8933-2020","Iqbal, Asim/0000-0001-7682-2818",,,,,46,9,10,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41.0,5,,,,,1415,1436,,10.1111/twec.12571,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432037100011,0

The proposed models can be seen as nonlinear common factor models subject to Markov switching and are able to exploit the information content in both returns and ex post volatility measures. Applications to equity returns compare the proposed models to existing alternatives. The empirical results show that the joint models improve density forecasts for returns and point predictions of return variance. Using the information in ex post volatility measures can increase the precision of parameter estimates, sharpen the inference on the latent state variable, and improve portfolio decisions.","[Liu, Jia; Maheu, John M.] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada; [Maheu, John M.] RCEA, Rimini, Italy",McMaster University,"Maheu, JM (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",maheujm@mcmaster.ca,,"Liu, Jia/0000-0003-0361-7623",SSHRC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We thank the the Editor Andrew Patton and two anonymous referees for many helpful comments that resulted in a significant revision of the paper.

Election scholars have taken up an interest in European and regional elections and the dominant approach to study these elections is the second-order election model. This model has generated important insights but it also faces limitations. A multilevel party system perspective exposes several vertical and horizontal interactions between electoral arenas. An empirical analysis on second-order effects in European elections held in 217 regions and 11 countries reveals that regional authority, regional identity and electoral timing of regional vis-a-vis European elections significantly alters the extent and way in which national politics flows into the European electoral arena. These results provide strong evidence that regionalization has significantly transformed European elections but this impact only comes to the fore once one adopts a multilevel party system perspective.

This study investigates a largely under-researched question: to what extent practical implementation exceeds levels of legislative compliance with EU requirements? To explain this phenomenon, we focus on the responsiveness of implementing actors to external (participation in transnational networks) and domestic pressures (national societal attitudes) for compliance with EU requirements and the availability of additional expertise at the implementation stage (bottom-up). Moreover, implementing actors are unlikely to respond in the same way to different types of national legislative problems (top-down). The findings suggest that implementers often outperform the transposition of EU laws. Practical outperformance depends on the level of societal support for external policies and is a response to incomplete or ambiguous domestic formal rules.","[Zhelyazkova, Asya] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Kaya, Cansarp; Schrama, Reini] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland",Radboud University Nijmegen; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Zhelyazkova, A (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Sch Management, Thomas van Aquinostr 5, NL-6525 GD Nijmegen, Netherlands.",a.zhelyazkova@fm.ru.nl,"Zhelyazkova, Asya/AAF-1006-2019","Schrama, Reini/0000-0001-8334-4244",,,,,45,7,7,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Our sample covers the period 2003-2015. We contribute to the literature by employing instrumental variable estimation approaches, using the between estimator, and pursuing panel specifications that enable us to control for multiple dimensions of fixed effects. We conclude that state-level electricity demand is very price inelastic in the short run, with a same-year elasticity of -0.1. The long-run elasticity is near -1, larger than often believed. Among the sectors, it is industry that has the largest long-run price elasticity of demand.

Our focus lies on the question whether improvements in energy intensity were caused by structural change towards a greener economy or by technological improvements. We account for intersectoral trade by using the World Input-Output database and adjust sectoral energy use via the environmentally extended input-output analysis. We find strong differences between consumption and production-based energy consumption across sectors, particularly in the construction and electricity industry. Using the three factor Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method, our decomposition analysis shows that recent energy intensity reductions were mostly driven by technological advances. Structural changes within countries played only a minor role, whereas international trade by itself even increased global energy intensity. Compared to a previous study only using production-based sectoral energy data, we find structural effects on energy intensity reductions to be systematically weaker under consumption-based data.","[Croner, Daniel] Univ Vienna, Fac Business Econ & Stat, Vienna, Austria; [Frankovic, Ivan] WU, IIASA, VID OAW, Wittgenstein Ctr, Vienna, Austria; [Frankovic, Ivan] Vienna Inst Demog, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Croner, D (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Fac Business Econ & Stat, Vienna, Austria.",daniel.croner@univie.ac.at,,"FRANKOVIC, IVAN/0000-0002-1992-2609",,,,,34,19,19,4,46,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,MAR,2018,39.0,2,,,,,103,122,,10.5547/01956574.39.2.dcro,0.0,,,20,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FZ4RB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427578400005,0

The cap-and-trade program dramatically decreased levels of NOx emissions and added substantial costs to regulated firms. Using a triple-differences approach, I examine how labor markets adjusted in manufacturing industries that were exposed to the program. I find that overall employment in the manufacturing sector dropped by 1.3%, with energy-intensive industries losing up to 4.8%. Employment declines are shown to have occurred primarily through decreased hiring rates rather than increased separation rates, thus mitigating the impact on incumbent workers. Young workers experienced the largest employment declines, and earnings of newly hired workers fell after the regulation began.","[Curtis, E.

We focus particularly on electric and hybrid vehicles. We use interactions between the cost (both fixed and running costs) and the household income to analyze the sensitivity towards different policy scenarios per income level. Results show that the willingness to pay and to accept obtained in our study is consistent with the real-market conditions. We also find that the most effective scenario to increase the market shares of new sold electric vehicles is that of a major technological advance such as a decrease in price due to cheaper manufacturing costs and an increase in driving range, rather than a policy-based scenario. In addition, the market segment that has more potential to increase the market shares of electric vehicle purchase is the middle-income level. In the paper, we discuss how to overcome the difficulties of working with revealed preference data, and propose multiple imputations to impute the attributes of the unchosen alternatives, by drawing from their empirical distributions.","[Fernandez-Antolin, Anna; Bierlaire, Michel] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Transport & Mobil Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland; [de Lapparent, Matthieu] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Western Switzerland HES SO, Sch Business & Engn Vaud HEIG VD, Yverdon, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Fernández-Antolín, A (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Transport & Mobil Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland.",anna.fernandezantolin@epfl.ch; matthieu.delapparent@heig-vd.ch; michel.bierlaire@epfl.ch,,"Bierlaire, Michel/0000-0002-5275-7692; de Lapparent, Matthieu/0000-0001-7894-9521",Nissan International SA,Nissan International SA,"This study is financed by a research agreement with Nissan International SA, which is gratefully acknowledged.",,51,5,5,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2018,84.0,2,,,SI,,277,303,,10.1007/s11238-017-9631-y,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FW8XW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425621300007,0

The optimization method allows future production possibilities to be enhanced if some final output in the current period is foregone so that larger amounts of the intermediate product can be produced. The goal is to choose the amounts of final output and intermediate product so as to maximize the size of the production possibility set. The method also allows identification of whether output is constrained by a lack of physical capital, a lack of human capital or a lack of both types of capital.

For 10 of 14 countries that were ultimately estimated, the uncovered emission-income relationship was either (1) decoupling-where income no longer affected emissions in a statistically significant way, (2) saturation-where the emissions elasticity of income is declining, less than proportional, but still positive, or (3) no transition-where the emissions elasticity of income is (or very near) unity. For only four countries did the emissions-income relationship become negative-i.e., a CKC. In concert with previous work, we conclude that the finding of a CKC is country-specific and that the shared timing among countries is important in income-environment transitions.","[Liddle, Brantley] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,Block A 10-01, Singapore 119620, Singapore; [Messinis, George] Victoria Univ, Victoria Inst Strateg Econ Studies, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",National University of Singapore; Victoria University,"Liddle, B (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,Block A 10-01, Singapore 119620, Singapore.",btliddle@alum.mit.edu,"liddle, brantley/K-9542-2014","liddle, brantley/0000-0003-3199-0214",,,,,49,28,28,1,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Moreover, a complete investment policy statement regarding the bond portfolio's structure, the level of diversification, the amount of transaction costs and the lot sizes, is precisely formulated.

We find strong empirical evidence that investors price this asymmetric dependence in the cross section of US REIT returns. In particular, we show that REIT stocks with lower-tail asymmetric dependence attract a risk premium averaging 1.3 % p.a. and REIT stocks exhibiting upper-tail asymmetric dependence are traded at discount averaging 5.8 % p.a. We find no evidence that the equity beta is positively priced in US REIT returns.

The other two axioms deal with the two-individual setting and specify how the envy measure should react to simple changes in the individuals' commodity bundles. The characterized class measures how much one individual envies another individual by the relative utility difference (using the envious' utility function) between the bundle of the envied and the bundle of the envious, where the utility function that must be used to represent the ordinal preferences is the 'ray' utility function. The class measures overall envy by the sum of these (transformed) relative utility differences.

Several studies have shown that food insecurity is associated with child externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. However, some potential methodological limitations remain. For example, most studies use a household measure of food insecurity while there is evidence that children, especially younger ones, tend to be shielded by their parents from experiencing food insecurity. In addition, the mechanisms through which food insecurity affects children are not well understood. This study uses longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to address these limitations. Fixed-effects models show that the association is even larger using a measure of child food insecurity instead of a household one. Correlated-random effects models show a large difference in child behavior problems between food secure and food insecure children due to unobserved heterogeneity. In addition, the association between child food insecurity and child externalizing behaviors remains largely unexplained while food insecurity among adults explains almost all the variation in the association with child internalizing behaviors. Food insecure children and parents are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies, which may lead to behavior problems in young children. These findings underscore the need for greater focus on reducing the risk of food insecurity, especially for children in fragile families, in order to reduce behavior problems and improve their educational attainment.

Using a novel collection of historical mortgage-market data, we identify four different ideal type' systems, which developed in mature economies when organised housing finance institutions began to emerge with the advance of industrialism and urbanism throughout the long nineteenth century: informal person-to-person lending, and state lending as solutions outside specialised banking circuits; and deposit-based and bond-based institutions as banking solutions. We adapt Alexander Gerschenkron's economic backwardness thesis in order to explain the temporal and spatial emergence of these distinct types, arguing that these systems created path-dependent logics, which made their influence felt over a century later.","[Blackwell, Timothy; Kohl, Sebastian] Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res, Uppsala, Sweden; [Blackwell, Timothy] Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Uppsala University; University of Sussex,"Kohl, S (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res, Uppsala, Sweden.",sebastian.kohl@soc.uu.se,"Kohl, Sebastian/AAB-8908-2019","Kohl, Sebastian/0000-0002-8358-6021; Blackwell, Timothy/0000-0002-3086-8113",Economic and Social Research Council [1363771] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,71,34,35,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Key assumptions are the stationarity of the propensity score conditional on the proxy and an exclusion restriction that the proxy must satisfy with respect to the change in average outcomes over time conditional on the true treatment status. We propose a generalized method of moments estimator for the ATT and we show that the associated overidentification test can be used to test our key assumptions.

For a hotel system, to be integrated into the global market, there must be an informational and communicational system that will successfully link all elements, absorb all data, filter out useful information and deliver them to hotel management at the right time. Today's business is based on such networks where information is key to success. The hotel industry is the most relevant basis for the growth and development of tourism, due to the complexity and volume of business. Therefore, it is very important to monitor, harmonize and implement contemporary industry hotel standards, which can be compared with the success of a business. In order to achieve it, it is important to keep the track of where, how much and when to invest. Hotel management must be capable of being up to date with all the changes in the tourism market. The indicator, that is significant in this information and communication system, is the quality of business communication, especially among the hotel staff. The purpose of this paper is to point out the current level of business communication quality in the hotel system, without which the transfer of information would not have a value, and it would be useless. The aim of the research is to recognize the level of influence of informational and communicational trends on the level of development and quality of business communication of hotel employees.

Data Envelopment Analysis is applied on a sample of 86 Austrian biogas plants for the year 2014, covering about one third of the installed electric capacity of Austrian biogas plants. We decompose technical efficiency into scale efficiency and pure technical efficiency (managerial efficiency). In a second-stage regression analysis the effects of subsidies and other variables on managerial efficiency are investigated. The main results are: i) 34% of biogas plants in our sample are technically efficient, 40% are scale efficient and 50% are managerial efficient; ii) small biogas plants (<= 100 kW) are scale inefficient exhibiting increasing returns to scale; iii) production subsidies show a significant, negative relationship to managerial efficiency. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that production subsidies provide a disincentive to managerial effort of plant operators.","[Eder, Andreas; Mahlberg, Bernhard] Inst Ind Res, Mittersteig 10-4, A-1050 Vienna, Austria; [Eder, Andreas; Mahlberg, Bernhard] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Eder, A (通讯作者)，Inst Ind Res, Mittersteig 10-4, A-1050 Vienna, Austria.;Eder, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",Eder@iwi.ac.at; Mahlberg@iwi.ac.at,"Mahlberg, Bernhard/AAE-8996-2020","Mahlberg, Bernhard/0000-0002-0063-9264; Eder, Andreas/0000-0002-7371-7032",Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) [845422],Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG),"The authors would like to express their gratitude to James L.

I compile a German state-level data set, based on household surveys and information obtained from analyzing 35 newspapers. The data are used to separate media effects from real economic consequences, taking advantage of two sources of exogenous variation. First, I exploit the salience of milestones in the number of unemployed. The news value of these milestones, which is not based on economic fundamentals, causes the media to report more about unemployment than usually. Second, I show that the amount of reports decreases when competing newsworthy events occur at the time of the release of the monthly unemployment statistics. Instrumental variable estimates indicate that a one standard deviation increase in coverage accounts for about a quarter of the average monthly change in the index of economic perceptions.","[Garz, Marcel] Hamburg Media Sch, Finkenau 35, D-22081 Hamburg, Germany; [Garz, Marcel] Univ Hamburg, Finkenau 35, D-22081 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Garz, M (通讯作者)，Hamburg Media Sch, Finkenau 35, D-22081 Hamburg, Germany.;Garz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Finkenau 35, D-22081 Hamburg, Germany.",,,"Garz, Marcel/0000-0003-0722-4202",,,,,55,18,20,3,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

The aim of the article is to assess the impact of key macroeconomic factors on the size of lending to non-financial enterprises by monetary financial institutions in the euro area countries. The macroeconomic factors examined include GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, wage growth, inflation and the long-term interest rate according to the Maastricht criterion. The survey covers the euro area countries in 2008-2015, without Estonia and Latvia due to incomplete data for these countries for the above period.

Using quantitative descriptive method, this research primarily referred to the secondary data from 2011 - 2015. The result shows that rice commodity is only seeded in South Solok, corn commodity is seeded in South Solok and West Pasaman, and soybean commodity is seeded in all of disadvantaged districts in West Sumatera. It is revealed that Pajale commodities are not specialized and centered in disadvantaged districts. Rice commodity is a priority in Solok Selatan, corn commodity is a priority in Pasaman Barat, and soybean commodity is not a priority in any disadvantaged districts of West Sumatera. Thus, it is conclusive that Upsus Pajale program should be implemented to rice commodity in South Solok while corn commodity in West Pasaman.","[Juhandi, Dany; Sembiring, Albert] Politekn Wilmar Bisnis Indonesia, Hort Agribusiness, Deli Serdang, Indonesia; [Odang, Nilam Kemala] Alumnae Univ Gadjah Mada Accounting, Padang, Indonesia",,"Juhandi, D (通讯作者)，Politekn Wilmar Bisnis Indonesia, Hort Agribusiness, Deli Serdang, Indonesia.",dany.juhandi@wbi.ac.id; albert.sembiring@wbi.ac.id; nilamodang@gmail.com,"Juhandi, Dany/GLN-6283-2022; Odang, Nilam Kemala/GLN-7013-2022","Juhandi, Dany/0009-0001-2956-2707",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5401,,978-94-6252-619-8,AER ADV ENG RES,,,2018,172.0,,,,,,265,268,,,,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BP7HZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000562072800053,0

After a person died, it was usually enough to go to his/her house or office and find all these items. Some of them were valuable, others were not, but all of them constituted inheritance. Today, for the most part, these items are digitized and stored on computers, smartphones, flash drives, email accounts, clouds, social media etc. Most of us have a lot of these digital assets, but almost none of us think about what will happen to them after we die. There are several issues concerning digital inheritance: digital assets are intangible and for the most part, their holder's heirs will not be aware of them; many of them are password protected and heirs will not know log in information; they tend to be numerous and a lot of them hold no financial or emotional value. These problems could be solved if individuals made plans for what is to happen to their digital assets post mortem like they do for their tangible property. The obvious choice is to include digital assets in a will. However, there are certain particularities which have to be kept in mind when planning for digital inheritance. For example, wills are publicly pronounced after a person dies, so many people might be privy to sensitive and private information concerning deceased's digital assets. When it comes to digital assets stored in internet service providers' (ISP) accounts, making plans will not mean much, since ISP have rules prohibiting anyone, other than the original user, from accessing these accounts. This paper will deal with these challenges of digital inheritance and possible ways on how to best prepare for it.","[Klasicek, Dubravka] Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Law, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Klasicek, D (通讯作者)，Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Law, Osijek, Croatia.",dklasicek@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,0,0,1,5,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1050,1068,,,,,,19,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300058,0

This article examines which motives prevail in the decisions of Polish households in terms of saving. A sample of 223 working respondents was taken under consideration. Each of them represents a household from Lubelskie Voivodeship (Poland). The research proves that the precautionary motive has the highest ranking in respondents' opinions followed by the independence motive. The down payment motive was ranked lowest, closely followed by the enterprise motive. Additionally, analysis of correlation between motives was carried out. In most cases, there is a statistically significant correlation between saving motives. However, although the respondents rated saving motives highly, their impact on respondents' saving behaviour is lower than can be assumed.","[Korzeniowska, Anna Magdalena] Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Dept Banking, Fac Econ, Pl Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Korzeniowska, AM (通讯作者)，Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Dept Banking, Fac Econ, Pl Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland.",anna.korzeniowska@umcs.lublin.pl,"Korzeniowska, Anna M/C-7087-2013","Korzeniowska, Anna M/0000-0001-9809-5260",,,,,8,0,0,1,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,284,291,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800036,0

Through the visual dimension, the overall effect of vision is presented in our minds, and visual design is established based on visual perception. The visual cognition needs to have a certain order, and can be performed well through the design. In this process, visual communication is designed to make the vision more three-dimensional with more sense of design. The presentation and design of visual space is based on visual cognition and in-depth information. The way in which visual communication is generally presented is mainly through visual design of graphics, colors, and so on. With the development of network technology and the blending of new media forms, diversity in its visual communication has changed. Visual communication is made quickly and profoundly based on visual information. Through the expression of graphics, colors, and words, the forms of expression are varied and the methods of expression are different. Through the multi-faceted development of visual design, the visual space has a more meaningful meaning. In this process, the development of the information age is combined to enhance the development of the visual space and its research is of great significance.

The findings indicate that TL and structural empowerment positively affect individual creativity. The findings also indicate that structural empowerment partially mediates the relationship between TLs and individual creativity. The findings will contribute to transformational leadership, empowerment and creativity literature in a part of the world in which limited knowledge is available in this area. The results are valuable for Libyan' decision makers in HTIs so that they can enrich their agenda in designing programs to develop managers' leadership skills and enhance creative behaviors of their employees. The results of this research contribute to the literature on individual creativity in education management literature by enhancing the understanding of the influences of structural empowerment and transformational leadership on individual creativity among faculty members.

It is shown that the capitalization rate is a key indicator in modeling the estimated value of land, as the results of the assessment tend to show high sensitivity to it. It is proved that the rate of capitalization of rental income for land plots can vary not only in regard to the financial market conditions and the risks of economic activity that are relevant for region or country, but also even within a city territory, reflecting the spatial heterogeneity of the local risks of real estate investments, as well as natural and technogenic risks.","[Martyn, Andrii] Natl Univ Life & Environm Sci Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine; [Kolosiuk, Anatolii] Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine",National University of Life & Environmental Sciences of Ukraine; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture,"Martyn, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Life & Environm Sci Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine.",martyn@nubip.edu.ua; kolosukaa@gmail.com,"Martyn, Andrii/AAG-7099-2019","Martyn, Andrii/0000-0002-6905-2445",,,,,8,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,104,110,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300012,0

Western models include the so-called capitalist 'free' (efficient) market and professional peer regulation. The free market, justified by the 18th century observations of Adam Smith, has dominated government thinking in the last 40 years, and led to calls for deregulation in all market activities, including those controlled by professional regulation. However, a catastrophic failure of the banking system in 2007-08 has drawn attention to the importance of prioritising customer interests, including maximising their knowledge and understanding of goods and services being provided, and holding suppliers accountable for failures and outright fraud. All these important principles for efficient and fair markets are firmly embedded in the social contract that underpins the legitimacy of the professions. This is not, in itself, an argument for greater professionalization of market sectors, but rather an indication of the need for effective government regulation of the free market that emphasises the key features of the efficient market: accountability, transparency and recognition of 'externalities' that must be accounted for in any comprehensive and fair market system.","[May, S.

Mapping the evolution of maritime engagement up to the refugee crisis', it is revealed how the invocation of human rights serves paradoxically to curtail (migrants') human rights, justifying interdiction (to save lives'), and impeding access to safety in Europe. The result is a double reification of boat migrants' as threats to border security and as victims of smuggling/trafficking. Through a narrative of rescue', interdiction is laundered into an ethically sustainable strategy of border governance. Instead of being considered a problematic (potentially lethal) means of control, it is re-defined into a life-saving device. The ensuing rescue-through-interdiction'/rescue-without-protection' paradigm alters the nature of human rights, which, rather than functioning as a check on interdiction, end up co-opted as another securitization/humanitarianization tool.","[Moreno-Lax, Violeta] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Moreno-Lax, V (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Law, Law, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.;Moreno-Lax, V (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Law, Immigrat Law Programme, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",v.moreno-lax@qmul.ac.uk,"Moreno-Lax, Violeta/AAB-4604-2021","Moreno-Lax, Violeta/0000-0002-0042-7907",,,,,123,86,89,4,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We utilise original archival material to analyse the activities of the German public development bank, the Kreditantstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), in order to shed light on an important, but neglected aspect of German industrial policy. We analyse how the KfW responded to multiple challenges after the rise of economic globalisation, including a funding crisis, international agreements to limit export subsidies and Europeanisation. We argue that KfW successfully managed to navigate these challenges in order to retain, and even increase, its ability to conduct selective industrial policy in the post-1980s era. This was possible because of Germany's hard currency and low sovereign credit risk, large market size, which was augmented by membership in the European Union, and Germany's position as regional hegemon within Europe. More broadly, this shows how, conditional on domestic politics, advanced economies are able to shape and exploit the rules of the international economic system to implement industrial policies to their advantage, even as developing countries are given the opposite policy recommendations.","[Naqvi, Natalya] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London, England; [Henow, Anne; Chang, Ha-Joon] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Dev Studies, Cambridge, England; [Chang, Ha-Joon] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Naqvi, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London, England.",,,"naqvi, natalya/0000-0003-0821-070X",DAAD-University of Cambridge Research Hub for German Studies; German Federal Foreign Office (FFO),DAAD-University of Cambridge Research Hub for German Studies; German Federal Foreign Office (FFO),This work was partly funded by the DAAD-University of Cambridge Research Hub for German Studies with funds from the German Federal Foreign Office (FFO).,,150,29,30,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Fermentation was an alternative that can be done to improve the properties of starch polymers, such as viscosity, gelatinization, and rheology. The research were to characterize the physico-chemical and functional properties of fermented cassava flour by Lactobacillus casei using submerged and solid-state fermentation. The results showed that the whiteness degree of cassava flour fermented by Lactobacillus casei ranged from 98-100, higher than cassava flour without fermentation 97. Amylose content of cassava flour fermented using BAL in submerged culture (13.7%) higher than spontaneous fermentation in submerged culture (11.03%). Cassava flour fermented in submerged had WHC (326,7%) and OHC (710,3%) value higher than cassava flour in solid-state fermentation. Gelatinization temperature of fermented cassava flour was lower (69.7 degrees C) than cassava flour non-fermentation (70.4 degrees C). The viscosity of cassava flour fermented using BAL (5135 cP) had a peak value higher than the fermented cassava flour (4495 cP), with longer time (4.33 min) and lower temperature (72.55 degrees C).

Decisions on the future direction of a company eventually are translated into financial form and affect the financial health of company. Assessment and prediction of financial health is key to the company's management. Data sources for assessment of financial situation for internal users are not only financial statements but also various internal reports. However, to external users are available only published financial statements and annual reports, which are the resources of information for financial situation assessment as basis for decision making. The picture of the company's financial performance is supplemented by financial analysis indicators, which should be evaluated in their mutual contexts. Evaluation based on one indicator can lead to incorrect conclusions, so for this reason in this paper is investigated decomposition of the return on equity (ROE) to selected indicators. The aim of the paper is to quantify the impact of indicators, such as tax burden ratio, interest burden ratio, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin, asset turnover and financial leverage, on ROE development. In the paper are used statistical methods, specifically regression and correlation analysis, which were applied on the sample of the Slovak Republic engineering industry company's. By linear regression model were found out that to the development of ROE the most significant impact has tax burden indicator and asset turnover, while the equity multiplier has the least significant impact.","[Oriskoova, Denisa; Paksiova, Renata] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Oriskóová, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",denisaorisko@gmail.com; renata.paksiova@euba.sk,"Pakšiová, Renáta/AAA-2007-2019","Pakšiová, Renáta/0000-0002-3833-9339",Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA) [1/0512/16],Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA)(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This article is an output of the project of the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic and Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA) no. 1/0512/16 (2016-2018) Retention and Development of Business Property of Company as a Relevant Tool for Sustainable Development.,,18,1,1,0,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,479,486,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800061,0

According to a centuries-old recipe, it is prepared from 100% of sheep milk. Due to high local demand and relatively high prices, some farmers add cow milk as much as 20% or more to increase available quantities for sale. Farmers sell Travnik's sheep cheese at markets, and the farmer's association even exports this cheese to other countries. For the last 20 years there is a sale of Travnik's sheep cheese through large retail chains as product with declaration and enhanced inspection control. The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent farmers respect traditional production (100% sheep cheese), and to what extent they deviate from it. Our goal is also to determine whether the traditional cheeses produced by industrial production in the retail chains correspond to the declaration. In this research PCR-species specific DNA test was used to detect Travnik's sheep cheese (total n=60) adulteration with cow milk. From the farmer we provided 41 pieces of cheese (n=41), and from the store 19 (n=19). We have prepared our own standards for cheese mixing in a different ratio of sheep and cow milk. Multiplex PCR was performed using ovine and bovine 12S and 16S genes fragment in cheese. Our results show that only 46.34% of the farmers respect the traditional recipe, while 53.66% of them verbally declared cheese as pure sheep milk cheese, but they were a mixture of cow-sheep milk. In stores, 63.16% of the cheese packaging corresponds to the declaration, and 36.84% deviates (cheating).","[Pasic-Juhas, E.; Hodzic, A.; Hrkovic-Porobija, A.; Bozic, I] Univ Sarajevo, Vet Fac, Dept Chem Biochem & Physiol, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Czegledi, L.

The principal of this method consists in finding such states in which there is a high probability of changing the tertiary trend. These states are then used to generate buy and sell signals. The aim of this study is to compare the profitability of a business strategy using MCA with varying state space with the selected indicators of technical analysis. The indicators that are often recommended in traders articles, i.e. MACD, RSI and OBV, have been selected for this comparison. The basic success rate of individual methods is to overcome the profitability of the Buy & Hold (B&H) passive strategy, profitability of which is calculated as well. The study was performed using historical daily prices (open and close) of the CEZ's shares for a period of 12 years; from the beginning of 2006 until the end of 2017 (3 010 trading days). Based on the results of some selected technical indicators it can be stated that none of them outperforms the B&H strategy in the long term, while the models based on MCA are able to outperform the B&H strategy. If we include fees, the trading strategy using the MCA is unprofitable. Only trading based on the RSI would bring a positive appreciation and slightly outperform the B&H strategy.","[Rihova, Pavla; Svoboda, Milan] Univ West Bohemia Pilsen, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Ríhová, P (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia Pilsen, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",divisova@kem.zcu.cz; svobodm@kem.zcu.cz,"Svoboda, Milan/AAU-4541-2020",,"Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen [SGS-2018-042]","Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen","The research project was supported by Grant SGS-2018-042 of the Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen.",,11,0,0,2,10,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,591,598,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800076,0

The goals thus seem laudable to most, but the experience of introducing GMOs on the market shows that even though there might be agreement on the goals, the strategy of using biotechnology to achieve them can be ethically contested. We describe the intentions behind developing the new plants and analyse some of the ethical issues that the development and marketing of the gene-edited potatoes raise. We argue that the concepts of autonomy and fairness are useful tools to understand many of the conflicting ethical values in the discussions relating to gene-editing. From our perspective these concepts are interrelated and relevant in at least two ways: (1) fairness in terms of both financial power and labelling as a means to ensure equal opportunities to make an autonomous decision as an individual ethical consumer and (2) fairness in term of equal market power between autonomous market actors.","[Rocklinsberg, H.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Environm & Hlth, POB 7068, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Gjerris, M.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Copenhagen,"Röcklinsberg, H (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Environm & Hlth, POB 7068, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",helena.rocklinsberg@slu.se,,"Rocklinsberg, Helena/0000-0002-2821-6837",,,,,18,1,1,1,3,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,430,435,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_68,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000068,0

Principal component analysis is used to reduce the TRL instrument's 69 items to 18 dimensions within five lifestyle components. Based on multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, it is found that the instrument possesses metric, but not scalar (measurement) invariance across the 10 countries. Multilevel latent class analysis is used to classify participants to TRL segments and to classify the 10 countries into groups with similar segment structure. The final solution has six TEL segments and two country classes, which are profiled in terms of relevant background characteristics. Finally, a multivariate GLM analysis reveals that three behavioral tendencies of importance for transport-related environmental impacts vary significantly and substantially between lifestyle segments: vehicle ownership, everyday travel-mode choice and environmentally-friendly transport innovativeness. Further, when differences in transport related lifestyles are controlled, country (cluster) of residence as well as the interaction between lifestyle and country (cluster) of residence also influence these three behavioral tendencies. In conclusion, the usefulness of transport-related lifestyle segmentation as a tool for transport planners and campaigners is discussed.","[Thogersen, John] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Thogersen, J (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Management, Aarhus BSS, Fuglsangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",jbt@mgmt.au.dk,"Thøgersen, John/G-6253-2013","Thøgersen, John/0000-0003-0613-8062","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [613194]","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration(European Union (EU))","This research is part the large-scale project 'Sustainable Lifestyles 2.0: End User Integration, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (EU-InnovatE)'.

The two classes kept conformity as regards the teacher, the grammar coursebook and the period distribution. Pre-test showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two classes. After a one-term teaching experiment, however, post-test revealed a higher grammatical proficiency of the experimental class.

First, it highlights China's One Belt, One Road' (OBOR) initiative as a Eurasia-centred project that, distinct from the twentieth-century Eurasianism, aims to introduce a new comprehensive integrationist agenda to the Eurasian strategic landscape. Second, it compares the US-led Euro-Atlanticism and the emerging Eurasianism, holding that while the former has historically stressed security over development (development is seen as contingent on the establishment of a hard security regime), the latter prioritises development over security (security is viewed as contingent on the establishment of an inclusive economic regime). Thus, this research argues that, if implemented successfully, OBOR could challenge Euro-Atlanticism as the long-held normative paradigm of interstate relations by offering a systemic alternative.","[Yilmaz, Serafettin] Shandong Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Qingdao Campus,72 Binhai Rd, Qingdao 266237, Jimo, Peoples R China; [Liu Changming] Shandong Univ, Int Polit, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liu Changming] Shandong Univ, Dept Int Polit, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Shandong University; Shandong University,"Yilmaz, S (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Qingdao Campus,72 Binhai Rd, Qingdao 266237, Jimo, Peoples R China.",shifanyao@sdu.edu.cn; liucming@sdu.edu.cn,,"Yilmaz, Serafettin/0000-0001-8159-651X",International Postdoctoral Exchange Programme of Shandong University,International Postdoctoral Exchange Programme of Shandong University,This research was sponsored by the International Postdoctoral Exchange Programme of Shandong University.,,111,15,16,1,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2018,70.0,2,,,,,252,276,,10.1080/09668136.2018.1435777,0.0,,,25,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FY7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427053100005,0

By definition, this literature only focuses on duels. Yet, if we consider general games, i.e., with more than two agents, analyzing Hobbes's state of nature in terms of duel is not completely satisfactory, since it is a very specific interpretation of the war of all against all. Therefore, we propose a definition of the state of nature for games with an arbitrary number of players. We show that this definition coincides with the strategy profile considered as the state of nature in two-person games. Furthermore, we study what we call rational states of nature (that is, strategy profiles which are both states of nature and Nash equilibria). We show that in rational states of nature, the utility level of any agent is equal to his maximin payoff. We also show that rational states of nature always exist in inessential games. Finally, we prove the existence of states of nature in a class of (not necessarily inessential) symmetric games.","[Crettez, Bertrand] Univ Pantheon Assas, CRED, EA 7321, 21 Rue Valette, F-75005 Paris, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Crettez, B (通讯作者)，Univ Pantheon Assas, CRED, EA 7321, 21 Rue Valette, F-75005 Paris, France.",bertrand.crettez@u-paris2.fr,,"Crettez, Bertrand/0000-0001-5521-7926",,,,,32,0,1,2,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,DEC,2017,83.0,4,,,,,499,511,,10.1007/s11238-017-9626-8,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FN1BM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415718300003,0

In search of effective policy measures, it is often claimed that a clean banknote circulation helps the general public to more easily detect counterfeits. To examine this claim, we conducted an experimental study with 250 consumers and 261 cashiers in the Netherlands and Germany. Participants received 200 banknotes with either a high or a low average soil level. The banknote test sets contained 20 counterfeits to be detected by the participants. For the regression analysis we applied approaches used in the area of psychophysical science (signal detection theory). Our candidates identified more counterfeits when sorting clean banknotes. However, our analysis also showed that the cleanliness of banknotes does not actually help the person checking the banknote to more easily distinguish a counterfeit banknote from a genuine note. In fact, new and clean banknotes raised suspicion: they were more often declared as counterfeits - correctly or not.

Such studies may provide an incomplete picture of the development and possible resolution of mortgage problems. This paper uses the proprietary geo-coded version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics from 2009 through 2013 to implement a different type of probability model. Three transitional probability equations are estimated: the likelihood of homeowners developing mortgage payment problems, the likelihood that those who develop such problems move to resolve their problems, and the conditional probability that those who develop such problems and don't move will recover from them by other means. The coefficients from all three are combined to calculate the joint (state) probability of households having mortgage problems from which they will not recover. The analysis contains a number of unique results: changes in the mortgage front-end ratio are shown to have a substantial influence on both developing a mortgage problem and its resolution for those who do not move, 2) prior foreclosures are determined to affect the development of current mortgage problems, and 3) out-of-pocket medical expenses are found to influence both mortgage problem development and recovery. Also, the impact of policy actions are considered across several at-risk demographic groups. This experiment demonstrates that by improving the financial and mortgage characteristics, and the education level of households that actually develop mortgage problems, their predicted probability of developing mortgage problems that cannot be resolved could be reduced substantially.","[Boehm, Thomas P.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Finance, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Schlottmann, Alan M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Boehm, TP (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Finance, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",tboehm@utk.edu; alan.schlottmann@unlv.edu,,,"Finance Department at the University of Tennessee; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Finance Department at the University of Tennessee; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank the participants in our session of the American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association National Meetings in 2014 in Washington DC where an initial draft of this work was presented.

At the asset level, screening results in retail and office assets with higher acquisition values and located in primary markets, i.e., more transparent assets, being pledged as collateral. Further, I find evidence consistent with the role of lender monitoring for secured mortgage loans and show that properties located in closer proximity to a REIT's headquarters are more likely to be pledged as collateral for a mortgage.","[Letdin, Mariya] Florida State Univ, Dept Risk Management Insurance Real Estate & Lega, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Letdin, M (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Risk Management Insurance Real Estate & Lega, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",mletdin@fsu.edu,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We exploit the timing and location of these interventions in a difference-in-differences type design to investigate the effects of removing CPR (common-pool resources) institutions on biological welfare. We find a significant and persistent increase in infant mortality rates and a more modest decrease in birth rates as a result of state centralization. We provide evidence that these demographic changes reflect a critical loss of natural resource income caused by the disruption of communal institutions. Impacts are most severe in communities that have no prior experience with formal institutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

After changes in these spatial choices, people inevitably show a travel behavior that is different from the travel behavior before these relocations occurred. Therefore, spatial alterations provide interesting starting points for policies and other interventions aiming at travel behavior change, as habits and routines are broken or at least weakened, and individuals reconsider their behavior and consciously reflect their decisions. The life-oriented approach is utilized in order to examine the interrelationships of various life choices with respect to the development of the commuting behavior over time and over people's life courses. These analyses require corresponding longitudinal data, which was collected in the Zurich region, Switzerland, in a retrospective survey covering the 20 year period from 1985 to 2004. The results show that the different dimensions of the life course are highly interdependent. The changes in residence, education and employment are to a great extent related to one another, occurring simultaneously rather than successively. A strong connection is also observed between the ownership of mobility tools and their usage for commuting. This applies likewise to changes in occupation (encompassing both education and employment) and the most frequently used mode of transport for the commuting trips. Following a residential relocation, the mean distances to the places of occupation decline, indicating that moving is used as a mean to reduce commuting. In contrast, changes in education and employment lead to considerably longer commuting distances. Interestingly, persons altering their places of residence and occupation simultaneously have even lengthier commutes. The ownership of both cars and public transport tickets rises after all changes. Concurrent with this increase in mobility tool availability, the corresponding usage for commuting also expands overall. Private and public transport are in general more frequently used, while cycling and walking decline. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Simultaneously, new poles emerged in the international arena leading to growing competition for higher market shares. Therefore, trade competition is a critical dimension of analysis for applied international trade studies. We propose a conceptual framework for measuring this phenomenon by combining some critical previous contributions to build a multidimensional and more comprehensive concept, which defines trade competition as a function of the degree of both structural similarity and total exports overlap. Moreover, structural similarity should take into account three elements: sectoral shares similarity, inter-sectoral similarity (evaluating how different the distinct sectors are) and intra-sectoral similarity (proximity in terms of quality ranges exported). Several measures are proposed to empirically capture the concept suggested. Finally, we present an example including the exports of six European economies (Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Hungary and Sweden) to 124 destination markets (in 2007, 2011, 2015) in order to illustrate the application of the concept and measures suggested.","[Moreira, Sandrina] Dept Econ & Management, Setubal, Portugal; [Moreira, Sandrina] Inst Politecn Setubal ESCE IPS, BRU IUL Business Res Unit, Lisbon, Portugal; [Simoes, Nadia; Crespo, Nuno] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, BRU IUL Business Res Unit, ISCTE Business Sch Econ Dept, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Moreira, S (通讯作者)，Dept Econ & Management, Setubal, Portugal.;Moreira, S (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Setubal ESCE IPS, BRU IUL Business Res Unit, Lisbon, Portugal.",,"Moreira, Sandrina B/C-5584-2011; Crespo, Nuno/AAG-9679-2019; Simoes, Nadia/AAG-1389-2020","Moreira, Sandrina B/0000-0003-2124-8366; Crespo, Nuno/0000-0002-6546-6325; Simoes, Nadia/0000-0002-4334-4482",,,,,29,1,2,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2017,40.0,10,,,,,2301,2326,,10.1111/twec.12492,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FK2XT,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413347400012,0

Road safety can be greatly improved by focusing on the often-overlooked intersection between driver behaviour and the use of new technologies. This paper presents the extent to which Canadian drivers self-reported how they would adapt their behaviour if using limited self driving vehicles (LSDVs). An online survey and focus groups were conducted to explore the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and behaviours of Canadians in relation to AVs. It was found that many drivers believed they would not need to pay attention to the road environment when using LSDVs, and that some of them would modify or adapt their behaviour in negative ways that would undermine safety objectives. These results provide insight useful to shape educational strategies, government policies, and tactics to help ensure the safety benefits that are highly expected of AVs actually materialize.","[Robertson, Robyn A.; Meister, Shawna R.; Vanlaar, Ward G.

Adopting a micro-sociological approach, it explores the practice as played out in multi-cultural transient service encounters. Given the dearth of existing research and low visibility of service nepotism operating 'under the radar', the article assumes an exploratory qualitative research approach to capture it through 'microstoria': the sharing of stories by marginal actors, as recounted by West African migrants working in the UK. These stories reveal similarity-to-self cueing, non-verbal communication and the availability of discretionary authority as three salient logics in play. In a highly differentiated multi-ethnic society, service nepotism challenges a very specific customer-oriented bureaucratic ethos that demands impartiality. It also provides contexts for relatively powerless employees to rebalance their relationship with their organizations, thereby addressing a more pressing dysfunction within the market and society more generally.","[Sarpong, David] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Strategy & Int Business, Bristol, Avon, England; [Maclean, Mairi] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Int Business, Bath, Avon, England",University of West England; University of Bath,"Sarpong, D (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",David2.Sarpong@uwe.ac.uk,"Maclean, Mairi/I-7634-2019","Maclean, Mairi/0000-0001-9030-7492; Sarpong, David/0000-0002-1533-4332",,,,,84,13,14,2,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We show that neither holds in the presence of capacity costs typical in U.S. wholesale markets. Using an optimization model describing the short-term problem faced by an electricity retailer, we find hourly prices that optimally pass through capacity costs. We estimate benefits for a retailer using these prices as well as optimal configurations of a number of time-varying rate structures. Testing a range of realistic assumptions, we find that in the absence of a well-designed demand charge, passing through clearing prices may miss up to three quarters of the benefits possible from optimal hourly prices. By contrast, a simpler critical peak pricing structure enables retailers to achieve approximately two-thirds of the total possible benefits.","[Mays, Jacob; Klabjan, Diego] Northwestern Univ, Ind Engn & Management Sci, 2145 Sheridan Rd,Room C210, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Klabjan, Diego] Northwestern Univ, Master Sci Analyt Program, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Mays, J (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Ind Engn & Management Sci, 2145 Sheridan Rd,Room C210, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",jacobmays@u.northwestern.edu,"Klabjan, Diego/B-7469-2009","Mays, Jacob/0000-0003-4931-0387",,,,,40,7,8,1,8,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,SEP,2017,38.0,5,,,,,67,92,,10.5547/01956574.38.5.jmay,0.0,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FE2PY,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408059400004,0

Our aim is to understand the nature of the instability in financial intermediation in the euro area during the recent financial crises. We define large changes as significant departures in the actual evolution of balance sheet variables during the crisis from their historical association with the business and financial cycles. In the course of the global 2008-2009 financial crisis, such large changes were features of the behaviour of cross-border inter-bank flows, both within the euro area and between the euro area and the rest of the world. By contrast, retail assets and liabilities, as well as inter-bank flows among banks of the same country, did not significantly deviate from historical regularities. Since the euro area sovereign crisis of 2011-2012, large changes have been more pervasive. In particular, a significant home bias in the sovereign bond market has emerged.","[Colangelo, A.; Lenza, M.] European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Giannone, D.] Fed Reserve Bank New York, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Pill, H.] Goldman Sachs, 120 Fleet St, London EC2A 2BB, England; [Reichlin, L.] London Business Sch, Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England; [Giannone, D.; Reichlin, L.] CEPR, 33 Great Sutton St, London EC1V 0DX, England; [Colangelo, A.; Lenza, M.] ECARES Univ Libre Bruxelles, Av FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",European Central Bank; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; University of London; London Business School; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Lenza, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.;Lenza, M (通讯作者)，ECARES Univ Libre Bruxelles, Av FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",antonio.colangelo@ecb.europa.eu; domenico.giannone@ny.frb.gov; michele.lenza@ecb.europa.eu; lreichlin@london.edu,,,,,,,30,4,4,1,2,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Simulating seasons, we find consistency reduces the variability in season-ending performances and momentum increases them.

Centre for European Policy Studies Working Paper (127), 2006) and Gali (J Monet Econ 58:537-550, 2011) suggest an accuracy ranking for these forecasts, from employing central bank expectations yielding the highest forecast accuracy to conditioning on constant interest rates yielding the lowest. Yet, when investigating the predictive accuracy of the Bank of England's and the Banco Central do Brasil's forecasts for interest rates, inflation and output growth, we hardly find any significant differences between forecasts based on the different interest rate paths.

The results show that the contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) was gradually overtaking that of the factor inputs in this period and became the main driver of Chinese tourism output growth, with its corresponding contribution rate jumping from 48.56% in 2006 to 76.55% in 2012. Technological progress was the key to the escalation of such contribution, while technical efficiency, scale efficiency especially, had a relatively smaller, slipping contribution to the growth and the contribution of pure technical efficiency was negligible, sliding from 51.44% in 2006 to 23.45% in 2012. The drivers for tourism economy growth differed from region to region, with the middle and western regions growing faster than the eastern region. The rise in Central China was mainly driven by scale efficiency, while that in the western region was mostly fueled by pure technical efficiency that appears to manifest in two distinct phases: drive of factor input in 2005-2008 and TFP drive in 2008-2012. The tourism economy of China became increasingly intensive from 2006 to 2012, where the contribution of TFP surpassed that of factor inputs and the growth was ever more driven by TFP.","[Zha, Jianping; Li, Zhiyong] Sichuan Univ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Sichuan University,"Li, ZY (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Sch Tourism, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",sculzy@scu.edu.cn,,,Sichuan Province Science and Technology Plan Project [2014SZ0091]; Chongqing Social Science Planning Fund Program [2015QNJJ07]; China's Major University Research Project Funds from Sichuan University [SKQY201350],Sichuan Province Science and Technology Plan Project; Chongqing Social Science Planning Fund Program; China's Major University Research Project Funds from Sichuan University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was financially supported by a grant from the Sichuan Province Science and Technology Plan Project (No. 2014SZ0091), Chongqing Social Science Planning Fund Program (to Zhiyong Li) (No. 2015QNJJ07), and China's Major University Research Project Funds from Sichuan University (to Zhiyong Li; No. SKQY201350).",,71,15,15,6,103,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

It begins by framing CPE within Jessop and Sum's previous work on the Regulation Approach, in order to show why the former can only be understood as the result of a critical dialogue with the latter. Next, my reconstruction of the main elements of Sum and Jessop's CPE is presented. After having carefully examined its main assumptions and concepts, I criticise CPE's main novel element, an ontological cultural turn, due to the culturalist risks it engenders. In order to substantiate and exemplify that theoretical criticism, I review CPE's application to the analysis of the North Atlantic Financial Crisis. This article concludes by showing the main difficulties that CPE faces as an alternative for deepening C*PE and proposes the Amsterdam School of Transnational Historical Materialism as a more suitable direction in which that initiative could be advanced.","[Ignacio Staricco, Juan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Staricco, JI (通讯作者)，Francisco Vidal 7043, RA-5147 Cordoba, Argentina.",staricco.juan@gmail.com,,"Staricco, Juan Ignacio/0000-0001-5056-9850",,,,,42,11,11,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We examine the volatility implications of equity Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) stock returns over the sample period from January 1985 through October 2012. We find a negative leverage effect in the pre- and post-Greenspan era, but not during the Greenspan era (circa 1994-2006). We argue that the positive elasticity of variance with respect to the value of equity during the Greenspan era can be explained by a decline in the spread between the yield on commercial mortgages and 10-year Treasuries, which triggered a wealth transfer from REIT equity holders to REIT debt holders. We also argue that the declining commercial-mortgage-10-year-Treasury yield spread during the Greenspan era allowed REITs to take on far more risk than most people realized.

We show that when time series with changes in persistence are analyzed in a regression framework with other persistent time series like interest rates, spurious regressions are likely to occur. We propose the coefficient of determination R-2 as a simple test statistic to distinguish between spurious and genuine regressions in situations where time series possibly exhibit changes in persistence. We extend the analysis towards fractional (co-) integration as well. To this end, we establish the limit theory for the R-2 statistic and conduct a Monte Carlo study where we investigate its finite-sample properties. The test performs remarkably well in terms of size and power and is robust to level shifts and multiple changes in persistence. Finally, we apply the test to the Fisher equation for the United States. The newly proposed R-2-based test offers robust evidence favourable to the Fisher hypothesis.","[Kruse, Robinson] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Dept Econ & Business, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Kruse, Robinson] Hendyplan, Uitbreidingstr 84-3, B-2600 Berchem, Belgium; [Ventosa-Santaularia, Daniel] CIDE, Carretera Mexico Toluca 3655, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico; [Noriega, Antonio E.] Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Emis, Legaria 691, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Noriega, Antonio E.] Univ Guanajuato, Dept Econ & Finance, Cerro El Establo S-N, Guanajuato, Gto, Mexico",Aarhus University; CREATES; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Moreover, the properties of various estimators of such models are well known. However, we show that these estimators break down when the data are irregularly spaced along the time dimension. Unfortunately, this is an increasingly frequent occurrence as many longitudinal surveys are collected at non-uniform intervals and no solution is currently available when time-varying covariates are included in the model. In this paper, we propose two new estimators for dynamic panel data models when data are irregularly spaced and compare their finite-sample performance to the naive application of existing estimators. We illustrate the practical importance of this issue in an application concerning early childhood development.

The data are from a survey conducted by the Bank of Italy on international tourism. Both zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions are estimated. In general, the estimates from ZTNB and OLS regressions are similar. The results suggest that age, returning directly to the country of residence and the summer season have a positive influence on the length of stay. On the other hand, international tourist expenditure and visiting other places than Venice have a negative impact on the length of stay. Moreover, the average length of overnight stays differs among nationalities and those who have visited Venice previously tend, on average, to stay longer. One finding is that visitors from North America and Australia stay longer and spend more than visitors coming from neighbouring countries.","[Mortazavi, Reza; Cialani, Catia] Dalarna Univ, Falun, Sweden",Dalarna University,"Mortazavi, R (通讯作者)，Dalarna Univ, Sch Technol & Business Studies, S-79188 Falun, Sweden.",rem@du.se,,"Mortazavi, Reza/0000-0001-8599-7185",,,,,24,14,14,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

There is a long tradition of using cycling as a mode of transportation among the Danish public and this is widespread across people with different socio-demographic characteristics. Copenhagen has an extensive network of cycling facilities and is often used as a role model for other large cities when developing cycling facilities. This setting provides a unique basis for investigating bicycle commuters' preferences for route characteristics and crowding in particular, which is not studied before, but likely to become an issue around the world's cities with increases in number of bicyclists. The study is based on a choice experiment of 3891 active cyclists in Copenhagen. The investigated attributes are cycle track, crowding, stops, environment/road type, green surroundings, and travel distance which is used as a payment vehicle to gain more desirable route characteristics. On average people state that they are willing to cycle 1.84 km longer if the route has a designated cycle track, and 0.8 km more if there are green surroundings too. Stops and crowding, based on number of cyclists on the route, have significant negative impacts on people's utility of a given route. People were willing to cycle one kilometre longer to avoid high levels of crowding and approximately 1.3 km longer to avoid routes with many stops. The most attractive road environment is a segregated path only for cyclists closely followed by shopping street. Looking into heterogeneity, we find that people who own a car have less disutility of cycling additional distance. The results may support future decision making when creating new infrastructure for cycling in cities by addressing the perceived importance of facilities and crowding in a population where commute cycling is very widespread.

We also discuss a more complicated case in which constant rebalanced portfolios are considered as expert advice, and obtain a corresponding portfolio selection strategy WAAC. The theoretical result shows that the cumulative gain that WAAC achieves is as large as that of the best constant rebalanced portfolio.

A distinguished feature of our model is that the random terms in the utility functions are correlated over time and jobs (habit or job persistence). Past options and not only the past optimal choices matter for the current choices. Given observed incentives and institutional constraints on offered hours, we find that nurses are mobile when they are young (less mobility than among physicians), but there is also a weak tendency of higher mobility again when they are approaching retirement age. Wage increases have a modest impact on labor supply. The overall elasticity for nurses is close to zero. These low elasticities shadow for stronger responses, shifting labor away from part-time jobs in the public and private sector toward full-time jobs in the private sector. A change in taxation away from the progressive tax system toward a flat tax of 28 % gives registered nurses a very modest incentive to shift their job to private hospitals. For physicians, the impact is stronger.","[Andreassen, Leif] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway; [Di Tommaso, Maria Laura] Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Lungo Dora Siena 100, I-10153 Turin, Italy; [Di Tommaso, Maria Laura] Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy; [Di Tommaso, Maria Laura; Strom, Steinar] Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway; University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Strom, S (通讯作者)，Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway.",steinar.strom@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,17,6,7,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

All normative theories of democracy share the conviction that it is imperative that democracies include long-term immigrant residents into the demos - either by granting citizenship or by introducing alien voting rights. But even the 20 most established and stable democracies within the EU are far from fully realizing the ideal of universal suffrage'. This is true independently of whether we count in- and excluded people in numerical terms, or whether we evaluate the relevant laws and regulations. Therefore, we diagnose a substantial democratic deficit on the level of European nation-states. By requiring its member states to enfranchise non-national EU citizens on the local level, the EU, for once, plays a positive role in reducing one of the most fundamental democratic deficits in times of migration.","[Blatter, Joachim] Univ Lucerne, Luzern, Switzerland; [Schmid, Samuel D.] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Blaettler, Andrea C.] Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Lucerne; European University Institute; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Blatter, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lucerne, Luzern, Switzerland.",joachim.blatter@unilu.ch,"Schmid, Samuel David/AAG-1261-2020","Schmid, Samuel David/0000-0003-1105-3071; Blatter, Joachim/0000-0002-2921-2619",,,,,56,21,22,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

One strategy used by transit agencies to reduce passenger activity time, and accordingly travel times, is the implementation of all-door boarding- a service allowing transit users to board and alight vehicles through any door. The present study uses data collected in Montreal, Canada, to assess the impacts of an all-door boarding pilot project from two points of view: (1) operationally through passenger activity time, and (2) by assessing passenger satisfaction. Operationally, the results reveal that when compared to a similar bus route that does not allow all-door boarding, the all-door boarding strategy shows a savings of five percent in passenger activity time at regular stops, while time savings at high passenger activity stops such as metro stations experienced time savings of around 19 percent. Thus, savings are maximized at stops with high passenger demand. Additionally, with regard to user perceptions, the results reveal that passengers who use the all-door boarding service are more satisfied with bus service, particularly with on time performance. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that all-door boarding is an effective strategy to improve the quality of service due to the associated time savings and increased customer satisfaction. Finally, the study offers important recommendations to transit planners and policy makers to effectively implement and maximize the benefits of an all-door boarding policy based on statistical analysis and on-site observations.

These models imply that increases in output are translated into proportional increases in labour, indicating constant labour productivity. In non-linear input-output (NLIO) models, final demand changes lead to substitution. This causes changes in labour productivity, even though one unit of labour ceteris paribus still produces the same output. Final demand changes can, however, also lead to employees working longer, harder and/or more efficiently. The goal of this article is to include this type of 'real' labour productivity change into an NLIO model. To do this, the authors introduce factor augmenting technical change (FATC) and a differentiation between core and peripheral labour. An NLIO model with and without FATC is used to calculate the regional economic impacts of a 10% final demand increase in tourism in the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands. Accounting for real productivity changes leads to smaller increase in the use of labour, as productivity increases allow output to be produced using fewer inputs.","[Klijs, Jeroen] NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, Breda, Netherlands; [Klijs, Jeroen; Peerlings, Jack; Heijman, Wim] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands",Breda University of Applied Sciences; Wageningen University & Research,"Klijs, J (通讯作者)，NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, Acad Tourism, Mgr Hopmanstr 1, NL-4817 JT Breda, Netherlands.",klijs.j@nhtv.nl,"Peerlings, Jack/C-8473-2015",,,,,,80,5,5,2,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This article contributes to the literature on institutional development through an in-depth case-study of the conditions under which the competence over the negotiation of agreements on foreign direct investment (FDI) was transferred from the national level to the European Union (EU) in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty. Most analysts assume that this competence shift was a rationally designed delegation, intended to maximize European bargaining power in international investment negotiations and conceived as an important element of a teleological drive to make the EU a meaningful external actor. This article tells a different story - one where the competence shift happened by stealth as a result of a combination of neo-functionalist Commission entrepreneurship and historical accident, against the preferences of the Member States.

The monopolist and a set of consumers communicate to form their beliefs about the underlying product quality. Since the firm's associated optimization problem can be analytically solved only under specific assumptions, we rely on the sequential quadratic programming computational approach to characterize the equilibrium. When consumers' initial beliefs are uniform, the firm's optimal influence strategy always involves targeting the most influential consumer. For the case of non-uniform initial beliefs, the monopolist might target the less influential consumer if the latter's initial opinion is low enough. The probability of investing more in the consumer with the lower influence increases with the distance between consumers' initial beliefs and with the degree of trust attributed on consumers by the firm. The firm's profit is minimized when consumers' influences become equal, implying that the firm benefits from the presence of consumers with divergent strategic locations in the network. In the absence of a binding constraint on total investment, the monopolist's incentives to manipulate the network decrease with consumers' initial beliefs and might either increase or decrease with the trust put in consumers' opinion by the firm. Finally, the firm's strategic motivation to communicate persistently high beliefs during the opinion formation process is positively associated with the market size, with the available budget and with the direct influence of the most influential consumer on the other but negatively associated with consumers' initial valuation of the good.","[Bilanakos, Christos; Sotiropoulos, Dionisios N.; Georgoula, Ifigeneia; Giaglis, George M.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Sotiropoulos, DN (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Athens, Greece.",xmpilan@aueb.gr; dsotirop@gmail.com; ifgeorgoula@aueb.gr; giaglis@aueb.gr,"Giaglis, George M/B-9705-2011; Sotiropoulos, Dionisios/AAR-1365-2021",,"European Union (European Social Fund-ESF); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: Aristeia, SocioMine","European Union (European Social Fund-ESF)(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: Aristeia, SocioMine","This research has been co-financed by the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: Aristeia, SocioMine.",,29,3,3,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The results indicate that few of the marquee signings drove higher attendance. Furthermore, these attendance effects tend to diminish over time. Specifically, only Beckham, Blanco, and Marquez generated excess fans in the games they played, with the largest effect in their first year.

Height differences estimated from skeletal remains, reflecting living standards during childhood and adolescence, are probably too small if social status is inferred based on grave goods which are associated with the individuals' social status at the time of their death. The higher the level of social mobility, the more distinguished individuals will not have had a privileged childhood and, therefore, have the biological characteristics of the disadvantaged group. In a newly assembled sample of individual level anthropometric data from 26 early medieval row grave cemeteries in south-western Germany, men buried with a long sword in their grave were on average about 3 cm taller than the others. In a simple model of the mechanics of the social-mobility bias, this height difference, together with parameters from the literature, implies a level of social mobility typical of small-scale agricultural or pastoral societies.","[Meinzer, Nicholas J.] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Meinzer, NJ (通讯作者)，Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.",nicholas.meinzer@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,79,1,1,0,7,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

Congestion is expected to form at bottlenecks such as escalator and staircase entrances with high rate of passenger flow, which could decrease walking efficiency and passenger comfort. Currently, no special treatment is adopted in most of the conventional bottlenecks in subway stations. This study conducts a series of pedestrian experiments to investigate the effectiveness of adding a funnel shape buffer zone in front of the bottleneck entrance. Different angles of funnel bottleneck are experimented under different pedestrian volumes. By analyzing factors including walking speed, individual passing time, total passing time, and time gap, it is found that funnel shape would overall improve the traffic effectiveness of the bottlenecks, especially when the flow rate is high. The recommendation of setting funnel angle depends on passenger flow level, the optimal of which should be between 46 degrees and 65 degrees. This study provides a rationale for agencies to improve the current pedestrian traffic efficiency at bottlenecks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, differences in time zones add significantly to the costs of service transactions. Decomposing the impact of distance into a longitudinal and latitudinal component and accounting for differences in time zones, it is possible to identify in detail the factors driving the impact of increasing coordination costs on the delivery of services through foreign affiliates. Working with a bilateral US data set on foreign affiliate sales in services this paper examines the impact of time zone differences and east-west and north-south distance on US outward affiliate sales, by employing a Hausman-Taylor model for services trade by foreign affiliates. Both distance components as well as time zone differences have a significant positive effect on foreign affiliate sales. By decomposing the effect of distance the results show that increasing east-west or north-south distance by 100km raises affiliates sales by 2 per cent. Regarding time zone differences, the findings suggest that affiliate sales increase as hourly time zone differences get larger.","[Christen, Elisabeth] Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria",,"Christen, E (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria.",,,"Christen, Elisabeth/0000-0002-4538-0671",,,,,33,15,16,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2017,40.0,3,,,SI,,612,631,,10.1111/twec.12326,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EP6OZ,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397500100008,0

I consider a model where firms are able to invest in innovation in order to increase their productivity, or knowledge capital. This investment is a costly and uncertain enterprise. As the capacity to obtain external funds is diminished, resources allocated to this effort will be reduced due to different mechanisms at work. First, the return of this investment in the case of success may be diminished by the inability to quickly increase production capacity if the credit necessary to do so is scarce (i.e., if entrepreneurs cannot rent the optimal level of physical capital). Second, financial constraints reduce profits obtained by entrepreneurs and therefore the amount of assets they are able to accumulate in every period. Finally, financially underdeveloped economies will be characterized by a lower average ability of entrepreneurs. This is due to the lower equilibrium wage in the economy, which results in a larger mass of individuals opting to set up firms. In the margin, these individuals tend to have lower ability to manage a firm and relatively low prospects of generating firm productivity growth through innovation.","[Lopez-Martin, Bernabe] Banco Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Bank of Mexico,"Lopez-Martin, B (通讯作者)，Banco Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",lopez@banxico.org.mx,,,University of Minnesota Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship,University of Minnesota Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship(University of Minnesota System),"In this note I present a relatively stylized version of the equilibrium model of this project.

We show that the SCC is a serial dictatorship a la Eraslan and McLennan (J Econ Theory 117:29-54, 2004) and that a serial dictatorship can include invisible serial dictators a la Kirman and Sondermann (J Econ Theory 5:267-277, 1972).","[Takayama, Shino; Yokotani, Akira] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Takayama, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",s.takayama1@uq.edu.au,,"Takayama, Shino/0000-0002-1295-7040",,,,,40,8,8,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2017,48.0,3,,,,,573,598,,10.1007/s00355-017-1025-0,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EQ4ZE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398089400005,0

However, increasing tourists' flows affect local economies and lives of local residents in a number of ways, not excluding negative effects. Careful consideration of benefits and pitfalls of the development of city tourism is necessary in order to sustain balanced urban development. In the present article, we evaluate experience of tourism development in 10 German cities-capitals of German cultural tourism. Our analysis is focused on the effect of city tourism on the well-being of urban residents. To address this issue, we study the effect of tourists' nights spent in the centers of cultural tourism on the satisfaction with life of urban residents. Based on the results of the study, we suggest policy implications for the development of urban tourism that leads to improvements of the quality of life of locals.","[Tokarchuk, Oksana; Maurer, Oswin] Free Univ Bolzano, Bolzano, BZ, Italy; [Gabriele, Roberto] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Trento,"Tokarchuk, O (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Piazza Univ 1, Bolzano, BZ, Italy.",oksana.tokarchuk@unibz.it,"Maurer, Oswin/HQZ-1558-2023; Tokarchuk, Oksana/AAJ-3468-2021; Maurer, Oswin/AAK-6081-2020; Gabriele, Roberto/AAY-2080-2021","Maurer, Oswin/0000-0003-3728-0598; Tokarchuk, Oksana/0000-0001-7602-9780; Maurer, Oswin/0000-0003-3728-0598;",Free University of Bolzano project 'The impact of tourism on quality of life of German residents',Free University of Bolzano project 'The impact of tourism on quality of life of German residents',This research was supported by the Free University of Bolzano project 'The impact of tourism on quality of life of German residents'.,,43,22,23,12,96,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In forecasts produced since the early 1990 s, road and air traffic growth rates have generally been overpredicted. Aggregate railway growth has been fairly accurate, but commercial long-distance railway growth has been overpredicted, and the growth of subsidized intra-regional railway travel has been underpredicted (following vast unanticipated supply increases). Focusing on car traffic forecasts, we show that a very large share of forecast errors can be explained by input variables turning out to be different than what was assumed in the forecasts. Even the original forecasts are much closer to actual outcomes than simple trendlines would have been, and once the input assumptions are corrected, the forecasts vastly outperform simple trendlines. The potential problems of using cross-sectional models for forecasting intertemporal changes thus seem to be limited. This tentative conclusion is also supported by the finding that elasticities from the cross-sectional models are consistent with those from a time-series model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Through employing Hardy and Thomas's taxonomy of objects, practice, bodies and space, we develop a fuller understanding of how the symbolic and material are fundamentally entwined within dirty work, and suggest that a neglect of the latter might foster a false optimism regarding worker experiences.","[Hughes, Jason] Univ Leicester, Head Sociol, Leicester, Leics, England; [Simpson, Ruth; Slutskaya, Natasha] Brunel Univ, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Simpson, Alex] Univ Brighton, Sch Appl Social Sci, Criminol, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Hughes, Kahryn] Univ Leeds, Sociol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leicester; Brunel University; University of Brighton; University of Leeds,"Hughes, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Sociol, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",jason.hughes@le.ac.uk,,"Simpson, Alex/0000-0003-2654-7058",,,,,33,46,48,4,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The article explains his conception of money. A variation in its quantity has an impact not only on prices, but also on the real economy, favourable when this issue is slow and moderate, but negative, on the other hand, when it is fast and large-scale.

Due to the necessity to have the halal certificate, there has been a tendency among some applicants resort to hiring consultants to help them apply the halal certificate online. Rather than facilitating the process of applying halal certificate, the online application seem to slow down the progress of their business, which gives impact to growth of the halal industry. Hence, there is an need to have a nuanced understanding of the factors that facilitate the use MYeHalal to suggest ways to facilitate the use of the online system. This paper initiates a discussion of this issue by proposing a conceptual model framed by Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to understand the interplay between the social and the technical actors in the application process using MYeHalal system.

We describe fertility trends immediately before and after the fall of state socialism across 19 Central and Eastern European and Central Asian countries. We found a few common patterns that may reflect economic and political developments. The countries that experienced the most successful transitions and integration into the EU experienced marked postponement of parenthood and a moderate decline in second and third births. Little economic change in the poorest transition countries was accompanied by less dramatic changes in childbearing behavior. In western post-Soviet contexts, and somewhat in Bulgaria and Romania, women became more likely to only have one child but parenthood was not substantially postponed. This unique demographic pattern seems to reflect an unwavering commitment to parenthood but economic conditions and opportunities that did not support having more than one child. In addition, we identify countries that would provide fruitful case studies because they do not fit general patterns.","[Billingsley, Sunnee] Stockholm Univ, Dept Sociol, Demog Unit, Linnaeus Ctr Social Policy & Family Dynam Europe, Stockholm, Sweden; [Billingsley, Sunnee; Duntava, Aija] Sodertorn Univ, Stockholm Ctr Hlth Soc Transit SCOHOST, Huddinge, Sweden; [Duntava, Aija] Uppsala Univ, Dept Sociol, Uppsala, Sweden",Stockholm University; Sodertorn University; Uppsala University,"Billingsley, S (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Sociol, Demog Unit, Linnaeus Ctr Social Policy & Family Dynam Europe, Stockholm, Sweden.;Billingsley, S (通讯作者)，Sodertorn Univ, Stockholm Ctr Hlth Soc Transit SCOHOST, Huddinge, Sweden.",sunnee.billingsley@sociology.su.se,,,Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet) via the Linnaeus Center for Social Policy and Family Dynamics in Europe (SPaDE) [349-2007-8701],Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet) via the Linnaeus Center for Social Policy and Family Dynamics in Europe (SPaDE),This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet) via the Linnaeus Center for Social Policy and Family Dynamics in Europe (SPaDE) [grant registration number 349-2007-8701].,,63,8,10,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Why do some states with surpluses choose to create sovereign wealth funds, while others advocate private finance institutions instead? This article speaks directly to this question by investigating the variation in sovereign wealth fund choices across nations with excess reserves. Thereby it contributes to an emerging stream of social network analysis within the international political economy literature. It develops an argument in least likely cases (i.e. Hong Kong and Singapore) about how the structure of domestic state-society relations - in form of policy networks - explains variation in sovereign wealth fund choices, which benefits some actors over others. By analysing primary archival material and through interviews with former policy-makers, this article opens the black box of policy-making behind the choices of state finance institutions.","[Braunstein, Juergen] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Braunstein, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Kennedy Sch, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Juergen_Braunstein@hks.harvard.edu,,"Braunstein, Juergen/0000-0002-7692-2648",,,,,69,11,11,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We articulate a framework for understanding this performance mismatch that emphasizes two types of borrowers: those with stable equity positions who perceive they are facing moderate or temporary liquidity shocks, and those facing severe financial stress in combination with negative equity. The former have an incentive to enter mismatch and subsequently cure, while the latter would default on both contracts.

Two distinct paradigmatic positions have surfaced. One champions economic, cultural, and political globalization conducted under the leadership of the Western world. The other advocates a more particularistic approach that fends for a balance of interests, multiplicity of politico-cultural forms and multiple centers of international influence. The latter doctrine, often referred to as the multipolar world theory, is the subject of this paper. The discussion argues that the idea of a multipolar world order has emerged as Russia's main ethical and ideological position advanced in the international arena. Its philosophical tenets buttress Russian society intellectually at home, providing the expedients to pursue the country's foreign policy goals abroad. The paper examines a substantial value package with roots in both Russian and Western philosophy that sustains the multipolar world order theory.","[Chebankova, Elena] Univ Lincoln, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Lincoln, England",University of Lincoln,"Chebankova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lincoln, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Lincoln, England.",echebankova@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,,95,19,21,4,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Two emerging challenges faced by rural communities today are cost control and equity due to the increasing demand and limited operations resources available and the need to deal with the inevitable tradeoffs among multiple objectives and criteria. In this paper, we develop a new methodology for rural transportation management which takes into consideration of both the equity and cost factors under multiple objectives. We conceptualize and define equity in rural transportation management with the development of new performance measures and an analytical model for decision making with multiple desirable and undesirable objectives. We also develop a heuristic procedure based on data envelopment analysis for characterizing and analyzing the route design choices on the frontier between costs and multi-objective measures of equity. A GIS-based decision support system is constructed to process the extensive data required in our analysis. The new methodology has been successfully implemented by Quinte Access, a not-for-profit organization in a rural community in Ontario, to help redesign bus routes with significant quantitative benefits observed in multiple performance dimensions. It is also expected that the new knowledge, insights, and decision support tools developed through this study for transportation planning, big data management, and transportation service operations can be transferred to other rural communities in order to deliver more sustainable transportation services in rural regions around the world.

This essay shows that the threat of rebellion' alone cannot explain Chinese party-state policies to extend public goods to rural residents in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Drawing on theories of policy making, it argues that China's one-party regime extended public goods to the rural population under the influence of ideas and policy options generated by policy communities of officials, researchers, international organisations and other actors. The party-state centre adopted and implemented these ideas and policy options when they provided solutions to external shocks and supported economic development goals. Explanations of policies and their outcomes in authoritarian political systems need to include not only dictators' but also other actors, and the ideas they generate.","[Duckett, Jane] Sch Social & Polit Sci, Polit, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8RT, Lanark, Scotland; [Wang, Guohui] Cent Compilat & Translat Bur, Ctr Comparat Polit & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Glasgow,"Duckett, J (通讯作者)，Sch Social & Polit Sci, Polit, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8RT, Lanark, Scotland.",jane.duckett@glasgow.ac.uk; wangguohui2003@msn.com,"Wang, Guohui/G-8935-2015","Duckett, Jane/0000-0002-5401-5350","United Kingdom's Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J012629/1, ES/J012688/1]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M581136]; ESRC [ES/J012688/1, ES/J012629/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J012688/1, ES/J012629/1] Funding Source: researchfish",United Kingdom's Economic and Social Research Council; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Research for this essay was supported by the United Kingdom's Economic and Social Research Council (ES/J012629/1 and ES/J012688/1) and by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2015M581136).

This fact is very often criticized by both politicians and experts. A proposal of halting the rise in retirement age in 2030 at the threshold 65 years is discussed in the Parliament this year. The main reason for increasing the retirement age in the Czech Republic since 1995 was to eliminate the consequences of population ageing for increasing financial burden of the pension system. Because of this permanent increase the proportion of population size in retirement age and population size in productive age (old age dependency ratio) would be not so rapidly growing after 2040 when numerous generations born in the 70th will retire. The paper presents computations of the old-age dependency ratio in the Czech Republic for various variants of development of fertility, mortality, migration and retirement age in the case of the Czech Republic and for each variant also the retirement age threshold (changing in time) which would guarantee stabilization of the old-age dependency at its present time value.","[Fiala, Tomas; Langhamrova, Jitka] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Fiala, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",fiala@vse.cz; langhamj@vse.cz,"Langhamrová, Jitka/Z-2115-2019",,Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [GA CR 15-13283S],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),This article was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic No. GA CR 15-13283S under the title Projection of the Czech Republic Population According to Educational Level and Marital Status.,,11,0,0,0,7,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",2453-9902,,978-83-7695-693-0,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2017,,,,,,,117,132,,10.15611/amse.2017.20.09,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BP1SD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540714200009,0

In pre-crisis years, potential output estimates promoted the build-up of private debt, housing bubbles and macroeconomic imbalances. After the financial crisis, these model estimates were revised downwards, which increased fiscal consolidation pressures. By focusing on the euro area's economies during 1999-2014, we show how the model's estimates influence actual economic outcomes. We identify two major economic impacts of the potential output model. First, the political implications of the model led to pro-cyclical feedback loops, reinforcing prevailing economic developments. Second, the model has contributed to national lock-ins on path dependent debt trajectories, fueling 'structural polarization' between core and periphery countries.","[Heimberger, Philipp; Kapeller, Jakob] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Comprehens Anal Econ, Linz, Austria; [Kapeller, Jakob] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Linz, Austria; [Heimberger, Philipp] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Vienna, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz; Johannes Kepler University Linz; Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Heimberger, P (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Comprehens Anal Econ, Linz, Austria.;Heimberger, P (通讯作者)，Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Vienna, Austria.",heimberger@wiiw.ac.at,"Kapeller, Jakob/AAP-1109-2020","Heimberger, Philipp/0000-0001-9874-7345",Institute for New Economic Thinking [INO1500015],Institute for New Economic Thinking,The Institute for New Economic Thinking [grant number INO1500015].,,79,32,32,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Unfortunately, the rights in education of the every person in society may be delayed due to financial problems, physical disabilities, time pressure, geographical distances or any other reasons. Distance learning is a one of the method that provides education for people by eliminating these disadvantages. Since end of the 19th century, distance education has been provided with some methods such as TV, radio, mail and etc. Especially, in the beginning of 21th century; internet is widely used by everybody. New technological environment has brought a new opportunity for distance education. Learning Management System (LMS) is the most important actor of the internet based distance learning that brings together educators and students for training. LMS allows to deliver materials, having assignment and quizzes and other educational activities. Whether educational institutions or organizations that are emphasis on the training of employees can use LMS platform. Every organization has to decide which LMS is suitable for them. Decision makers face to solve this kind of problems because every LMS has different characteristics and different learning process. This study is focused on choosing suitable LMS for organizations by using AHP methods. Two groups of LMS, open source software's (Moodle and Sakai) and commercial software's (BlackBoard and Sharepoint LMS), are compared by using selecting criteria's. These criteria's are license costs, flexibility, security, user interface and prevalence of use. In the decision process, different weight ratios are used depending on their priority.

It can be shown that such an approach induces a spectral density function with concentration of mass around a value (a frequency) related to a complex root. The resulting stochastic process is often referred to as a stochastic cycle model. However, there exists an alternative approach where business cycles are generated by time-varying mean which is driven by a deterministic function (a deterministic cycle approach). It is often claimed that the deterministic cycle is not sufficient for description of actual economic fluctuations due to its inflexibility. However, it is not clear that it is true for short series of data available for e.g. the emerging economies.

From a trade perspective, one of the most important aspects of such regulatory measures is their potential distortionary effect, as their cost of compliance is often asymmetrical across countries. This paper investigates the effect of the European Union's sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures on the exports from low income countries. This study finds that SPS measures result in relatively higher burden for low income countries but that membership in deep trade agreements seems to reduce the difficulties related to compliance with SPS measures. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that while many middle and high income countries have the internal capacity to comply with SPS measures, most low income countries do not.","[Murina, Marina; Nicita, Alessandro] UNCTAD, Div Int Trade Goods & Serv & Commod, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Murina, M (通讯作者)，UNCTAD, Div Int Trade Goods & Serv & Commod, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,18,22,24,3,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2017,40.0,1,,,,,168,181,,10.1111/twec.12368,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EK5CJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393944200008,0

Taking into consideration of the definition of Willingness to pay a price Premium which says it is the highest price level consumers are willing to pay to buy a good or service, it can be said that it is a situation that can be achieved by the positive comparison of the value that consumers will get against the cost elements they will endure. Having information about which factors motivate consumers to have a willingness to pay a price Premium plays an important role for firms in securing the slippery floor in which they operate. From this point of view, this paper attempts to shed light on the antecedents of consumers' willingness to pay a price Premium. The key research question in that study is what makes consumers willing to pay more? Is there any difference between the impacts of those antecedents on the willingness? If yes, which effects of factors have more impact, independently from others? Data were collected from a random sample from Gaziantep which is one of big cities of Turkey through questionnaires. Because the model of this study aims to find out under which effects does the consumers decide to pay high price, we emphasize on the factors of brand equity, Perceived social image, perceived uniqueness, Green brand image, Brand reputation, Brand Effect, Brand logo which are predicted that have an effect on the willingness to pay a price Premium.","[Mutlu, Hanifi Murat; Yilmaz, Canan] Gaziantep Univ, Gaziantep, Turkey",Gaziantep University,"Mutlu, HM (通讯作者)，Gaziantep Univ, Gaziantep, Turkey.",mmutlu@gantep.edu.tr; ylmzcanan@gmail.com,"Karasu, Derya/F-1579-2017; yılmaz uz, canan/JMB-6821-2023; Mutlu, Hanifi Murat/W-2999-2017; yilmaz, canan/N-3608-2019","Karasu, Derya/0000-0003-1867-9018; yilmaz, canan/0000-0002-1510-0667",,,,,27,1,1,1,9,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,307,313,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000031,0

The examination of the discursive dynamics of policy coordination and political communication calls attention to agents' rhetorical strategies, the circulation of ideas in discursive communities, and the role of ideational leaders along with that of the public and the media in a post-truth era.

Major essential studies on corruption admit that corruption is related to an ineffective, non-transparent public administration system, it facilitates irrational use of public resources, increases the uncontrollable economic segment, decreases the population welfare level, undermines confidence in public institutions, etc. Prevention and combating of corruption, despite the strivings of law enforcement authorities, are considered to be insufficiently effective. In the studies practically no attention is paid to the possible positive elements of corruption, which are hard to be identified.

An incentive for an even greater private enforcement of competition law has been provided by a more recent piece of legislation - Directive 2014/104/EU on certain rules governing actions for damages under national law for infringements of the competition law provisions of the Member States and of the European Union, the aim of which is removing obstacles for compensation of the harm sustained as a result of the infringement of competition laws. In a legal environment in which the private enforcement of competition law is encouraged and an increasing number of competition disputes have a cross-border element, establishing which EU Member State courts are competent to discuss the case becomes a crucial matter. Therefore, this paper deals with the issue of establishing international jurisdiction for private competition claims in the EU. Rules on international jurisdiction for civil and commercial cases are contained in Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the Brussels I bis Regulation), one of the most important sources of the EU private international law. This paper identifies which Brussels I bis provisions are applicable for establishing international jurisdiction in private competition claims characterised as non-contractual liability.","[Vrbljanac, Danijela] Univ Rijeka, Fac Law, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Vrbljanac, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Law, Rijeka, Croatia.",dvrbljanac@pravri.hr,"Vrbljanac, Danijela/R-5960-2018","Vrbljanac, Danijela/0000-0002-1118-5384",Croatian Science Foundation [9366],Croatian Science Foundation,This paper is written under the support of the Croatian Science Foundation project no. 9366 - Legal Aspects of Corporate Acquisitions and Knowledge Driven Companies' Restructuring,,9,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,401,411,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300040,0

It was discovered that in spite of the existence of many indirect confirmations of the importance of partnership relations for innovative companies in general, these relations in most cases are formed spontaneously without deep justification. It turned out that many innovative companies consider large domestic and foreign corporations as reliable main partners.

The authors analyze the causes of low sustainability and low competitiveness of economy of modern Russia's regions and determine that these causes are closely connected, which creates a possibility for their complex solution. For that, the authors distinguish two most perspective directions of investment attraction into the regional economy of modern Russia: infrastructure and innovations; the corresponding recommendations are offered, and the institutional model of investment attraction into sustainable and competitive development of region is developed.

To this end, we considered a standard Taylor rule (using two drivers: output gap and inflation gap) and proxied them differently for robustness. Further, we extended this Taylor rule to a nonlinear framework while enabling its coefficient to be time-varying and to change with regard to the phases in business cycle, in order to better capture any further asymmetry in the data and the structural break induced by the Great Depression. Accordingly, we showed two important findings. First, the linearity hypothesis was rejected, and we found that an On/Off Taylor Rule is appropriate to reproduce the conduct of monetary policy during the interwar period more effectively (the activation of drivers only occurs per regime). Second, unlike Field [Field, A. 2015. The Taylor Rule in the 1920s. Working Paper], we validated the use of a Taylor rule to explain the conduct of monetary policy in history more effectively. Consequently, this nonlinear Taylor rule specification provides interesting results for a better understanding of monetary regimes during the interwar period, and offers useful complements to narrative monetary history.","[Damette, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, BETA CNRS, Nancy, France; [Damette, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, BETA CNRS, Metz, France; [Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Lille, Lille, France; [Parent, Antoine] Sci Po Lyon, OFCE, CAC IXXI Complex Syst Inst, Lyon, France",Universite de Lorraine; Universite de Lorraine; Universite de Lille,"Damette, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, BETA CNRS, Nancy, France.;Damette, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, BETA CNRS, Metz, France.",olivier.damette@gmail.com,,"Damette, Olivier/0000-0002-7520-3780; JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391; PARENT, Antoine/0000-0001-5087-9488",,,,,56,0,0,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

To address this gap, this paper suggests a total interpretive structural modelling based approach. We use graph theory logic to synthesize expert interpretations in the form of a theoretical supply chain model. This method may prove to be an alternative method to econometric based modelling or structural equation modelling.

The framework consists of four components. First, it provides a necessary and sufficient condition for parameter identification, where the identifying information is provided by the first- and second-order properties of nonsingular submodels. Second, it provides a procedure based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo for parameter estimation. Third, it delivers confidence sets for structural parameters and impulse responses that allow for model misspecification. Fourth, it generates forecasts for all the observed endogenous variables, irrespective of the number of shocks in the model. The framework encompasses the conventional likelihood analysis as a special case when the model is nonsingular. It enables the researcher to start with a basic model and then gradually incorporate more shocks and other features, meanwhile confronting all the models with the data to assess their implications. The methodology is illustrated using both small- and medium-scale DSGE models. These models have numbers of shocks ranging between 1 and 7.","[Qu, Zhongjun] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Qu, ZJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,,,,,,,45,4,5,0,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This allows to evaluate whether relevant shifts in the conduct of monetary policy occurred and whether the current financial crisis had an influence on that. The paper considers two different specifications, one with contemporaneous regressors and one with regressors from surveys. The Taylor rule is then enriched with a set of macroeconomic and financial variables with the aim of testing their significance. Results show that forward-looking variables have a better explanatory power over interest rate policy. All the coefficients are found to be stable along the sample so that no shift in the reaction function can be identified and the financial crisis is found to only lead to a change in the size of the shock. Finally, we also provide evidence about the fact that the ECB has been actually constrained by the zero lower bound during the recent crisis.","[Rivolta, Giulia] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy",University of Brescia,"Rivolta, G (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy.",giulia.rivolta@unibs.it,,"RIVOLTA, GIULIA/0000-0003-0132-3867",,,,,74,2,2,0,2,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

As such, we study the methods by which hedge funds and private equity collection firms can more profitably unwind this toxic debt. Specifically, we employ the theory of Asymmetric Dominance and find support that introducing a similar payment amount (i.e., a decoy) significantly induces borrowers to change their preference from one that is optimal for them to one that is suboptimal. We then employ the Left-Most Digit effect in a new manner and demonstrate a statistically significant ability to mitigate the Asymmetric Dominance effect.

Despite increasing societal interest in transitions to more sustainable transportation technologies, there has been little consideration of how such innovations might challenge, maintain or support different aspects of automobility, and what that means for technology deployment, transport policy, and user practices. To bring attention to the complexity and apparent durability of the automobility system, in this paper we develop a conceptual framework that explores automobility through a categorization of frames, or shared cultural meanings. This framework moves beyond the typical focus on private, functional considerations of user choice, financial costs and time use to also consider symbolic and societal frames of automobility that exist among users, non-users, industry, policymakers and other relevant social groups. We illustrate this framework with eight particular frames of automobility that fall into four broad categories: private-functional frames such as (1) cocooning and fortressing and (2) mobile digital offices; private-symbolic frames such as (3) gender identity and (4) social status; societal-functional frames such as (5) environmental stewardship and (6) sub urbanization; and societal-symbolic frames such as (7) self-sufficiency and (8) innovativeness. Finally, we start the process of discussing several transportation innovations in light of these automobility frames, namely electrified, autonomous and shared mobility examining early evidence for which frames would be challenged or supported by such transitions. We believe that appreciation of the complex and varied frames of automobility can enrich discussion of transitions and policy relating to sustainable transportation.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Axsen, Jonn] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Aarhus University; University of Sussex; Simon Fraser University,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",BenjaminSo@hih.au.dk,"Babariya, Dheeraj/G-8663-2019; Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program [EP/K011790/1]; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant [4182-00033B]; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"One of the intellectual architects of this manuscript, Professor John Urry, sadly passed away in March 2016 as a second draft was being written.

Understanding the connections between daily travel behavior and emotional well-being will not only help transportation practitioners identify concrete strategies to improve user experiences of transportation services, but also help health practitioners to identify innovative solutions for improving public health. Prior research on the subject had focused on limited travel behavior dimensions such as travel mode and/or travel duration. Other dimensions such as travel purpose and travel companionship have received limited attention. Using data from the 20122013 American Time Use Survey, this paper applied the generalized ordered logistic regression approach and examined how the mode, duration, purpose, and companionship characteristics of a trip shape six different emotions during the trip, including happy, meaningful, tired, stressful, sad, and pain. After controlling for personal demographics, health conditions, and residential locations, we find that biking is the happiest mode; public transit is the least happy and least meaningful; and utilitarian walking for transportation is associated with all four negative emotions. Trip duration has a negative association with happiness and a positive association with stress. Travel for discretionary purposes such as leisure, exercise, and community activities is generally associated with higher levels of positive emotions and lower levels of negative emotions than travel for work or household maintenance. Trips with eating and drinking purposes appear to be the happiest and trips with the purpose of spiritual and/or volunteering activities appear to be the most meaningful. Travel with family especially children or travel with friends is happier and more meaningful than travel alone. Transportation planners in the U.S. are recommended to promote biking behavior, improve transit user experiences, and implement spatial planning strategies for creating a built environment conducive to shorter trips, more discretionary trips, and more joint trips with family and friends.","[Zhu, Jing] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Shaanxi Key Lab Earth Surface Syst & Environm Car, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Fan, Yingling] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affair, 301 19th Ave South,295E Humphrey Sch, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Northwest University Xi'an; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Fan, YL (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affair, 301 19th Ave South,295E Humphrey Sch, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",yingling@umn.edu,,"Fan, Yingling/0000-0003-0500-4804","National Science Foundation, United States [1444745]; National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [51608443]","National Science Foundation, United States(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Natural Science Foundation of China, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors thank the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for many helpful suggestions that greatly improved the paper.

Using a panel vector autoregressive model, we find that there is a particularly strong feedback mechanism between prices and turnover. Momentum effects are another important reason why prices and turnover are correlated. Common underlying factors, such as GDP and interest rates, also explain part of the price-turnover correlation. The results in this paper imply that, to understand price and turnover dynamics, it is important to model prices and turnover as two interdependent processes. There is a considerable bias in the coefficient estimates of standard house price models if this dependency is not explicitly taken into account.","[Droes, Martijn I.; Francke, Marc K.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Fac Econ & Business, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Droes, Martijn I.] Amsterdam Sch Real Estate, Jollemanhof 5, NL-1019 GW Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Droes, Martijn I.] Tinbergen Inst, Gustav Mahlerpl 117, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Francke, Marc K.] Ortec Finance, Naritaweg 51, NL-1043 BP Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Dröes, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Business Sch, Fac Econ & Business, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Dröes, MI (通讯作者)，Amsterdam Sch Real Estate, Jollemanhof 5, NL-1019 GW Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Dröes, MI (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, Gustav Mahlerpl 117, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.i.droes@uva.nl,,,,,,,51,12,11,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Although UK pensioners express a desire to use their homes to support their retirement, few actually downsize or borrow against the value of their home using an equity release product. In this paper, we examine housing equity withdrawal behaviour by analysing the cost and benefits of housing equity withdrawal, variations in financial behaviours and attitudes to homeownership along with a consideration of regional effects. Using the UK Wealth and Assets Survey, we find that quantifying the likely amount released and transaction costs explains many of the patterns we observe in the data. Our empirical analysis helps explain the low level of housing equity withdrawal, regional variations in this activity and the choice between downsizing and equity release.

Employing data from an oral history database at Harvard Business School, the article identifies five major sources of political risk: macroeconomic and policy turbulence, excessive bureaucracy, political instability, corruption, and violence. Marked regional differences were identified in perceptions and responses to risks. Macroeconomic and policy turbulence was the biggest perceived source of risk in Latin America. Excessive bureaucracy was the biggest source of perceived risk in South Asia. South Asian businesses often avoided bureaucracies, while Latin Americans worked with them.","[Jones, Geoffrey; Comunale, Rachael] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Jones, G (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",gjones@hbs.edu,,,Division of Research and Faculty Development at the Harvard Business School,Division of Research and Faculty Development at the Harvard Business School,The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees for their comments on earlier draft.

Importantly, the model is amended with real rigidities to simultaneously account for the macroeconomic evidence of a low Phillips curve slope and the microeconomic evidence of frequent price changes. We show that the nonlinear solution is associated with a much smaller multiplier than the linearized solution in long-lived liquidity traps, and pin down the key features in the model which account for the difference. Our results caution against the common practice of using linearized models to calculate fiscal multipliers in long-lived liquidity traps.","[Linde, Jesper] Sveriges Riksbank, Res Div, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden; [Linde, Jesper] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Trabandt, Mathias] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Chair Macroecon, Berlin, Germany; [Trabandt, Mathias] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Saale, Germany",Sveriges Riksbank; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Free University of Berlin; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Lindé, J (通讯作者)，Sveriges Riksbank, Res Div, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden.",jesper.linde@riksbank.se,,,International Finance Division of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; International Monetary Fund; 2016/2017 DG-ECFIN Fellowship Initiative of the European Commission,International Finance Division of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; International Monetary Fund; 2016/2017 DG-ECFIN Fellowship Initiative of the European Commission,"A previous version of this paper was titled Fiscal multipliers in a nonlinar world.

We also show that among the three distinct estimates, one is biased when money lines suggest a very heavy favorite in a particular sporting event. Thus, it is important to consider the assumptions for each method when deciding which to use in a particular context.

First, we represent a national data set incorporating 16,850 crowd-shipping requests across the United States for the 2 year period of January 2015 through December 2016. Second, we develop a two-part model of supply defined by both the probability of receiving a bid from a crowd-courier, and the bid count. Model results along with elasticity measurements summarize the effects of variation in shipping request and package, built environment, and socioeconomic characteristics. Third, we report the sensitivity of elasticities over different segmentations to understand whether and to what extent the supply responsiveness varies across segments. Our results show that (1) supply is unevenly distributed across the U.S. at the block group level, (2) this geographical disparity is a function of not only the shipping request and service characteristics, but also the socioeconomic and built environment attributes, (3) the supply has denser pockets in areas with a higher percentage of African-American population, high wage workers, and families with two or more vehicles, (4) the supply peters off in areas with higher population and employment densities, while, it is accumulated in geographical areas with higher destination accessibility and regional employment diversity, and (5) the out-of-state and the business-to-customer shipments present the highest elasticity in receiving a bid, while posted requests with a delivery deadline is the most inelastic segment. Transportation planners and crowd-shipping companies can use these results to implement improved supply creation, geographically targeted growth, and price discrimination strategies.","[Ermagun, Alireza; Stathopoulos, Amanda] Northwestern Univ, McCormick Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Stathopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, McCormick Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",alireza.ermagun@northwestern.edu; a-stathopoulos@northwestern.edu,"Stathopoulos, Amanda/GWM-4799-2022; Stathopoulos, Amanda/K-2386-2014",,US National Science Foundation Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) Grant [1534138]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh [1534138] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,US National Science Foundation Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) Grant; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),This material is based upon work supported by the US National Science Foundation Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) Grant No. 1534138 Smart CROwdsourced Urban Delivery (CROUD) System.

We uncover indicative evidence that increases in food prices are associated with reductions in poverty, not increases.

Families from the Accession countries appear to have little access to non-parental childcare or the support of extended family, which is an important resource for their Irish peers. Fewer EU Accession mothers return to paid work at the end of maternity leave, and are more likely to juggle work and childcare without support.

Patch-working' - the reliance on supplementary forms of income to support business activity - is often seen as a means of cushioning the financial vulnerability of small firms. However, the mechanisms and forms that patch-working takes tend to be overlooked. Evidence from 42 West Midlands' firms shows that, despite the highly constrained operating environment, the exercise of social agency can help to cushion against disadvantage and to rework their current conditions through patch-working. This allows for business growth, and even transformational growth in some cases, rather than sheer survival. Even so, our findings show that the agency of migrant entrepreneurs brings about only minor improvements in revenue and is certainly not capable of fundamentally changing either the nature of the sector or the structure of the labour market in which they are embedded.","[Villares-Varela, Maria] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Ram, Monder; Jones, Trevor] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Southampton; University of Birmingham,"Villares-Varela, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Social & Human Sci, Bldg 58,Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",M.Villares-Varela@soton.ac.uk,"Hadri, Valdet/AAE-5457-2021","Ram, Monder/0000-0003-1901-6654; Villares-Varela, Maria/0000-0002-0137-7104",Advantage West Midlands,Advantage West Midlands,This research project was funded by Advantage West Midlands.,,45,21,21,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

(1963) has become one of the standard methods to estimate a constant-quality price index. The model, however, fails to adjust for depreciation, as age and time between sales have an exact linear relationship. This paper proposes a new method to estimate an age-adjusted repeat sales index by decomposing property value into land and structure components. As depreciation is more relevant to the structure than land, the property's depreciation rate should depend on the relative size of land and structure. The larger the land component, the lower the depreciation rate of the property. This new method is applied to property transactions in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Hong Kong is shown to have a higher depreciation rate based on a fixed structure-to-property value ratio, while the resulting age adjustment is larger in Tokyo because its land value has shrunken over time.","[Wong, Siu Kei; Chau, K.

The article first states some quantitative elements on the absolute and relative importance of the references to Marx and the words Marxism and Marxist in the journal. The central editorial line of the review - to restore a French descent to socialism and to try to found a socialism not exclusively Marxist - is then analysed. This line is maintained over time, with variations, in different national and international contexts. Finally, three key economic themes defining the relation to Marx in the journal are presented. Based on this quantitative and qualitative analysis, a brief conclusion stresses some of the most specific aspects of the socialist reception of Marx in France before WWI.","[Bellet, Michel] Univ St Etienne, Univ Lyon, CNRS, UMR,GATE Lyon St Etienne, 10 Rue Trefilerie, F-42023 Sain Etienne, France; [Bellet, Michel] Univ Jean Monnet, ANR St Simonism, 10 Rue Trefilerie, F-42023 St Etienne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2,"Bellet, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Etienne, Univ Lyon, CNRS, UMR,GATE Lyon St Etienne, 10 Rue Trefilerie, F-42023 Sain Etienne, France.;Bellet, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jean Monnet, ANR St Simonism, 10 Rue Trefilerie, F-42023 St Etienne, France.",michel.bellet@univ-st-etienne.fr,,,,,,,153,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

We use top income shares of the World Wealth and Income Database (WID). Globalisation is measured by the KOF index of globalisation. Static and dynamic panel model results show that the top income shares increased more under right wing governments than under left wing governments. The ideology-induced effect was stronger when globalisation proceeded more rapidly. Globalisation was positively correlated with income shares of the upper-middle class (P99-P90), but negatively with income shares of the rich (top 1%) in the overall sample. We show that the relationship differs between Anglo-Saxon countries and other OECD countries. Globalisation was more pro-rich in Anglo-Saxon countries than in other OECD countries. Government ideology does not turn out to have a statistically significant effect on top income shares in Anglo-Saxon countries after the 1980s, whereas ideology-induced differences in the distributional outcomes continued in other OECD countries.","[Dorn, Florian; Schinke, Christoph] Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Ifo Ctr Publ Finance & Polit Econ, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Dorn, F (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Ifo Ctr Publ Finance & Polit Econ, Munich, Germany.",,,"Dorn, Florian/0000-0003-2476-4059",Hanns-Seidel-Foundation,Hanns-Seidel-Foundation,"We would like to thank Niklas Potrafke, seminar participants at the ifo Institute, the participants of the International Institute of Public Finance (IIPF) Annual Conference 2014, and an anonymous referee for helpful comments.

Based on data from the 2005 population mini-census with prefecture-level statistics, we distinguish the effect of economic development from that of marketisation on the gender earnings gap. Multi-level analyses reveal that marketisation and economic development have affected gender inequality in different ways: whereas market forces have exacerbated gender earnings inequality, economic development has reduced it. Overall, marketisation appears to be the main driver of the increase in gender earnings inequality in urban China.

In this context, this paper presents an empirical investigation of actual and perceived travel time at each stage in a bus-rail transport trip, where first mile, in-vehicle stage, transfer stage and last mile are considered. Data on actual and perceived travel time, socioeconomic characteristics, trip characteristics and facility usage are collected by accompanied survey undertaken from passengers' originations to destinations. The results from a series of paired T-tests show that passenger do perceive travel time to be greater than the actual amount at each stage. Three linear regression models are developed for estimation of perceived walking, waiting and in-vehicle time. Results indicate that socioeconomic characteristics, trip characteristics and facility usage seem to have an impact on passengers' travel time perception, while the travel time spent on the previous stage does not affect the perception much.","[Meng, Meng; Rau, Andreas; Mahardhika, Hita] TUM Create, 1 Create Way,10-02 Create Tower, Singapore 138602, Singapore",,"Meng, M (通讯作者)，TUM Create, 1 Create Way,10-02 Create Tower, Singapore 138602, Singapore.",meng.meng@tum-create.edu.sg,"meng, meng/GWZ-7461-2022","MENG, MENG/0000-0001-7240-6454",Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme,Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme,This study is supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme.

On a broader scale the paper contributes to the insight that it might be time to fully address the use of direct democracy at the national and EU levels.","[Cheneval, Francis] Univ Zurich, Zollikerstr 117, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ferrin, Monica] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy",University of Zurich; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Cheneval, F (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Zollikerstr 117, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",francis.cheneval@philos.uzh.ch,"Ferrin, Monica/B-1174-2017","Ferrin, Monica/0000-0002-3761-8897",,,,,33,7,7,2,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This is due to parameter estimates implying a high signal-to-noise ratio in terms of the variance of trend shocks as a fraction of the overall forecast error variance. When we impose a lower signal-to-noise ratio, the resulting Beveridge-Nelson filter produces a more intuitive estimate of the output gap that is large in amplitude and highly persistent, and it typically increases in expansions and decreases in recessions. Notably, our approach is also reliable in the sense of being subject to smaller revisions and predicting future output growth and inflation better than other trend-cycle decompositions that impose a low signal-to-noise ratio.","[Kamber, Guenes] Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland; [Kamber, Guenes; Wong, Benjamin] Reserve Bank New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand; [Morley, James] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wong, Benjamin] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Bank for International Settlements (BIS); Reserve Bank of New Zealand; University of Sydney; Monash University,"Kamber, G (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland.;Kamber, G (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand.",,"Morley, James C/J-9166-2012","Morley, James/0000-0003-2380-6747; Wong, Benjamin/0000-0002-1665-6165",,,,,39,52,53,0,5,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The results showed that: (1) customer and job satisfaction fully-mediate the link between corporate level associations (i.e. CSR and SQ) and shipping firms' financial performance; (2) CSR and SQ complement each other in driving job and customer satisfaction; (3) the interaction between CSR and SQ produces synergistic effects on customer satisfaction but compensatory effects on job satisfaction. The results suggest that the decision to implement CSR is contingent on the motivation of a firm as well as its current SQ capability.

However, very little has been done to appropriately estimate these dynamic policies. This paper estimates regime- switching monetary and fiscal policy rules and lays strong emphasis on mis-specification testing. We apply a Markov regime-switching model to estimate monetary and fiscal policy rules for India to highlight the evolving stance of Indian macro-policy for the period 1951-2008 and investigate the behaviour of select macroeconomic variables under the estimated policy regimes. Our results suggest that, in India, fiscal policy was largely active for the entire period except for a few periods of restraint. Monetary policy, despite achieving greater autonomy post-1990s, has largely been accommodating fiscal policy. Whenever monetary policy became active, fiscal policy undermined monetary policy's effectiveness by not accommodating accordingly. We argue for an aggressive monetary policy and a constrained fiscal policy in India.","[Arora, Sanchit] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Gen Vaidya Marg, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India",,"Arora, S (通讯作者)，Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Gen Vaidya Marg, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",sanchit86@gmail.com,"Arora, Sanchit/AAI-4609-2020",,,,,,48,4,4,3,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The proposed estimators are based on the integrated likelihood, which are substantially more reliable than alternatives. Using US data, we find overwhelming support for the TVP-VAR with stochastic volatility compared to a conventional constant coefficients VAR with homoskedastic innovations. Most of the gains, however, appear to have come from allowing for stochastic volatility rather than time variation in the VAR coefficients or contemporaneous relationships. Indeed, according to both criteria, a constant coefficients VAR with stochastic volatility outperforms the more general model with time-varying parameters.","[Chan, Joshua C.

However, the simplest evaluations are often quite demanding in terms of the resources and the time needed to be implemented. In this article, we study the economic impact of a tourism media campaign launched in Nazare, an old fishing community on the west coast of Portugal, to make big waves visible to the world. The campaign provided the required informational media infrastructure that created the public awareness necessary to boost tourism in the region. To measure the economic impact of that campaign on the local economy, we show how a counterfactual analysis can be implemented using regional statistical data on domestic and international tourist arrivals. We show how the method can be adapted to account for the presence of potential spillover effects that may have occurred, as neighboring municipalities could also have been affected by the intervention. We further compare the estimated impact on revenues with the costs incurred by the local municipality in the marketing campaign.

The model is empirically estimated for whites, blacks and Hispanics separately, with the results among whites consistent with education being more valuable to women due to signalling. For 90% of the whites in the sample women choose a higher level of education, given their ability, than men.

Smoking is known to have damaging effects on health, but there is limited evidence on how the effects of smoking translate into worse labour market outcomes, such as the inability to work. In contrast to the few previous studies on smoking and disability retirement, we use a large population sample with registry information on smoking, which is recorded for all women who give birth in Sweden. Thanks to these comprehensive data, we are able to account for a much broader range of potential confounders. In particular, by the use of sibling and twin fixed effects, we account for unobserved heterogeneity in childhood environment and family characteristics. Given that smoking is often initiated in adolescence, one would suspect such factors to play important roles. Among individuals aged 50-64 in 2011, a simple model suggested smokers to have a 5 percentage point higher probability of receiving (full) disability pension, making them more than twice as likely as nonsmokers to receive this. However, in a model with sibling fixed effects, the size of the effect was reduced by more than a third. The results point to the importance of confounders, such as childhood circumstances or behaviours, which were not accounted for by previous studies. We also consider effects on disability due to different health conditions. In relative terms, effects are the largest for circulatory conditions and tumours. Results are largely driven by health problems severe enough to merit hospitalization, and there is no evidence of a role played by financial incentives.(C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Three findings are drawn from the close analysis of overlapping EU agendas on social inclusion and minority inclusion. First, although there are no comprehensive data on European minorities' socio-economic condition, significant evidence has been collected at EU-level that minorities are consistently at a disadvantage. Second, the growing recognition that minorities suffer disproportionately from socio-economic exclusion has not been accompanied by an increasing willingness to consider structural policy approaches. Rather, a policy paradigm has emerged that prioritizes job creation, growth and employability as the one-size-fits-all solution to social exclusion. I call this the trickle-down' approach to minority social inclusion.

Results show that the EIB was the first International Financial Institution to place integration and development above the alleviation of capital constraints.","[Clifton, Judith; Diaz-Fuentes, Daniel; Lara Gomez, Ana] Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Clifton, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Fac Business & Econ Sci, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",judith.clifton@unican.es,"Díaz-Fuentes, Daniel/K-8324-2014; Gómez, Ana María/Q-3324-2017; Clifton, Judith/E-4462-2013; Gómez, Ana Lara/IST-3355-2023","Díaz-Fuentes, Daniel/0000-0002-6290-2363; Clifton, Judith/0000-0001-6081-6800; Gómez, Ana Lara/0000-0002-5324-5584",Santander Financial Institute (SANFI) [APIE 3/2015-17],Santander Financial Institute (SANFI),This article is an output of the research project APIE 3/2015-17 funded by the Santander Financial Institute (SANFI).,,68,19,20,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this regard, Brexit is just another step in a proactive British policy of influencing European co-operation. Most instances of isolationism were self-induced, not the result of any sinister Franco-German plot. In addition, this article will also demonstrate that the UK government has not consistently put forth a free-trade European policy.

Using data from seventeen cities, we establish robust relationships between topography and density, income and housing value gradients. We find that high-income households display strong preference not only for higher altitude but also for unevenness, leading to spatial income stratification at both the city and tract-level. We analyze potential causes of this propensity: micro-climate, crime, congestion, view effects, and use of public transit. We conclude that multidimensional. spatial methods are crucial to investigations of cities with substantial unevenness. Moreover, redistributive social and economic policies must struggle with a fundamental, topographical dimension to inequality.","[Ye, Victor Yifan] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Becker, Charles M.] Dept Econ, Social Sci 213, Campus Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Boston University,"Becker, CM (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, Social Sci 213, Campus Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",yifanye82@gmail.com; cbecker@duke.edu,"Becker, Charles/IWU-5480-2023",,,,,,34,5,5,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Government and employers call on universities to produce employable graduates who are attractive to the labour market and can sustain their future marketability by taking responsibility for protean self-development. While the neoliberal assumptions behind this call have attracted robust critique, the extent to which employers shape graduating students' subjectivities and sense of worth as (potentially employable) workers has escaped scrutiny. Inspired by Foucauldian analyses of human resource management (HRM) practices, this article examines employers' graduate careers websites and explores the discursive construction of the employable graduate'. The article contends that these websites function as a mechanism of anticipatory socialization through which HRM practices extend managerial control into the transitional space of pre-recruitment, with the aim of engaging students' consent to particular norms of employability.","[Handley, Karen] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Business, Work & Org, Oxford, England",Oxford Brookes University,"Handley, K (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford Brookes Business Sch, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",khandley@brookes.ac.uk,,,,,,,60,32,33,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

However, that interpretation assumes no influence of health status in climbing the occupational ladder. This paper documents evidence of non-negligible returns to occupation status on health (which we refer as 'healthy worker effect'). We use a unique empirical strategy that addresses the issue of reverse causality. That is, an instrumental variable strategy using the variation in average health in the migrant's country of origin, a health measure plausibly not determined by the migrant's occupational status. Our findings suggest that health status exerts significant effects on occupational status in several dimensions; including having a supervising role, worker autonomy, and worker influence. The effect size of health is larger than that of an upper secondary education. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

If holding LPCs in addition to REITs provides excess diversification benefits, this would imply that investors have a larger pool of real estate assets in which to invest. Preliminary tests, however, show they are not comparable enough to be direct substitutes for each other. In portfolio performance analysis, LPCs alone provide certain diversification benefits, but the gains are slightly lower than those provided by REITs alone. We find little, if any, additional gains from holding both assets simultaneously. Further investigation suggests a long-term cointegration relationship between these two assets that is driven by property market conditions, yield term structure, default risk premium, and institutional money funds flow. In the short horizon, we observe unilateral Granger causality running from REITs to LPCs, suggesting that REITs are the leading index, while LPCs are followers in the system. Overall, our findings suggest that LPCs widen the number of public real estate securities that can be used. However, they are not quite as effective as REITs in terms of diversification benefits.","[Glascock, John L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Finance, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Glascock, John L.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Prombutr, Wikrom] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Finance, Coll Business Adm, Long Beach, CA 90802 USA; [Zhang, Ying] Fairfield Univ, Dolan Sch Business, Dept Finance, Fairfield, CT 06824 USA; [Zhou, Tingyu] Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, Dept Finance, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada",University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; California State University System; California State University Long Beach; Fairfield University; Concordia University - Canada,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Fairfield Univ, Dolan Sch Business, Dept Finance, Fairfield, CT 06824 USA.",John.glascock@uconn.edu; wikrom.prombutr@csulb.edu; yzhang1@fairfield.edu; tingyu.zhou@concorida.ca,,"Zhou, Tingyu/0000-0002-2787-9137",,,,,85,1,2,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Previous studies of the trade-off between the quantity of children and some measure of their quality have been much concerned with the endogeneity of fertility choices. Here we use the IFLS for 1993,1997 and 2000 to exploit some unique institutional features that have influenced fertility. We find evidence that family size is influenced both from the supply side, as represented by components of the Indonesian family planning programme, and on the demand side, as represented by exposure to modern media. We use these variables as instruments for family size in regressions for the height z-scores. We find evidence for a significant negative effect of family size on height in the presence of a range of other influences. An increase of one sibling is associated with a decrease of one third of a standard deviation in the z-score of height. This effect is stronger among families with low-educated mothers and is present in both urban and rural settings.

This paper then applies a split population hazard model, or widely known as a mixture cure model in biometrics literature, to jointly predict incidence (probability) and latency (hazard rate) of mortgage default, and more specifically to analyze the right-tail characteristics of the survival distributions of the sample mortgages. Our results show that negative equity is a highly significant factors driving both default incidence and latency for both adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) and fixed rate mortgages (FRMs). We also show that borrowers' credit scores have weaker predictive effects on the latency (survival hazard) risks, but both low FICO and subprime borrowers have higher probability to default in an adverse market condition, ceteris paribus. Borrowers with low credit scores have high default probabilities but with a longer time to default (hazard rate). They are more likely to hang onto their mortgages even if they are underwater (negative equity). In terms of the cured rate, we show that subprime borrowers with underwater (negative equity) FRM mortgages, and prime ARM borrowers have relatively higher cured rates in the mortgage sample. More policy experiments can be conducted using the mixture cure model to test the effectiveness of selected financial assistance programs in the future.","[Liu, Bo] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Sing, Tien Foo] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; National University of Singapore,"Sing, TF (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore.",liubo@jxufe.edu.cn; rststf@nus.edu.sg,"Sing, Tien Foo/J-9381-2013","Sing, Tien Foo/0000-0002-4101-851X",,,,,34,4,6,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

By doing this, we provide a dynamic, multi-level analysis of the mechanism that drives inflation in the U.K. We find that the CPI classes' network exhibits an evolving topology through time which depends substantially on the prevailing economic conditions in the U.K. We identify non-overlapping communities of these CPI classes and we observe that they do not correspond to the actual categories they belong to; a finding that suggests that diverse forces are driving the inter-relations of the CPI classes which are stronger between categories rather than within them. Finally, we construct a reduced version of the U.K. CPI that fulfills the core inflation measure criteria and can possibly be used as an appropriate measure of the underlying inflation in the U.K. Since this new measure makes use of only 14 out of the 85 U.K. CPI classes, it can be used to complement the Bank of England's arsenal of core inflation measures without the need for further resource allocation.","[Sarantitis, Georgios Antonios; Papadimitriou, Theophilos; Gogas, Periklis] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Komotini 69100, Greece",,"Sarantitis, GA (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Komotini 69100, Greece.",gsaranti@econ.duth.gr,"Papadimitriou, Theophilos/GVU-6967-2022; Papadimitriou, Theophilos/AAD-7737-2020; Gogas, Periklis/N-8162-2014","Gogas, Periklis/0000-0002-5134-3869; Papadimitriou, Theophilos/0000-0001-9035-183X",European Union (European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning' of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: THALES [MIS 380292],European Union (European Social Fund (ESF))(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning' of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: THALES(Thales Group),This research has been co-financed by the European Union (European Social Fund (ESF)) and Greek national funds through the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning' of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: THALES (MIS 380292).

A survey was conducted at spa hotels in four major spa regions of Taiwan. The findings indicated that the immediate situational factors of quality and price contribute to the net value perception, which in turn leads to the WTB. Oppositely, the long-term factor of risk does not have either direct or indirect effect when making such an infrequent decision.

We find that the initial distribution of permits, in particular, the amount of permits initially given to the dominant firm, is crucial in determining over-or under-investment in relation to the benchmark model without market power. Specifically, if the dominant firm is initially endowed with more permits than the corresponding cost effective allocation, this results in under-investment by the dominant firm and over-investment by the competitive fringe, regardless of the specific amount of permits given to the latter firms. The results are reversed if the dominant firm is initially endowed with relatively few permits. Also, the presence of market power results in a divergence of both abatement and technology adoption levels with respect to the benchmark scenario of perfect competition, as long as technology adoption becomes more effective in reducing abatement costs.","[Andre, Francisco J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Andre, Francisco J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, ICE, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Arguedas, Carmen] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teora Econ & Hist Econ, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Complutense University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"André, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.;André, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, ICE, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",andre@ccee.ucm.es,"Arguedas, Carmen/H-4170-2016; Andre, Francisco J./H-4613-2015","Arguedas, Carmen/0000-0002-2719-6918; Andre, Francisco J./0000-0002-6406-3305","ERDF [ECO2015-70349-P]; Banco Santander [PR26/16-15B-4]; European Comission [SOE1/P1/F0173]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [ECO2014-52372-P]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness; Complutense University of Madrid","ERDF(European Union (EU)); Banco Santander; European Comission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Complutense University of Madrid","The authors wish to thank the participants at the 5th Meeting on International Economics, the 1st AERNA Workshop on Game Theory and the Environment, 7th AERNA and 2017 EAERE meetings, and an anonymous referee, for very helpful comments and suggestions on earlier drafts.

On this notion there are many interpretations, understandings and definitions in the conceptual, methodological and applicative sense. Taxes are how the state budget revenues supplies needed to finance public expenditure. At the same time, they represent an instrument of intervention in the economic and social life, because, by establishing their level, the state intervenes in carrying out economic and social activities and influences the population's consumption capacity. Each state promotes its own fiscal policy. It establishes the number, type and size of taxes and duties that are structured in relation to different criteria to assess and analyze the effects of taxation on the dynamics of the economy. The tax strategy changes quite frequently, depending on economic, social and political, domestic and international developments. Companies must comply with the accounting and tax rules and to keep records of all transactions according to regulations. The accounting principles, rules or rules are not, in some cases, the same as those in fiscality. Thus, the link between fiscality and accounting is complex. The objective of the research is to identify the main tax changes and to highlight their impact on the formation of budgetary revenues, but also on the economic and financial activity of the companies.

In theory, the occurrence of breakdowns in the phase shift signifies interference in the interdependence. The preliminary research results presented in this article aim to address the question whether those breakdowns can be used to identify moments of the occurrence of shocks in financial markets, resulting from the behaviour of return rates in the partner market under examination. The results presented in the article reveal the significance of most square rates of return in the period preceding the occurrence of a phase break in the model for variance and the lack of significance of return rates of those moments to the concurrent change in the expected value.

In view of the problem that the university archives management system seriously restricts the development of archives work, the aspects of the weakening of the archives institution setting, the separation setting of document management and archives management, chaotic and unsystematic archives management and no front-end control and whole process management are analyzed. Finally, the system of archives management in colleges and universities is reformed. The countermeasures of innovating management mechanism, ensuring the hardware facilities and funds of the archives management, strengthening the information construction of university archives, enhancing the service function, improving the work efficiency, strengthening the development of quality and building a new platform for team development are put forward to promote the stable and efficient development of archives work in colleges and universities.","[Chen, Xia] Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Yantai 264005, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong Technology & Business University,"Chen, X (通讯作者)，Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Yantai 264005, Shandong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-521-4,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2018,182.0,,,,,,350,353,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BM5RA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465424800080,0

These initiatives worked with existing British policy, and structural biases, to exacerbate the already bifurcated structure of UK capitalism - between the high-paid technology and financial services sector on the one hand, and low-cost, low-wage sectors on the other hand. In particular, and central to the argument of this paper, immigration from Eastern and Central Europe after 2004 helped to sustain low-cost manufacturing and services industries by undermining firms' incentives to invest in training. This combined with endemic failures in the UK's skills system, which is heavily geared towards producing graduates with general skills but neglects the needs of mid and lower segments of the labour market. EU integration, therefore, exacerbated cleavages over skills between high- and low-productivity sectors and may have contributed to social divisions that led to Brexit.","[Coulter, Steve] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Coulter, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London, England.",S.Coulter1@lse.ac.uk,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023",,,,,,73,6,6,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

However, beside its advantages consisting in secured, cheaper and faster transactions, borderless use, anonymity of the participants and lack of inflation, which makes it attractive for many people, Bitcoin also generates significant threats not only towards banks and economy, in general, but also to the society. Its private nature, beyond the supervision of any authority and especially the anonymity ensured for the participants in transactions with Bitcoin opens possibilities of using it in money laundering and terrorism activities, but also for speculative attacks on traditional currencies. Moreover, intermediating the sales of goods and services it interferes with traditional payment systems and may affect the monetary policies of governments from all over the world, including European Union countries. Therefore, debating on the issue of finding ways to regulate the use of Bitcoin in order to prevent such threats become justified and led us to the conclusion that beyond the need of regulations to be created by each country, because of its borderless use, there needed also regulatory measures to be taken on global scale by institutions like IMF or European Commission. Moreover, because of its dual nature, for regulating Bitcoin there is a need to combine the legislation applicable to traditional currencies with the one applicable to financial assets.","[Filip, Bogdan Florin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Filip, BF (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",bogdan.filip@feaa.uaic.ro,"Filip, Bogdan Florin/AAG-6091-2021",,,,,,21,0,0,0,6,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-492-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,147,163,,,,,,17,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL8FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456271700010,0

By examining the evolution of the Fund's structural conditionalities and the thematic distribution of Bank commitments, it provides evidence for a significant change on the ground: a partial retreat from the post-Washington Consensus (PWC) agenda, which marked a turn-of-the-century upgrade of orthodox neoliberalism. Conceptualising the PWC as a paradigm expansion that followed severe policy failures, the analysis finds that although narrow institutional reforms towards upgrading fiscal and financial regimes remain popular, there is now less emphasis on good governance and broad institutions; meanwhile in social policy the twins increasingly diverge. It is argued that this selective disengagement is driven by extant operational imperatives and constraints, which are further intensified by changes in lending framework and ongoing transformations in development finance. Rather than constitute a paradigm shift, the partial decline of the PWC reflects an adjustment in policy practice towards increased flexibility and discretion in a progressively challenging environment. These findings have implications for the study of the twins. They also highlight the evolving parameters of North-South development cooperation.","[Gueven, Ali Burak] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Polit, Int Relat & Int Polit Econ, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Güven, AB (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Polit, Int Relat & Int Polit Econ, London, England.",a.guven@bbk.ac.uk,,"Guven, Ali Burak/0000-0001-9335-2790",,,,,95,26,31,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Our findings demonstrate that the number of asylum applications in the EU and the media attention this generates primarily affect euroscepticism, while the number of asylum applications into each individual Member State first and foremost affects attitudes towards national institutions. Our results contribute to the literature on democratic accountability, by demonstrating that, even in a complex multi-level governance structure, citizens differentiate between levels of government.","[Harteveld, Eelco; Schaper, Joep; De Lange, Sarah L.; Van der Brug, Wouter] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"De Lange, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, POB 15578, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.l.delange@uva.nl,"van der Brug, Wouter/R-7048-2019","van der Brug, Wouter/0000-0003-4117-1255; de Lange, Sarah/0000-0003-1396-8080",,,,,47,55,57,1,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This paper examines the case of BRICS' discussions to create their own credit rating agency (CrRA) which began in 2012 around the same time as the initiatives to establish the NDB and CRA. These discussions have been driven by discontent with US-based CrRAs which act as key authorities in global finance, but BRICS institutional innovation has been slower to emerge than in the NDB and CRA cases because the BRICS have shared less of a common social purpose on this issue. Even if a BRICS CrRA was created, this institution would be very unlikely to challenge the dominant order any time soon because of the enduring structural power of US and its CrRAs in this sector. The case shows how a wider case selection than the NDB and CRA reveals that the BRICS' capacity to transform the global financial order through collective institutional innovation is dependent on specific conditions: the strength of their common social purpose and the degree of the structural power of established authorities.","[Helleiner, Eric; Wang, Hongying] Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Wang, HY (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",h279wang@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,82,26,28,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The emergence of new political parties in 2012-2013 led to a temporary increase in electoral competition, an augmentation of the political space, and a rise in the number of electoral cleavages, but these developments did not weaken the domination of United Russia. The trend towards an ever greater tightening up of entry requirements for contestation in the elections led to a lowering of the number of political and, consequently, electoral cleavages, in addition to a reconfiguration of the political space. The study shows that there was an unbalancing of the political cleavage structure in 2012-2015: the socioeconomic political cleavage, whose primary place is a key determinant of equilibrium, ceded the top position to the authoritarian-democratic cleavage in 2012-2013, and to the Ukrainian' (systemic) cleavage in 2014-2015.","[Korgunyuk, Yury] INION, Dept Polit Sci, Moscow, Russia; [Korgunyuk, Yury] INDEM Fdn, Reg Publ Fdn, Dept Polit Sci, Informat Sci Democracy, Moscow, Russia; [Ross, Cameron] Univ Dundee, Polit & Int Relat, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Shpagin, Sergey] Tomsk Univ, Fac Philosophy, Tomsk, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences; University of Dundee; Tomsk State University,"Korgunyuk, Y (通讯作者)，INION, Dept Polit Sci, Moscow, Russia.;Korgunyuk, Y (通讯作者)，INDEM Fdn, Reg Publ Fdn, Dept Polit Sci, Informat Sci Democracy, Moscow, Russia.",partinform@mail.ru; c.z.ross@dundee.ac.uk; shpagin1972@mail.ru,"Korgunyuk, Yury G/K-6300-2018; Shpagin, Sergey A./J-4412-2018; Korguniuk, Yurii/AAN-3320-2020","Korguniuk, Yurii/0000-0002-2131-8152",,,,,30,8,8,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2018,70.0,2,,,,,155,181,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1417976,0.0,,,27,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FY7OT,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427053100001,0

While we find well-level production of natural gas is primarily determined by geological characteristics, producers respond to market signals through drilling rates and locations. Using a novel fixed effects approach based on petroleum-engineering characteristics, we confirm that production decline rates tend to be larger for wells with larger peak-production rates. We also find that the price elasticity of peak production is negative, plausibly because firms drill in less productive locations as prices increase. Finally, we show that drilling is price inelastic, although the price elasticity of drilling increased significantly when new technologies began to be adopted in Wyoming. Our results indicate that the popular view that shale wells have larger decline rates than conventional wells can be at least partially explained by the pattern of falling natural gas prices.","[Mason, Charles F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ, Petr & Nat Gas Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Mason, Charles F.] London Sch Econ, Grantham Inst, London, England; [Roberts, Gavin] Weber State Univ, Dept Econ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA",University of Wyoming; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University,"Mason, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ, Petr & Nat Gas Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.;Mason, CF (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Inst, London, England.",bambuzlr@uwyo.edu,,"MASON, CHARLES/0000-0002-9846-0173",,,,,20,15,18,0,6,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2018,39.0,,,,1,,79,100,,10.5547/01956574.39.SI1.cmas,0.0,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ4BL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457118600007,0

This article challenges the emphasis on bureaucratic autonomy in explaining the ability of governments to promote technological change. We show that structural features of the bureaucracy alone are insufficient to account for variation in policy intervention, and argue that sectoral patterns of interest intermediation shape state capacity. Political coordination leads industry and government to broker technological transformations in consensus-driven negotiations. This prioritizes the interests of incumbent firms, likely resulting in regulatory capture and weak policy intervention. Political competition among interest groups and state agencies, by contrast, allows policy-makers to organize coalitions of technology challengers, likely leading to strong policy intervention. We examine this argument in the case of electric vehicle policy in Germany and the United States. Germany failed to disrupt its auto sector to transition to electric vehicles, while the United States adopted comprehensive policies for the manufacturing and commercialization of electric cars against incumbent opposition. Counter to conventional wisdom, our findings suggest that states can effectively engage in sectoral intervention to drive technological change in the absence of autonomous bureaucracies.","[Meckling, Jonas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Nahm, Jonas] Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies, Energy Resources & Environm, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Johns Hopkins University,"Nahm, J (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies, Energy Resources & Environm, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",jnahm@jhu.edu,"Nahm, Jonas/AAE-4836-2019","Nahm, Jonas/0000-0003-1742-5999",ClimateWorks Foundation,ClimateWorks Foundation,ClimateWorks Foundation.,,129,40,49,6,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Should they translate their increasing economic strength into political power to further developing countries' interests in lower levels of international patent protection? Or, anticipating a rising domestic interest in stronger international patent protection, should they adopt a position that favours maximal patent protection? Drawing on multiple case studies using a most-similar system design, we argue that rising economies, after having been coerced into adopting more stringent patent standards, tend to display ambivalent positions, trapped in bureaucratic politics and caught between conflicting domestic constituencies. We find that the recent proliferation of international institutions and the expansion of transnational networks have contributed to fragmentation and polarisation in domestic patent politics. As a result, today's emerging economies experience a more tortuous transformative process than did yesterday's. This finding is of particular relevance for scholars studying rising powers, as well as for those working on policy diffusion, regulatory regimes, transnational networks and regime complexes.","[Morin, Jean-Frederic] Laval Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Serrano, Omar] Univ Geneva, Global Studies Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Burri, Mira] Univ Bern, Fac Law, Bern, Switzerland; [Bannerman, Sara] McMaster Univ, Dept Commun & Multimedia, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Laval University; University of Geneva; University of Bern; McMaster University,"Morin, JF (通讯作者)，Laval Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",jean-frederic.morin@pol.ulaval.ca,"Oswald, Omar Ramon Serrano/I-7826-2019; Morin, Jean Frederic/AAF-4645-2020; Morin, Jean-Frederic/K-2341-2013","Oswald, Omar Ramon Serrano/0000-0002-7396-7891; Burri, Mira/0000-0001-9224-3568; Morin, Jean-Frederic/0000-0003-1053-5597",,,,,83,7,8,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We first lay out a framework of market integration in the context of global LNG market where the main supplier (e.g. Qatar) may have market power. Estimating a time-varying coefficients model, we find that a varying degree of market integration exists between all four LNG indices particularly after the Fukushima incident in 2011. We complement the time-varying coefficient analysis with a test of price convergence among the LNG indices using the Phillips-Sul (2007) methodology. The results reveal that, there is strong evidence that the spot LNG prices are converging after the Fukushima accident and they are also converging with the price of NBP in the UK. The empirical result is consistent with the change of market power of the main supplier.","[Mu, Xiaoyi] Univ Dundee, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Carnegie Bldg, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Ye, Haichun] Hong Kong Monetary Author, Res Dept, Int Finance Ctr 2, 55th Floor,8 Finance St, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Dundee; Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),"Mu, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Carnegie Bldg, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",x.mu@dundee.ac.uk; haichunye@gmail.com,,"Mu, Xiaoyi/0000-0002-3280-6426",,,,,30,6,6,0,13,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2018,39.0,1,,,,,211,233,,10.5547/01956574.39.1.xmu,0.0,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FS0PR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419476700010,0

There are five fundamental functions of management - planning, organizing, human resource management, leading and controlling. Each of these functions has its role and specific significance in the managing process or management system. Functions of management include a series of sub-functions. This paper deals with and explains three sub-functions within each of indicated functions. Evaluation of fundamental functions and sub-functions of management by the police officers (with significant professional knowledge and work experience) is of great heuristic relevance. Empirical research was carried out with regard to the above-mentioned, using the method of survey, by means of a Questionnaire on Fundamental Functions of Management in the Police Service. The research included students (respondents) of the Professional Graduate Study of Criminal Investigation (128 police officers). Respondents evaluated the status (qualitative level) of fundamental functions of management and their sub-functions in the police service by giving certain grades. The grading instrument was a rating scale with a five-level range - from bad to excellent. Research results indicated the existence of almost unanimous - extremely negative - police officers' perception of a qualitative level of all fundamental functions of management in the police service, as well as their sub-functions. When it comes to respondents' perception, almost all functions and sub-functions of management in the police service are at a very low qualitative level, i.e. at a satisfactory level (level 2, on a scale from 1 to 5). Within indicated (extremely negative) level, the function of human resource management was rated as the worst, while the least bad function was the function of controlling. The aim of this research was to obtain a preliminary diagnosis of the status of the police management, as well as to emphasize its relevance and the necessity of prompt development of all its functions and sub-functions.","[Orlovic, Ante] Police Acad, Minist Interior, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Orlovic, A (通讯作者)，Police Acad, Minist Interior, Zagreb, Croatia.",aorlovic@fkz.hr,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,286,305,,,,,,20,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300016,0

By contrast with existing interpretations, the argument is that for Genovesi virtue is a significant ordering device of the polity: virtue mediates between passions and reason, and the human capacity for virtue helps individuals better to realise their different talents. This, in turn, means that virtue is central to the division of labour and the right proportions between different activities, including the balance between consumption and trade.","[Pabst, Adrian] Univ Kent, Rutherford Coll, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury CT2 7NX, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Pabst, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Rutherford Coll, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury CT2 7NX, Kent, England.",A.Pabst@kent.ac.uk,,"Pabst, Adrian/0000-0002-3153-1598",,,,,69,10,10,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

In Belgium, difficult calving in this breed is typically pre-empted by means of planned caesarean sections (CS). The breed association, under some pressure from its parent organisation the National Cattle Committee, first implemented an action plan to reduce the rate of CS following a media event and subsequent reactions from politicians in Denmark in 1998. Later, the breed association renamed the breed from Belgian White Blue to Danish Blue Cattle in an effort to distance the breed from its Belgian origin. The aim of this paper is to undertake an ethical evaluation of how this issue was handled, with specific focus on the actions of the breed association and the National Cattle Committee. This evaluation involves an objective assessment of the outcome of the action plan as well as a wider ethical assessment of the rationale and actions of the professional organisations in charge. We begin by describing the controversy in 1998, which led to the aforementioned action plan. Then, we evaluate how successful the action plan has been in achieving its stated goals. These results show that the action plan has achieved a decrease in the rate of CS from over 50% between 1990-1998 to below 10% between 2000-2013. There has also been a significant decrease in the rate of other types of difficult births in the breed. Finally, we evaluate the implementation of the action plan from the perspective of professional ethics, where the aim is to handle public controversies in such a way as to maintain acceptance from the surrounding society. This has clearly been a success. However, viewed from a consequentialist perspective with a focus on animal welfare, the outcome is more ambiguous. The welfare for Danish Blue cattle has improved, but on the other hand the breed still has a much higher level of CS than comparable breeds of cattle in Denmark.","[Sandoe, P.; Theut, L.

This study aimed to assess the AGI stability against rapid and long-term heating to model pasteurization and incubation, respectively. Moreover, the impact of lemongrass on the physical and sensory qualities of two dairy products was evaluated. The AGI activity was measured using rat intestinal glucosidase inhibition assay and sensory evaluation was performed using the Hedonic test. Stability testing against heating as applied in the ice cream and yoghurt production showed that heating decreased AGI activities, where longer heating intensified the effect vigorously. Noteworthy was that a higher extract amount lessened the damaging effect significantly. Yoghurt fortified with 1,500 mg/ L of lemongrass extract failed to form. Fortification of lemongrass extract reduced viscosity in both ice cream and yoghurt, increased meltdown rate and reduced overrun value in ice cream. Varied concentrations of lemongrass added in ice cream had no significant effect on the sensory acceptance. Hence, lemongrass showed high potential as a functional ingredient for ice cream.","[Santoso, Filiana; Winarno, Jonathan; Gunawan-Puteri, Maria D. P.

Since that original workshop, and against a consolidated neoliberal capitalist context, the political rise of fascistic movements has intensified across the globe. Our collective provocation here is that this current conjuncture cannot be explained with reference to the exceptional intrusion of racism, nor the epiphenomenal status of race in relation to political economy. Instead we attend to how race functions in structural and agential ways, integrally reproducing raced markets and social conditions. Our Introduction opens this conversation for New Political Economy readers, positioning neoliberalism and the current conjuncture as the present political economic moment to be understood through a raced market frame of analysis. Our hope is that this special issue will be read as a timely intervention, referencing a long tradition of (often marginalised) thought which attends to race as productive and material, rather than confined to the ideological realm.","[Tilley, Lisa] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London, England; Queen Mary Univ London, Int Relat, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Tilley, L (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Polit & Int Relat, London, England.",l.tilley@qmul.ac.uk,,"Tilley, Lisa/0000-0001-8805-2398",Leverhulme Trust [ECF-2017-683],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),This work was supported by The Leverhulme Trust [grant number ECF-2017-683].,,43,101,104,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The Financial Regulation on the EU's general budget is a comprehensive document, which deals in detail with revenue and expenditure operations, audit, special funds and external actions. Still, this regulation merely sets out the general principles and basic rules governing the whole budget activity, whose positive regulation is mainly provided by the treaties, while the implementing provisions are contained in specific regulation. The attempt to draw strict and centralized presentation of fund allocations would not guarantee efficiency of the budgetary implementation procedure. To this end, derogations from the principles are regulated in various forms and the EU Commission is the institution entitled to manage these exceptional situations. The budgetary transfers seems to be the most used correction mechanisms for the budget forecast errors, the surplus from one indicator being used to cover the deficit from another, respecting the budgetary principles. The influence of the budgetary principles is not only theoretical, but also it is present in the courts of law jurisprudence, both at national and EU level. The paper proves the increasing importance of these principles and their applicability in practice, showing the evolution of their impact in the last decade.","[Tofan, Mihaela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Tofan, M (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",mtofan@uaic.ro,"Tofan, Mihaela/C-2216-2012",,,,,,27,0,0,0,1,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-492-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,67,84,,,,,,18,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL8FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456271700005,0

Those two explanatory variables are directly proportional to the response variable. Thus, the smaller the mean volume of waste produced by one person and the lower the disposal rate, the smaller the quantity of waste disposed of per capita in a given country. Causal analysis enables us to answer the question of how the two factors affect the variable considered, namely, the direction and strength of their influence.

In the European context, it is a particularly pressing matter in Eastern Europe. The European Parliament recently highlighted the need to examine the agricultural land market beyond the boundaries set by the principles of free movement of goods, services, capital and people. The purpose of this study is to investigate the diversity of trade restrictions on agricultural land in 17 European countries and the market situation in Latvia before and after the liberalisation of the agricultural land market. A relationship between the rigidity of the regulatory framework, the share of agricultural activities in national economy, and the sales price of agricultural land was found. While most countries have restrictions for agricultural land trade to non-EU natural and legal persons, a third of the examined countries prohibit agricultural land sales to non-EU natural and legal persons. The impact of the current agricultural land trade restrictions on agricultural land market in Latvia over the period 2012-2016 was analysed by using data on agricultural land sales transactions obtained from the State Land Service of Latvia. The analysis reveals signs of agricultural land concentration, with a substantial increase of legal persons in the agricultural land transaction structure. At the same time, natural persons who are citizens of Latvia have been active in selling their agricultural land properties. The conclusions of this study provide an insight into the effects of agricultural land market restrictions and characteristics of the land market in general.","[Valtenbergs, Visvaldis] Univ Latvia, Saeima Analyt Serv, Riga, Latvia; [Grumolte-Lerhe, Inese; Avotniece, Zanita; Beizitere, Ilona] Saeima Analyt Serv, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Valtenbergs, V (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Saeima Analyt Serv, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,757,768,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500070,0

The animal patient is being conceptualized in analogy to the patient of (human-)medical ethics: as some sort of person (rather than an object or good), whose individual perspective ought to be an active part in the making of decisions concerning its (medical) treatment. This readiness to accept wide-ranging similarities between humans and animals, however, ends at the principle of autonomy: since animals lack the capacity to speak like humans, their own perspective cannot be included in the process of deciding over their treatment. This is a crucial point, the paper will argue, since it threatens to undermine the entire patient-status of animals: they are incapacitated, attributed to the advocacy of the veterinarian (and/or owner), excluded from the ethical discourse on them. The present paper suggests a second look at this situation by questioning the human-animal-divide that structures it. Taking the ethical status of the animal as patient, whose dignity and welfare are the first responsibility of veterinarians, seriously, requires to work out alternative ways, in which animals could be articulating themselves as subjects.","[Weich, K.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Weich, K (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",kerstin.weich@vetmeduni.ac.at,,"Weich, Kerstin/0000-0002-4391-2056",,,,,21,0,0,0,0,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,249,254,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_38,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000038,0

Specifically, it tests whether extending the appearance of an overcrowded subway line on the Washington DC subway map would encourage passengers to use other underutilized lines. The experiment was conducted through the Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform, with 3056 participants, producing 21,240 route choice decisions on the official and six alternative maps. Results show that redesigned maps significantly affect participants' route choices. Depending on the specific design, a 20% length increase of the overcrowded line could move 1.9-5.7 percentage points of ridership to an alternative, underutilized line. The change could remove up to 10 passengers per car during the highest peak, reducing the number of highly congested half-hour periods (max load = 100-120 passengers per car) on the overcrowded line from 4 to 1, and the number of crush periods (max load > 120 passengers per car) from 3 to 1.

This paper examines the properties of the rankings induced by the set of all coherent completions of the mildly sweetened partial preference structure. Building on these properties, I propose an ensemble-based refinement of Hare's (Analysis 70:237-247, 2010) prospectism criterion for rational choice when preferences are incomplete. Importantly, this ensemble-based refinement is immune to Peterson's (Theory and Decision 78:451-456, 2015) weak money pump argument. Hence, ensemble prospectism ensures outcome rationality. Furthermore, by recognizing the structural isomorphism between mildly sweetened preference structures and Cover's splitting rule in Blackwell's Pick the Largest Number problem (Ann Math Stat 22:393-399, 1951), ensemble prospectism can be shown to yield better-than-even odds of selecting the ex-post higher utility option-despite the absence of all-things-considered preferences ex ante.","[Kaivanto, Kim] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Lancaster University,"Kaivanto, K (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",k.kaivanto@lancaster.ac.uk,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,DEC,2017,83.0,4,,,,,535,546,,10.1007/s11238-017-9622-z,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FN1BM,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415718300005,0

The determinants of IO mediation effectiveness remain poorly understood, partly because prior research has not adequately captured the institutional heterogeneity of peace-brokering IOs. To explore how mediation effectiveness depends on institutional variation, I combine newly gathered data on the design of 13 peace-brokering IOs with existing data on 109 civil war mediation episodes in the 1975-2004 period. I find that IOs with institutionalized capabilities to deploy field missions, such as peacekeeping operations, outperform other IOs as mediators of civil wars, whereas information-gathering capacity does not yield a significant advantage. The results suggest that IO enforcement assistance has a forward-looking effect: the ability to credibly signal, ex ante, that peacekeeping or monitoring forces will be deployed to enforce an agreement, helps IOs shape negotiations long before forces are actually deployed. Reaffirming the credible commitment theory of conflict resolution, the study demonstrates that there is considerable variation among external guarantors, which explains why some IOs can shift civil war disputants away from violent bargaining strategies whereas other cannot.","[Lundgren, Magnus] Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Lundgren, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stockholm, Sweden.",magnus.lundgren@statsvet.su.se,"Lundgren, Magnus/AFJ-8877-2022","Lundgren, Magnus/0000-0002-9961-3645",,,,,73,16,17,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Our research approach combines data from three sources: the industrial census, international and domestic patent records, and leadership biographical information. Using non-linear methods, we find robust evidence that returnees positively influence patenting activity and promote neighbouring firm innovation. Our analysis suggests that market liberalisation and industry policy influence patent application counts.

This aid fragmentation result is robust to the introduction of fixed costs, even if they are improbably large. In equilibrium, smaller donors have less fragmented aid, and behave better from an efficiency viewpoint. We present evidence that our theoretical results are in line with cross-country correlations. Our analysis has important policy implications: First, short of ending donors' maximization of relative aid impact, agreements to better coordinate aid allocations are not implementable. Second, since policies to increase donor competition in terms of aid effectiveness risk reinforcing relativeness, they may well backfire, as any such reinforcement increases aid fragmentation.","[Annen, Kurt] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Moers, Luc] Benin Int Monetary Fund IMF, Washington, DC USA",University of Guelph,"Annen, K (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.",kannen@uoguelph.ca; lmoers@imf.org,,,,,,,34,17,17,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

We calculate two sets of ad valorem equivalents (AVEs) of NTBs using the gravity approach to disaggregated and aggregated Central Product Classification data for 15 Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) agro-food sectors. We find that the AVEs of NTBs vary substantially across products and that using aggregated data primarily results in greater effects of NTBs. In a second step, we incorporate the AVEs of NTBs into the GTAP model to evaluate Turkey's EU membership and conclude that aggregation bias has considerable effects on both the estimation of NTBs and the general equilibrium simulation results. Utilising different data aggregation levels leads to a great variability of trade costs of NTBs and, hence, to misleading trade and welfare effects.","[Bektasoglu, Beyhan; Engelbert, Tanja; Brockmeier, Martina] Univ Hohenheim, Chair Int Agr Trade & Food Secur, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Bektasoglu, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Chair Int Agr Trade & Food Secur, Stuttgart, Germany.",,,,,,,,78,4,4,3,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2017,40.0,10,,,,,2255,2276,,10.1111/twec.12444,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FK2XT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413347400010,0

Foreign ownership generates larger and more prevalent wage premiums than overseas Chinese ownership, but both produce premiums that respond similarly in estimates of determinants. Using the number of computers per worker to measure firms' technology levels, we find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that foreign firms pay higher wages to reduce the risk of worker turnover and the accompanying technology leakage in 76 to 78 per cent of industries. However, this determinant explains only 5 to 6 per cent of the foreign wage premium. We find the most intensive support for the fair wage' hypothesis that foreign firms pay higher wages because they are more profitable than domestic firms and workers in more profitable firms expect to be paid more, otherwise they will shirk. This hypothesis explains an average of 8 to 9 per cent of the foreign wage premiums, with support found in 72 to 75 per cent of the industries. When we consider the best combination of explanatory variables to include in each industry's wage regression, we find evidence consistent with our combined hypotheses in most industries, but we still find large residual foreign wage premiums.","[Greaney, Theresa M.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Li, Yao] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",University of Hawaii System; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Greaney, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",,"Greaney, Theresa/AAV-4374-2020",,China National Social Sciences Foundation [10XJL0019],China National Social Sciences Foundation,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the China National Social Sciences Foundation (grant ID: 10XJL0019) and helpful comments from journal referees and from conference participants at the Asia Pacific Trade Seminar at Sogang University, Seoul, June 2014; the fifth International Symposium on Human Capital and the Labor Market at the Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing, December 2013; and the Midwest International Trade Meeting at the University of Michigan, October 2013.",,23,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2017,40.0,10,,,,,2056,2077,,10.1111/twec.12441,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FK2XT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413347400002,0

To fill this gap, this study analyses holiday travel behaviour dynamics with IMTI usage, based on the life oriented approach. IMTI usage is taken as a separate life domain in this study, and a two-way relationship between holiday travel biography and IMTI usage biography over the life course, is examined after controlling for the effects of residential, household structure, employment/education, and car ownership biographies. Based on the web-based life history survey data, statistical characteristics of mobilities in each life biography are first analysed. Then, different random-effects ordered logistic models are established to investigate the biographical interdependencies from three aspects: intra-domain interdependency, inter-domain interdependency and outer-domain interdependency. The results show that the life biography is not only affected by a personal life course, but also affected by external background of the times. Under the interaction of inner individual factors and outer environment factors, there is an obvious dynamic two-way relationship between holiday travel biography and IMTI usage biography. Meanwhile, residential, household structure, employment/education and car ownership biographies have significant effects on these two life biographies. Especially, the influence of long-term state dependence for different life domains, over the life course, is much more obvious when explaining holiday travel behaviour dynamics and IMTI usage mobilities. Therefore, the life-oriented approach provides a valid method for analysing the dynamics of holiday travel behaviour with IMTI usage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparing actor constellations and policy measures in four different countries (the UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands) and on the EU level, we identify strategies and measures that have been applied to challenge the automobility regime. Instead of creating a new analytical framework for studying the governance of discontinuation, we propose to use three existing concepts, namely the multi-level perspective (MLP), multi-level governance (MLG) as well as actor-centred approaches, combining them into one integrated concept labelled multi-level governance of socio-technical regimes. From this perspective, the European Union is the most active actor in attempts to restrict automobility, especially exerting pressure at the landscape level. However, in spite of various challenges, the automobility regime still remains considerably stable. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A stylized network model is used to study this potential vicious cycle. We derive sufficient conditions for this negative effect to increase overall public transport costs. The new line is only beneficial when there are relatively many users that want to use the new direct line or when the unit cost reduction is sufficiently large.

Short-run inefficiency is the part of inefficiency that is allowed to adjust freely over time for each company, but long-run (persistent) inefficiency remains constant over time, although it is allowed to vary across companies. For robustness check we also consider two additional models in which either company effects are not controlled or these are treated as inefficiency. The production technology is represented by a translog input distance function in all three models. We find that technical change and returns to scale are quite robust across the models. However, the efficiency scores across the three models we consider are not correlated strongly. We conclude that the regulators and practitioners should take extra caution in using the proper model in practice, especially when the efficiency measures are used to reward/punish companies through incentives for better performance.","[Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY USA; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Oslo, Norway; [Lien, Gudbrand] Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, NO-2604 Lillehammer, Norway",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Lien, G (通讯作者)，Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, NO-2604 Lillehammer, Norway.",kkar@binghamton.edu; gudbrand.lien@hil.no,,"Lien, Gudbrand/0000-0003-3424-4401",,,,,49,21,21,0,10,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,SEP,2017,38.0,5,,,,,17,38,,10.5547/01956574.38.5.skum,0.0,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FE2PY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408059400002,0

The results from the empirical models of individual and household commuting travel suggest there is some evidence of longer weekly commuting distances travelled, but shorter total travel times, for more frequent home teleworkers. The findings also suggest that there is no intra-household compensation effect between partners, that is, the home teleworking status of one of the household's members does not appear to influence his/her partner's commuting travel. We also find that some of the observed differences relate to the definition of home teleworker status, particularly with respect to the level of home telework frequency. Despite the increase in the share of workers using home telework at least once a week, from 4% in 2005 to 6% in 2012, the magnitude of the relationship between home teleworking and weekly commuting length and duration does not seem to have changed over the period studied. Although the findings suggest that home telework tends to increase weekly commuting distances travelled (but not travel times), data-related limitations did not allow us to address issues of selection and/or simultaneity bias; consequently we cannot make causal inference conclusions about the nature and size of the relationship between home telework and commuting patterns, and in turn its policy implications.

Our connectivity model incorporates multiple discount factors including capacity and velocity penalties to correct for the quality of a connection. We find that Chinese airports experienced a great increase in air connectivity over the study period. Beijing Capital, Shanghai Pudong and Guangzhou Baiyun are far ahead of other airports in terms of overall connectivity and especially so in terms of international connectivity. However, the growth of some tourism cities and small cities has been stagnant and they suffered losses of connectivity at times. Airport competition measured by HHI, average fare, investment in local city's fixed asset investment and airport facilities, macroeconomic conditions, and population are found to be closely associated with an airport's connectivity. We also find that the presence of low-cost carriers is conducive for air connectivity, while HSR has the effect of decreasing airport connectivity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Typically, only one of the two methods was chosen. We show in a stepwise approach how a combination of both methods can reveal novel results on the determinants of exports and export pricing behaviour. For the case of German beer exports, we show that structural differences exist between markets on which exporters apply either PTM or non-PTM strategies. German beer exporters apply PTM strategies, in particular local-currency stabilization, on those markets where imports are very sensitive to exchange-rate changes. Non-PTM strategies, i.e. full exchange-rate transmission, occur on export markets with insensitive reactions. Apart from PTM strategies, German beer exports are strongly dependent on policy variables such as the introduction of the Euro and the partner country's membership in the EU.","[Dreyer, Heiko; Fedoseeva, Svetlana; Herrmann, Roland] Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Fedoseeva, S (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",h.dreyer@biolandhof-agena.de; svetlana.fedoseeva@zeu.uni-giessen.de; roland.herrmann@agrar.uni-giessen.de,,"Fedoseeva, Svetlana/0000-0001-7345-3009",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [HE 1419/12-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Work on this paper is based on the project What Explains Agricultural Trade of the EU and Germany?

Household expenditure surveys, covering recent household expenditures and including key food groups, are routinely conducted in low- and middle-income countries. These data may help identify patterns of food expenditure that relate to child growth. Objectives: We investigated the relationship between household food expenditures and child growth using factor analysis. Methods: We used data on 6993 children from Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam at ages 5, 8 and 12y from the Young Lives cohort. We compared associations between household food expenditures and child growth (height-for-age z scores, HAZ; body mass index-for-age z scores, BMI-Z) using total household food expenditures and the household food group expenditure index (HFGEI) extracted from household expenditures with factor analysis on the seven food groups in the child dietary diversity scale, controlling for total food expenditures, child dietary diversity, data collection round, rural/urban residence and child sex. We used the HFGEI to capture households' allocations of their finances across food groups in the context of local food pricing, availability and pReferences Results: The HFGEI was associated with significant increases in child HAZ in Ethiopia (0.07), India (0.14), and Vietnam (0.07) after adjusting for all control variables. Total food expenditures remained significantly associated with increases in BMI-Z for India (0.15), Peru (0.11) and Vietnam (0.06) after adjusting for study round, HFGEI, dietary diversity, rural residence, and whether the child was female. Dietary diversity was inversely associated with BMI-Z in India and Peru. Mean dietary diversity increased from age 5y to 8y and decreased from age 8y to 12y in all countries. Conclusion: Household food expenditure data provide insights into household food purchasing patterns that significantly predict HAZ and BMI-Z. Including food expenditure patterns data in analyses may yield important information about child nutritional status and linear growth. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Pesticides and contaminants contribute to various health problems. Children are more vulnerable to the dangers of pesticides and contaminants because as soon as they start eating solids, they consume a limited number of food items, most of which are fruits and vegetables. To protect the health of the most vulnerable part of the population, the EU regulations stipulate that no more than 0.01mg/kg of any single pesticide residue is permitted in baby food. In this respect, the EU differs from most of its trading partners, the majority of which do not differentiate food safety regulations according to the age of the consumer. The purpose of this paper is to compare the EU regulations on maximum residue limits of pesticides to those of its major competitors through a severity index. This index is then introduced into a gravity equationto assess the impact on EU imports of baby food. We find that the EU regulation had a negative impact on the volume of trade but a positive one on the probability of setting up new trade relationships.","[DeMaria, Federica] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [DeMaria, Federica; Drogue, Sophie] INRA, UMR MOISA, Montpellier, France",University of Calabria; INRAE,"DeMaria, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.;DeMaria, F (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR MOISA, Montpellier, France.",,"DeMaria, Federica/P-9204-2019; Drogue, Sophie/L-6936-2019","DeMaria, Federica/0000-0002-1718-1894; drogue, sophie/0000-0001-8819-9998",European Commission: the European Social Fund; Region Calabria (Programma Operativo Regione Calabria FSE),European Commission: the European Social Fund; Region Calabria (Programma Operativo Regione Calabria FSE),"We thank Isabelle Piot-Lepetit (INRA, UMR MOISA) and participants of the ETSG 14th annual conference in Leuven and of the 2nd AIEAA Conference in Parma for their useful comments and suggestions.

This paper fills in a gap in scientific research by presenting the most important traffic and financial determinants for airport profitability, since the majority of scientific literature on airport (financial) performance focuses on efficiency rather than on profitability. Comprehensive airport traffic and financial data for 125 airports in Europe, the United States (US), Canada, Australia and New Zealand for the period 2010-2016 have been used to estimate several fixed effects panel data regression on profit margin. Among others, the results show evidence for the fact that an increasing share of transfer passengers affects an airport's profit margin. In addition, there is no sign of a general LCC effect and just limited evidence for the fact that the market share of specific LCCs affect airport profitability: only an increase in the market share of Southwest Airlines at major airports leads to lower profit margins. Moreover, a quadratic relationship between seasonality and profitability has been identified. It points at the existence of a certain optimal seasonality score. Below that tipping point, a decrease in seasonality leads to higher profit margins. On the contrary, a further reduction of seasonality after the tipping point leads to lower profit margins. This might indicate that no or limited seasonality is a result of capacity constraints and, in turn, leads to increasing operating costs related to congestion. Regarding financial variables, the results especially show significant positive effects of capital cost efficiencies on profitability. Those effects are especially large for airports in the US and for small regional airports. Labour productivity only plays a important role in the profitability of US airports. Finally, the results show that regional O/D airports largely depend on regional economic development and population growth, while the major airports rather depend on global economic development than on an increase in local demand.

However, the reform turned out to be rather unpopular, including among winners. This paper relies on ad hoc household surveys conducted before the implementation and in the following two-and-a-half years to test which factors help explain the puzzle. The analysis uses probit regressions to show that misinformation (a negativity bias by which people with limited information inferred negative consequences), mistrust of the government's ability to implement the policy, and political priors explain most of the (un) satisfaction before implementation. Perceptions improved gradually-and significantly so-over time when the subsidy reception induced households to update their initial priors, although political biases remained significant throughout the entire period. The results suggest several implications with respect to policy reforms in cases where agents have limited information.","[Calvo-Gonzalez, Oscar] World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Cunha, Barbara] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Trezzi, Riccardo] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Calvo-Gonzalez, O (通讯作者)，World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ocalvogonzalez@worldbank.org,,,University of Cambridge,University of Cambridge(University of Cambridge),"Barbara Cunha is a senior economist with The World Bank.

It simulates the market in the recent period at the aggregate level and at the level of the principal categories of labor, on the basis of the decisions of heterogeneous agents, firms and individuals, who interact. These decisions rely on individual computations of profits and utilities, although rationality is bounded in such a complex environment. The theoretical structure that underlies the decisions is the search concept. We apply this framework to the case of France in 2011. The model is at a scale of 1/4700. It is fairly detailed on the institutions of the labor market that constrain the agents' decisions. Finally it is calibrated by a powerful algorithm to reproduce a large number of variables of interest. The calibrated model presents a consistent accounting system of the gross flows of the individuals between the main states, employment, distinguishing open ended contracts and fixed duration contracts, unemployment and inactivity. The simulation of the gross flows accounts enables us to analyze the patterns of mobility in a way that the observed statistics on gross flows, which are partial, cannot do. The model then characterizes the nature of the labor market under study, reproducing the high proportion of the fixed duration contracts in the hiring flows, and it points to a dualism of the French labor market.","[Goudet, Olivier; Kant, Jean-Daniel; Ballot, Gerard] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite,"Kant, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 06, Paris, France.",jean-daniel.kant@lip6.fr,"Goudet, Olivier/AAD-7802-2021","Goudet, Olivier/0000-0001-7040-5052",,,,,54,5,5,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Network planning models include an itinerary choice model that is used to allocate air total demand in a city pair to different itineraries. Multinomial logit (MNL) models are commonly used in practice and capture how individuals make trade-offs among different itinerary attributes; however, none that we are aware of account for price endogeneity. This study formulates an itinerary choice model that is consistent with those used by industry and corrects for price endogeneity using a control function that uses several types of instrumental variables. We estimate our model using a database of more than 10 million passenger trips provided by the Airlines Reporting Corporation. Results based on Continental U.S. markets for May 2013 departures show that models that fail to account for price endogeneity overestimate customers' value of time and result in biased price estimates and incorrect pricing recommendations. The size and comprehensiveness of our database allows us to estimate highly refined departure time of day preference curves that account for distance, direction of travel, number of time zones traversed, departure day of week and itinerary type (outbound, inbound or one-way). These time of day preference curves can be used by airlines, researchers, and government organizations in the evaluation of different policies such as congestion pricing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents evidence suggesting firms owned by President Ben Ali and his family were more prone to evade import tariffs. During Ben Ali's reign, evasion gaps, defined as the difference between the value of exports to Tunisia reported by partner countries and the value of imports reported at Tunisian customs, were correlated with the import share of connected firms. This association was especially strong for goods subject to high tariffs, and driven by underreporting of unit prices, which diminished after the revolution. Consistent with these product-level patterns, unit prices reported by connected firms were lower than those reported by other firms and declined faster with tariffs than those of other firms. Moreover, privatization to the Ben Ali family was associated with a reduction in reported unit prices, whereas privatization per se was not.","[Rijkers, Bob] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Baghdadi, Leila] Univ Tunis, Tunis Business Sch, Tunis, Tunisia; [Raballand, Gael] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; Universite de Tunis; The World Bank,"Rijkers, B (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",brijkers@worldbank.org; leila.baghdadi@tbs.rnu.tn; graballand@worldbank.org,,"Baghdadi, Leila/0000-0003-2079-1113","KCP [TF 014655, P127907]; Economic Research Forum (ERF)",KCP; Economic Research Forum (ERF),"The findings, interpretations, and conclusions expressed in this paper are entirely those of the authors.

So, it may not be adequate to use a general model for all the companies operating in the European market, as the one proposed by the Directive 2009/138/CE. Solvency II is a general regulatory model such that the volume of own resources will be determined depending on risks based on a calibration reached considering the average behaviour of companies. In order to criticize this approach, we have obtained a characterization of the profiles of companies using a PAM clustering methodology, adapted for longitudinal data, and we have studied the evolution of the obtained groups of companies under a Bayesian approach. In this way, we have introduced a multinomial general dynamic linear model to study the probabilities of the companies to be included into each group. The characterization and identification of these groups suggest that an unique regulatory model may be unsuitable. We have used data from DGSFP (Spanish insurance regulator), with public information about the balance sheets and income statements from years 1999 to 2011.","[Albarran, I.; Marin, J.

Scholars have since applied this term to many types of labour, yet there is little clarity or consensus as to what 'invisibility' means and what mechanisms produce it. Through an in-depth analysis of this far-reaching literature, the present article seeks to reconstruct ` invisible work' as a more robust analytical concept. It argues that work is made invisible through three intersecting sociological mechanisms - here identified as cultural, legal and spatial mechanisms of invisibility. Though they differ in function and degree, each of these mechanisms obscures the fact that work is performed and therefore contributes to its economic devaluation. Ultimately, this revised concept of invisible work offers scholars a new analytic tool to untangle the systems that produce and reproduce disadvantage for workers.","[Hatton, Erin] SUNY Buffalo, Sociol, Buffalo, NY USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Hatton, E (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Sociol, 404 Pk Hall,North Campus, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",eehatton@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,91,108,128,8,52,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The article analyses the work of teachers as both productive and reproductive, needing both material and non-material recognition. It argues that in times of radical social change, social groups struggle to determine what value is. The rapid introduction of a neoliberal market economy in Estonia has created a situation where teachers' labour becomes a site of contestation determining what values prevail in society. Based on 24 semi-structured life history interviews, this article combines theories of the value of labour, of professionalism and the anthropological theory of value to argue for the key role that teachers play during rapid change to a societal value regime.","[Keskula, Eeva] Tallinn Univ, Sch Humanities, Tallinn, Estonia; [Loogma, Krista] Tallinn Univ, Vocat & Profess Educ, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University; Tallinn University,"Kesküla, E (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ, Narva Mnt 25, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia.",Eeva.keskula@gmail.com,"Kesküla, Eeva/AAH-8145-2021","Keskula, Eeva/0000-0002-5359-5584",Estonian Research Council,Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council),This article has been prepared and completed within the research projects 'Fundamental Educational Change: vocational teachers as change agents in the course of VET reforms' and 'Teachers' professionality and professionalism in changing context' funded by the Estonian Research Council.,,39,5,5,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The article conceptualises Europarties as transnational actors whose external activities match the pathways of EU influence in EaP states.

The analysis focuses on Smart Grid (SG) technologies which, among others benefits, could save operational costs and reduce the need for further conventional investments in the grid. In spite of the benefits that may result from their implementation, the adoption of SGs by network operators can be hampered by the uncertainties surrounding actual performances. A decision model has been developed to assess the firms' incentives to invest in smart technologies under different regulatory schemes. The model also enables testing the impact of uncertainties on the reduction of operational costs, and of conventional investments. Under certain circumstances, it may be justified to support the development and early deployment of emerging innovations that have a high potential to ameliorate the efficiency of the electricity system, but whose adoption faces many uncertainties.","[Costa, Paulo Moises] Inst Politecn Viseu, Escola Super Tecnol Gestao, Campus Politecn Repeses, P-3500 Viseu, Portugal; [Costa, Paulo Moises] Inst Politecn Viseu, Ctr Studies Educ Technol & Hlth CI & DETS, Campus Politecn Repeses, P-3500 Viseu, Portugal; [Costa, Paulo Moises] INESC TEC INESC Technol & Sci, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, Oporto, Portugal; [Bento, Nuno] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch Govt, Sustainabil Sci Program, Mailbox 117,79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bento, Nuno] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIA CET IUL, Av Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Marques, Vitor] ERSE, Rua Dom Cristovao da Gama 1, P-1400113 Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico de Viseu; Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Instituto Politecnico de Viseu; INESC TEC; Harvard University; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Costa, PM (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Viseu, Escola Super Tecnol Gestao, Campus Politecn Repeses, P-3500 Viseu, Portugal.;Costa, PM (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Viseu, Ctr Studies Educ Technol & Hlth CI & DETS, Campus Politecn Repeses, P-3500 Viseu, Portugal.;Costa, PM (通讯作者)，INESC TEC INESC Technol & Sci, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, Oporto, Portugal.",pau-lomoises@estv.ipv.pt,"Almeida da Costa, Paulo Moisés Moisés/GYJ-1780-2022; Almeida da Costa, Paulo Moisés/H-6057-2019","Almeida da Costa, Paulo Moisés Moisés/0000-0001-6787-3357; Bento, Nuno/0000-0002-5923-0666",,,,,87,7,7,0,14,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,MAR,2017,38.0,2,,,,,149,174,,10.5547/01956574.38.2.pcos,0.0,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EL6JX,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394729600007,0

After checking various socioeconomic covariates, among the deterrent variables, likelihood of arrest and conviction always showed deterrent effects on criminal behavior for different kinds of violent and property crimes. Since property crimes have relatively higher inertia than violent crimes, their associated long-run elasticities with respect to significant deterrence variables are greater, which implies that allocating more resources to increasing the likelihood of arrest for property crimes can effectively decrease them in the long run.","[Ghasemi, Mojtaba] Shahid Behehsti Univ, Family Res Inst, Tehran, Iran",Shahid Beheshti University,"Ghasemi, M (通讯作者)，Shahid Behehsti Univ, Family Res Inst, Tehran, Iran.",mojtaba_ghasemi@sbu.ac.ir,"Ghasemi, Mojtaba/R-1877-2019",,,,,,21,4,4,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The advantage of this approach is that, unlike conventional OLS and Tobit estimators, it produces consistent parameter estimates under conditions of a corner solution at zero and heteroscedasticity. An application to sportfishing evaluates the role of socioeconomic demographics and species preferences on trip spending. The bias from an inappropriate estimator is illustrated by comparing the results from QML and OLS estimation, which shows that OLS significantly overstates the impact of trip duration on trip expenditures compared with the QML estimator. Both sets of estimates imply that trout and bass anglers spend significantly more on their fishing trips compared with other anglers.","[Melstrom, Richard T.] Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Melstrom, RT (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",melstrom@okstate.edu,,"Melstrom, Richard/0000-0001-6420-5425",The Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station; USDA; National Institute of Food and Agriculture,The Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station; USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station and USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture provided financial support for this study.",,28,5,5,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

To provide empirical evidence for this, we present the land price change related to the Japanese government's report on the damage of catastrophic earthquakes and tsunamis whose probability of occurrence is extremely low. While this relationship has been studied in previous research, there are some notable shortcomings. Firstly, the control of the attributes between the treatment group, namely the land in the area where information is updated, and the control group is insufficient. Secondly, the link between rational behavior and the estimation result is not established enough. This study addresses these two points and updates the findings in this regard. We find that the estimated results presented herein match those proposed by previous works, confirming that the established link between the data and rational behavior suggests the importance of accounting for such catastrophic events even if their probability of occurrence is extremely low.","[Nakanishi, Hayato] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Honmachi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Kyoto University,"Nakanishi, H (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Honmachi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",nakanishi.h.aa@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [12J09136]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [12J09136, 15J05823] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful to the editor and two referees for their comments that greatly improved the paper.

According to this idea, state-level pouvoirs constituants may issue an authorization for constitutional decision-making at the supra-state level and thereby bring about a new constituent power whose composition can take a variety of forms. This conceptual framework paves the way for a systematic analysis of the EU's pouvoir constituant and its relation to the demoi of the member states. At the same time, it renders it an open normative question of who should be in charge of EU constitutional politics.","[Patberg, Markus] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Patberg, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Social Sci, Allende Pl 1, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",markus.patberg@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,"Patberg, Markus/0000-0002-2300-7657",DFG,DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Research for this article was supported by the DFG project 'Reclaiming Constituent Power?',,16,12,12,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Many simulation models use greedy algorithms to represent a firm's trial-and-error based exploration (i.e., backward-looking search). This implies that managers always reject changes that decrease performance relative to the status quo. Although we observe significant heterogeneity in backward-looking search behavior, over 50 % of our subjects deviate from greedy search behavior by occasionally preserving performance-decreasing changes. The likelihood of such preservation was inversely related to the magnitude of the performance decrease. While search behavior is likely context specific, our analysis suggests that non-greedy firm search cannot be dismissed outright. Substituting non-greedy algorithms for greedy ones will alter the behavior of some simulation models used in economic research. We recommend that future work in this area report whether key findings are dependent on the use of greedy or non-greedy search algorithms. We also suggest that researchers explicitly discuss which algorithm best represents backward-looking search in the phenomenon under study.","[Tracy, William M.; Markovitch, Dmitri G.; Peters, Lois S.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Phani, B.

Using daily data from 182 markets in seven Midwestern states, an error correction model is estimated and directed acyclic graphs characterize the contemporaneous causal relationships among prices from different states. Empirical results based on the PC algorithm show that three states, Iowa, Ohio, and Minnesota, dominate corn cash prices. Four potential causal paths among the three states also are identified. Given that physical flows of grain are different at different times of the year, the data are divided into storage periods and harvest periods, and a VAR in differences is adopted to model the price relationships. While Iowa and Ohio continue to dominate corn prices during the storage period, the causal flows are mixed during the harvest period. An application of the LiNGAM algorithm refines the results relative to those derived from the PC algorithm and reveals that Iowa, the leading corn-producing state, is the only state that dominates pricing over the crop year.","[Xu, Xiaojie] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Xu, XJ (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",xxu6@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,50,29,31,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The results show that approximately 20 percent of the children in the study area are malnourished and a one standard deviation increase in NDVI z-score decreases the probability of child malnourishment by 12-16 percent.

Nonetheless, little is known about how public transit fare structures relate to social equity concerns. Some transit agencies charge more for fewer rides weekly fares often cost more per ride than unlimited monthly fares, though monthly fares cost more upfront. For some social groups, in particular low-income earners, purchasing monthly passes may place a burden on their budget, and influence them to buy weekly passes instead. In this study, we analyze transit fare purchases of total monthly, weekly, and three or more weekly passes during the month of September 2014 in Montreal, Canada. We discovered that fare vendors in neighborhoods with low median household income and/or with a high proportion of unemployed residents are predicted to sell more weekly fares than vendors in neighborhoods with high household income and low rates of unemployment. Monthly fare purchases were not dependent on income or unemployed residents. Moreover, using smartcard data to track individual fare cards, we found that recurring purchases of three or more weekly passes depend on income and unemployment, so neighborhoods with socially vulnerable individuals are predicted to have more riders purchasing multiple weekly fares than socially secure neighborhoods. Our findings indicate that individuals residing in marginalized neighborhoods are likely to spend more money on transit fares over the course of a month compared to those residing in wealthy neighborhoods. These findings raise concerns regarding the financial burden that the existing fare structure in the city of Montreal imposes, especially on low-income groups. The methodology and findings from this study provide insight for transport planners, particularly those concerned with providing an equitable public transit system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Following a descriptive presentation that traces the German promotion of renewable energy technologies since 2000, we draw on two stated-preference surveys conducted in 2013 and 2015 that elicit the households' WTP for green electricity. Two models are estimated, one based on a closed-ended question framed around Germany's target of 35% renewable energy in electricity provision by 2020, and the other on an open-ended format that captures changes in WTP over time. To deal with the bias that typifies hypothetical responses, the models distinguish respondents according to whether they express definite certainty in their reported WTP. The results from both models reveal a strong contrast between the households' general acceptance of supporting renewable energy technologies and their own WTP for green electricity.","[Andor, Mark A.; Vance, Colin] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Frondel, Manuel] RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Frondel, Manuel] Ruhr Univ Bochum, RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Vance, Colin] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ruhr University Bochum; RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Jacobs University,"Frondel, M (通讯作者)，RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.;Frondel, M (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",frondel@rwi-essen.de,,,Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of the German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 823]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LA1113A],Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of the German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We are grateful for invaluable comments and suggestions by three anonymous reviewers.

The imperfect information game between authors and readers presents several types of Perfect Bayesian Equilibria, including a separating equilibrium in which only authors of high-quality papers are driven toward the open access track.

The analysis will start by discussing a recent focus of the CSR debate on the supply chain of multinational corporations, and evaluate the hotel industry in the light of these increasing social and environmental demands beyond the legal boundaries of corporations into the network of their suppliers. The focus is first on how globalization triggered a debate in which NGOs and consumers confront corporations with new responsibilities. Second, the consequences for two types of hotel businesses - small, privately owned hotels and international hotel chains will be discussed. Third, the author will evaluate the changing social and environmental responsibilities for hoteliers by analyzing well managed and poorly managed CSR issues.

The authors performed evaluation of efficiency of marketing activities of Russian regions by the example of Volgograd Oblast, determined institutional traps of marketing activities of regions of Russia, analyzed their formation and development, and developed instrumentarium for fighting institutional traps of territorial marketing-the proprietary institutional model of development of region's marketing activities. As a result of the research, the authors came to the conclusion that existence of institutional traps is a serious obstacle for efficient marketing activities of regions of modern Russia. A trap was found related to ineffectiveness of the institute of policy in the sphere of support for development of entrepreneurship, ineffectiveness of the institute of corporate responsibility, and institute of social and ecological policy, as well as ineffectiveness of the institute of region's marketing activities as such.

The aim of the paper is to estimate whether liquidity and share of fixed assets has affected usage of external financial sources among hotels. Comparison is made through two ways. Firstly, it is compared the situation between large and medium sized hotels. Secondly, estimated relations are compared among V4 countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia). As the main estimation method it is used Generalized Method of Moments with panel data from financial reports of those hotels. In particular it is used debt ratio, return of equity, liquidity quick ratio, liquidity current ratio and share of fixed assets. International financial database Amadeus has been therefore used for the analysis and in total 1,223 hotels have been analyzed. Estimation period is from 2006 till 2015.

Several recent analyses have assessed the extent to which those policies contributed to the 2006-08 international price rises but only by focusing on one commodity or by using a back-of-the envelope (BOTE) method. The present more comprehensive analysis uses a global, economy-wide model that is able to take account of the interactions between markets for farm products that are closely related in production and/or consumption and able to estimate the impacts of those insulating policies on grain prices and on the grain trade and economic welfare of the world's various countries.

This should determine the scope and purpose of the undertaken improvements, as well as facilitate the selection of appropriate methods and techniques. While in Western-European companies, the process approach and process-based methodologies are firmly established, in transition economies, including Poland, they are not commonly known or implemented. Passive transfer and adaptation of Western ideas, failing to take account of the specific conditions of transition economies, such as Poland, may contribute to the emergence of certain inconsistencies of the re-organized processes. In acknowledgement of the significance of these issues, the main purpose of the paper is to identify inconsistencies of business processes in Polish small- and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The paper presents the results of empirical surveys which enabled the author to identify business process inconsistencies and to analyse them in the context of the companies' level of process orientation maturity. The surveys were conducted among Polish managers from the SMEs. The performed analysis revealed that in enterprises with higher levels of maturity, process inconsistencies primarily stemmed from failure to understand the ideas of strategic alignment and process governance. Meanwhile, the inconsistencies observed in firms which were just beginning to implement the process approach were rooted in human resources and a lack of process culture. A comparison of the obtained outcomes with those of similar studies conducted in Western companies indicates a certain diversity in terms of the types of process inconsistencies occurring in enterprises at higher maturity levels.","[Jurczuk, Arkadiusz] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Jurczuk, A (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",a.jurczuk@pb.edu.pl,"Jurczuk, Arkadiusz/N-7813-2014","Jurczuk, Arkadiusz/0000-0003-2994-8180",Ministry of Science and Higher Education funds; [S/WZ/1/2017],Ministry of Science and Higher Education funds;,The research were conducted within S/WZ/1/2017 project and were financed from Ministry of Science and Higher Education funds,,37,1,1,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,742,751,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300075,0

These methods encompass semi-parametric rule-based methods and parametric Markov switching models. We compare the mean-variance utilities that result when a risk-averse agent uses the predictions of the different methods in an investment decision. Our application of this framework to the S&P 500 shows that rule-based methods are preferable for (in-sample) identification of the state of the market, but Markov switching models for (out-of-sample) forecasting. In-sample, only the mean return of the market index matters, which rule-based methods exactly capture. Because Markov switching models use both the mean and the variance to infer the state, they produce superior forecasts and lead to significantly better out-of-sample performance than rule-based methods. We conclude that the variance is a crucial ingredient for forecasting the market state.

Besides, the influence of preference coefficient on supply chain decisions and results depends on the value of the reciprocal dependency coefficient.","[Lu, Xiao-ling; Qin, Juan-juan] 25th Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China",,"Lu, XL (通讯作者)，25th Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",,"yang, yun/IZE-1092-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71302115],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This paper is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71302115).,,8,0,0,0,1,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-0042,,978-1-60595-495-0,DESTECH TRANS SOC,,,2017,,,,,,,191,194,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BJ8SO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428761200037,0

The evaluation content, on the basis of retaining the necessary examination, has been increased to the learning state, classroom participation, practice experiments and other aspects of the test. The evaluation methods included student self-assessment, student mutual evaluation and other means of performance evaluation. In addition to the course, it would also work with the league to review other aspects of the undergraduates.

This essay considers the liberal phase of Fascist Italy (1922-1925) as a case study to explain austerity as a full-blown rationality, that is intrinsically, and simultaneously, theory and practice, encompassing the moral, the economic and the political. My explanation moves beyond the interpretation of austerity as the post-1980, neoliberal recipe of price deflation and budget cuts. The Italian case draws attention to a neglected connection: that between austerity and repression. Austerity was the guiding principle of the Fascist economic agenda during the 1920s. It served to extinguish the effects of the democratisation process of the post-WWI years. The paper examines the work of four distinguished economists, Maffeo Pantaleoni, Luigi Einaudi, Alberto De Stefani and Umberto Ricci, who - in different roles as professors, journalists, advisors, and policy-makers - can be considered the source, the guardians and the enforcers of Fascist austerity.","[Mattei, Clara Elisabetta] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA",The New School,"Mattei, CE (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA.",matteic@newschool.edu,,,,,,,101,8,10,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

One view is that economic development is a pre-requisite for democracy. Another view is that the emergence of democracy is largely random, and economic prosperity is important only for ensuring democracy's survival in the event of a crisis. This essay contributes to this debate by using public opinion surveys collected over an extended period to examine patterns of economic change and public support for democracy in China and Russia. The results show that education and, to a lesser extent, social mobility and economic attitudes, play an important role in promoting pro-democracy attitudes in both countries. The results have implications for democratisation, with an increasingly large tertiary-educated middle class acting as a potential driver for democratisation in China, and for the return of a free, fair and competitive democracy in Russia.","[McAllister, Ian] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [White, Stephen] Univ Glasgow, Dept Polit, Polit, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8RT, Lanark, Scotland",Australian National University; University of Glasgow,"McAllister, I (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",ian.mcallister@anu.edu.au; stephen.white@glasgow.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J012688/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J012688/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,49,5,6,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JAN,2017,69.0,1,,,,,76,91,,10.1080/09668136.2016.1267713,0.0,,,16,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,EM0UY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395034400005,0

At first, was detected, that in conditions of globalization is very important the task of improving the competitiveness of the economy, which depends on its ability to ensure economic growth. Realization of this task requires financial support that is difficult to implement in countries with underdeveloped economies, especially in the need to respect the concept of sustainable development, which implies more attention to solving social and environmental problems. So, actual problem, nowadays, is to find ways of financial provision of positive changes in the economic development in the long term, especially at the regional level, for reduce social tension and differences in socio-economic development of regions. For filling of local budgets in many European countries contributes the property tax, which can provide the necessary income standards by introducing reasonable considering the financial requirements and property values. The experience of developed countries shows that this tax has the right to life, though the approaches to the tax base vary depending on the specific traditions and characteristics of public administration in the country. Author has been proposed necessary elements of mechanism for property taxation, which have to assist to motivation for replenishment of local budget. The tax base is slightly dependent on the current results of economic activity in the region. Therefore revenues have to be predictable and stable. Therefore, in opinion of author, an effective mechanism for property taxation contributes to social justice and faithful implementation of citizens' responsibilities. At the same time property tax should be counted in proportion to local and national budgets, which will strengthen the finances of local communities and not lose control of the process by the central government.","[Mykolaichuk, Mykola] Natl Acad Publ Adm President Ukraine, Odessa Reg Inst Publ Adm, Odessa, Ukraine",National Academy of Public Administration under the President of Ukraine,"Mykolaichuk, M (通讯作者)，Natl Acad Publ Adm President Ukraine, Odessa Reg Inst Publ Adm, Odessa, Ukraine.",mykmm@meta.ua,"Mykolaichuk, Mykola/M-3942-2018","Mykolaichuk, Mykola/0000-0001-7837-0229",,,,,8,1,1,0,1,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,492,499,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300040,0

Yet, we have little evidence about the nature of trust and its implications for decision-making, in particular in times of crisis. Hence, our article's central question: how does trust matter in the process of decision-making during crisis? Our argument is that uncertainty during the crisis enabled trust-building between the actors: Member States and European institutions. In the case of the Ukrainian crisis, this happened in parallel to the decreasing levels of trust in EU-Russia relations. Consequently, the EU was able to agree and implement the instruments of coercive power. To illustrate our argument, we look at the adoption of EU sanctions in reaction to the annexation of Crimea, the downing of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 plane and the war in Donbass.","[Natorski, Michal; Pomorska, Karolina] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Natorski, M (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance, UNU MERIT, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",michal.natorski@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Pomorska, Karolina/B-7342-2011; Natorski, Michal/AFG-0390-2022","Natorski, Michal/0000-0002-2736-1709; Pomorska, Karolina/0000-0002-9111-1296",,,,,68,30,30,4,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The empirical results are contrasted with the effective allocations of foreign equity holdings of EMU investors, reported in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey conducted by the International Monetary Fund. The analysis indicates that EMU-based investors have a significant weight of foreign holdings invested in other EMU equities and to a lower extent in equities outside EU countries, while the lowest allocation belongs to equities from EU non-EMU countries.

This paper analyzes the urban structure when localized pollution exposure arises from commuting traffic and investigates the feedback effect of endogenous pollution on residential choices. The presence of stronger traffic-induced air pollution exposure reduces the geographical extent and the population of cities. Land rents fall with distance from the city center while population densities may be non-monotonic. Cleaner vehicle technologies reduce pollution exposure everywhere, increase population and density everywhere and do not affect the spatial extent of the city. The paper compares the urban equilibrium with the first-best. The first-best structure is a less expanded city with higher densities at the center and lower densities at the fringe.","[Schindler, Mirjam; Caruso, Geoffrey] Univ Luxembourg, Inst Geog & Spatial Planning, Maison Sci Humaines 2, L-4366 Esch Belval, Luxembourg; [Picard, Pierre] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Picard, Pierre] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",University of Luxembourg; University of Luxembourg; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Schindler, M (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, Inst Geog & Spatial Planning, Maison Sci Humaines 2, L-4366 Esch Belval, Luxembourg.",mirjam.schindler@uni.lu; geoffrey.caruso@uni.lu; pierre.picard@uni.lu,"; Caruso, Geoffrey/S-6613-2016","Schindler, Mirjam/0000-0001-6279-4510; Caruso, Geoffrey/0000-0001-9538-2328",,,,,43,18,19,0,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

How market reflexivity limits fundamental financial reform,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Review,,,,,,Financial regulation; regulatory reform; financial crisis; credit rating agencies; liquidity regulation; accounting standards,POLITICAL-ECONOMY; RATING AGENCIES; BANKING; CRISIS; RISK,"Financial firms' valuation approaches are key to financial market functioning. The financial crisis exposed fundamental faults in pre-crisis practices and the regulations that bolstered them. Critics pointed to reflexivity: financial markets have no solid anchor outside of market participants' assessments, which makes them inherently unstable. Reflexivity implies valuation techniques are performative: they shape rather than reflect risks. Critics thus called for root and branch reform: regulators needed to regain control over these valuation practices. In spite of a flurry of changes, progress on the reforms has been limited in precisely those domains where it seemed most necessary. We argue that this lack of progress does not persist in spite of market reflexivity, but because of it. Public prescriptiveness might mandate widespread use of deficient valuation routines, exacerbating their deleterious performative effects and implicating public authorities in future financial crises. In the regulator's conundrum, neither a hands-off approach to valuation approaches, nor an interventionist stance promises to be effective. Empirically, we show how reflexivity has obstructed fundamental reforms in the European Union in three key domains: credit ratings, liquidity regulation, and accounting standards. Market reflexivity itself is, therefore, crucial to understanding the limited regulatory reforms we have witnessed since the crisis.","[Stellinga, Bart] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Mugge, Daniel] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Polit Arithmet, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Stellinga, B (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",b.j.p.stellinga@uva.nl,,"Stellinga, Bart/0000-0001-5106-5400; Mugge, Daniel/0000-0001-9408-7597",H2020 Societal Challenges [649456]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649456] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,H2020 Societal Challenges; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),This work was supported by the H2020 Societal Challenges [grant number 649456].,,111,24,24,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

A number of models that followed herein were perhaps theoretically more precise. or closer to reality in their assumptions. but also more complicated to calculate. The problem that appeared at the same time. and which has still not been resolved, are certain anomalies which appeared in the capital market that the respective models could not explain. At that point, behavioral finance appears which seeks to explain such anomalies in terms of psychological relationships between the participants in the capital market. This research will try to indirectly test the behavioral elements in the Croatian capital market, following a series of data from 2002 until 2016, with the corresponding sub-periods. It will be done by determining the deviation of the theoretical values that shares should yield, according to the CAPM model, from the real yields that they actually achieved. The hypothesis is that the environment in the capital market will have a significant impact on the applicability of the model for the evaluation of shares. The scientific contribution will be achieved in terms of establishing additional preconditions for the applicability of this model on developing capital markets. This study demonstrated that the SML equation was statistically significant only in 2007, while in all the other years it could not be used to identify wrongly valued shares. Such results confirmed the existence of behavioral elements in the Croatian capital market and its weak relationship with the real economy.","[Uckar, Dean; Benazic, Manuel] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkov, Pula, Croatia; [Pesa, Anita Radman] Univ Zadar, Dept Econ, Zadar, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula; University of Zadar,"Uckar, D (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkov, Pula, Croatia.",duckar@unipu.hr,"Peša, Anita Radman/G-2626-2013","Peša, Anita Radman/0000-0003-3767-0676",Croatian Science Foundation [9481],Croatian Science Foundation,"This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation, under the project number 9481, Modelling Economic Growth - Advanced Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm.

When there are different combinations of origin and destination airports for a city pair, it is important to identify the cross relations among the various flying routes. Here, this study does so using the allocation parameter of the cross-nested logit model and the overlapping error components of the error components logit model. A survey based on the stated preference method was designed to collect travelers' preferences in order to examine the distribution of choices for Taiwan-Shanghai direct flights. The empirical results reveal that airfare and access time are significant variables, and could be used as operating strategies to increase the market share of flying routes. The flying route between the two international airports existed simultaneously within two groups, namely the leading group and the PVG group.

Therefore, in the process of supply side reform in Xinjiang, the overall performance is that the gap between the Xinjiang state farms Construction Corps and the local is huge, the overall effect of the reform in the supply side of the Corps is better. Our findings revealed, if local farmers want to deep reforms in the supply side, they need to move from decentralization to unity, and set up professional cooperatives.

Specifically, we describe a study carried out to analyze possible evolutions of the (domestic) air transport network of the Azores with the objective of reducing the network's operating costs. The changes to implement could involve the flight schedule, the fleet assignment and the route structure. According to the results obtained in the study, it would be possible to reduce the variable operating costs of the network by 16.2%, and, at the same time, improve substantially the level of service offered to passengers (decrease of 17.5% in the average travel time and of 37.5% in the average waiting time of connecting trips), while achieving a well-balanced distribution of impacts across the different islands of the Azores.","[Antunes, Antonio P.; Santos, Miguel G.; Pita, Joao P.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Civil Engn, CITTA, Polo 2, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Menezes, Antonio G.] Univ Azores, Dept Econ & Management, CEEAplA, Ponta Delgada, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade dos Acores,"Antunes, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Dept Civil Engn, CITTA, Polo 2, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal.",,"Menezes, António/AAU-5257-2021; Antunes, Antonio P/E-7845-2011","Menezes, António/0000-0002-2001-1589; Antunes, Antonio P/0000-0002-8265-9225",,,,,35,5,5,0,23,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

To figure out whether downstream prices react differently to upstream price increases than to price decreases, alternative dynamic nonlinear and asymmetric error correction models are applied to weekly price data. This paper analyse the existence of price asymmetries in the fuel market in Spain during the 2011-2016 period. In comparison with traditional asymmetric price theory literature, this paper introduces a new double threshold error correction (ECM) model (DT-ECM) and new double logistic ECM models and compares them with more common linear ECM, time varying parameter models (TV-ECM), threshold autoregressive models (T-ECM), smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models and nonlinear error correction (Logistic-ECM) and double threshold Logistic (DT-Logistic ECM). The asymmetric results found in Spain in the oil sector, show that sophisticated bivariate short-run nonlinearities are present in the gasoline market prices and that those price reactions depend on two main aspects; whether the oil price increases or decreases and on the stage (above of below) of the prices of gasoline relative to their long-run expected crude oil prices (error correction term). Those empirical results are consistent with the economic explanations based on market power-collusion and/or with consumer having search costs.","[Escribano, Alvaro; Torrado, Maria] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Escribano, A (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain.",alvaroe@eco.uc3m.es,"Escribano, Alvaro/H-7997-2015","Escribano, Alvaro/0000-0003-4401-0887","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [10.13039/501100003329, ECO2016-00105-001, MDM 2014-0431]; Comunidad de Madrid [MadEco-CM S2015/HUM-3444]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Comunidad de Madrid(Comunidad de Madrid),"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Funder Id: 10.13039/501100003329, Grant Number: ECO2016-00105-001 and MDM 2014-0431.

Dataset covers the period 1975-2012. Our methodology is based on tests for multiple structural breaks at unknown dates and counterfactual exercises. The results show that inflation and output volatility present an inverted U-shape pattern, peaking at the 1985-1994 sample. Changes in the monetary policy stance and milder shocks accounted for the reduced inflationary volatility (about 50% each, in some specifications). However, some assumptions indicated that a sharp decline in the Phillips curve slope was also important for controlling inflation. Concerning to output, the sole explanation for its volatility fall seemed to be smaller shocks. Therefore, we conclude that a mix of the good luck and good policy hypotheses mainly originated the current period of increased stability in the country.","[Lopes, Luckas Sabioni] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Dept Econ, Av Dr Raimundo Rezende 330, BR-35012140 Governador Valadares, MG, Brazil; [Chauvet, Marcelle] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [de Lima, Joao Eustaquio] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Rural Econ, Av Purdue,S-No Campus Univ, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora; University of California System; University of California Riverside; Universidade Federal de Vicosa,"Lopes, LS (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Dept Econ, Av Dr Raimundo Rezende 330, BR-35012140 Governador Valadares, MG, Brazil.",luckas.lopes@ufjf.edu.br; chauvet@ucr.edu; jelima@ufv.br,"Chauvet, Marcelle/AAG-8251-2019","Chauvet, Marcelle/0000-0002-2548-5679",Brazilian National Council for the Improvement of Higher Education (CAPES) [BEX 9649/12-3],Brazilian National Council for the Improvement of Higher Education (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"We would like to thank two anonymous referees for many helpful comments and suggestions.

To estimate causal effects, I exploit reductions in violence driven by increases in security expenditures during alvaro Uribe's presidency; these resulted in greater violence reductions in municipalities that voted for him in the 2002 elections as he was looking for reelection. I find that firms that face higher violence also face lower output and input prices. Output prices fall more than the prices of inputs, which drives firms to reduce production, and some firms exit the market.

Yet most remain controversial owing to inter alia the arbitrary selection of component weights. Several studies have proposed testing the robustness of rankings generated by composite indices with respect to alternative weights but have not provided sufficient guidance on the choice of these alternatives. This paper proposes a holistic yet theoretically novel approach for selecting sets of alternative weights and assessing comparison robustness that is applicable to linear composite indices with any finite number of dimensions. Our approach is founded on the main normative assumption that a consensus has been reached on the minimum and the maximum allowable weights that should be assigned to the components. This approach is applied to robustness testing of inter-temporal country improvements generated by arguably the world's most influential composite development index, the UNDP Human Development Index.","[Seth, Suman] Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Seth, Suman; McGillivray, Mark] Univ Oxford, Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat OPHI, Oxford, England; [McGillivray, Mark] Deakin Univ, Alfred Deakin Inst, Locked Bag 20001, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia",University of Leeds; University of Oxford; Deakin University,"Seth, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Seth, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat OPHI, Oxford, England.",S.Seth@leeds.ac.uk; Mark.McGillivray@deakin.edu.au,"Seth, Suman/ABE-1498-2020","Seth, Suman/0000-0002-2591-6977; McGillivray, Mark/0000-0002-6461-2706",,,,,24,18,18,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,DEC,2018,51.0,4,,,,,657,679,,10.1007/s00355-018-1132-6,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,HA3NH,,"hybrid, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450158800004,0

However, the ChAFTA fails to relax the major regulatory barriers in China, which will remain the key obstacles to Australia's education services exports to China. Through a preliminary study and a regression analysis of the impacts of the ChAFTA on Australia's education exports to China based on available data, we show that the ChAFTA did not play a significant role in promoting the application and approval of Sino-Australian joint programmes but did contribute to the growth of international student enrolments from China. The effect of the ChAFTA is, at best, secondary to that of domestic regulation and tends to be greater in less regulated areas.","[Xi, Junfang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Weihuan; Wang, Heng] UNSW Sydney, Chinese Int Business & Econ Law CIBEL Initiat, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Xi, JF (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,"Zhou, Weihuan/HDM-5765-2022; Wang, Heng/S-8117-2019","Wang, Heng/0000-0003-2410-6144",UNSW-SJTU,UNSW-SJTU,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the UNSW-SJTU Collaborative Research Seed Grant 2017 on the project titled The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement: Implications for Australian Services Suppliers and China's Services Sectors.

Many studies have shown that electrifying the taxi fleet is effective in reducing roadside pollution and carbon footprint. However, high ownership cost of electric taxis, limited driving range, and availability of chargers are constraining their deployment. Government subsidy has been sought for in many applications, yet the required amount can be enormous and remains infeasible in many jurisdictions. To address these issues, electric taxis are proposed to provide premium services and let all stakeholders share the financial input. That is, a higher fare will be charged to the taxi customers for a higher service quality. The taxi drivers with higher incomes will be able to pay more to rent the electric taxis. With an increase of rental income to the taxi owners, fewer financial incentives from the government will be required. This study aims to uncover the factors underpinning how taxi owners and drivers choose between conventional taxis and the proposed premium electric taxis. Stated-preference surveys were conducted in Hong Kong, and two separate binary logistic regression models were calibrated accordingly. It was found that the (subsidized) vehicle purchase price, rental income, and battery lifespan were influential to the owners, while fare income, the rental cost, the access time to chargers, and the range per charge significantly affected taxi drivers' decisions. An equilibrium model with an iterative solution procedure is proposed to illustrate the interactions between the stakeholders and predict the changes in percentage-of-switch under different policy settings. Policy implications to improve taxi service and reduce roadside emissions and pollution are hence discussed.","[Yang, W. H.; Wong, R. C. P.; Szeto, W.

Scholars have tended to investigate the euro crisis from either a pragmatic and prescriptive perspective - asking which reforms are necessary to build legitimacy in the governance structure of the Eurozone - or an analytical perspective focused on the power wielding of actors useful for understanding what actors have done and why they have been influential or not. The paper argues that rather than bifurcating the issues of legitimacy and power politics, much may be gained by investigating the relationship between legitimacy and power. Specifically, the paper employs the concept of ideational power to analyze the strategies through which actors have sought to defend their claims to three constitutive dimensions of legitimacy - input, output and throughput legitimacy - and proposes a matrix of nine pathways to legitimation that played into processes of legitimacy battles in the Eurozone crisis.","[Carstensen, Martin B.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Schmidt, Vivien A.] Boston Univ, Frederick S Pardee Sch Global Studies, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Carstensen, Martin B.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School; Boston University; Copenhagen Business School,"Carstensen, MB (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark.;Carstensen, MB (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",martinbc@gmail.com,,"Carstensen, Martin B./0000-0002-0432-1632","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, 'ENLIGHTEN-European Legitimacy in Governing through Hard Times: The Role of European Networks' [649456-ENLIGHTEN]","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, 'ENLIGHTEN-European Legitimacy in Governing through Hard Times: The Role of European Networks'","The research presented in the paper was supported by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, 'ENLIGHTEN-European Legitimacy in Governing through Hard Times: The Role of European Networks.'

In addition to the traditional dividend determinants, sector and country-specific determinants such as leverage, asset intangibility, capital intensity (CI), and effective dividend tax rate are used. The estimation results demonstrate that company size, profitability, investment opportunities, and asset intangibility are positive drivers of dividend payout, whereas the leverage ratio and CI deter dividend payout. Additionally, the study provides international empirical evidence for the positive relationship between investment opportunities and dividend payout. This positive relationship, which is regarded as a puzzle, is unique for companies operating in the travel and leisure sector. The identification of unique dividend determinants and the recognition of differences among the subsectors help investors and managers to shape their investment and financial management decisions.","[Bahreini, Mahboubeh; Adaoglu, Cahit] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Adaoglu, C (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Banking & Finance, Via Mersin 10, TR-99628 Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey.",cahit.adaoglu@emu.edu.tr,"Adaoglu, Cahit/R-1795-2019; Adaoglu, Cahit/CAI-6843-2022","Adaoglu, Cahit/0000-0001-5771-9997; Adaoglu, Cahit/0000-0001-5771-9997",,,,,55,8,8,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

An appropriate antidumping duty-nullifying the dumping margin-decreases with the FIT program. We show that optimal FIT increases with the AD duty. Therefore, trade and renewable energy optimal policies may complement one another. Lastly, we introduce R&D activities in the PV sector, and international spillovers.

We find that analysts forecast the PMI poorly and display multiple biases when forecasting. In particular, forecasters anti-herd and anti-anchor. Anti-herding supports a reputation-based notion that forecasters are rewarded not only for forecast accuracy but also for being the best forecast at a single point in time. Anti-anchoring is consistent with forecasters overreacting to private information.

Headwinds include a demographic contraction that will bring negative labour force growth and rapid ageing. Rising aged dependency combined with lower saving rates will rebalance the economy, but they will reduce both GDP growth and real per capita income. While an effective two-child policy could sustain growth and eventually mitigate the aged dependency problem, it would set real per capita income on a still lower path. These conundrums are examined using a global economic and demographic model, which shows how the continuing demographic and saving contractions in China would alter the trajectories of both the Chinese and global economies.","[Golley, Jane] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Ctr China World, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Tyers, Rod] Univ Western Australia, Business Sch, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Tyers, Rod] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Zhou, Yixiao] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Business Sch, Perth, WA, Australia",Australian National University; University of Western Australia; Australian National University; Curtin University,"Golley, J (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Australian Ctr China World, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,"Tyers, Rodney/0000-0003-3080-0415; Zhou, Yixiao/0000-0001-7712-2776",,,,,71,6,6,3,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,3194,3220,,10.1111/twec.12602,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200014,0

Either voters are content to trust their governments, because issues have low salience, or governments react to voters' preferences. How far is this 'supply side' of the theory still valid in the newly politicized world of EU politics? This article discusses the assumptions about representation in the theory, and looks at the conditions under which the assumptions might still hold and what this means for EU politics today. If the representational assumptions still hold in this highly politicized EU world, then the theory would predict policy gridlock. On the other hand, if there is a growing gap between publics and elites, then the assumptions, and the related propositions about the democratic deficit, no-longer hold. Either way, the inherent optimism of the theory is undermined.","[Hix, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hix, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.hix@lse.ac.uk,,"Hix, Simon/0000-0002-3116-5292",,,,,38,14,15,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

By this, I conduct an important, but rarely addressed, step in assessing the empirical relevance of a theoretical new Keynesian model. Another advantage of this approach is that the cycle and trend components of the data are separated when imposing the testable restrictions, such that there is no need to filter the data series prior to estimation. The results show that most of the properties pertaining to the theoretical model cannot be rejected when imposed as restrictions. The new Keynesian model on the labor market is thus found to be empirically relevant. Furthermore, the estimated econometric model explains a large degree of the wage and price dynamics in the USA, such that the paper also provides an estimated macroeconometric model.","[Kivedal, Bjornar Karlsen] Ostfold Univ Coll, Fac Business Languages & Social Sci, POB 700, N-1757 Halden, Norway; [Kivedal, Bjornar Karlsen] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Ostfold University College; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Kivedal, BK (通讯作者)，Ostfold Univ Coll, Fac Business Languages & Social Sci, POB 700, N-1757 Halden, Norway.;Kivedal, BK (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",bjornark@hiof.no,,,Norwegian University of Science and Technology; Ostfold University College,Norwegian University of Science and Technology; Ostfold University College,"The author is grateful for helpful comments and suggestions from Gunnar Bardsen, Tom Engsted, Katarina Juselius, Tord Krogh, Massimiliano Pisani, Joakim Prestmo, and four anonymous referees.

The physicians and dentists within the same hospital were also found to be less integrated after global budgeting. Empirical results show that a joint analysis improves the estimation efficiency from separate analysis and suggest that the aggregate inefficiency came mostly from physicians in hospitals that were small, public, non-teaching, located in small markets and had a low market share.

Wages were highly procyclical during the 1980s and early 1990s, a period characterized by high inflation. As inflation declined wages became less procyclical, a feature that is consistent with emerging downward wage rigidities in a low inflation environment. Compositional effects associated with changes in labor participation along the business cycle appear to matter less for estimates of wage cyclicality than in developed economies.","[Gambetti, Luca] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Gambetti, Luca] Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Messina, Julian] Interamer Dev Bank, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Inter-American Development Bank,"Messina, J (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",luca.gambetti@uab.es; julianm@iadb.org,"Messina, Julian/ABE-9287-2021","Messina, Julian/0000-0002-3635-499X",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2009-09847]; Barcelona Graduate School Research Network,Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Barcelona Graduate School Research Network,"Luca Gambetti is associate professor at Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona and Barcelona Graduate School of Economics; his email address isluca.gambetti@uab.es.Julian Messina (corresponding author) is lead economist at the Research Department of the Inter-American Development Bank; his email address is julianm@iadb.org.We thank Bill Maloney, Daniel Lederman, and seminar participants at the 2013 Latin American Economic Association Meetings for their helpful comments.

Global economic growth, the evolution of the human population, CO2 emissions, and the state of the environment are endogenous. Societal values are the main driver of all economic variables. They determine the different types of investment, the level of aggregate consumption and employment. Societal values evolve over time in response to economic and environmental conditions. The model is applied to generate possible scenarios for the twenty-first century. A baseline calibration generates an average global GDP growth rate of 3.6% p.a. and a global population level of 11.2 billion people in 2100. Mean global temperate in 2100 will be 1.77 degrees C higher than in 1995. These results are probably too optimistic. Sensitivity analyses show how these outcomes depend on various parameters. If values respond to environmental conditions only, global warming would reach 2.5 degrees C and a lower impact of investment in carbon efficiency could lead to average temperature increase by 4.8 degrees C. The model is a novel conceptual framework that can be extended in many dimensions.","[Roos, Michael W.

However, through the Bologna Process, the European Union (EU) has influenced these traditional features and helped to develop an external dimension to higher education policy in and beyond Europe. Despite these significant changes, scholarship on the EU has not yet interrogated directly the external dimensions of Bologna and the influence the EU wields through this process. This article employs Market Power Europe (MPE) as a conceptual framework to examine the Bologna Process and the EU's role in these important changes. Focusing on the notion of externalization, the article reveals the importance of market factors, multiple means (externalization tools) and actors (beyond intergovernmental) through which the EU influences other actors in higher education policy. The findings contribute to the MPE conceptual framework and encourage further research into the causal mechanisms at play in the under-studied external dimensions of this policy area.","[Damro, Chad] Univ Edinburgh, Europa Inst, Polit & Int Relat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Friedman, Yoav] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Bologna Training Ctr, Natl Jean Monnet Ctr Excellence CSEPS, Beer Sheva, Israel",University of Edinburgh; Ben Gurion University,"Damro, C (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Polit & Int Relat, 21 George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland.;Damro, C (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Europa Inst, 21 George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland.",chad.damro@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,65,7,7,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using a classification algorithm, we identify tree canopy coverage in Lisbon, Portugal, to be approximately 8%. Our results have an accuracy rating of approximately 90% highlighting the benefits of this technique in capturing novel forms of data. Using these measures aggregated to the neighborhood level, we explore the impact of open space accessibility and urban greenness on the residential property market in Lisbon. We capture the heterogeneity of open spaces through their size and average vegetation level, and further explore how the greenness of a resident's neighborhood may elicit complementary or substitutability behavior in house pricing relative to proximity to urban open spaces and other urban ecological variables. Our results indicate that proximity to both large urban forests and smaller neighbourhood parks are capitalized through residential prices. These effects are dependent on neighborhood green composition with neighborhoods which have a higher proportion of sparse or low lying vegetation willing to trade-off proximity to parks (where this type of vegetation is abundant) and have a preference for being closer to urban forests (where there is greater diversity in vegetation from the neighborhood). Overall tree canopy coverage is positively valued with a square kilometer increase in the relative size of tree canopy valued at 0.20% of dwelling prices, or approximately (sic)400 per dwelling. These results highlight the importance of capturing the heterogeneity of urban greenery and the interacting effects with the local ecology and the built environment.","[Franco, Sofia F.; Macdonald, Jacob L.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Franco, Sofia F.] ISEG Ulisboa, UECE, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Franco, SF (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.;Franco, SF (通讯作者)，ISEG Ulisboa, UECE, Lisbon, Portugal.",sfranco@novasbe.pt; jacob.macdonald@novasbe.pt,"Macdonald, Jacob L./GNW-5507-2022","Macdonald, Jacob L./0000-0002-3940-4876","FCT (Fundacdo pare a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), Portugal; [PTDC/IIM-ECO/5389/2014]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/IIM-ECO/5389/2014] Funding Source: FCT","FCT (Fundacdo pare a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), Portugal; ; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","The authors wish to thank Jan K.

We call this the gender BMI puzzle and investigate its underlying cause. We begin by studying time trends in Japan, where, consistent with the cross-country puzzle, the BMI of adult women has steadily decreased since the 1950s, whereas the BMI of adult men has steadily increased. We study how changes in energy intake and energy expenditure account for the over-time gender BMI puzzle using the Japanese National Nutrition Survey from 1975 to 2010, which provides nurse-measured height and weight and nutritionist-assisted food records. Because long-term data on energy expenditure do not exist, we calculate energy expenditure using a steady-state body weight model. We then conduct cross-country regression analysis to corroborate what we learn from the Japanese data. We find that both energy intake and energy expenditure have significantly decreased for Japanese adult men and women and that a larger reduction in energy expenditure among men than women accounts for the increasing male-to-female BMI gap. Trends in BMI and energy expenditure vary greatly by occupation, suggesting that a relatively large decrease in physical activity in the workplace among men underlies the gender BMI puzzle. The cross-country analysis supports the generalizability of the findings beyond the Japanese data. Furthermore, the analysis suggests the increasing male-to-female BMI gap is driven not only by a reduction in the energy requirements of physically demanding work but also by weakening occupational gender segregation. No support is found for other explanations, such as increasing female labor force participation, greater female susceptibility to malnutrition in utero, and gender inequality in nutrition in early life.

However, little is known about the effect of long-term discount rate uncertainty on capital investment real option values. This paper bridges the long-run discount rate uncertainty literature developed in climate change economics with the financial literature on interest rate models and real options. First. we derive an Ingersoll-Ross real option model under the assumption of a declining discount rate model (DDR) following Gollier and Weitzman, and show how optimal investment timing is affected. Second, we study the problem of an open oil field with an abandonment option. We find that, compared with DDR, standard models using constant or mean-reverting interest rates undervalue projects and their real options to wait or to abandon. Indeed, results under DDR are more consistent with recent evidence on corporate decision-making under incomplete preferences or ambiguity. The results have implications for both energy investment under uncertainty and climate finance.","[Tandja, Djerry C.

The ZLB model is then exploited to estimate inflation expectations and risk premiums. This entails jointly pricing and decomposing nominal and real UK yields.

Then we explore if like-minded people (homophily) live together and examine heterogeneity within their households. To do this we analyze attitudinal data using multilevel latent class clustering that allows identification of groups of persons and groups of households jointly. Our analysis identifies distinct groups of people with different attitudes towards modes and we do not find strong homophily in attitudes within households. The distinction of attitudes among persons transfers well to the household level giving us the opportunity to identify and test differences among the different attitudinal groups using longitudinal records. We then move to a longitudinal analysis using a small sample of households that participated in more than ten years of the Puget Sound panel survey to explore the sequence of their residential location characteristics, car ownership, and travel. We find in descriptive statistics and in a second application of multilevel cluster models that carpool and transit loyalty persists over time by a portion of car pool and transit lovers. We also find sustained use of cars by car loving households, sustained car use of a neutral in attitudes group, a group of younger households with positive attitudes towards carsharing and sustained car sharing over time, and a possibly disenfranchised older household group lacking access to opportunities. The inclusion in the analysis of the two residential location characteristics (evolution of density and diversity around the household residence) enabled a more complete analysis and a clearer description of household context for both attitudes and behavior.","[Lee, Jae Hyun; Goulias, Konstadinos G.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, GeoTrans Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Lee, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, GeoTrans Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",lee@geog.ucsb.edu; goulias@geog.ucsb.edu,"Lee, Jae Hyun/ABH-9059-2020","Lee, Jae Hyun/0000-0003-4007-7048; Goulias, Konstadinos/0000-0002-7436-9447",University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation (UCCONNECT) dissertation awards; University of California Santa Barbara Office of Research; University of California Santa Barbara College of Letters and Science,University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation (UCCONNECT) dissertation awards; University of California Santa Barbara Office of Research; University of California Santa Barbara College of Letters and Science,"Funding for this research was provided by the University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation (UCCONNECT) dissertation awards, and grants of the University of California Santa Barbara Office of Research and the College of Letters and Science.

The estimation results show that the receipt of intergenerational transfers from parents and/or parents-in-law increases the likelihood of individuals leaving bequests to their children in both Japan and the United States, which in turn is likely to contribute to the persistence or widening of wealth disparities. However, such a tendency is found to be stronger among less better-off households in both countries, and this may help alleviate the disequalising effect of intergenerational transfers on the distribution of wealth, at least to some extent.","[Niimi, Yoko; Horioka, Charles Yuji] Asian Growth Res Inst, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka, Japan",National Bureau of Economic Research; Osaka University,"Niimi, Y (通讯作者)，Asian Growth Res Inst, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan.",,"Horioka, Charles Yuji/AFE-9181-2022",,"Asian Development Bank Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [15H01950]; Asian Growth Research Institute; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Science and Technology (MEXT) Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01950] Funding Source: KAKEN","Asian Development Bank Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Asian Growth Research Institute; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Science and Technology (MEXT) Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The empirical work undertaken in this paper utilises microdata from the Preference Parameters Study of Osaka University's Twenty-first Century Center of Excellence Program, Behavioral Macrodynamics Based on Surveys and Experiments, and its Global Center of Excellence Project, Human Behavior and Socioeconomic Dynamics.

This liability is a function of the portfolio's accumulated depreciation and is driven by different tax rates applied to individual components of the total gain from property sales. These two components are the capital gain resulting from the sale of property at a price higher than its cost and the gain due to the recapture of depreciation taken during the use of the property. Our measure of value is the REIT's net asset liquidation value (NALV). The metric of REIT value currently used by analysts is a REIT's net asset value (NAV), but a REIT's NAV will always be greater than the NALV and therefore overestimate market value, all else equal. Finally, using observed market prices for REITs, we provide evidence that NALVs give superior estimates of REIT market prices than do NAVs.","[French, Dan W.] Univ Missouri, Jeffrey E Smith Inst Real Estate, Dept Finance, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Price, S.

Motivations underlying carpooling for different types of trips,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carpooling; Everyday trips for carpooling; Environmental threat; Public transportation attitudes,SHOPPING PURPOSES; TRANSPORT MODES; ATTITUDES; TRAVEL; MANAGEMENT; OWNERSHIP; INTERNET; SCHOOL; YOUNG; NORM,"Carpooling can be understood as an informal agreement between several individuals to share a privately owned car for a trip and to contribute to its expenses. It represents one of the most appealing strategies for reducing car use since it could reduce the number of kilometres driven by car, save money, and contribute to lowering CO2 emissions. Despite these advantages, and even if accepted and somewhat practiced, carpooling is still underused. The aims of this study are to investigate for which type of everyday trips French drivers use carpooling, to analyze their characteristics, and determine whether the motivations for carpooling are different for each type of trip, as well as to find out whether the motivation changes according to the number of carpooled trips. 634 carpool drivers and/or passengers (aged 19-75 years, M = 43.85, SD = 12.05, 42.7% men) were recruited to answer an online survey. Factual data (socio-demographics, transportation accessibility) and motivational factors (attitudes regarding car use, public transportation, environment) were used to describe and explain carpooling for four types of trips (work, children, leisure, and shopping). Carpooling was most frequently used for leisure trips, followed by shopping, and then by work and children trips. Among the motivations underlying carpooling, most notable were the following: perceived pressure from family and peers (for all types of trips) and public transportation attitudes. Finally, motivations for carpooling use differed according to whether participants carpool for one, two, three or four trips, regardless of the type of trip.","[Gheorghiu, Alexandra] Univ Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Traff Psychol Lab, Bd Carol 11, Iasi 700506, Romania; [Gheorghiu, Alexandra] French Inst Sci & Technol Transport Dev & Network, Planning Mobil Environm Dept, Lab Mobil & Behav Psychol, 25 Allee Marronniers Satory, F-78000 Versailles, France",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Gheorghiu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Traff Psychol Lab, Bd Carol 11, Iasi 700506, Romania.",gheorghiu.anda@yahoo.com,"Gheorghiu, Alexandra/IVH-4830-2023; Gheorghiu, Alexandra/AAE-6523-2021","Gheorghiu, Alexandra/0000-0002-0043-5173; Gheorghiu, Alexandra/0000-0002-0043-5173; delhomme, patricia/0000-0002-0889-6177",,,,,57,39,43,3,22,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The graph concordance measure can be generally used to quantify the empirical relevance of a network in explaining cross-sectional dependence of the outcomes, and as shown in the paper, it can also be used to quantify the extent of homophily under certain conditions. When one observes a single large network, it is nontrivial to make inferences about the concordance pattern. Assuming a dependency graph, this paper develops a permutation-based confidence interval for the graph concordance measure. The confidence interval is valid in finite samples when the outcomes are exchangeable, and under the dependency graph, an assumption together with other regularity conditions, is shown to exhibit asymptotic validity. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the validity of the permutation method is more robust than the asymptotic method to various graph configurations.","[Song, Kyungchul] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Song, K (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I thank the editor and three referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

In the destination country, copayments for patients decrease to a larger extent under indemnity insurance, whereas reductions in public health expenditure occur only under coinsurance. In the source country, copayments increase less under coinsurance, whereas health expenditure is reduced more under indemnity insurance.

In addition to metrics such as income and population levels, socioeconomic mobility has been identified as an important characteristic of the socio-economic fabric of market areas. As such, it is a potentially significant determinant of demand for goods and services, including air travel. Drawing on data from the U.S. domestic airline industry and newly available measures of socio-economic mobility, we empirically discern how the latter affects both yields and passenger counts at U.S. airports. The results offer compelling evidence that greater mobility is associated with lower air fares. In addition, our findings suggest that greater passenger volumes are also lower in areas marked by higher socio-economic mobility, all else equal. Collectively, our results document the significance of socio-economic mobility as a determinant of air travel demand and thereby highlight the importance of considering it in the context of forecasting, demand management and, ultimately, infrastructure planning.","[Hofer, Christian; Kali, Raja] Univ Arkansas, Sam M Walton Coll Business, WCOB 475F, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Mendez, Fabio] Loyola Univ Maryland, Sellinger Sch Business, Baltimore, MD USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Loyola University Maryland,"Hofer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Sam M Walton Coll Business, WCOB 475F, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",chofer@walton.uark.edu,,,,,,,36,8,10,0,12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Using a dynamic stochastic model of urbanization with endogenous demand for property rights over land use, we demonstrate that the costly provision of those rights may result in both residential informality that can persist over time and suboptimal urbanization whereby cities are too small and insufficiently productive. In developing countries, because land administrations in charge of issuing titles are difficult to reform, achieving the second best may require acceptance of some level of informality in spite of the negative externalities stemming from informal land tenure and informal settlements. This may not be easily implemented as urban elites may favor overall welfare-reducing policies that over-evict informal dwellers.","[Cai, Yongyang] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Selod, Harris; Steinbuks, Jevgenijs] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Energy & Environm Team, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; The World Bank,"Selod, H (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Energy & Environm Team, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cai.619@osu.edu; hselod@worldbank.org; jsteinbuksr@worldbank.org,,"Stenbuks, Jevgenijs/0000-0003-3548-2196; Selod, Harris/0000-0002-0886-1265","National Science Foundation [SES-0951576, SES-1463644]; RDCEP project at the University of Chicago",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); RDCEP project at the University of Chicago,"We are grateful to the editor Yves Zenou, two anonymous referees, Gilles Duranton, Matthias Flueckiger, Jonathan Halket, Kenneth Judd, David Palmer, Gulnaz Sharafutdinova, Anthony Yezer and participants to the World Bank/George Washington University Urbanization and Poverty Reduction Research Conference, CSAE Annual Conference, Royal Economic Society Annual Conference, NARSC/UEA Annual Meetings, ISDG Conference on Dynamic Games and Game Theoretic Analysis, Annual World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty and Hull Business School seminar for Useful Comments.

However, there is only scant knowledge about the powers and purpose of this position. This article draws upon theories of legislative organization and committee assignments to assess the question: What individual qualities determine the selection of group coordinators? Using a novel dataset of all MEPs elected to the 8(th) session of the European Parliament (EP), we consider various aspects of MEP professional background, experience in the chamber and interest group ties as potential predictors of this selection. Our findings indicate the particularly strong effect of incumbency in the committee system, as well as professional background for selection. Ultimately, the results bear relevance to the legislative organization of the EP as a legislature with both strong committees and strong parties.","[Daniel, William T.] Francis Marion Univ, Florence, SC USA; [Thierse, Stefan] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Daniel, WT (通讯作者)，Francis Marion Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Geog, POB 100547, Florence, SC 29502 USA.",wdaniel@fmarion.edu,"Daniel, William T/AFL-4007-2022","Thierse, Stefan/0000-0001-8033-9191",Antwerp Consortium on the Organization of Rulemaking and Multi-level Governance in Europe (ACTORE) at the University of Antwerp,Antwerp Consortium on the Organization of Rulemaking and Multi-level Governance in Europe (ACTORE) at the University of Antwerp,"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding by the Antwerp Consortium on the Organization of Rulemaking and Multi-level Governance in Europe (ACTORE) at the University of Antwerp to support research for this article.

We propose a novel approach to estimate intermediate input elasticities of exports by sourcing country. We find that, on average, Japanese export-platform foreign affiliates in Mexico source intermediate inputs from third countries, including the United States and Canada, rather than from Japan and Mexico, suggesting that Japanese export-platform foreign affiliates in Mexico are mainly integrated into the vertical production networks back and forth between Mexico, the United States and Canada. In turn, Japanese foreign affiliates selling domestically in Mexico source intermediate inputs not only within the North American Free Trade Agreement countries but also from Japan. In addition, we find that export-platform foreign affiliates in Mexico use more labour-intensive production than do foreign affiliates selling domestically in Mexico. This suggests that saving labour costs is one of the motives for export-platform foreign direct investment in Mexico.","[Kondo, Keisuke] Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan",,"Kondo, K (通讯作者)，Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Kondo, Keisuke/JKH-9176-2023; Kondo, Keisuke/JQX-0654-2023","Kondo, Keisuke/0000-0002-1613-907X;",,,,,23,4,4,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41.0,5,,,,,1437,1456,,10.1111/twec.12579,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432037100012,0

Speed - density relationship is the foundation of the traffic flow theory and transportation engineering, as it represents the mathematical relationship among the three fundamental parameters of traffic flow. It was long believed that single regime models could not well represent all traffic states ranging from free flow conditions to jam conditions until Qu et al. (2015) pointed out that the inaccuracy was not caused solely by their functional forms, but also by sample selection bias. They then applied a new calibration method (named as Qu-Wang-Zhang model hereafter) to address the sample selection bias. With this Qu-Wang-Zhang model, the result calibrated from observational data sample can consistently well represent all traffic states ranging from free flow conditions to traffic jam conditions. In the current paper, we use a fundamentally different approach that is able to yield very similar and consistent results with the Qu-Wang-Zhang model. The proposed approach firstly applies reproducible sample generation to convert the observational data to experimental data. The traditional least square method (LSM) can subsequently be applied to calibrate accurate traffic flow fundamental diagrams. Two reproducible sample generation approaches are proposed in this research. Based on our analyses, the first approach is somewhat affected by outliers and the second approach is more robust in dealing with potential outliers.","[Zhang, Jin] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Engn, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Zhang, Jin; Qu, Xiaobo] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Wang, Shuaian] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Nanshan Dist, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shuaian] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Chalmers University of Technology; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Qu, XB (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden.",drxiaoboqu@gmail.com; wangshuaian@gmail.com,"Qu, Xiaobo/AAG-4777-2021; Wang, Shuaian/C-3559-2012; Wang, Shuai/HZJ-7466-2023; Qu, Xiaobo/C-4182-2013","Wang, Shuaian/0000-0001-9247-4403; Qu, Xiaobo/0000-0003-0973-3756",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771050],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We want to express our special thanks to Dr. Daiheng Ni from UMass Amherst and Dr. Haizhong Wang from Oregon State University for their data support.

Many applications have been devoted to investigating the impact of new mass transit systems, such as rail infrastructures. However, the implementation of such infrastructures usually takes some time and markets can react with an anticipation effect that can vary according to the different development phases. Moreover, the impact may be different if it acts as a substitute to existing rapid transit services. This paper focuses on the impact of substituting bus rapid transit (BRT) for light rail transit (LRT) services, taking into account temporal and spatial decomposition of the effect of new urban infrastructures using a spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) estimator based on a repeated sales approach. An empirical investigation is conducted for the case of the implementation of the tramway in Dijon (France) between 2008 and 2012 using apartment transactions occurring between 2001 and 2014. The results indicate that the impact of substituting LRT to BRT is partly anticipated at the construction phase, while the cumulative impact returns a complex pattern where the positive effect is mainly concentrated around stations located in the center of the city.","[Dube, Jean] Univ Laval, 2325 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Legros, Diego] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Econ Dijon LEDi, UMR 6307, 2 Blvd Gabriel, F-24100 Dijon, France; [Devaux, Nicolas] UCS, INRS, 385 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Universite de Bourgogne; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS),"Dubé, J (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, 2325 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",jean.dube@esad.ulaval.ca; diego.legros@u-bourgone.fr; nicolas.devaux@ucs.inrs.ca,"Dubé, Jean/L-1751-2019","Dubé, Jean/0000-0003-3445-3449","BQR, University Bourgogne-Franche-Comte; PART, in the Bourgogne region","BQR, University Bourgogne-Franche-Comte; PART, in the Bourgogne region","This research has been partly financed by the BQR, University Bourgogne-Franche-Comte and the PART, in the Bourgogne region.

To this end, we employed a time-series regression model, controlling for various factors that may affect taxi trips, and found no direct evidence that the number of taxi trips, the revenue per driver, or occupancy rates have decreased since Uber entered the market. However, a closer investigation into other dimensions, specifically the degree of dispersion of pick-up and drop-off locations, reveals that taxi drivers have been forced to change their way of conducting business in order to retain their market position. Since Uber has crowded out taxis from the central area of Manhattan, the latter have actively responded by serving customers outside of this area. By increasing their geographic coverage and serving customers that were previously ignored, taxis were able to retain their numbers for trips and market share. Our results suggest that the incumbent taxi drivers actively responded to the disruptive threat of Uber's entry and have consequently provided substantial benefits to consumers as taxis can now be hailed from a wider area of New York. We thus found that the sharing economy has transformed the existing market in a positive and welfare-enhancing way.","[Kim, Kibum] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Baek, Chulwoo] Duksung Womens Univ, Dept Int Trade, 33 Samyang Ro,144 Gil, Seoul 01369, South Korea; [Lee, Jeong-Dong] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Duksung Women's University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Baek, C (通讯作者)，Duksung Womens Univ, Dept Int Trade, 33 Samyang Ro,144 Gil, Seoul 01369, South Korea.",kb.kim@snu.ac.kr; chulwoo100@duksung.ac.kr; leejd@snu.ac.kr,,,STEPI Research Fellowship; Science & Technology Policy Institute in Korea,"STEPI Research Fellowship(Science & Technology Policy Institute (STEPI), Republic of Korea); Science & Technology Policy Institute in Korea(Science & Technology Policy Institute (STEPI), Republic of Korea)","The authors acknowledge financial support from the STEPI Research Fellowship, partly funded by the Science & Technology Policy Institute in Korea.

However, previous works consider simplified linear borrowing cost functions that leads to suboptimal allocations. This paper aims at efficiently solving the leveraged portfolio selection problem with a thorough borrowing cost representation comprising a number lenders with different rates and credit limits. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model for asset and debt allocation considering a CVaR-based risk constraint and a convex piecewise-linear borrowing cost function. We compare our model to its counterpart with the fixed borrowing rate approximation used in literature. Numerical results show our model significantly improves performance in terms of risk-return trade-off.","[Valladao, Davi Michel] Pontif Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ind Engn, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Veiga, Alvaro; Street, Alexandre] Pontif Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Dept Elect Engn, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,"Valladao, DM (通讯作者)，Pontif Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ind Engn, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",davimv@puc-rio.br,"Street, Alexandre/HKV-6109-2023; Valladão, Davi Michel/J-1113-2014","Street, Alexandre/0000-0003-1569-030X; Valladão, Davi Michel/0000-0002-1084-6881; VEIGA, Alvaro/0000-0003-0200-6724",CNPq,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),Partially funded by CNPq.,,28,4,4,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Consequently, mainstream economics assumes people to be sordidly selfish. The teachings of Islam, however, promote social preferences where individuals should be other-regarding and have preferences over social outcomes. This paper replaces the selfish agent with a social agent and presents the results in a theorem referred to as the third fundamental theorem of welfare economics (TFTWE). The TFTWE states that when the selfish agents are replaced with the social agents, market outcomes are Pareto optimal, equitable, and unique. This is an important result which has widespread implications. We show that the TFTWE holds under conditions where the first two fundamental theorems of welfare economics fail and that a Walrasian equilibrium is more likely to exist when selfish preferences are non-convex. Unlike the popular convention, there is no equity-efficiency trade-off. In fact we point to the possibility of reversal in equity-efficiency trade-off.","[Khan, Hayat] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Khan, Hayat] Alfaisal Univ, Coll Business, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",La Trobe University; Alfaisal University,"Khan, H (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Khan, H (通讯作者)，Alfaisal Univ, Coll Business, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,,"Khan, Hayat/0000-0002-1959-0640",,,,,42,5,5,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2018,41.0,3,,,,,723,737,,10.1111/twec.12508,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FY7DH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427021300004,0

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of sukuk issuance on firm performance. To do so, we analyse how stock market performance and operating performance (OP) are influenced by issuance of sukuk and bonds on a sample of Malaysian listed companies. We consider the short-term and medium-term stock market reaction through the computation of cumulative abnormal returns andbuy-and-hold abnormal returns. We investigate the impact on OP by performing regressions and by calculating abnormal operating performance (AOP) so that we can compare how issuance affects similar firms. We find that sukuk issuance generates a negative stock market reaction both in the short term and in the medium term. We also find evidence that issuing sukuk hampers OP. The analysis of AOP shows that sukuk issuers have better performance than their matched bond issuers, but that sukuk contributes to reduce the gap in performance over time. Overall, our results support the view that sukuk issuance hampers stock market performance, but that it is not attributable to a signalling effect on the bad financial situation of the issuer. We interpret our findings as evidence of adverse selection taking place on the financed projects and agency problems stemming from the specific sukuk structuring with stock market investors more reluctant to invest in sukuk issuers.","[Klein, Paul-Olivier] Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France; [Weill, Laurent] Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, Strasbourg, France; [Godlewski, Christophe J.] Univ Haute Alsace, Strasbourg, France; [Godlewski, Christophe J.] EM Strasbourg Business Sch, Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Haute-Alsace (UHA),"Klein, PO (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.",,"Godlewski, Christophe/D-1830-2014","Godlewski, Christophe/0000-0002-1391-1108; Klein, Paul-Olivier/0000-0003-2403-5980",,,,,25,12,12,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2018,41.0,3,,,,,699,722,,10.1111/twec.12509,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FY7DH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427021300003,0

Critics charge that such institutions are too politicized; states condemn human rights violations selectively, based on their strategic interests, while protecting friends and allies. In this view, politicization undermines shaming's credibility and thus its effectiveness. This paper offers an alternative account of such institutions and the mechanism by which they promote human rights. We argue that interstate shaming is an inherently political exercise that operates through strategic relationships, not in spite of them. While states are less likely to criticize their friends and allies, any criticism they do offer is more influential precisely because of this pre-existing partnership. We test this argument through quantitative analysis of the most elaborate human rights mechanism in the international system: the United Nations Universal Periodic Review. We find that states are more lenient towards their strategic partners in the peer-review process. Yet when they do criticize, their recommendations are accepted more often than substantially identical recommendations emanating from other states with fewer strategic ties. Insofar as shaming disseminates powerful signals regarding political relationships between states, these interactions can be meaningful and influential, even as they remain selective and politicized.","[Terman, Rochelle] Stanford Univ, Ctr Int Secur & Cooperat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Voeten, Erik] Georgetown Univ, Edmund A Walsh Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC USA; [Voeten, Erik] Georgetown Univ, Dept Govt, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Stanford University; Georgetown University; Georgetown University,"Terman, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Ctr Int Secur & Cooperat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rterman@stanford.edu; Ev42@georgetown.edu,,"Voeten, Erik/0000-0002-1002-3770; Terman, Rochelle/0000-0003-1987-3613",University of California Institute for Global Conflict and Cooperation; University of California Berkeley Institute of International Studies,University of California Institute for Global Conflict and Cooperation; University of California Berkeley Institute of International Studies,"An earlier version of this article was presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association (San Francisco, 2015), the Human Rights in an Age of Ambiguity conference (New York City, 2016), and the International Relations colloquium at the University of California, Berkeley.

The model specifies duration between events as the first time a latent component of multivariate Brownian motion crosses a random boundary. Meanwhile, another (correlated) Brownian component generates the prices. The proposed estimation method facilitates computation and overcomes problems related to the discretization error in the moment conditions and the non-tractability in the joint probability density function. An empirical application using transaction level data on stocks of a large capitalization company traded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange is illustrated. Estimation results suggest that durations and return volatility have strong persistence and, further, there is a negative instantaneous relation between volatility and contemporaneous duration. The impact of considering the causality relation between volatilities and durations on instantaneous volatility estimate are also investigated.","[Purwono, Yogo; Ekaputra, Irwan Adi; Husodo, Zaafri Ananto] Univ Indonesia, Fac Econ & Business, Depok, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Purwono, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Fac Econ & Business, Depok, Indonesia.",yogo.purwono@ui.ac.id,"Purwono, Yogo/GQQ-9332-2022; Ekaputra, Irwan Adi/W-3323-2019; Husodo, Zaafri/AID-1141-2022","Ekaputra, Irwan Adi/0000-0003-2623-0544; Husodo, Zaafri/0000-0002-7127-0775; Purwono, Yogo/0000-0003-2499-8023","Directorate of Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture [1414.29/E4.4/2013]","Directorate of Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture","We kindly acknowledge financial support from the Directorate of Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture (Grant No. 1414.29/E4.4/2013).

Joint disposability is assumed between the bad output and the polluting input, rather than weak disposability and null jointness between the good and bad outputs. Moreover, we set up an integrated DEA optimization problem over the intersection of these two subtechnologies to measure the efficiency of a firm that produces a bad output alongside the good output. In an empirical illustration of our methodology, we use country-level data for an unbalanced panel of 64 countries over the years 1986 through 2011 where per capita GDP is the good and per capita emission is the bad output.

Using the framework of focus-weighted utility we show that consumers might take out loans even when that yield them negative utility due to the focusing bias. We suggest, however, that this can be counterbalanced and consumers might be more prudent in their decisions and less likely to take out such loans when the usual fixed-installments plan is coupled with an equivalent decreasing-installments option. Moreover, we show that this is true even for loans with prepayment options or when borrowers take default into consideration.

We develop a formal model to explain how these mechanisms affect the capital invested abroad by heterogeneous firms. The Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) integration of 2007 is used to quantify the effect of EMI on FDI empirically. Gravity estimates on a global dataset including bilateral FDI data show that the integration of Portugal and Spain's electricity market increased both the amount of FDI's participants and the number of foreign projects. In line with our theoretical expectations, our estimates show that the increase of FDI is mainly due to the reduction in price dispersion. However, the institutional credibility signal sent by MIBEL had a greater influence than expected by the actual price reduction. Furthermore, we also observe a positive increase in FDI from neighboring countries (in this instance, France), albeit lower in magnitude.","[Costa-Campi, Maria T.; Paniagua, Jordi; Trujillo-Baute, Elisa] Chair Energy Sustainabil UB, Barcelona, Spain; [Costa-Campi, Maria T.; Trujillo-Baute, Elisa] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Costa-Campi, Maria T.; Trujillo-Baute, Elisa] Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, Barcelona, Spain; [Paniagua, Jordi] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Valencia, Spain; [Paniagua, Jordi] Inst Int Econ UJI, Valencia, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Valencia,"Paniagua, J (通讯作者)，Chair Energy Sustainabil UB, Barcelona, Spain.;Paniagua, J (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Valencia, Spain.;Paniagua, J (通讯作者)，Inst Int Econ UJI, Valencia, Spain.",jordi.paniagua@uv.es,"Paniagua, Jordi/H-6353-2015; Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/P-2285-2019","Paniagua, Jordi/0000-0002-8859-0775; Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/0000-0002-6328-3242","Chair of Energy Sustainability (IEB, UB); Generalitat de Catalunya [2017-SGR-739]; Spanish Ministry of Economy (MINECO/FEDER, UE) [ECO2015-69107-R]; FUNSEAM; MINECO [ECO2015-68057-R]; Generalitat Valenciana [GV/2017/052]","Chair of Energy Sustainability (IEB, UB); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Economy (MINECO/FEDER, UE); FUNSEAM; MINECO(Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF))","We are very grateful to editor David Broadstock and two anonymous referees for excellent comments that enhanced the manuscript substantively.

Some factors including formal education, production facilities access, market prices, and cosmopolitan levels led to the different application of organic rice SOPs. Conversely, the age of farmers, non-formal education, organic rice farming experience, and land area did not result in different SOP application of organic rice. It is recommended that farmers make dikes, use fertilizer when seeding, and have a good irrigation regularly.

Testing the Role of Ideology on FOMC Voting Behaviour",NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fed; monetary policy; FOMC; central bank independence; dissent; ideological bias; educational training; freshwater; saltwater; economics science,PREFERENCES; IDEAS; MEMBERS; BANK,"This research is trying to shed light on two myths that are usually widespread: the first one being the idea of the academic economist as a neutral scientist finding uncontestable consensual truths, thanks to uncontestable empirical methods, the second, the idea of the central banker as a Weberian neutral bureaucrat setting aside personal beliefs to act mechanically for the common good. Deconstructing this neutrality illusion', this work argues that economics is actually a divided and ideologically marked discipline despite its aim at natural-science-type-legitimacy. It argues in a related discussion that such ideological bias also impedes a purely neutral conduct of monetary policy, undermining the very idea of central bank independence. Linking these two arguments, it argues that graduate training in economics is the first place for the formation of biased preferences, because of the substantial ideological sorting that exists across universities. Using a unique database on FOMC members' votes and ideology, the paper tests this idea empirically and despite unavoidable caveats, finds robust evidence of a systematic impact of the ideological features of their alma mater on FOMC members' voting behaviour - impact that we found more important than the other traditional determinants of central bankers' actions.","[Lepers, Etienne] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London, England; [Lepers, Etienne] Sci Po, Paris Sch Int Affairs, Paris, France",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Lepers, E (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London, England.;Lepers, E (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris Sch Int Affairs, Paris, France.",etienne.lepers@oecd.org,,"Lepers, Etienne/0000-0002-2500-9066",,,,,70,6,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Although Throughput Accounting has not yet become widespread, it is one of the contemporary cost accounting methods whose importance in decision making has been growing. Despite the many drawbacks, there is an increasing interest in its use as it focuses on increasing profits. The fact that the subject of the paper falls under the field of management accounting is a further indication that Throughput Accounting has become increasingly important in decision making. Given that this method has not yet been sufficiently explored in Croatian literature, the paper aims at presenting its basic concepts, characteristics, specificities, and application. A historical overview of the development of Throughput Accounting is given in which the definition and the development of the method related to the Theory of Constraints are explained. The basic concept and the purpose of this method are described, followed by an example of its use, and main ratios. The purpose, advantages, and disadvantages of the method are discussed in a separate chapter.

These changes are causing the population structure to shift in size with an increasing elderly cohort compared to working-age individuals between the ages of 15 and 65 years. The inferred assumption is that this change may have detrimental effects on the labour market by creating shortages of labour resources. The paper analyses the relationship between the labour market requirements for workers and the demographic ageing process as it evolves over time causing a shift in the structure of Romania's population. This paper also looks at the main consequences that might arise in the near future both social and economic dimensions. The methodological research consists of statistical methods, utilizing datasets of official statistics. The expected results are that changes in the demographic structure brought by an ageing population will cause a decrease in the supply of workers, causing shortages over time.","[Sala, Lucian Adrian] Univ Craiova, Doctoral Sch Econ Sci, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Sala, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Doctoral Sch Econ Sci, Craiova, Romania.",sala_lucian@yahoo.com,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,283,292,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300029,0

The goal of this research is to develop a method of MBTI model implementation to create an optimal structure of an acmeological-invariant Organization management as an instrument of break-through innovations incorporation. A complex system of a project group creation is represented in the research. Its goal is to initiate and successfully realize break-through innovations, based on the example of JSC Pharmaceutical company Darnitsa. A described system is based on the realization of a 4-phase algorithm. The goal of acmeological-invariant Organization management structure development is to obtain such an organization structure, where an interaction between its separate elements will lead to a new level of an overall organization development. An economic-mathematical evaluation was conducted in order to identify project group members interaction efficiency (according to their new project roles). The purpose of this evaluation is an empirical relationship validation between new structure components relevance. As a next step, a clusterization of possible staffing combination variants of the project group was carried out, it was based on the results of the evaluation of interaction level between project group members according to their functional responsibilities. The choice of the most optimal organization structure was done with the help of ANOVA toolkit. A conducted research proves that the application of MBTI model is a logical continuation of the process called to amplify and deepen non-standard solutions to successfully initiate and realize break-through innovations. A creation of a principally new optimized organization structure is a key to success in a progressive development path, where balanced staffing serves as one of its invariants.","[Shcherbak, Olena] Procter&Gamble, Igorevskaya St 13-5a, UA-04070 Kiev, Ukraine; [Ganushchak-Efimenko, Liudmyla; Kulak, Nataliia] Kyiv Natl Univ Technol & Design, Nemirovich Danchenko St 2, UA-01011 Kiev, Ukraine",Procter & Gamble; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Kyiv National University of Technologies & Design,"Shcherbak, O (通讯作者)，Procter&Gamble, Igorevskaya St 13-5a, UA-04070 Kiev, Ukraine.",shcherbak.o@pg.com; glm5@ukr.net; nkulak@meta.ua,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,35,43,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300005,0

However, despite its ethnic and cultural diversity, the republic's authorities have consistently sought to promote a unified concept of Dagestani identity. This policy has been challenged by local ethnic nationalists concerned about the future of their ethnic communities, which they saw as being endangered by assimilation and marginalisation. This struggle to secure political and social benefits began in the Soviet period and reached its height in the early 1990s. Resentment was particularly widespread among the Kumyks and Lezgins. Their dissatisfaction with the status quo resulted in a competition between inclusive (national) and exclusive (ethnic) approaches, which in turn manifested themselves in debates over historiography.

Some scholars also claim that outside' lobbying such as appealing to the US public through media and advertising campaigns is also critical especially for free trade success. Yet, little crossover exists between the trade literature on lobbying and the emerging IR foreign policy literature on narratives and how policy-maker stories' impact outcomes. This article helps rectify this gap by demonstrating how US pro-trade public lobbying campaigns rely on national identity narratives to successfully appease and appeal to the public and thus facilitate passage in Congress even when partner countries are negatively perceived. The article examines two cases of US trade liberalization campaigns with China and Russia to analyze how the negative domestic perception of the two potential partner countries impacted pro-trade narratives and shaped outside' lobbying strategies. Drawing on recent foreign policy literature on narratives and national identity, this article demonstrates how domestic actors rely on existing country images - even when negative - to emotionally empower trade policy arguments and ironically glean legislative success.","[Skonieczny, Amy] San Francisco State Univ, Int Relat, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Skonieczny, A (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Int Relat, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",,"Skonieczny, Amy/T-4271-2019",,,,,,79,16,17,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

At the same time, the northern Member States' deliberate - yet widely under-researched - non-use' of Europe, such as using and maximizing national leeway, has been an equally important strategy to reduce migratory pressure and achieve higher return rates.","[Slominski, Peter] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Trauner, Florian] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium",University of Vienna; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Slominski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Inst European Integrat Res, Strohgasse 45 Top Floor, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",peter.slominski@univie.ac.at,"Slominski, Peter/AAP-7055-2020","Slominski, Peter/0000-0001-6403-5833; Trauner, Florian/0000-0001-5044-6818",,,,,91,58,62,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Financial analysis is actually a synthesis of financial data with which we try to identify economic trends, determine financial policies and guidelines, create financial plans for the future and identify potential projects and investments. Such analysis are mostly performed for companies, yet other organizations, states or projects can also be covered everything that involves financial flows in their activities. The aim of the financial analysis is to check whether the company which is the subject of the analysis is solvent, liquid or profitable (viable), For that purpose, the analyst performing the analysis checks various financial data. However, the core focus of analysis are three basic financial statements - income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. Most common subject of financial analysis is the business result, the financial position and the cash flow of the company. All reports present business operations in their own way, yet they complement each other, so they need to be studied as a whole. The basic purpose of the analysis is to gain a clear picture of the company's financial situation. The results of financial analysis can be the basis for making economic decisions of a wider circle of useful information. As a state-owned enterprise Croatian Railways (HZ) are often referred to as media topics. Croatian Railway (HZ) operations and its components are in the public focus as a synonym for public good that should be in the benefit of all taxpayers of the Republic of Croatia.

The demand for environmental information and corporate social responsibility by both internal and external users has contributed to the development of the concept of environmental accounting': It is a concept that, in addition to the environmental and socially responsibility component, also covers the economic component that is reflected through economic viability and financial performance. By analysing secondary data or the annual financial statements (for the year 2017) of the companies listed on Zagreb Stock Exchange, it will be determined to which extent the environmental accounting information is represented.

This paper highlights strategic dimensioning and sectoral specialization in tourism through the appropriate allocation of available tourism resources as a significant aspect when implementing the concept of Smart Tourism Destination, The specialization of tourism market and the identification of market niches within the tourism sector results in specialized tourist products. From this aspect, tourism destinations are able to utilize synergies between strategic planning, specializing and recognizable tourist products and market competitiveness when implementing the concept of Smart Tourism Destination. The priority is therefore given to install information technology into the business processes of many actors as possible in order to form a tourism supply. Tourism supply of a Smart Tourism Destination based on the sectoral technology platform provides benefits for tourist as well as for the domestic people. This paper seeks to fill the research gap by identifying the challenges of successful conceptualization and implementation of the Smart Tourism Destination, above all from the aspect of strategic planning and recognizable specialization in tourism.

We find that Russians prefer to give directly to people in need rather than to NGOs; the donations are small, spontaneous, and irregular; they are mainly targeted to supporting the poor and the sick. Involvement in religious activities and higher self-assessed income are two factors that contribute most to the probability of donating. Educated and younger donors are more likely to donate to NGOs compared to donating to particular people/families.

Furthermore, we find that the ratchet price mechanism disappears once the currency substitution is completed. These findings provide new evidence of the effect of anchoring on a market whose transactions involve substantial, long-term economic consequences.","[Ben-Shahar, Danny] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Management, Alrov Inst Real Estate Res, IL-6139001 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Golan, Roni] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Ctr Urban & Reg Studies, IL-32000 Technion City Haifa, Israel",Tel Aviv University; Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Ben-Shahar, D (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Management, Alrov Inst Real Estate Res, IL-6139001 Tel Aviv, Israel.",bdanny@post.tau.ac.il; rgolan@tx.technion.ac.il,,,Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research,Alrov Institute for Real Estate Research,"The authors thank Thomas Bechtle, Danny Czamanski, Ayala Cohen, Daniel Felsenstein, Doron Kliger, David Genesove, Eldad Yechiam, Dan McMillen, Andrea Tambalotti, Yossi Yakhin, and participants of the 2014 Israel Regional Science meetings, the 2014 Israel Economic Association meetings, the 2014 Israel Real Estate and Urban Economics International Symposium, and the 2015 American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association meetings for helpful comments.

If interest groups care mainly about current, or short-run, policy outcomes, they will make campaign contributions to ideologically neutral politicians who are often pivotal voters in the legislature. However, if interest groups care more about future, or long-run, policy outcomes, they have an incentive to help ideologically strong politicians who share similar policy preferences to win the election. Thus, liberal (conservative) interest groups will make campaign contributions to liberal (conservative, respectively) politicians. Using data on the amount of campaign contributions given by interest groups to the members of the US House of the Representatives in the 111th Congress (2009-2010), I show that ideologically neutral politicians receive more campaign contributions from interest groups. This result suggests that interest groups are primarily motivated by the short-run incentive.","[Choi, Sungmun] Korea Inst Publ Finance, 1924 Hannuri Daero, Sejong, South Korea",,"Choi, S (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Publ Finance, 1924 Hannuri Daero, Sejong, South Korea.",evenschoi@gmail.com,"Choi, Sungmun/GYQ-8342-2022","Choi, Sungmun/0000-0003-1982-5435",,,,,28,2,2,1,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

By using two complementary empirical strategies, instrumental variables and matching procedures, we find that the imposition of Public Service Obligations does not seem to be effective in reducing prices. Furthermore, we find that prices are higher on routes where only island residents enjoy subsidies, but not on routes where subsidies do not discriminate between residents and non-residents. Finally, prices seem to be higher on routes with flat rates in contrast to routes where subsidies to residents are made through fare discounts. Overall, the results of our analysis suggest the need to change policies in order to support air services to islands and to avoid distortions in the market fares offered by airlines.","[Fageda, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Luis Jimenez, Juan] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Despacho D 2-12, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Valido, Jorge] Univ Europea Canarias, Inocencio Garcia 1, La Orotava 38300, Spain; [Fageda, Xavier] Univ Navarra, IESE Business Sch, Publ Private Sect, Res Ctr, Pamplona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Jiménez, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Despacho D 2-12, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",xfageda@ub.edu; juanluis.jimenez@ulpgc.es; jorge.valido@universidadeuropea.es,"Fageda, Xavier/F-6635-2018","Fageda, Xavier/0000-0001-8526-8169; Valido, Jorge/0000-0002-0815-4739; Jimenez Gonzalez, Juan Luis/0000-0002-3808-2588",Spanish Ministry of Innovation [ECO2015-69193-R],Spanish Ministry of Innovation(Spanish Government),The authors are grateful to Daniel Albalate and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

With the OCM as a shock event, subsequent responses may be conceptualised as having three different phases. Phases One and Two refer to chaos at an adverse event's initial outbreak, and the subsequent state of flux. Phase Three may or may not exist; it sets in when people in the society accept these adaptations as longer-term arrangements. Fragmented data and information about the severe disruptions and ensuing changes of the transport system during and after this shock event have been carefully assembled and systematically analysed in relation to the actions and adaptations made by the Government, the industry and the general public. With increasing urbanisation, all stakeholders, including city governments, the industry and the general public, need to be more prepared for large-scale disruptions caused not just by natural hazards but also human beings. Government actions alone are not sufficient. Speedy and concerted responses of the industry. are indispensable in achieving transport resilience. Effective dissemination of information through different channels is critical. Moreover, there needs to be concrete steps towards establishing Key Resilience Performance Indicators for cities, covering both the hardware and software components of a transport system.","[Loo, Becky P.

The trade-off between travel time and safety,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; CONTINGENT VALUATION; STATED PREFERENCE; STATISTICAL LIFE; MIXED LOGIT; AGE; VALUES,"Transport policy decisions often involve a trade-off between travel time and safety. Transport economists generally evaluate the societal value of transport policy options involving travel time versus safety trade-offs in a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) through multiplying the expected change in traffic casualties with the value of a statistical life (VOSL) and multiplying the changes in travel time with the (marginal) value of time (VOT). The dominant empirical approach to infer the VOSL and the VOT is based on stated preference experiments in which respondents are asked to make choices between (hypothetical) routes which differ in terms of various characteristics (e.g. travel time and number of fatal accidents per year). This approach towards inferring the VOT and the VOSL has been criticized by scholars who argue that individuals' preferences as consumer of mobility inferred through (hypothetical) route choices may be a poor proxy for how the same individuals in their role of citizen believe that government should trade-off safety and travel time. This study investigates the extent to which individuals indeed do have different preferences as consumer and citizen when trading off travel time and safety, by conducting five stated choice experiments in which respondents are asked to choose between hypothetical routes as consumer or hypothetical routes/policy options as citizen. Our results suggest that individuals in their role as citizen assign substantially more value to safety than travel time when compared to their consumer choices. We believe that this paper could fuel a debate about whether or not the VOT and VOSL inferred from choices individuals make as a car driver are the single most relevant metrics for the valuation of expected changes in traffic casualties and travel time in the appraisal of transport-related government policy options.","[Mouter, Niek; van Cranenburgh, Sander; van Wee, Bert] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Transport & Logist Grp, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Mouter, N (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Transport & Logist Grp, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands.",n.mouter@tudelft.nl,,,province of Limburg (the Netherlands),province of Limburg (the Netherlands)(Netherlands Government),We thank four anonymous reviewers for their useful suggestions to improve our paper.

Theory strongly suggests this reasoning may be flawed: reducing the tax on capital reduces its cost and therefore incents a substitution away from labor. This study is the first effort to estimate the employment impact of exempting tangible personal property from the property tax in the manufacturing sector in Ohio. Using the synthetic control method, we find that manufacturing employment in Ohio is lower than what it would have been had the tax not been eliminated. From our preferred model, the estimated effect is 19,300 fewer jobs per year on average, but we consider other models that produce estimates between 13,400 and 28,400 fewer jobs per year, on average.","[Mughan, Sian] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA; [Propheter, Geoffrey] Univ Colorado, Sch Publ Affairs, 1380 Lawrence St,500, Denver, CO 80204 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Propheter, G (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Sch Publ Affairs, 1380 Lawrence St,500, Denver, CO 80204 USA.",geoffrey.propheter@ucdenver.edu,,"Mughan, Sian/0000-0003-2404-7463",,,,,49,7,7,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This pattern is partially attributed to differences in nutritional intake, with the poor eating the least healthy diets. This paper examines whether there is an SES gradient in one specific aspect of nutrition: fast-food consumption. Fast food is generally high in calories and low in nutrients. We use data from the 2008, 2010, and 2012 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to test whether adult fast-food consumption in the United States falls as monetary resources rise (n = 8136). This research uses more recent data than previous fast-food studies and includes a comprehensive measure of wealth in addition to income to measure SES. We find little evidence of a gradient in adult fast-food consumption with respect to wealth. While adults in the highest quintile are 54.5% less likely to report fast-food consumption than those in the lowest quintile, adults in the second and third quintiles are no less likely to report fast food-food intake than the poorest. Contrary to popular belief, fast-food consumption rises as income rises from the lowest to middle quintiles. The variation in adult fast-food consumption across income and wealth groups is, however, small. Those in the wealthiest quintile ate about one less fast-food meal on average than those in the lowest quintile. Other factors play a bigger role in explaining fast-food consumption: reading ingredient labels is negatively associated while soda consumption and hours of work are positively associated with fast-food consumption.

Notably, this period encompasses an era in which widespread adoption of mechanical refrigeration facilitated the ability to store otherwise perishable commodities. This development in turn altered observed price dynamics for many perishables, including fresh eggs. We use a class of time series models, time varying autoregressions (TVARs), to document both the structural change and the corresponding impact on spatial price dynamics for U.S. regional egg price relationships during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Our results reveal that, while spatially distinct markets remained integrated, the opportunity to store eggs over time often resulted in weaker spatial price relationships for eggs.

Based on the premise that leveraging accessibility concepts to address public involvement challenges could promote their adoption in planning practice, this research investigates mechanisms to promote social learning among participants in public workshops. Potential mechanisms of learning include specific tool-based interactions and how such interactions reinforce structures of learning such as alignment and imagination. This paper details iterative testing of these mechanisms with a tool called CoAXs (short for Collaborative ACCESSibility-based stakeholder engagement system), through focus groups and exploratory workshops. A mixed-methods analysis of the workshops supports the expectation that alignment and imagination correlate positively with social learning, as measured by reported teaming and dialog quality. Specific interactions with the accessibility-based features of CoAXs in turn correlate positively with alignment and imagination, at individual and group levels of analysis. These findings, while not robustly generalizable, suggest that effective targeted stakeholder engagement for public transport can be structured around collaborative accessibility mapping. Adoption for broader public participation requires further development, especially the incorporation of actual day-to-day experiences such as unreliable operations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, as decades of academic studies show, their use is riddled with barriers and bottlenecks. Academic studies generated insight in these bottlenecks and identified a number of directions to bridge the implementation gap. Most notably, the transparency, flexibility and interactivity of PSS needed to be enhanced to align the instruments more with the dynamic characteristics of urban strategy-making processes. However, PSS developers do not seek instrumental use only; they seek to increase the quality of planning through this use. Accordingly, academic analysis should go beyond the user-friendliness of the PSS themselves. There are a number of studies that focus on the relations between PSS and planning quality. This paper aims to construct links between these studies of usefulness and the body of knowledge on user-friendliness. To do so, it operationalizes the characteristics of user-friendliness and the potential added value that PSS have on the qualities of planning (specifically the strategy-making phases). Consequently, the relations between these concepts are further explored. Five experiments measured user-friendliness and usefulness indicators of different PSS and explored the relations between these two concepts. The findings indicate high user friendliness across the board, while usefulness was only found in very limited cases and for very limited dimensions (notably Insight and Consensus). The correlations between the perceived user-friendliness and usefulness on different planning qualities reveal that for the.self-reported Enthusiasm of participants all user-friendliness indicators have a positive effect. For perceived gains in Insight, only Credibility and Clarity of output have a significant positive effect.

In particular, the results show that segmenting passengers by their operational exposure may generate demand, even in a fairly standardized service operations industry, such as the airline industry.

The analysis shows that the bias potential is nonlinear and asymmetric in relation to the subject hotel's revenues, and uses this revealed asymmetry to prove that when future relative performance levels are uncertain, exclusion tactics is preferred.

We also show that these preferences have only a trivial overlap with the class of Choquet Expected Utility preferences, but there are plenty of preferences of the a-Maxmin Expected Utility type that satisfy our assumptions. We identify several concrete settings where our results could be applied. Finally, we consider the special case where the unconditional preference is itself SEU, and compare our results with those of Fishburn (Econometrica 41:1-25, 1973).","[Amarante, Massimiliano] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Amarante, Massimiliano] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Amarante, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Amarante, M (通讯作者)，CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",massimiliano.amarante@umontreal.ca,,,SSHRC of Canada [410-2011-2025],SSHRC of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I wish to thank Fabio Maccheroni, Rich McLean and two anonymous referees for useful suggestions.
