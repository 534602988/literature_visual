In other words, the level of development (performance) or the efficiency (doing things right) of an alternative are measured, when the effectiveness is left beyond the attention. In spite of frequent usage of this term in the literature and acknowledged importance in management practice, the well-grounded methodology for the effectiveness has been missing. The generic view of effectiveness explained as doing right things underpins the suggested methodology. Basing on this, the focus in the measurement is shifted from the weighted absolute values of criteria to the weighted inter-criteria proportions. The new Difference Additive Weighting method is suggested to solve the problem of utility dependence during proportions investigation.

Normally, cooperative games tacitly treat all players symmetric. However, the fact is that different players may be asymmetric and contribute to different efforts, bargaining powers, or stability in the process of cooperation. A weight vector is used to reflect players' asymmetry. In view of these weights are possible to be less than 1, that is, not all players are absolutely important, a loss of dividends of coalitions can happen. We define and characterize a reduced Harsanyi power solution for cooperative games with a weight vector, which is relevant to a loss function of dividends. Moreover, when the loss function takes particular forms, the reduced Harsanyi power solution has a linear relationship with the Harsanyi power solution.","[Li, Xianghui; Sun, Hao] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Sun, H (通讯作者)，Northwestern Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",xianghuili@mail.nwpu.edu.cn; hsun@nwpu.edu.cn,"lu, yuting/IIS-2826-2023; li, xiang/GWM-6319-2022; sun, hao/HMD-2991-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571143, 71601156, 71671140, 71271171]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71571143, 71601156, 71671140 and 71271171).",,9,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-981-10-6753-2; 978-981-10-6752-5,COMM COM INF SC,,,2017,758.0,,,,,,229,239,,10.1007/978-981-10-6753-2_17,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BL5GE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451446900017,0

Subsidies from the state budget are allocated to individual universities based on their share on the total performance of all public higher education institutions in education and research. The competition for financial resources has greatly influenced the behaviour of universities.

It is explained by the fact that due to unfavorable development factors in these regions, it is most difficult to ensure economic and social growth, to carry out infrastructure development, to attract external financing and investments. Depressive regions tend to have a low level of competitiveness and a prolonged economic decline in industrial production, accompanied by an increase in unemployment. The development of such regions is impossible without external intervention. Specialists in the regional economy have described indicators of such regions. They are: the rate of change in industrial production, the level of unemployment, the size of the gross regional product per capita, the industrial output per capita. It is necessary to attract investment in the economy of depressed regions in order to bring their economies to the stage of sustainable growth. It is possible due to the development of the innovation sphere. A key element of the innovative sphere of any region is its innovative infrastructure. In this connection, the analysis of the state and the definition of promising areas for the development of the innovation infrastructure of the depressed regions is an urgent and significant scientific task. The article analyzes the existing state of the innovation infrastructure of ten constituent entities of the Russian Federation, which are considered to be depressive. The authors use the method of understanding factual data, the index method, the method of comparisons and the method of expert evaluations. According to the obtained results, the authors have defined the most promising directions for the development of the innovation infrastructure for these regions.","[Karanina, E., V; Palkina, M., V] Vyatka State Univ, 36 Moskovskaya St, Kirov 610000, Russia",Vyatka State University,"Karanina, EV (通讯作者)，Vyatka State Univ, 36 Moskovskaya St, Kirov 610000, Russia.",palmavik@yandex.ru,"Karanina, Elena E.V./L-1395-2016","Karanina, Elena E.V./0000-0002-5439-5912",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,680,682,,,,,,3,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800151,0

It is a common practice that the both supply and demand of some actors can be indeterminate as well as the evaluation of routes between them in terms of distance and time. There are ways to deal with uncertainty in the linear optimization models such as stochastic optimization or interval programming. These approaches bring also computational difficulties since their practical application is quite demanding. We show how this situation can be handled using robust optimization approach towards modelling of uncertainty. The robust approach is a tool that seeks a robust-optimal solution and it allows, in its extended form, to specify the deviations from deterministic values quite precisely while the entire mathematical model remains simple which is a considerable computational advantage. The way of transformation of transportation problem into its robust counterpart is described in detail and accompanied by example of different scenarios in the end.","[Hlavaty, Robert; Brozova, Helena] Czech Univ Life Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hlavaty, R (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic.",hlavaty@pef.czu.cz; brozova@pef.czu.cz,"Hlavatý, Robert/C-7653-2017; Brozova, Helena/K-2834-2017","Hlavatý, Robert/0000-0001-6136-8739; Brozova, Helena/0000-0002-0322-251X",,,,,15,3,3,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,225,230,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400039,0

An epsilon-optimal strategy gives the sum of discounted expected single period payoffs that is no lower than its maximum on the set of strategies minus epsilon. Since the state space is infinite, an epsilon-optimal solution to the program is open-ended. We develop an algorithm that generates (for a chosen small positive epsilon) an epsilon-optimal solution gradually. It gives for each state the prescription for it that is ex ante epsilon-optimal, without specifying prescriptions for other states. It is based on critical periods.

However, the co-movement was more apparent in case of households when the level of new loans provided by banks was lower after the lending standards tightening (and vice versa). In case of enterprises, the behaviour of banks concerning credit standards and the loans to enterprises was more unstable. In both cases, the co-movement is characterised by short-term reactions rather than long-term trend.

Two refrigerated vehicles (one rigid and one articulated), two food products (one chilled and one frozen), and three delivery schedules (long multi-drop delivery, continuous multi-drop delivery, and short delivery) are used for assessment purposes. The analysis indicates that for all cases investigated more cryogenic fluid is required for food transport refrigeration compared to the quantity of diesel. For all delivery schedules, the Well to Wheel environmental impacts of cryogenic systems will be of the same order as those of diesel driven refrigeration systems.

Customers are from Generation Y. For this purpose, it was used factor analysis followed by cluster analysis, which is in this article the main research method. It is used hierarchical cluster analysis for finding the number of clusters and even non-hierarchical cluster analysis, which assigned objects to concrete clusters. In the part of hierarchical clustering it is used Ward's procedure. Claims (attitudes) are defined on the basis of what kind of initiatives users show, when they are deciding about visiting theatre, what is their relationship to it, which types of performances they visit and what is the main point of visiting theatre. Cluster analysis found 5 clusters (Visitors, who don't prefer theatre, Accompanying visitors, Occasional visitors, Theatre fans and Visitors following prestige) which showed big differences in their approach to the theatre.","[Rebrosova, Katarina] Tech Univ Ostrava, Vysoka Skola Banska, Dept Mkt & Business, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Rebrosová, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Vysoka Skola Banska, Dept Mkt & Business, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.",katarina.rebrosova@vsb.cz,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,620,625,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400106,0

Operational complexity measure should express behavioral uncertainties of the system during the time with respect to specified control levels. It has to record all possible types of flow variations within and across company in detail, e.g. replenishment time disturbances, deviations of material in/out flows, etc. Further, we discuss in detail various entropy measures which are applicable to operational complexity analysis. The basic one is classical Shannon entropy. We also discuss relations between the Shannon entropy and various generalized entropy based measures, e.g. (c, d)-entropy.

Gradual transition to the system of polytechnic education is carried out by conducting laboratory practices and works in the field, where students independently participate in engineering surveys, studies of natural materials and soil, perform geodetic work. A new trend in development for hydraulic engineering construction is the use of building information modelling (BIM) technologies for the life cycle of structures. The introduction of BIM technologies should radically improve and interlink all the directions of design, construction and operation of such unique objects as water transport hydraulic structures. We give several examples of the introduction of polytechnic education in the system of training specialists of various levels (bachelor, master and specialist) for hydraulic engineering construction of water transport facilities, which corresponds to the best world practices.

Since the Business tendency survey is based on opinions of selected companies, a quality and confidence of predictions in the previously mentioned survey is opened to discussion. The article focuses on evaluation predictions and the real development of industrial companies in the Czech Republic. Authors are comparing results from Short-term statistics in the industry and the Business tendency survey. The Czech Statistical Office collects data from the both surveys. Using mathematical and statistical methods, authors want to scale and categorize real data-based economic development, recorded by short-term business statistics, into categories corresponding within predictions, offered by Business tendency survey, such that the appropriate categories from the both sources correlate themselves enough.

While the Black-Scholes model assumes that the volatility of the asset is constant or a deterministic function, the Heston model assumes that the volatility is a random process. The explicit solution for the Heston model is unavailable for many types of options and therefore numerical methods have been proposed for pricing options under Heston model, e.g. Monte Carlo method, the finite difference method, the finite element method or the discontinuous Galerkin method. The Heston model is represented by a parabolic equation. For its efficient numerical solution, we use the theta scheme for the time discretization and we propose an adaptive wavelet method for the discretization of the equation on the given time level. We construct a piecewise linear wavelet basis and use it in the scheme. The advantage of wavelets is their compression property. It means that the representation of the solution in a wavelet basis requires a small number of coefficients and the computation of the solution can be performed with the small number of parameters. Numerical example is presented for the European put option.","[Cerna, Dana] Tech Univ Liberec, Dept Math & Didact Math, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Cerná, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Dept Math & Didact Math, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",dana.cerna@tul.cz,"Černá, Dana/D-5913-2012","Černá, Dana/0000-0003-3259-8919",Czech Science Foundation [GA16-09541S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by grant No. GA16-09541S of the Czech Science Foundation.,,17,0,0,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,96,101,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400017,0

Traditional game theory is divided into non-cooperative and cooperative models. Biform games combine non-cooperative and cooperative models. The goal of coopetition is to move the players from a zero-sum game to a plus-sum game, a scenario in which the end result is more profitable when the competitors work together. The paper presents game theory models that represent the co-opetition concept. The coopetition business model has PARTS of a business strategy - five dimensions a company can use to identify strategies that change the game: Players, Added value, Rules, Tactics, and Scope.

The most significant factors are the size of companies, the ratio of non-current assets to total assets, the rentability of assets, the ratio of inventory to the total assets, the economic activity classification CZ-NACE, and the legal form.

In existing literature, the imprecision burdening a portfolio is usually modelled by given fuzzy return rates. The rates are assumed to include imprecision of information used by investor to make a financial decision, that is data which may possibly be faulty or incomplete. In the presented paper imprecision is understood as ambiguity and vagueness of information, and stems from investor's subjectivity as well as technical and technological premises. Previous research shows, that measures of ambiguity and vagueness should be calculated for discount factors rather than for return rates from a portfolio. Means of appointing the measures and some interesting conclusions about the relationship between portfolio construction and imprecision are stated throughout the paper. Finally, numerical example presenting model characteristics and exemplary calculation of portfolio fuzzy discount factor is given.","[Siwek, Joanna] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Operat Res, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Siwek, J (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Operat Res, Poznan, Poland.",joanna.siwek@ue.poznan.pl,"Siwek, Joanna/ABD-8633-2020","Siwek, Joanna/0000-0002-7889-4505",National Science Centre Poland [2015/17/N/HS4/00206],"National Science Centre Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The article is financed by the National Science Centre Poland, grant No. 2015/17/N/HS4/00206.",,23,3,3,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,661,666,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400113,0

Since 1918, when the Far Eastern engineering higher school sprang up, the discussion about how future engineers must be taught hasn't terminated till now. The mission of engineering education having been interpreted in different ways in various historical periods, according to the existing system of values, made teaching approaches different as well. As a result, engineering education in Russia featured a number of reforms that gave the priority in teaching to either an ideological aspect with a lot of political disciplines in a curriculum (the early 1920s) or a branch approach when highly specialized teaching was introduced to the detriment of theoretical knowledge (the early 1930s). Though the significance of vocational practices was realized at all historical stages of engineering education in the Russian Far East, their forms and methods varied in different time. The conclusion is made about the highest level of their organization in the 1980s. The local higher schools had strong connections with the industry getting the opportunity to send students to leading enterprises throughout the USSR. The author analyses also some new trends in organizing students' vocational practices using the examples of the Vladivostok University of Economics and Services.

Two methods based on this approach are proposed. In one of them the innovation activity intensity is measured via decomposition of the labor productivity increase into the factors that generate it - the dynamics of capital productivity ratio and capital-labor ratio (in logarithms). Another methodical approach closely connected with the previous one is based on the special parameter, characterizing investment potential growth, the demand for the net investments to increase unit intensity productivity. Calculations made on US statistics since the early 1960s give an idea of the innovation factor role in certain quantitative assessments. It turned out that in general for the period 1961-2014 about 3/4 of the productivity increase is due to the capital-labor ratio growth, and only 1/4 to the capital productivity ratio growth. In 1981-2000 about half of the productivity increase was already obtained due to the innovation factor; investment, which provided breakthrough technologies. At the same time, a reduction in the relative demand for investment from the beginning of the 1980s made it possible with almost the same accumulation rate to stop the threatening tendency towards reducing of the labor productivity growth rates.","[Lavrovskiy, B.

An inseparable part of the process of the liberalization is the strengthening of the competitive fight between national and foreign producers which often result in the manifestation of the unfair competition from the part of foreign counterparts in the form of price discrimination of domestic goods. Under such conditions an important challenge for the national economy is the achievement of a definite balance between the protectionist measures and the tools of free trade. The mentioned problems have acquired an additional relevance after the joining the World Trade Organization by Russia and after the growth of integration processes in the post soviet space within the Eurasian partnership. In the current situation the optimal mechanism which allows on the one hand to observe the national economic interests of Russia and on the other not to violate international agreements is the system of non-tariff barriers. The changing realities of regional and international trade influence the used measures of non-tariff restrictions. This situation requires the search of the most efficient and optimal measures of non-tariff regulation with the account of foreign economic and foreign trade priorities of the country and the interests of national economic agents.,"[Zemlyanskaya, S., V] Volgograd State Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Chair Econ Theory Reg & World Econ, Volgograd, Russia; [Novikov, M., V] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Volgograd Inst Management Branch, Dept Econ & Finance, Volgograd, Russia",Volgograd State University (VOLSU); Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration,"Zemlyanskaya, SV (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, Chair Econ Theory Reg & World Econ, Volgograd, Russia.",stella.zemlyanskaya@yandex.ru; novikovmv@yandex.ru,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,1231,1236,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800279,0

In recent development of many economies, interest rate hit the zero lower bound, making traditional instrument of monetary policy unemployable. Depreciation of country's currency and subsequent interventions on FX market therefore provide for an option for inflation targeting in small open economies. We use a New-Keynesian dynamic stochastic model of general equilibrium. The possibility of central bank's interventions is modeled by adding a segment of FX dealers as a modified uncovered interest parity condition, according to [2]. The model is then estimated on data of Czech economy. We then introduce non-linearities to otherwise linear model, providing a way to model constraints on variables. Constraint on interest rate is chosen to model the position of the economy at zero lower bound, whereas constraint on exchange rate is used to model commitment of central bank to keep exchange rate above certain value. Model is solved using toolbox of [3], which introduces a way of dealing with non-linear models, by assuming perfect foresight of agents.

Uncertainty is understood as a state of vagueness that does not provide a decision-maker with any guidance to construct rational estimates; only possible ranges of input values are known. A typical representative of such a system is a solar photovoltaic power plant, by means of which the research findings are demonstrated. The basic idea of the herein presented approach is the thesis that in terms of uncertainty there is a much greater chance to correctly predict the intervals at which the respective point values are found than to correctly estimate a single point value. Within this argument the relevant formulas are translated from the language of arithmetic to the language of intervals. In it the significant points of the interval of profitability values are derived, which, in addition to standard information about the profitability of investments (standard IRR), also provide information about the measure of investment safety (in terms of resistance against possible financial loss) and the measure of hope for a premium assessment. These conclusions are the major original contribution.","[Haskova, Simona] Sch Expertness & Valuat, Inst Technol & Business, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Hasková, S (通讯作者)，Sch Expertness & Valuat, Inst Technol & Business, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",haskovas@post.cz,"Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019",,,,,,11,7,7,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,213,218,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400037,0

Hereby the least square interval-valued nucleoli of interval-valued cooperative games are determined in the sense of minimizing the difference of the square excesses of the coalitions.

Phosphorus (P) is crucial to plant growth and mineral fertilizer is added to soil to maintain P concentrations, however this is a finite resource, thus efficient use is critical. Plants primarily uptake P from a labile (available) P pool and not from the stable solid phase; transfer between these pools limits bioavailability. Transfer is controlled by soil properties which vary between soil types. The dynamic phosphorus pool simulator (DPPS) quantifies crop production and soil P relationships by utilising the transfer. This approach effectively models crop uptake from soil inputs, but it does not quantify the efficiency use. This study incorporates geochemical techniques within DPPS to quantify the efficiency of fertilizer-P use based on soil chemistry. (C) 2017 The Authors.

An assessment of separate and specific behavioural, equipment maintenance, preparation and cooking strategies are performed. The baseline energy use results were validated to within 0.65% of the findings from an extensive and detailed monitoring study of a leading operator of UK public houses and restaurants Pt Seven energy reduction scenarios were then assessed using the developed calculator. Potential energy savings of 58% (195 MWh) and emissions savings of 46% (55,224 kgCO(2)e) per year were indicated from replacing the chargrill, fryers and microwave combi ovens with two combi steam ovens and reducing freezing demand in the case study restaurant.

Direct emissions of greenhouse gases associated with the use of high Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants, and the indirect impact on the environment related to high electrical energy consumption, make shopping malls not sustainable buildings. This paper analyses the energy saving potential of integrated supermarket air conditioning and refrigeration systems using a Water Loop Heat Pump system (WLHP). A basic CO2 booster commercial refrigeration system, applied to cold rooms and display cabinets, is considered. Heat recovery from the refrigeration circuit is performed in the heating season, while in the cooling season a dry cooler on the water loop allows heat rejection to outdoors. The building and all systems are modelled in the Trnsys environment taking into account the hourly weather data, the simulated daily profiles of the cooling and heating load demand and the request from refrigerated food storage equipment.

When the system is operating in transcritical cycle the heat exchanger at the high-pressure side of the system is well known as gas cooler. The gas cooler rejects heat from the superheated refrigerant gas to ambient air without condensation in single phase heat transfer process. The understanding of its performance parameters under different conditions and control strategies is essential to adequately design and optimise for specific applications. In this paper, a detailed mathematical model is developed in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) platform, and validated with experimental results obtained from a test rig at the National Centre for Sustainable Energy use in Food Chains (CSEF). The model is investigated two different gas cooler designs when separately installed and test into a CO2 refrigeration system, an attempt to formulate the design guidelines for CO2 gas coolers. Then the detailed gas cooler models were integrated with the CO2 refrigeration system model to investigate the effects of the gas cooler design into system COP. Parameters such as intermediate pressure, evaporating temperature and cooling capacity were defined from the experimental results and then inserted to the model. The results of the detailed gas cooler model and CO2 refrigeration system model were validated against the experimental test results based on the gas cooler performance and overall system performance.

In our model there are n agents and each agent strategically chooses when to join a first-come-first-served observable queue. Agents dislike standing in line and they take actions in discrete time steps: we assume that each agent has a cost of 1 for every time step he waits before joining the queue and a cost of w > 1 for every time step he waits in the queue. At each time step a single agent can be processed. Before each time step, every agent observes the queue and strategically decides whether or not to join, with the goal of minimizing his expected cost. In this paper we focus on symmetric strategies which are arguably more natural as they require less coordination. This brings up the following twist to the usual price of anarchy question: what is the main source for the inefficiency of symmetric equilibria? is it the players' strategic behavior or the lack of coordination? We present results for two different parameter regimes that are qualitatively very different: (i) when w is fixed and n grows, we prove a tight bound of 2 and show that the entire loss is due to the players' selfish behavior (ii) when n is fixed and w grows, we prove a tight bound of Theta (root w/n) and show that it is mainly due to lack of coordination: the same order of magnitude of loss is suffered by any symmetric profile.","[Babaioff, Moshe] Microsoft Res, Herzliyya, Israel; [Oren, Sigal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Oren, S (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.",moshe@microsoft.com; sigal3@gmail.com,,"Oren, Sigal/0000-0002-4271-7291",,,,,31,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,37,50,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_3,0.0,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000003,0

Specifically, we focus on the case where the agents are allowed to submit strict weak orders and we try to address the following questions from the perspective of a market-designer: (i) How can a designer generate matchings that are robust-in the sense that they are good with respect to the underlying unknown true orders? (ii) What is the trade-off between the amount of missing information and the quality of solution one can get? With the goal of resolving these questions through a simple and prior-free approach, we suggest looking at matchings that minimize the maximum number of blocking pairs with respect to all the possible underlying true orders as a measure of goodness or quality, and subsequently provide results on finding such matchings. In particular, we first restrict our attention to matchings that have to be stable with respect to at least one of the completions (i.e., weakly-stable matchings) and show that in this case arbitrarily filling-in the missing information and computing the resulting stable matching can give a non-trivial approximation factor for our problem in certain cases. We complement this result by showing that, even under severe restrictions on the preferences of the agents, the factor obtained is asymptotically tight in many cases. We then investigate a special case, where only agents on one side provide strict weak orders and all the missing information is at the bottom of their preference orders, and show that in this special case the negative result mentioned above can be circumvented in order to get a much better approximation factor; this result, too, is tight in many cases. Finally, we move away from the restriction on weakly-stable matchings and show a general hardness of approximation result and also discuss one possible approach that can lead us to a near-tight approximation bound.","[Menon, Vijay; Larson, Kate] Univ Waterloo, David R Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Menon, V (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, David R Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",vijay.menon@uwaterloo.ca; kate.larson@uwaterloo.ca,,"Larson, Kate/0000-0002-5455-9657",,,,,21,3,3,2,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,341,355,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_23,0.0,,,15,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000023,0

The budget feasible mechanism design problem requires the design a mechanism which incentivizes the sellers to truthfully report their cost and maximizes the buyer's value while guaranteeing that the total payment does not exceed her budget. Such budget feasible mechanisms can model a buyer in a crowdsourcing market interested in recruiting a set of workers (sellers) to accomplish a task for her. This budget feasible mechanism design problem was introduced by Singer in 2010. We consider the general case where the buyer's valuation is a monotone submodular function. There are a number of truthful mechanisms known for this problem. We offer two general frameworks for simple mechanisms, and by combining these frameworks, we significantly improve on the best known results, while also simplifying the analysis. For example, we improve the approximation guarantee for the general monotone submodular case from 7.91 to 5; and for the case of large markets (where each individual item has negligible value) from 3 to 2.58. More generally, given an r approximation algorithm for the optimization problem (ignoring incentives), our mechanism is a r + 1 approximation mechanism for large markets, an improvement from 2r(2). We also provide a mechanism without the large market assumption, where we achieve a 4r + 1 approximation guarantee. We also show how our results can be used for the problem of a principal hiring in a Crowdsourcing Market to select a set of tasks subject to a total budget.","[Khalilabadi, Pooya Jalaly; Tardos, Eva] Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Gates Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Khalilabadi, PJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Gates Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jalaly@cs.cornell.edu; eva@cs.cornell.edu,,,"NSF [CCF-1563714, CCF-1422102]; ONR [N00014-08-1-0031]; Google Research Grant",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research); Google Research Grant(Google Incorporated),"P.

Moreover, we introduce the new concept of the Price of Mistrust and analyze the connection to earliest arrival flows.","[Scheffler, Robert; Strehler, Martin] BTU Cottbus Senftenberg, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany; [Koch, Laura Vargas] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, D-52056 Aachen, Germany",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; RWTH Aachen University,"Scheffler, R (通讯作者)，BTU Cottbus Senftenberg, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany.",schefrob@b-tu.de; strehler@b-tu.de; laura.vargas@oms.rwth-aachen.de,,"Scheffler, Robert/0000-0001-6007-4202",,,,,20,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,408,422,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_27,0.0,,,15,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000027,0

The price of each product is fixed in advance, and a probabilistic choice function describes which product a customer will choose from any given subset. We introduce the combinatorial assortment problem, where each customer may select a bundle of products. We consider a choice model in which each consumer selects a utility-maximizing bundle subject to a private valuation function, and study the complexity of the resulting optimization problem. Our main result is an exact algorithm for k-additive valuations, under a model of vertical differentiation in which customers agree on the relative value of each pair of items but differ in their absolute willingness to pay. For valuations that are vertically differentiated but not necessarily k-additive, we show how to obtain constant approximations under a well-priced condition, where each product's price is sufficiently high. We further show that even for a single customer with known valuation, any sub-polynomial approximation to the problem requires exponentially many demand queries when the valuation function is XOS, and that no FPTAS exists even when the valuation is succinctly representable.","[Immorlica, Nicole; Lucier, Brendan; Syrgkanis, Vasilis] Microsoft Res, Boston, MA USA; [Mao, Jieming] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Tzamos, Christos] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA",Microsoft; University of Pennsylvania; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Mao, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",nicimm@microsoft.com; brlucier@microsoft.com; maojm517@gmail.com; vasy@microsoft.com; ctzamos@gmail.com,,"Tzamos, Christos/0000-0002-7560-5069",,,,,17,3,3,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,218,231,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_15,0.0,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000015,0

Previous work has shown that several well-known tournament solutions almost never rule out any alternative in large random tournaments. Nevertheless, all analytical results thus far have assumed a rigid probabilistic model, in which either a tournament is chosen uniformly at random, or there is a linear order of alternatives and the orientation of all edges in the tournament is chosen with the same probabilities according to the linear order. In this work, we consider a significantly more general model where the orientation of different edges can be chosen with different probabilities. We show that a number of common tournament solutions, including the top cycle and the uncovered set, are still unlikely to rule out any alternative under this model. This corresponds to natural graph-theoretic conditions such as irreducibility of the tournament. In addition, we provide tight asymptotic bounds on the boundary of the probability range for which the tournament solutions select all alternatives with high probability.","[Saile, Christian] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, Munich, Germany; [Suksompong, Warut] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Technical University of Munich; Stanford University,"Suksompong, W (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",saile@in.tum.de; warut@cs.stanford.edu,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BR 2312/11-1]; Stanford Graduate Fellowship,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Stanford Graduate Fellowship(Stanford University),"This material is based upon work supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under grant BR 2312/11-1 and by a Stanford Graduate Fellowship.

This paper introduces a generalization of Byzantine agreement, where the input values of the nodes are preference rankings of three or more candidates. We show that consensus on preferences, which is an important question in social choice theory, complements already known results from Byzantine agreement. In addition, preferential voting raises new questions about how to approximate consensus vectors. We propose a deterministic algorithm to solve Byzantine agreement on rankings under a generalized validity condition, which we call ParetoValidity. These results are then extended by considering a special voting rule which chooses the Kemeny median as the consensus vector. For this rule, we derive a lower bound on the approximation ratio of the Kemeny median that can be guaranteed by any deterministic algorithm. We then provide an algorithm matching this lower bound. To our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial generalization of multi-valued Byzantine agreement to multiple dimensions which can tolerate a constant fraction of Byzantine nodes.","[Melnyk, Darya; Wang, Yuyi; Wattenhofer, Roger] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Melnyk, D (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",dmelnyk@ethz.ch; yuwang@ethz.ch; wattenhofer@ethz.ch,"Wang, Jing/IQW-3496-2023","Wang, Jing/0000-0002-8296-2961; Melnyk, Darya/0000-0001-5614-8563",,,,,39,3,3,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,327,340,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_22,0.0,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000022,0

We are interested in simple and natural variants of the FJ model that use limited information exchange in each round and converge to the same stable point. As in the FJ model, we assume that each agent i has an intrinsic opinion si is an element of [0, 1] and maintains an expressed opinion x(i)(t) is an element of [0, 1] in each round t. To model limited information exchange, we assume that each agent i meets with one random friend j at each round t and learns only x(j)(t). The amount of influence j imposes on i is reflected by the probability p(ij) with which i meets j. Then, agent i suffers a disagreement cost that is a convex combination of (x(i)(t) - s(i))(2) and (x(i)(t) - x(j)(t))(2). An important class of dynamics in this setting are no regret dynamics. We show an exponential gap between the convergence rate of no regret dynamics and of more general dynamics that do not ensure no regret. We prove that no regret dynamics require roughly Omega(1/epsilon) rounds to be within distance e from the stable point x* of the FJ model. On the other hand, we provide an opinion update rule that does not ensure no regret and converges to x* in (O) over tilde (log(2)(1/epsilon)) rounds.

Although social welfare maximization is a seemingly non-convex optimization problem in prices, we show that (i) it can be reduced to a dual convex optimization problem in prices, and (ii) the revealed preferences can be interpreted as supergradients of the concave conjugate of valuation, with which subgradients of the dual function can be computed. We thereby obtain a simple subgradient-based algorithm for strongly concave valuations and convex cost, with query complexity O(m(2)/epsilon(2)), where epsilon is the additive difference between the social welfare induced by our algorithm and the optimum social welfare. We also study social welfare maximization under the online setting, specifically the random permutation model, where consumers arrive one-by-one in a random order. For the case where consumer valuations can be arbitrary continuous functions, we propose a price posting mechanism that achieves an expected social welfare up to an additive factor of O(root mn) from the maximum social welfare. Finally, for profit maximization (which may be non-convex in simple cases), we give nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the query complexity for separable valuations and cost (i.e., each good can be treated independently).","[Ji, Ziwei; Mehta, Ruta; Telgarsky, Matus] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Ji, ZW (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",ziweiji2@illinois.edu; rutameht@illinois.edu; mjt@illinois.edu,,,,,,,36,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,264,281,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_18,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000018,0

To maximize the value provided to auction participants, spending is smoothed across auctions so budgets are used for the best opportunities. Motivated by a mechanism used in practice by several companies, this paper considers a smoothing procedure that relies on pacing multipliers: on behalf of each bidder, the auction market applies a factor between 0 and 1 that uniformly scales the bids across all auctions. Reinterpreting this process as a game between bidders, we introduce the notion of pacing equilibrium, and prove that they are always guaranteed to exist. We demonstrate through examples that a market can have multiple pacing equilibria with large variations in several natural objectives. We show that pacing equilibria refine another popular solution concept, competitive equilibria, and show further connections between the two solution concepts. Although we show that computing either a social-welfare-maximizing or a revenuemaximizing pacing equilibrium is NP-hard, we present a mixed-integer program (MIP) that can be used to find equilibria optimizing several relevant objectives. We use the MIP to provide evidence that: (1) equilibrium multiplicity occurs very rarely across several families of random instances, (2) static MIP solutions can be used to improve the outcomes achieved by a dynamic pacing algorithm with instances based on a realworld auction market, and (3) for our instances, bidders do not have an incentive to misreport bids or budgets provided there are enough participants in the auction.","[Conitzer, Vincent] Econorithms LLC, Durham, NC USA; [Conitzer, Vincent] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA; [Kroer, Christian; Sodomka, Eric; Stier-Moses, Nicolas E.] Facebook Inc, Core Data Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Duke University; Facebook Inc,"Kroer, C (通讯作者)，Facebook Inc, Core Data Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",vincent.conitzer@duke.edu; chrkroer@fb.com; sodomka@fb.com; nstier@fb.com,"Stier-Moses, Nicolas/R-5236-2018","Stier-Moses, Nicolas/0000-0001-6380-1516; Kroer, Christian/0000-0002-9009-8683",,,,,0,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,443,443,,,,,,1,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000030,0

This is an important consideration in settings such as crowdsourcing competitions, open science challenges and group-based assignments, where a large number of agents organize themselves into small teams which then compete against each other. A central tension here is between the strategic interests of agents who want to have the highest-performing team, and that of the principal who wants teams to be balanced. Moreover, although the principal cannot choose the teams or modify rewards, she often has additional knowledge of agents' abilities, and can leverage this information asymmetry to provide signals that influence team formation. Our work uncovers the critical role of self-awareness (i.e., knowledge of one's own abilities) for the design of such mechanisms. For settings with two-member teams and binary-valued agents, we provide signaling mechanisms which are asymptotically optimal when agents are agnostic of their own abilities. On the other hand, when agents are self-aware, then we show that there is no signaling mechanism that can do better than not releasing information, while satisfying agent participation constraints.","[Hssaine, Chamsi; Banerjee, Siddhartha] Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Hssaine, C (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ch822@cornell.edu; sbanerjee@cornell.edu,,,National Science Foundation [DMS 1839346]; Army Research Office [W911NF-17-0094],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Army Research Office,"We acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation grant DMS 1839346), and the Army Research Office (grant W911NF-17-0094).",,0,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,446,447,,,,,,2,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000033,0

In this paper we seek to identify structural properties of instances of stable matching problems which will allow us to design efficient algorithms using elementary techniques. We focus on the setting in which all agents involved in some matching problem can be partitioned into k different types, where the type of an agent determines his or her preferences, and agents have preferences over types (which may be refined by more detailed preferences within a single type). This situation would arise in practice if agents form preferences solely based on some small collection of agents' attributes. We also consider a generalisation in which each agent may consider some small collection of other agents to be exceptional, and rank these in a way that is not consistent with their types; this could happen in practice if agents have prior contact with a small number of candidates. We show that (for the case without exceptions), the well-known NP-hard matching problem Max SMTI (that of finding the maximum cardinality stable matching in an instance of stable marriage with ties and incomplete lists) belongs to the parameterised complexity class FPT when parameterised by the number of different types of agents needed to describe the instance. This tractability result can be extended to the setting in which each agent promotes at most one exceptional candidate to the top of his/her list (when preferences within types are not refined), but the problem remains NP-hard if preference lists can contain two or more exceptions and the exceptional candidates can be placed anywhere in the preference lists.","[Meeks, Kitty] Univ Glasgow, Sch Comp Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Rastegari, Baharak] Univ Southampton, Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Glasgow; University of Southampton,"Rastegari, B (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton, Hants, England.",kitty.meeks@glasgow.ac.uk; b.rastegari@soton.ac.uk,,"Rastegari, Baharak/0000-0002-0985-573X; Meeks, Kitty/0000-0001-5299-3073",Royal Society of Edinburgh (Scottish Government),Royal Society of Edinburgh (Scottish Government),The first author is supported by a Personal Research Fellowship from the Royal Society of Edinburgh (funded by the Scottish Government).

However, this result relies heavily on the assumption that buyers are indifferent to risk. In this paper we investigate the case where the buyers are risk-loving, i.e. they prefer gambling to being rewarded deterministically. We use the standard model for risk from expected utility theory, where risk-loving behavior is represented by a convex utility function. We focus our attention on the special case of exponential utility functions. We characterize the optimal auction and show that randomization can be used to extract more revenue than when buyers are risk-neutral. Most importantly, we show that the optimal auction is simple: the optimal revenue can be extracted using a randomized take-it-or-leave-it price for a single buyer and using a loser-pay auction, a variant of the all-pay auction, for multiple buyers. Finally, we show that these results no longer hold for convex utility functions beyond exponential.","[Nikolova, Evdokia; Pountourakis, Emmanouil; Yang, Ger] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Pountourakis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",manolis@utexas.edu,,"Nikolova, Evdokia/0000-0002-8801-0320",,,,,18,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,375,392,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_25,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000025,0

Such games are central in formal verification since they model the interaction between a non-terminating system and its environment. We study bidding games in which the players bid for the right to move the token. Two bidding rules have been defined. In Richman bidding, in each round, the players simultaneously submit bids, and the higher bidder moves the token and pays the other player. Poorman bidding is similar except that the winner of the bidding pays the bank rather than the other player. While poorman reachability games have been studied before, we present, for the first time, results on infinite-duration poorman games. A central quantity in these games is the ratio between the two players' initial budgets. The questions we study concern a necessary and sufficient ratio with which a player can achieve a goal. For reachability objectives, such threshold ratios are known to exist for both bidding rules. We show that the properties of poorman reachability games extend to complex qualitative objectives such as parity, similarly to the Richman case. Our most interesting results concern quantitative poorman games, namely poorman mean-payoff games, where we construct optimal strategies depending on the initial ratio, by showing a connection with random-turn based games. The connection in itself is interesting, because it does not hold for reachability poorman games. We also solve the complexity problems that arise in poorman bidding games.","[Avni, Guy; Henzinger, Thomas A.] IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Ibsen-Jensen, Rasmus] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Institute of Science & Technology - Austria; University of Liverpool,"Avni, G (通讯作者)，IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria.",guy.avni@ist.ac.at,,,"Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [S11402-N23, Z211-N23, M 2369-N33]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [M2369] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"This research was supported in part by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) under grants S11402-N23 (RiSE/SHiNE), Z211-N23 (Wittgenstein Award), and M 2369-N33 (Meitner fellowship).",,36,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,21,36,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_2,0.0,,,16,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000002,0

We form new algorithms to do this in the presence of only ordinal information, i.e., when the true costs or distances from the agents to the facilities are unknown, and only the ordinal preferences of the agents for the facilities are available. The main difference between our work and previous work in this area is that while we assume that only ordinal information about agent preferences is known, we know the exact locations of the possible facilities F. Due to this extra information about the facilities, we are able to form powerful algorithms which have small distortion, i.e., perform almost as well as omniscient algorithms but use only ordinal information about agent preferences. For example, we present natural social choice mechanisms for choosing a single facility to open with distortion of at most 3 for minimizing both the total and the median social cost; this factor is provably the best possible. We analyze many general problems including matching, k-center, and k-median, and present black-box reductions from omniscient approximation algorithms with approximation factor beta to ordinal algorithms with approximation factor 1+ 2 beta; doing this gives new ordinal algorithms for many important problems, and establishes a toolkit for analyzing such problems in the future.","[Anshelevich, Elliot; Zhu, Wennan] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Anshelevich, E; Zhu, WN (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",eanshel@cs.rpi.edu; zhuw5@rpi.edu,,,NSF [CCF-1527497],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank Onkar Bhardwaj for discussion of the lower bound example for the k-median problem.

However, when agents have multiple opportunities for revealing information, and take into account long-term effects of their actions, deception and reticence may appear. Such situations have been described in the literature. No simple rules exist to distinguish between the truthful and the untruthful situations, and a determination has been done in isolated cases only. This is of relevance to prediction markets, where the market value is a common prediction, and more generally in informal public prediction forums, such as stock-market estimates by analysts. We describe three different mechanisms that are strategy-proof with non-myopic considerations, and show that one of them, a discounted market scoring rule, meets all our requirements from a mechanism in almost all prediction settings. To illustrate, we extensively analyze a prediction setting with continuous outcomes, and show how our suggested mechanism restores prompt truthfulness where incumbent mechanisms fail.","[Ban, Amir] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Ban, A (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, Haifa, Israel.",amirban@netvision.net.il,,,,,,,15,1,2,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,51,65,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_4,0.0,,,15,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000004,0

An instance of the game consists of a single server and a set of unit-length jobs. Every job needs to be processed along a specified time interval, defined by its release-time and due-date. Jobs may also have variable weights, which specify the amount of resource they require. We assume that jobs are controlled by selfish agents who act to minimize their own cost, rather than to optimize any global objective. The jobs processed in a specific time-slot cover the server's activation cost in this slot, with the cost being shared proportionally to the jobs' weights.

The latent word-word influencer relationships in WIN are the building blocks for causal reasoning and predictive modeling. We demonstrate the efficacy of WIN by using it for unsupervised extraction of latent features for stock price prediction and obtain 2 orders lower prediction error compared to a similar causal graph based method. WIN discovered influencer links from seemingly unrelated words from topics like politics to finance.

Such a matching market can be viewed as a variation of Fisher market, albeit with rather peculiar preferences of agents. These preferences can be described by piece-wise linear concave (PLC) functions, which however, are not separable (due to each agent only asking for one item), are not monotone, and do not satisfy the gross substitute property-increase in price of an item can result in increased demand for the item. Devanur and Kannan in FOCS 08 showed that market clearing prices can be found in polynomial time in markets with fixed number of items and general PLC preferences. They also consider Fischer markets with fixed number of agents (instead of fixed number of items), and give a polynomial time algorithm for this case if preferences are separable functions of the items, in addition to being PLC functions. Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm for finding market clearing prices in matching markets with fixed number of different agent preferences, despite that the utility corresponding to matching markets is not separable.

Selfish clients submit jobs, each with an arrival time, deadline, length, and value. The service provider's goal is to implement a truthful online mechanism for scheduling jobs so as to maximize the social welfare of the schedule. Recent work shows that under a stochastic assumption on job arrivals, there is a single-parameter family of mechanisms that achieves near-optimal social welfare. We show that given any such family of near-optimal online mechanisms, there exists an online mechanism that in the worst case performs nearly as well as the best of the given mechanisms. Our mechanism is truthful whenever the mechanisms in the given family are truthful and prompt, and achieves optimal (within constant factors) regret. We model the problem of competing against a family of online scheduling mechanisms as one of learning from expert advice. A primary challenge is that any scheduling decisions we make affect not only the payoff at the current step, but also the resource availability and payooffs in future steps. Furthermore, switching from one algorithm (a.k.a. expert) to another in an online fashion is challenging both because it requires synchronization with the state of the latter algorithm as well as because it affects the incentive structure of the algorithms. We further show how to adapt our algorithm to a non-clairvoyant setting where job lengths are unknown until jobs are run to completion. Once again, in this setting, we obtain truthfulness along with asymptotically optimal regret (within polylogarithmic factors).","[Chawla, Shuchi] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Devanur, Nikhil; Kulkarni, Janardhan] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA USA; [Niazadeh, Rad] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Microsoft; Cornell University,"Chawla, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",shuchi@cs.wisc.edu; nikdev@microsoft.com; jakul@microsoft.com; rad@cs.cornell.edu,,,"NSF [CCF-1512964, CCF-1617505, CCF-1320854]; Google Ph.D. Fellowship",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Google Ph.D. Fellowship(Google Incorporated),Shuchi Chawla was supported in part by NSF grants CCF-1320854 and CCF-1617505.

Previous work on selfish scheduling protocols has focused on two extreme models: omnipotent protocols that are aware of every machine and every job that is active at any given time, and oblivious protocols that are aware of nothing beyond the machine they control. The main focus of this paper is on a well-motivated middle-ground model of resource-aware protocols, which are aware of the set of machines that the system comprises, but unaware of what jobs are active at any given time. Apart from considering budget-balanced protocols, to which previous work was restricted, we augment the design space by also studying the extent to which overcharging can lead to improved performance. We first show that, in the omnipotent model, overcharging enables us to enforce the optimal outcome as the unique equilibrium, which largely improves over the Theta(log n)-approximation of social welfare that can be obtained by budget-balanced protocols, even in their best equilibrium [32]. We then transition to the resource-aware model and provide price of anarchy (PoA) upper and lower bounds for different classes of cost functions. For concave cost functions, we provide a protocol with PoA of 1 + epsilon for arbitrarily small epsilon > 0. When the cost functions can be both convex and concave we construct an overcharging protocol that yields PoA <= 2; a spectacular improvement over the bounds obtained for budget-balanced protocols, even in the omnipotent model. We complement our positive results with impossibility results for general increasing cost functions. We show that any resource-aware budget-balanced cost-sharing protocol has PoA of Theta(n) in this setting and, even if we use overcharging, no resource-aware protocol can achieve a PoA of o(root n).","[Christodoulou, Giorgos; Sgouritsa, Alkmini] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Gkatzelis, Vasilis] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Liverpool; Drexel University,"Christodoulou, G (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",,,"Gkatzelis, Vasilis/0000-0001-7203-438X","EPSRC [EP/M008118/1]; Royal Society [LT140046]; National Science Foundation [CCF-1216073, CCF-1161813, CCF-1408635]; EPSRC [EP/M008118/1] Funding Source: UKRI",EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Royal Society(Royal Society); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The first author was supported by EPSRC EP/M008118/1 and Royal Society LT140046.

The established solution to this problem is a class of peer prediction mechanisms, where each agent is rewarded based on how his answers compare with those of his peer agents. These peer prediction mechanisms are designed by exploring the stochastic correlation of agents' answers. The prior distribution of agents' true answers is often assumed to be known to the principal or at least to the agents. In this paper, we consider the problem of IEWV for heterogeneous binary signal tasks, where the answer distributions for different tasks are different and unknown a priori. A concrete setting is eliciting labels for training data. Here, data points are represented by their feature vectors x's and the principal wants to obtain corresponding binary labels y's from strategic agents. We design peer prediction mechanisms that leverage not only the stochastic correlation of agents' labels for the same feature vector x but also the (learned) correlation between feature vectors x's and the ground-truth labels y's. In our mechanism, each agent is rewarded by how his answer compares with a reference answer generated by a classiffication algorithm specialized for dealing with noisy data. Every agent truthfully reporting and exerting high effort form a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium. Some benefits of this approach include: (1) we do not need to always re-assign each task to multiple workers to obtain redundant answers. (2) A class of surrogate loss functions for binary classification can help us design new reward functions for peer prediction. (3) Symmetric uninformative reporting strategy (pure or mixed) is not an equilibrium strategy. (4) The principal does not need to know the joint distribution of workers' information a priori. We hope this work can point to a new and promising direction of information elicitation via more intelligent algorithms.","[Liu, Yang; Chen, Yiling] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",yangl@seas.harvard.edu; yiling@seas.harvard.edu,"Chen, Yuxuan/IWL-8267-2023; Chen, Yi/HIR-2608-2022; chen, ye Xiao/HSF-9650-2023; Chen, Yi/HPD-0595-2023; Chen, Yi/JBR-7728-2023; wu, yi/JEP-1581-2023; Chen, yf/JMR-4435-2023",,National Science Foundation [CCF-1301976]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1301976] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under grant CCF-1301976.,,29,16,22,0,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,63,80,,10.1145/3033274.3085126,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900008,0

To reconcile the differing objectives, we introduce posted machine prices. The selfish job seeks to minimize the sum of its completion time on the machine and the posted price for the machine. Prices may be static (i.e., set once and for all before any arrival) or dynamic (i.e., change over time), but they are determined only by the past, assuming nothing about upcoming events. Obviously, such schemes are inherently truthful. We consider the competitive ratio: the ratio between the makespan achievable by the pricing scheme and that of the optimal algorithm. We give tight bounds on the competitive ratio for both dynamic and static pricing schemes for identical, restricted, related, and unrelated machine settings. Our main result is a dynamic pricing scheme for related machines that gives a constant competitive ratio, essentially matching the competitive ratio of online algorithms for this setting. In contrast, dynamic pricing gives poor performance for unrelated machines. This lower bound also exhibits a gap between what can be achieved by pricing versus what can be achieved by online algorithms.","[Feldman, Michal; Fiat, Amos] Tel Aviv Univ, Blavatnik Sch Comp Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Roytman, Alan] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Comp Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark",Tel Aviv University; University of Copenhagen,"Feldman, M (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Blavatnik Sch Comp Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel.",mfeldman@tau.ac.il; fiat@tau.ac.il; alanr@di.ku.dk,,,European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant [337122]; Thorup's Advanced Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF-0602-02499B]; Israel Science Foundation [822/10]; Israeli Centers for Research Excellence (ICORE) program,European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant(European Research Council (ERC)); Thorup's Advanced Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); Israeli Centers for Research Excellence (ICORE) program,"The work of M.

To evaluate an online matching mechanism, we use the notion of blocking pairs from stable matching theory: our goal is to maximize the number of positions (or secretaries) that do not take part in a blocking pair. This is compared with a stable matching in which no blocking pair exists.

We model such settings in both classical and contextual bandit models in which the myopic agents maximize rewards according to current empirical averages, but are also amenable to exogenous payments that may cause them to alter their choices. Our notion of fairness asks that more qualified individuals are never (probabilistically) preferred over less qualified ones [8]. We investigate whether it is possible to design inexpensive subsidy or payment schemes for a principal to motivate myopic agents to play fairly in all or almost all rounds. When the principal has full information about the state of the myopic agents, we show it is possible to induce fair play on every round with a subsidy scheme of total cost o(T) (for the classic setting with k arms, (O) over tilde(root k(3)T), and for the d-dimensional linear contextual seSing (O) over tilde (d root k(3)T)). If the principal has much more limited information (as might often be the case for an external regulator or watchdog), and only observes the number of rounds in which members from each of the k groups were selected, but not the empirical estimates maintained by the myopic agent, the design of such a scheme becomes more complex. We show both positive and negative results in the classic and linear bandit settings by upper and lower bounding the cost of fair subsidy schemes.","[Kannan, Sampath; Kearns, Michael; Morgenstern, Jamie; Roth, Aaron; Vohra, Rakesh; Wu, Zhiwei Steven] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pai, Mallesh] Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Rice University,"Kannan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,"Roth, Aaron/0000-0002-0586-0515","National Science Foundation [CNS-0435060, CCR-0325197, EN-CS-0329609]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work is supported by the National Science Foundation, under grant CNS-0435060, grant CCR-0325197 and grant EN-CS-0329609.

Is dominant-strategy implementation equivalent to the semantically less stringent Bayesian one (as in the case of Myerson's 1-item auction)? Can one find explicit solutions for non-trivial families of multi-item auctions (as in the 1-item case)? In this paper, we present such natural families whose explicit solutions exhibit a revenue gap between the two implementations. More precisely, consider the k-item n-buyer maximum revenue auction where k, n > 1 with additive valuation in the independent setting (i.e., the buyers i have independent private distributions F-ij on items j). We derive exact formulas for the maximum revenue when k = 2 and F-ij are any IID distributions on support of size 2, for both the dominant-strategy (DIC) and the Bayesian (BIC) implementations. The formulas lead to the simple characterization that, the two models have identical maximum revenue if and only if selling-separately is optimal for the distribution. Our results also give the first demonstration, in this setting, of revenue gaps between the two models. For instance, if k = n = 2 and Pr(X-F = 1} = Pr{X-F = 2} = 1/2, then the maximum revenue in the Bayesian implementation exceeds that in the dominant-strategy by exactly 2%; the same gap exists for the continuous uniform distribution X-F over [a, a + 1 ] boolean OR [2a, 2a + 1] for all large a.","[Yao, Andrew Chi-Chih] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Yao, ACC (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",andrewcyao@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,29,15,21,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,3,20,,10.1145/3033274.3085120,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900002,0

First, our main result provides a complete characterization of truthful mechanisms that allocate all the items to the players. Our characterization reveals an interesting structure underlying all truthful mechanisms, showing that they can be decomposed into two components: a selection part where players pick their best subset among prespecified choices determined by the mechanism, and an exchange part where players are offered the chance to exchange certain subsets if it is favorable to do so. In the remaining paper, we apply our main result and derive several consequences on the design of mechanisms with fairness guarantees. We consider various notions of fairness, (indicatively, maximin share guarantees and envy-freeness up to one item) and provide tight bounds for their approximability.

The markets we consider consist of buyers and sellers of a number of items, and the aim of a mechanism is to improve the social welfare by arranging purchases and sales of the items. A mechanism is given prior distributions on the agents' valuations of the items, but not the actual valuations; thus the aim is to maximise the expected social welfare over these distributions. As in previous work, we are interested in the worst-case ratio between the social welfare achieved by a truthful mechanism, and the best social welfare possible. Our main result is an incentive compatible and budget balanced constant-factor approximation mechanism in a setting where buyers have XOS valuations and sellers' valuations are additive. The is the first such approximation mechanism for a two-sided market setting where the agents have combinatorial valuation functions. To achieve this result, we introduce a more general kind of demand query that seems to be needed in this situation. In the simpler case that sellers have unit supply (each having just one item to sell), we give a new mechanism whose welfare guarantee improves on a recent one in the literature. We also introduce a more demanding version of the strong budget balance (SBB) criterion, aimed at ruling out certain unnatural transactions satisfied by SBB. We show that the stronger version is satisfied by our mechanisms.","[Colini-Baldeschi, Riccardo] LUISS, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Rome, Italy; [Goldberg, Paul W.; Turchetta, Stefano] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [de Keijzer, Bart] Ctr Wiskunde & Informat CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Leonardi, Stefano] Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy; [Roughgarden, Tim] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Turchetta, Stefano] KPMG Italy, Milan, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; University of Oxford; Sapienza University Rome; Stanford University,"Colini-Baldeschi, R (通讯作者)，LUISS, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Rome, Italy.",,"Goldberg, Paul/ADX-8145-2022","Goldberg, Paul/0000-0002-5436-7890",NSF [CCF-1524062]; Google Focused Award on Algorithms for Large-scale Data Analysis; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1524062] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Google Focused Award on Algorithms for Large-scale Data Analysis(Google Incorporated); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),The authors thank anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

A cloud computing platform such as Amazon EC2 sells virtual machines to clients, each of who needs a different number of virtual machine hours. Similarly, cloud storage providers such as Dropbox have customers that require different amounts of storage. Software companies such as Microsoft sell software subscriptions that can have different levels of service. The levels could be the number of different documents you are allowed to create, or the number of hours you are allowed to use the software. Companies like Google and Microsoft sell API calls to artificial intelligence software such as face recognition, to other software developers. Video and mobile games are increasingly designed in such a way that one can pay for better access to certain features. Spotify and iTunes sell music subscription, and different people listen to different number of songs in a month. Cellphone service providers like AT&T and Verizon offer cellular phone call minutes and data. People have widely varying amounts of data consumption. Pricing is an important component in all these examples. The aim of this paper is to understand how to price such goods, for a monopolist seller who aims to maximize her revenue. The following common features (to a first degree of approximation) of these examples are crucial for our model. The marginal cost of offering a higher level of service is essentially a constant. The valuations for the different levels of service are roughly linear, subject to a cap. Based on this, we consider the following problem. There is a single good with multiple units of it for sale. Equivalently, there is a single service with various levels of service. The marginal cost to the seller for procuring another unit of the good is a constant. There is a population of buyers, each of who has a linear valuation for consuming a number of units of the good, subject to a cap (which we refer to as demand). The type/private information of a buyer is determined by the per-unit valuation and the demand. Buyers try to maximize their utility which is quasi linear, i.e., the valuation minus their payment. The question is what is the revenue maximizing pricing scheme.","[Devanur, Nikhil R.] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA; [Haghpanah, Nima] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Psomas, Alexandros] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA",Microsoft; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Devanur, NR (通讯作者)，Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.",,,,"NSF [CCF1408635, CCF0964033]; Templeton Foundation [3966]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Templeton Foundation,"This work is supported by the NSF, under grants CCF1408635, CCF0964033, Templeton Foundation grant 3966.",,6,2,4,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,41,42,,10.1145/3033274.3085122,0.0,,,2,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900005,0

In this work we study comparison-based choice functions, a simple but surprisingly rich class of functions capable of exhibiting so-called choice-set effects. Motivated by the challenge of predicting complex choices, we study the query complexity of these functions in a variety of settings. We consider settings that allow for active queries or passive observation of a stream of queries, and give analyses both at the granularity of individuals or populations that might exhibit heterogeneous choice behavior. Our main result is that any comparison-based choice function in one dimension can be inferred as efficiently as a basic maximum or minimum choice function across many query contexts, suggesting that choice-set effects need not entail any fundamental algorithmic barriers to inference. We also introduce a class of choice functions we call distance-comparison based functions, and briefly discuss the analysis of such functions.

The goods are not in limited supply, but can only be produced at a limited rate and are costly to produce. The seller observes only the bundle of goods purchased at each day, but nothing else about the buyers valuation function. Our main result is a dynamic pricing algorithm for optimizing welfare (including the seller's cost of production) that runs in time and a number of rounds that are polynomial in d and the approximation parameter. We are able to do this despite the fact that (i) the price-response function is not continuous, and even its fractional relaxation is a non-concave function of the prices, and (ii) the welfare is not observable to the seller. We derive this result as an application of a general technique for optimizing welfare over divisible goods, which is of independent interest. When buyers have strongly concave, Holder continuous valuation functions over d divisible goods, we give a general polynomial time dynamic pricing technique. We are able to apply this technique to the setting of unit-demand buyers despite the fact that in that setting the goods are not divisible, and the natural fractional relaxation of a unit-demand valuation is not strongly concave.

By introducing a new weighting scheme for the dilated entropy function, we develop the first distance-generating function for the strategy spaces of sequential games that only a logarithmic dependence on the branching factor of the player. This result improves the convergence rate of several first-order methods by a factor of Omega (b(d) d), where b is the branching factor of the player, and d is the depth of the game tree. Thus far, counterfactual regret minimization methods have been faster in practice, and more popular, than first-order methods despite their theoretically inferior convergence rates.

In this approach, these costs are given by an underlying metric on the set of all agents plus alternatives. Social choice rules have access to only the ordinal preferences of agents but not the latent cardinal costs that induce them. Distortion is then defined as the ratio between the social cost (typically the sum of agent costs) of the alternative chosen by the mechanism at hand, and that of the optimal alternative chosen by an omniscient algorithm. The worst-case distortion of a social choice rule is, therefore, a measure of how close it always gets to the optimal alternative without any knowledge of the underlying costs. Under this model, it has been conjectured that Ranked Pairs, the well-known weighted-tournament rule, achieves a distortion of at most 3 (Anshelevich et al. 2015). We disprove this conjecture by constructing a sequence of instances which shows that the worst-case distortion of Ranked Pairs is at least 5. Our lower bound on the worst-case distortion of Ranked Pairs matches a previously known upper bound for the Copeland rule, proving that in the worst case, the simpler Copeland rule is at least as good as Ranked Pairs. And as long as we are limited to (weighted or unweighted) tournament rules, we demonstrate that randomization cannot help achieve an expected worst-case distortion of less than 3. Using the concept of approximate majorization within the distortion framework, we prove that Copeland and Randomized Dictatorship achieve low constant factor fairness-ratios (5 and 3 respectively), which is a considerable generalization of similar results for the sum of costs and single largest cost objectives. In addition to all of the above, we outline several interesting directions for further research in this space.","[Goel, Ashish; Krishnaswamy, Anilesh K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Munagala, Kamesh] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Stanford University; Duke University,"Goel, A (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",anilesh@stanford.edu; ashishg@stanford.edu; kamesh@cs.duke.edu,,,"NSF [CCF-1637418, CCF-1408784, CCF-1637397, IIS-1447554]; ONR [N00014-15-1-2786]; ARO [W911NF-14-1-0526]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research); ARO,"Anilesh K.

When n agents are present, there is only one truly fair allocation: each agent receives 1/n of the resource. Implementing this static solution in the dynamic world is notoriously impractical; there are too many disruptions to existing allocations: for a new agent to get her fair share, all other agents must give up a small piece. A natural remedy is simply to restrict the number of allowed disruptions when a new agent arrives. [16] considered this setting, and introduced a natural benchmark - the fairness ratio - the ratio of the minimal share to the ideal share (1/k when there are k agents in the system). They described an algorithm that obtains the optimal fairness ratio when d >= 1 disruptions are allowed per arriving agent. However, in systems with high arrival rates even one disruption per arrival can be too costly. We consider the scenario when fewer than one disruption per arrival is allowed. We show that we can maintain high levels of fairness even with significantly fewer than one disruption per arrival. In particular, we present an instance-optimal algorithm (the input to the algorithm is a vector of allowed disruptions) and show that the fairness ratio of this algorithm decays logarithmically with c, where c is the longest number of consecutive time steps in which we are not allowed any disruptions. We then consider dynamic fair division with multiple, heterogeneous resources. In this model, agents demand the resources in fixed proportions, known in economics as Leontief preferences. We show that the general problem is NP-hard, even if the resource demands are binary and known in advance. We study the case where the fairness criterion is Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF), and the demand vectors are binary. We design a generic algorithm for this setting using a reduction to the single-resource case. To prove an impossibility result, we take an integer program for the problem and analyze an algorithm for constructing dual solutions to a residual linear program; this approach may be of independent interest.","[Friedman, Eric J.] ICSI, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; [Friedman, Eric J.; Psomas, Christos-Alexandros] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Vardi, Shai] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; California Institute of Technology,"Friedman, EJ (通讯作者)，ICSI, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.",,"Vardi, Shai/C-1105-2018","Psomas, Alexandros/0000-0002-7709-5058","National Science Foundation [NSF-1216073, NSF-1161813, CCF1408635, CCF0964033]; Templeton Foundation [3966]; Leventis Foundation; I-CORE in Algorithms Postdoctoral Fellowship",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Templeton Foundation; Leventis Foundation; I-CORE in Algorithms Postdoctoral Fellowship,"This work is supported by the National Science Foundation, under grants NSF-1216073, NSF-1161813, CCF1408635, CCF0964033, Templeton Foundation grant 3966, the Leventis Foundation and by the I-CORE in Algorithms Postdoctoral Fellowship.",,45,16,21,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,461,478,,10.11145/3033274.3085123,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900047,0

A publicly known cost function specifices the cost of providing every possible combination of services. A combinatorial cost sharing mechanism is a protocol that decides which services each player gets and at what price. We look for dominant strategy mechanisms that are (economically) efficient and cover the cost, ideally without overcharging (i.e., budget balanced). Note that unlike the standard cost sharing setting, combinatorial cost sharing is a multi-parameter domain. This makes designing dominant strategy mechanisms with good guarantees a challenging task. We present the Potential Mechanism - a combination of the VCG mechanism and a well-known tool from the theory of cooperative games: Hart and Mas-Colell's potential function. The potential mechanism is a dominant strategy mechanism that always covers the incurred cost. When the cost function is subadditive the same mechanism is also approximately efficient. Our main technical contribution shows that when the cost function is submodular the potential mechanism is approximately budget balanced in three settings: supermodular valuations, symmetric cost function and general symmetric valuations, and two players with general valuations.","[Dobzinski, Shahar; Ovadia, Shahar] Weizmann Inst Sci, Rehovot, Israel",Weizmann Institute of Science,"Dobzinski, S (通讯作者)，Weizmann Inst Sci, Rehovot, Israel.",shahar.dobzinski@weizmann.ac.il; shaharov59@gmail.com,,,I-CORE program of the planning and budgeting commiSee; Israel Science Foundation [4/11]; EU CIG grant [618128],I-CORE program of the planning and budgeting commiSee; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); EU CIG grant,The first author is the incumbent of the Lilian and George LySle Career Development Chair.

For Nash equilibrium, we prove that constant grid size (that depends on epsilon andm, but not on n) is sufficient to guarantee the existence of a weak approximate equilibrium. This result implies a polynomial (in the input) algorithm for a weak approximate equilibrium. For approximate Nash equilibrium we introduce a closely related question and prove its equivalence to the well-known Beck-Fiala conjecture from discrepancy theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that introduces a connection between game theory and discrepancy theory. For a correlated equilibrium, we prove a O(1/log n) lower-bound on the grid size, which matches the known upper bound of Omega(1/log n). Our result implies an Omega(log n) lower bound on the rate of convergence of any dynamic to approximate correlated (and coarse correlated) equilibrium.

Segal (2007) and Gonczarowski et al.

In real-world markets with many agents, this communication requirement is implausibly high. This casts doubts on whether stable matching can arise in large markets. We study markets with realistic structure on the preferences and information of agents, and show that in typical markets, a stable matching can be found with much less communication effort. In our model, the preferences of workers are unrestricted, and the preferences of firms follow an additively separable latent utility model. Our efficient communication protocol modifies workers-proposing DA, by having firms signal workers they especially like, while also broadcasting qualification requirements to discourage other workers who have no realistic chances from applying. In the special case of tiered random markets, the protocol can be modified to run in two-rounds and involve only private messages.

Unlike prior work on this model, we allow many states of nature. We assume that the principal's objective is a monotone set function, and study the problem both in the public signal and private signal models, drawing a sharp contrast between the two in terms of both efficacy and computational complexity. When private signals are allowed, our results are largely positive and quite general. First, we use linear programming duality and the equivalence of separation and optimization to show polynomial-time equivalence between (exactly) optimal signaling and the problem of maximizing the objective function plus an additive function. This yields an efficient implementation of the optimal scheme when the objective is supermodular or anonymous. Second, we exhibit a (1 - 1/e)-approximation of the optimal private signaling scheme, modulo an additive loss of epsilon, when the objective function is submodular. These two results simplify, unify, and generalize results of [3, 4], extending them from a binary state of nature to many states (modulo the additive loss in the later result). Third, we consider the binary-state case with a submodular objective, and simplify and slightly strengthen the result of [4] to obtain a (1 - 1/e)-approximation via a scheme which (i) signals independently to each receiver and (ii) is oblivious in that it does not depend on the objective function so long as it is monotone submodular. When only a public signal is allowed, our results are negative. First, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the optimal public scheme, within any constant factor, even when the objective is additive. Second, we show that the optimal private scheme can outperform the optimal public scheme, in terms of maximizing the sender's objective, by a polynomial factor.","[Dughmi, Shaddin; Xu, Haifeng] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Dughmi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",shaddin@usc.edu; haifengx@usc.edu,,,NSF [CCF-1350900],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work is supported by NSF grant CCF-1350900.,,27,16,19,1,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,351,368,,10.1145/3033274.3085152,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900040,0

As such, well-designed centralized markets must induce participants to join voluntarily, in spite of pre-existing decentralized institutions they may already be using. Utilizing the general framework of Monderer and Tennenholtz (2009)[1], we take the view that centralizing a market is akin to designing a mediator to which people may sign away their decision rights. The mediator is voluntary in the sense that it cannot condition the actions of those who participate on the actions of those who do not. Within this setting we propose a new desideratum for market design: Dominant Individual Rationality (D-IR). A mediator is D-IR if every decentralized strategy is weakly dominated by some centralized strategy. While such a criterion does not offer a prediction about how people will behave within the centralized market, it does provide a strong guarantee that all players will use centralized strategies rather than opting out of the centralized market. We show that suitable modification of the Boston mechanism satisfies D-IR and a similar modification of any stable matching mechanism satisfies an approximation of D-IR. In both cases the modification relies on allowing the receiving end of the market to accept offers in either the centralized or decentralized part of the market. This design closely resembles the suggestion of Niederle et al. (2006) [2] about centralizing the market for gastroenterologists. Relative to their analysis, ours highlights why this design feature coupled with some, but not all, matching algorithms is effective in inducing participation of the proposing side of the market. Further, by highlighting its role in attaining (approximate) D-IR our analysis provides a new non-cooperative justification for stability. In other applications we demonstrate that, suitably modified, Top Trading Cycles satisfies D-IR, and double auctions satisfy approximate D-IR.

We formulate two somewhat general techniques for designing good pricing algorithms for this setting: Price Doubling and Item Halving. Using these techniques, we unify many of the existing results in the item pricing literature under a common framework, as well as provide several new bicriteria algorithms for approximating both revenue and social welfare simultaneously. More specifically, for a variety of settings with item pricing, we show that it is possible to deterministically obtain a log-approximation for revenue and a constant-approximation for social welfare simultaneously: thus one need not sacrifice revenue if the goal is to still have decent welfare guarantees. The main technical contribution of this paper is a O((log m + log k)(2))-approximation algorithm for revenue maximization based on the item halving technique, for settings where buyers have XoS valuations, where m is the number of goods and k is the average supply. Surprisingly, ours is the first known item pricing algorithm with polylogarithmic approximation for such general classes of valuations, and partially resolves an important open question from the algorithmic pricing literature about the existence of item pricing algorithms with logarithmic factors for general valuations [4]. We also use the item halving framework to form envy-free item pricing mechanisms for the popular setting of multi-unit markets, providing a log-approximation to revenue in this case.","[Anshelevich, Elliot; Sekar, Shreyas] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Comp Sci, 110,8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Anshelevich, E (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Comp Sci, 110,8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",eanshel@cs.rpi.edu; shreyas.sekar@gmail.com,,,"NSF [CNS-1218374, CCF-1527497]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was partially supported by NSF awards CNS-1218374 and CCF-1527497.,,27,3,3,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,325,342,,10.1145/3033274.3085117,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900035,0

Wagering mechanisms can be used to elicit predictions from agents who reveal their beliefs by placing bets. Lambert et al. [20, 21] introduced weighted score wagering mechanisms, a class of budget-balanced wagering mechanisms under which agents with immutable beliefs truthfully report their predictions. However, we demonstrate that these and other existing incentive compatible wagering mechanisms are not Pareto optimal: agents have significant budget left over even when additional trade would be mutually benficial. Motivated by this observation, we design a new wagering mechanism, the double clinching auction, a two-sided version of the adaptive clinching auction [9]. We show that no wagering mechanism can simultaneously satisfy weak budget balance, individual rationality, weak incentive compatibility, and Pareto optimality. However, we prove that the double clinching auction attains the first three and show in a series of simulations using real contest data that it comes much closer to Pareto optimality than previously known incentive compatible wagering mechanisms, in some cases almost matching the efficiency of the Pareto optimal (but not incentive compatible) parimutuel consensus mechanism. When the goal of wagering is to crowdsource probabilities, Pareto optimality drives participation and incentive compatibility drives accuracy, making the double clinching auction an attractive and practical choice. Our mechanism may be of independent interest as the first two-sided version of the adaptive clinching auction.","[Freeman, Rupert] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Pennock, David M.; Vaughan, Jennifer Wortman] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA USA",Duke University; Microsoft,"Freeman, R (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,"Freeman, Rupert/0000-0003-4744-9449; Pennock, David/0000-0003-0522-4815",,,,,25,9,12,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,43,60,,10.1145/3033274.3085118,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900006,0

These approaches have generally considered an agent who experiences a single behavioral bias, studying the effect of this bias on the outcome. In general, however, decision-making can and will be affected by multiple biases operating at the same time. How do multiple biases interact to produce the overall outcome? Here we consider decisions in the presence of a pair of biases exhibiting an intuitively natural interaction: present bias - the tendency to value costs incurred in the present too highly - and sunk-cost bias - the tendency to incorporate costs experienced in the past into one's plans for the future. We propose a theoretical model for planning with this pair of biases, and we show how certain natural behavioral phenomena can arise in our model only when agents exhibit both biases. As part of our model we differentiate between agents that are aware of their biases (sophisticated) and agents that are unaware of them (naive). Interestingly, we show that the interaction between the two biases is quite complex: in some cases, they mitigate each other's effects while in other cases they might amplify each other. We obtain a number of further results as well, including the fact that the planning problem in our model for an agent experiencing and aware of both biases is computationally hard in general, though tractable under more relaxed assumptions.","[Kleinberg, Jon; Raghavan, Manish] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Oren, Sigal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel",Cornell University; Ben Gurion University,"Kleinberg, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Oren, Sigal/AHE-1701-2022","Oren, Sigal/0000-0002-4271-7291",Simons Investigator Award; ARO MURI grant; Google Research Grant; Facebook Faculty Research Grant,Simons Investigator Award; ARO MURI grant(MURI); Google Research Grant(Google Incorporated); Facebook Faculty Research Grant(Facebook Inc),"Supported in part by a Simons Investigator Award, an ARO MURI grant, a Google Research Grant, and a Facebook Faculty Research Grant.",,25,8,9,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,567,584,,10.1145/3033274.3085156,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900060,0

We study a practically important class of security games that is played out in space and time, with targets and patrols moving on a real line. A central open question here is whether the Nash equilibrium (i.e., the minimax strategy of the defender) can be computed in polynomial time. We resolve this question in the affirmative. Our algorithm runs in time polynomial in the input size, and only polylogarithmic in the number of possible patrol locations (M). Further, we provide a continuous extension in which patrol locations can take arbitrary real values. Prior work obtained polynomial-time algorithms only under a substantial assumption, e.g., a constant number of rounds.

In order to quantify the quality of approximation, it is natural to consider the candidates and voters as embedded within a common metric space, and to ask how much further the chosen candidate is from the population as compared to the socially optimal one. We use this metric preference model to explore a fundamental and timely question: does the social welfare of a population improve when candidates are representative of the population? If so, then by how much, and how does the answer depend on the complexity of the metric space? We restrict attention to the most fundamental and common social choice setting: a population of voters, two candidates, and a majority rule election. When candidates are not representative of the population, it is known that the candidate selected by the majority rule can be thrice as far from the population as the socially optimal one; this holds even when the underlying metric is a line. We examine how this ratio improves when candidates are drawn independently from the population of voters. Our results are two-fold: When the metric is a line, the ratio improves from 3 to (4 - 2 root 2) approximate to 1.1716; this bound is tight. When the metric is arbitrary, we show a lower bound of 1.5 and a constant upper bound strictly better than 2 on the distortion of majority rule. The aforementioned positive results depend in part on the assumption that the two candidates are independently and identically distributed. However, we show that i.i.d. candidates do not suffice for our upper bounds: if the population of candidates can be different from that of voters, an upper bound of 2 on the distortion is tight for both general metric spaces and the line. Thus, we show a constant gap between representative and non-representative candidates in both cases.","[Cheng, Yu; Dughmi, Shaddin; Kempe, David] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Cheng, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,,"Cheng, Yu/0000-0002-0019-2570","Shang-Hua Teng's Simons Investigator Award; NSF [CCF-1423618, IIS-1619458]; NSF CAREER award [CCF-1350900]",Shang-Hua Teng's Simons Investigator Award; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF CAREER award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"Yu Cheng is supported in part by Shang-Hua Teng's Simons Investigator Award.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of posted price mechanisms when customers arrive in an unknown random order. We compare the expected revenue of these mechanisms to the expected revenue of the optimal auction in two different settings. Namely, the nonadaptive setting in which all offers are sent to the customers beforehand, and the adaptive setting in which an offer is made when a consumer arrives. For the nonadaptive case, we obtain a strategy achieving an expected revenue within at least a 1 - 1/e fraction of that of the optimal auction. We also show that this bound is tight, even if the customers have i.i.d. valuations for the item. For the adaptive case, we exhibit a posted price mechanism that achieves a factor 0 :745 of the optimal revenue, when the customers have i.i.d. valuations for the item.

Given these polytopes, a strategy profile naturally corresponds to an integral vector in the aggregation polytope P-N = Sigma(i) P-i. We identify two general properties of the aggregation polytope P-N that are sufficient for our results to go through, namely the integer decomposition property (IDP) and the box-totally dual integrality property (box-TDI). Intuitively, the IDP is needed to decompose a load profile in P-N into a respective strategy profile of the players, and box-TDI ensures that the intersection of a polytope with an arbitrary integer box is an integral polytope. Examples of polytopal congestion games which satisfy IDP and box-TDI include common source network congestion games, symmetric totally unimodular congestion games, non-symmetric matroid congestion games and symmetric matroid intersection congestion games (in particular, r-arborescences and strongly base-orderable matroids). Our main contributions for polytopal congestion games satisfying IDP and box-TDI are as follows: (1) We derive tight bounds on the price of stability for these games. This extends a result of Fotakis (2010) on the price of stability for symmetric network congestion games to the larger class of polytopal congestion games. Our bounds improve upon the ones for general polynomial congestion games obtained by Christodoulou and Gairing (2016). (2) We show that pure Nash equilibria can be computed in strongly polynomial time for these games. To this aim, we generalize a recent aggregation/decomposition framework by Del Pia et al. (2017) for symmetric totally unimodular and non-symmetric matroid congestion games, both being a special case of our polytopal congestion games. (3) Finally, we generalize and extend results on the computation of strong equilibria in bottleneck congestion games studied by Harks, Hoefer, Klimm and Skopalik (2013). In particular, we show that strong equilibria can be computed efficiently for symmetric totally unimodular boSleneck congestion games. In general, our results reveal that the combination of IDP and box-TDI gives rise to an efficient approach to compute a pure Nash equilibrium whose inefficiency is better than in general congestion games.","[Kleer, Pieter; Schafer, Guido] CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schafer, Guido] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Kleer, P (通讯作者)，CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,33,3,3,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,223,240,,10.1145/3033274.3085149,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900024,0

Our replication confirms that this is the case, following the original study's assumption that the financial firms' behaviors are fixed. We then extend the model to account for a possible strategic response, where financial firms adapt to the regulatory regime. Using empirical game-theoretic analysis, we derive equilibria with and without regulation. We find that in the new Basel-regulated equilibria, more funds stay out of default and banks lose less capital.

Our fairness guarantees are in terms of the maximin share, that is defined to be the maximum value that an agent can ensure for herself, if she were to partition the goods into n bundles, and then receive a minimum valued bundle. Since maximin fair allocations (i.e., allocations in which each agent gets at least her maximin share) do not always exist, prior work has focussed on approximation results that aim to find allocations in which the value of the bundle allocated to each agent is (multiplicatively) as close to her maximin share as possible. In particular, Procaccia and Wang (2014) along with Amanatidis et al. (2015) have shown that under additive valuations a 2 /3-approximate maximin fair allocation always exists and can be found in polynomial time. We complement these results by developing a simple and efficient algorithm that achieves the same approximation guarantee. Furthermore, we initiate the study of approximate maximin fair division under submodular valuations. Specifically, we show that when the valuations of the agents are nonnegative, monotone, and submodular, then a 1\10-approximate maximin fair allocation is guaranteed to exist. In fact, we show that such an allocation can be efficiently found by using a simple round-robin algorithm. A technical contribution of the paper is to analyze the performance of this combinatorial algorithm by employing the concept of multilinear extensions.","[Barman, Siddharth] Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Murthy, Sanath Kumar Krishna] Chennai Math Inst, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Chennai Mathematical Institute,"Barman, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",,,,Ramanujan Fellowship [SERB -SB/S2/RJN-128/2015],Ramanujan Fellowship(Department of Science & Technology (India)),The first author was supported in part by a Ramanujan Fellowship (SERB -SB/S2/RJN-128/2015).,,37,54,66,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,647,664,,10.1145/3033274.3085136,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900068,0

In our setting, under standard continuity and convexity conditions, a stable outcome exists in any acyclic network, as long as all firms regard sales as substitutes and the market is large. Thus, complementarities between inputs do not preclude the existence of stable outcomes in large markets, unlike in discrete markets. Even when sales are not substitutable, tree stable outcomes exist in our setting. The model presented in this paper generalizes and unifies versions of general equilibrium models with divisible and indivisible goods, matching models with continuously divisible contracts, models of large (two-sided) matching with complementarities, and club formation models. Additional results provide intuition for the role of uni-directional substitutability conditions and acyclicity in the main existence results, and explain what kinds of equilibria are guaranteed to exist even when these conditions are relaxed.

This is limiting in many domains, where we would expect agents to differ in taste, judgment and reliability. Although the Correlated Agreement (CA) mechanism [30] can be extended to handle heterogeneous agents, the new challenge is with the efficient estimation of agent signal types. We solve this problem by clustering agents based on their reporting behavior, proposing a mechanism that works with clusters of agents and designing algorithms that learn such a clustering. In this way, we also connect peer prediction with the Dawid and Skene [5] literature on latent types. We retain the robustness against coordinated misreports of the CA mechanism, achieving an approximate incentive guarantee of epsilon-informed truthfulness.

The algorithms in this setting are considered non-adaptive as they have to choose the subgraph H without knowing any information about the set of realized edges in G. Originally motivated by an application to kidney exchange, the stochastic matching problem and its variants have received significant attention in recent years. The state-of-the-art non-adaptive algorithms for stochastic matching achieve an approximation ratio of 1/2 - epsilon for any epsilon > 0, naturally raising the question that if 1/2 is the limit of what can be achieved with a non-adaptive algorithm. In this work, we resolve this question by presenting the first algorithm for stochastic matching with an approximation guarantee that is strictly better than 1/2: the algorithm computes a subgraph H of G with the maximum degree O(log (1/p)/p) such that the ratio of expected size of a maximum matching in realizations of H and G is at least 1/2 + delta(0) for some absolute constant delta(0) > 0. The degree bound on H achieved by our algorithm is essentially the best possible (up to an O(log (1/p)) factor) for any constant factor approximation algorithm, since an Omega(1/p) degree in H is necessary for a vertex to acquire at least one incident edge in a realization. Our result makes progress towards answering an open problem of Blum et al. (EC 2015) regarding the possibility of achieving a (1 - epsilon)-approximation for the stochastic matching problem using non-adaptive algorithms. From the technical point of view, a key ingredient of our algorithm is a structural result showing that a graph whose expected maximum matching size is opt always contains a b-matching of size (essentially) b .

This problem was originally introduced by Dobzinski, Nisan, and Oren (STOC'14) as the following simple market scenario: m items are to be allocated among n bidders in a distributed setting where bidders valuations are private and hence communication is needed to obtain an efficient allocation. The communication happens in rounds: in each round, each bidder, simultaneously with others, broadcasts a message to all parties involved. At the end, the central planner computes an allocation solely based on the communicated messages. Dobzinski et al. showed that (at least some) interaction is necessary for obtaining any efficient allocation: no non-interactive (1-round) protocol with polynomial communication (in the number of items and bidders) can achieve approximation ratio better than Omega(m(1/4)), while for any r >= 1, there exists r-round protocols that achieve (O) over tilde (r . m(1/r+1)) approximation with polynomial communication; in particular, O(log m) rounds of interaction suffice to obtain an (almost) efficient allocation, i.e., a polylog(m)-approximation. A natural question at this point is to identify the right level of interaction (i.e., number of rounds) necessary to obtain an efficient allocation. In this paper, we resolve this question by providing an almost tight round-approximation tradeoff for this problem: we show that for any r >= 1, any r-round protocol that uses poly(m, n) bits of communication can only approximate the social welfare up to a factor of Omega(1/r . m(1/2r+1)). This in particular implies that Omega(log m/log log m) rounds of interaction are necessary for obtaining any efficient allocation (i.e., a constant or even a polylog(m)-approximation) in these markets. Our work builds on the recent multi-party round-elimination technique of Alon, Nisan, Raz, and Weinstein (FOCS'15) - used to prove similar-in-spirit lower bounds for round-approximation tradeoff in unit-demand (matching) markets - and settles an open question posed initially by Dobzinski et al., and subsequently by Alon et al.","[Assadi, Sepehr] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Assadi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [CCF-1552909, CCF-1617851, IIS-1447470]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Supported in part by National Science Foundation grants CCF-1552909, CCF-1617851, and IIS-1447470.",,27,15,17,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,145,162,,10.1145/3033274.3085121,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900017,0

At the center of this literature lies the question of whether there exist mechanisms that can implement fair outcomes, despite the agents' strategic behavior. A fundamental objective function used for measuring the fairness of an allocation is the geometric mean of the agents' values, known as the Nash social welfare (NSW). This objective function is maximized by widely known solution concepts such as Nash bargaining and the competitive equilibrium with equal incomes. In this work we focus on the question of (approximately) implementing this objective. The starting point of our analysis is the Fisher market, a fundamental model of an economy, whose benchmark is precisely the (weighted) Nash social welfare. We begin by studying two extreme classes of valuations functions, namely perfect substitutes and perfect complements, and find that for perfect substitutes, the Fisher market mechanism yields a constant approximation: at most 2 and at least e(1/e) (approximate to 1.44). However, for perfect complements, the Fisher market mechanism does not work well, its bound degrading linearly with the number of players. Strikingly, the Trading Post mechanism-an indirect market mechanism also known as the Shapley-Shubik game-has significantly better performance than the Fisher market on its own benchmark. Not only does Trading Post achieve an approximation of 2 for perfect substitutes, but this bound holds for any concave utilities, and it becomes essentially optimal for perfect complements, where it reaches (1 + epsilon) for any epsilon > 0. Moreover, we show that all the Nash equilibria of the Trading Post mechanism are pure (hence the approximation factors extend to all Nash equilibria), and satisfy an important notion of individual fairness known as proportionality.","[Branzei, Simina] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Gkatzelis, Vasilis] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mehta, Ruta] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Drexel University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Brânzei, S (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.",,,"Gkatzelis, Vasilis/0000-0001-7203-438X","ISF [1435/14]; Israel-USA Bi-national Science Foundation (BSF) [2014389]; I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee; Israel Science Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [740282]; NSF [CCF-1408635, CCF-1216073, CCF-1161813]",ISF(Israel Science Foundation); Israel-USA Bi-national Science Foundation (BSF)(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Simina was supported by ISF grant 1435/14 administered by the Israeli Academy of Sciences and Israel-USA Bi-national Science Foundation (BSF) grant 2014389, and the I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee and The Israel Science Foundation.
