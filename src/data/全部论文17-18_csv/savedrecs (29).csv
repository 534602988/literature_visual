The method is not consistent with the purposes and can't really reflect the participants' Putonghua level of speaking.

The research relies on the secondary statistical data of the Czech Statistical Office, the General Financial Directorate of the Czech Republic and the OECD Fiscal Decentralization Database. Since fiscal decentralization has many dimensions, the following indicators are used for empirical examination. expenditure decentralization, revenue decentralization, intergovernmental transfer decentralization and tax revenue decentralization. The study uses Hodrick-Prescott filter for isolating the cycle component of annual GDP time series. The empirical tests are based on cross correlation and Granger causality methodology. The results suggest that decentralization appears to be positively associated with GDP per capita but negatively associated with GDP growth, except expenditure decentralization positively correlated in both cases. The relationship is stronger for economic maturity than for economic growth. Based on results of Granger causality, GDP growth comes first followed by decentralization.","[Szarowska, Irena] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Szarowská, I (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina, Czech Republic.",szarowska@opf.slu.cz,"Szarowská, Irena/J-6391-2012","Szarowská, Irena/0000-0002-5197-6455","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government)","This paper was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2017.",,34,1,1,0,2,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Internet finance has led to non-financial institutions involved in the financial services industry, which represented by electricity business enterprises. And Internet finance has caused a great impact on the past model of financial industry. However, Chinese researchers are less likely to analyze the Internet finance impact on consumers in a macro perspective.

The data cover the period from 2000 to 2014. Although bank liquidity, measured by the liquid asset ratio, decreased during the analyzed period, Czech banks were liquid enough and prepared for a potential bank run. Using panel data regression analysis, we tested seven bank-specific factors and seven macroeconomic factors. The sensitivity of Czech banks to a possible bank run is determined by bank profitability. Among the macroeconomic factors, the interest rate and unemployment rate are relevant. However, the most important factor is the level of bank liquidity: banks with a sufficient buffer of liquid assets are safer than other banks, particularly during periods of financial distress.","[Vodova, Pavla Klepkova; Stavarek, Daniel] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Vodová, PK (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",klepkova@opf.slu.cz; stavarek@opf.slu.cz,"Vodova, Pavla Klepkova/ABG-2948-2020","Vodova, Pavla Klepkova/0000-0003-0382-5174",,,,,8,0,0,0,0,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4362-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,147,153,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI4MO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411851600019,0

A precise description of road network patterns can provide useful guidance for both design and improvement of road systems. Most previous studies have classified road network patterns using a visual inspection method. Although visual inspection is valuable in practical applications, it can be subjective and time consuming. Hence, a more reliable, automated, and quantitative approach for the classification of road network patterns is required. The objective of this study is to develop and apply a quantitative method for network pattern classification. Data analyzed are from 718 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in Florida's Hillsborough County. Six quantitative metrics, geometric and topologic, were analyzed, and their ability to classify different road network patterns were compared. Then, a multinomial logit model was developed to classify various network patterns using the six metrics. The results show that meshedness coefficient, proportion of cul-de-sacs, and proportion of 4-legged intersections were the three most significant variables in determining network patterns. Finally, this quantitative method was validated using TAZ data from Florida's Orange County, with an accuracy of 74.7%. This accuracy demonstrates the potential of the method in automatically and reliably classifying road network patterns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the Push and Pull Theory, on the one hand, the startups of returned rural migrant workers are attracted and pulled by the new economic development in rural areas, on the other hand, they are pushed away due to the poor adaptabilities of working in cities. Nowadays, policies shall be strengthened to encourage rural migrant workers to return home for startups and increase the income expectation through startups, pulling them to return home for startups.","[Yang, Dan] China West Normal Univ, Sch Management, Nanchong 637002, Peoples R China",China West Normal University,"Yang, D (通讯作者)，China West Normal Univ, Sch Management, Nanchong 637002, Peoples R China.",,,,Fundamental Research Funds of China West Normal University [17E010],Fundamental Research Funds of China West Normal University,Supported by the Fundamental Research Funds of China West Normal University (Grant No. 17E010).,,13,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-437-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,32.0,,,,,,511,514,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426689600106,0

Therefore, as a being current member of WTO, it is necessary to examine the current competitiveness of agriculture exports. In order to assess the export competitiveness, we use the popular Balassa Revealed Comparative Advantages Index. According to our findings, a group of products have comparative advantages including cereals wheat and meslin, barley, wheat and meslin flour as well as cotton, oilseeds and sunflower seeds. Moreover, the regression analysis is used in the paper. The results show that GDP, GDP per capita and arable land have negative effects on the export competitiveness of agricultural products, while agricultural employment, exchange rate and WTO memberships are positively associated with comparative advantages.","[Zhaishylyk, Nurdana; Sun, Fang] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Sun, F (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,8,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-405-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,37.0,,,,,,117,124,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ9PC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429699600007,0

The results show that the cash holding ratio of insurance companies increases with the increase of economic policy uncertainty, and the increase in the proportion of cash holdings of life insurance enterprises and large-scale insurance enterprises is more than other types of insurance companies when economic policy is more uncertain, but premiums and claims of non-life insurance companies and small and medium-sized insurance companies premium are more volatile.

Yet, here we demonstrate an important limitation to this result: the awareness of the own group's structural disadvantages relative to a comparison group renders within-group cooperation more fragile. More specifically, we confirm the general pattern that the desire to avoid 'lagging behind' a comparison group motivates within-group cooperation. However, having information about the own group's structural disadvantage, i.e., the own group's lower return from cooperation, leads group members to become more sensitive to how well their group 'stands together'. That is, they reduce their contributions more strongly in response to within-group free-riding. Further analyses suggest that particularly those group members who perceive that contributions are not comparable between groups reduce their contributions more strongly in response to within-group free-riding.","[Boehm, Robert] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Templergraben 64, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Rockenbach, Bettina; Zimmermann, Jarid] Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; University of Cologne,"Zimmermann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",robert.boehm@rwth-aachen.de; bettina.rockenbach@uni-koeln.de; jarid.zimmermann@uni-koeln.de,"Rockenbach, Bettina/HRC-3842-2023; Rockenbach, Bettina/B-5447-2016; Rockenbach, Bettina/AAI-8072-2021","Rockenbach, Bettina/0000-0003-2624-1964; Rockenbach, Bettina/0000-0003-2624-1964; Bohm, Robert/0000-0001-6806-0374",German Research Foundation [246329797],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),We gratefully acknowledge funding from the German Research Foundation [grant number 246329797].,,34,1,1,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-4870,1872-7719,,J ECON PSYCHOL,J.

Immediately thereafter, the new national government started to extend Piedmontese laws to the new nation's southern regions, introducing conscription and heavy taxation. The institutions and body politics of the pre-unification Italian states differed considerably. The new state centralized governmental power to level those differences. The southern people, were subjected to heavy-handed coercion, if not exploitation. The paper focuses on the coercion imposed by fiscal policies on the South. It asks whether coercion from the center was attenuated by redistribution operated at the regional and, especially, at the personal level with a focus on the poor. The answers confirm that fiscal coercion was indeed formidable. The Italian state imposed a heavy tax burden on the poor of all regions. When public expenditure also is brought in the picture, the poor in the southern regions remained disadvantaged, but less than they were before unification.","[Brosio, Giorgio] Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Stat, 113 Str Bellardo, I-10132 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Brosio, G (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Stat, 113 Str Bellardo, I-10132 Turin, Italy.",giorgio.brosio@unito.it,"Baltutyte, Gerda/AGH-5630-2022",,,,,,53,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2018,177.0,3-4,,,SI,,235,264,,10.1007/s11127-018-0589-2,0.0,,,30,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GW2IX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446708000004,0

In this paper, we consider market connectedness, assessing volatility spillover between the world's three largest seafood markets, the EU, Japan and the USA, for fish and crustaceans. The data spans from 1990 to 2015, capturing a period of strong growth in the seafood trade, as both the EU and US increased their share of the global seafood trade. We find lime-varying and significant spillover between all markets. The results suggest that volatility spillover originates from the net exporting market and is transmitted to the net importing markets, which is particularly evident for crustaceans, where Japan is a positive net transmitter to the EU and US. Further, we can identify several peaks in volatility spillover and relate them to events like El Nino/La Nina and to the financial crisis as a period of high volatility spillover.","[Dahl, Roy Endre; Jonsson, Erlendur] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ & Risk Management, NO-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Dahl, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ & Risk Management, NO-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",roy.e.dahl@uis.no,,"Dahl, Roy Endre/0000-0002-1874-795X",,,,,74,18,21,3,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

The countercyclicality of multilateral development bank (MDB) lending is mostly driven by the behavior of the World Bank (borrowing from regional development banks tends to be acyclical). The paper also shows that MDB lending to Latin America and East Asia is more countercyclical than MDB lending to other regions. Private sector lending is instead procyclical in all developing regions. While the cyclicality of MDB lending does not depend on domestic or international conditions, private lending becomes particularly procyclical in periods of limited global capital flows. By focusing on both borrower and lender heterogeneity, the paper shows that the cyclical properties of international government debt are mostly driven by credit supply shocks. Demand factors appear to be less important drivers of procyclical international government borrowing. The focus on supply and demand factors is different from the traditional push and pull classification, as push and pull factors could affect both the demand and the supply of international government debt.

We analyze the performance of three different payment vehicles in a Malaysian case of valuing wetland conservation. Two are well-known: voluntary donations and income taxes. The third is new: reductions in government subsidies for daily consumer goods. Using donations is common, but this payment vehicle is prone to issues of free-riding. An income tax usually has favorable properties and is commonly used in environmental valuation. However, in Malaysia as well as in many other low- to middle-income economies, large proportions of people do not pay income taxes, putting the validity of this payment vehicle into question. Instead, citizens in Malaysia and many other countries benefit from subsidies for a range of consumer goods. We find that price sensitivity is higher and the unexplained variance smaller when using subsidies rather than donations or income taxes. Importantly, this approach translates into completely different conclusions concerning policy advice. Our results suggest that in developing countries, using reduced subsidies as a payment vehicle may have favorable properties in terms of improved payment consequentiality compared to alternative payment vehicles, thus enhancing the external validity of stated preference surveys.","[Hassan, Suziana; Olsen, Soren Boye; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Hassan, Suziana] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Bintulu Campus, Bintulu 97008, Malaysia; [Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Universiti Putra Malaysia; University of Copenhagen,"Hassan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.;Hassan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Agr & Food Sci, Bintulu Campus, Bintulu 97008, Malaysia.",suzi@upm.edu.my; sobo@ifro.ku.dk; bjt@ifro.ku.dk,"Olsen, Søren B/M-2949-2014; Hassan, Suziana/ABS-7612-2022; Nummer2, CMEC/HKE-1900-2023; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/K-8770-2014","Olsen, Søren B/0000-0002-1278-3749; Hassan, Suziana/0000-0002-1051-158X; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/0000-0002-3305-8343",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education's (Malaysia) Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS) Programme [JPT.S (BPKI) 2000/09/01/015Jld.4 (67)]; Danish National Research Foundation (Centre of Excellence Grant) [DNRF 96]; research group of Responsible Rural Tourism Network,"Universiti Putra Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia); Ministry of Higher Education's (Malaysia) Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS) Programme; Danish National Research Foundation (Centre of Excellence Grant); research group of Responsible Rural Tourism Network",The authors acknowledge the help of reviewers and the editor in improving the manuscript.

Concerning the effects of the firstborn child's sex on maternal labor supply, mothers with a firstborn daughter were consistently found to exhibit a greater labor supply.

Design/methodology/approach The data were collected using an online questionnaire made available to technology-based companies resident in Brazilian Technological Parks. A total of 73 companies responded. The data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate statistical techniques and were processed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software. The statistical tests included factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha and multiple regression. Findings The paper shows that the strategic alliance portfolio is influenced by organizational learning, diversity of partners, governance structure, intensity of partnership relations and configuration. In particular, the portfolio of alliances with competence orientation is characterized by tacit knowledge exchanges and learning exploration, homogeneity of partners, informal governance mechanisms, strong bonds of trust and reciprocity with partners and low diversification of actors' profiles, their attributions and the results obtained in the portfolio. Meanwhile, the characteristics of alliance portfolios with legitimacy orientation include explicit knowledge exchange and learning exploitation, heterogeneity of partners, formal governance mechanisms, weak bonds of trust and reciprocity with partners and high diversification of the profile of the actors, their attributions and the results obtained from the portfolio. Practical implications The configuration of the alliance portfolio plays an important role in innovation. To stimulate the creation of new technological skills, the executive of a technology-based company from emerging countries such as China, Russia and India, can configure the portfolio of strategic alliances with more homogeneous partners in terms of profile and attribution. However, if this executive is challenged to seek legitimacy and complementary resources in these markets he can invest in the diversification of the strategic alliance portfolio, prioritizing partners with differentiated profiles and attributions. Originality/value The originality of the research lies in the adoption of a complementary and multidimensional theoretical prism, considering the relational capacity of TBFs in the configuration of alliances, both in the intra-firm and portfolio perspective. Furthermore, it was considered that the configuration of alliances can be based on both competence and legitimacy factors.","[da Costa, Priscila Rezende] Univ Nove Julho, Dept Adm, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Braga Junior, Sergio Silva] Univ Estadual Paulista Julio de Mezquita Filho, Fac Ciencias & Engn, Dept Adm, Campus Tupa, Tupa, Brazil; [Porto, Geciane Silveira] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Adm, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; [Pagan Martinez, Marta] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Dept Adm, Campo Grande, Brazil; [Pagan Martinez, Marta] Univ Murcia, Dept Informat Technol, Murcia, Spain",Universidade Nove de Julho; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; University of Murcia,"da Costa, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Nove Julho, Dept Adm, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",priscilarezende@yahoo.com.br; sergio@tupa.unesp.br; geciane@usp.br; pagan.marta@gmail.com,"Martínez, Marta Pagán/N-8375-2015; Porto, Geciane/T-6369-2019; rezende da costa, priscila/H-4010-2018; , Sergio Silva Braga Junior/A-6706-2013","Martínez, Marta Pagán/0000-0001-7363-2939; Porto, Geciane/0000-0001-6104-3627; rezende da costa, priscila/0000-0002-7012-0679; , Sergio Silva Braga Junior/0000-0002-4979-1988",,,,,134,7,8,2,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

J,"Combe, J",,,,"Combe, Julien",,,Are Affirmative Action Policies so Impossible?,REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE,,,English,Article,,,,,,matching; school choice; affirmative action; deferred acceptance,,"Affirmative action policies are a widely used tool for policy makers. One of their objectives is to improve the welfare of a targeted group of students during a school admission procedure. However, it is well-know in the matching literature that these policies can lead to perverse effects: the targeted students can be hurt by the policy intended to help them. In this paper, we take an interim-welfare perspective and show that, in the particular framework of aligned preferences and indifferent schools, the well-known Deferred Acceptance algorithm never hurts the minority students' welfare once an affirmative action policy is implemented. We also highlight the welfare effects of the ordering defining how the seats of a school are allocated throughout the matching procedure, known as a precedence order. Our main proof elicits two effects of a reinforcement of an affirmative action policy. A direct effect where the policy increases the probability to be assigned to the schools where the policy was reinforced. And an indirect one: in decreasing the competition from other minority students, the policy increases the expected utility of a student, even if this latter has been rejected by the schools where the policy was reinforced. We provide counter examples to show that the environment that we consider is a tight domain for the positive effects on minority students. Last, we perform simulations to study the interim-welfare effects of affirmative actions when we depart from the framework of i) aligned preferences preferences ii) indifferent schools. With indifferent schools, they support that the more correlated are the preferences, the better the affirmative action policy performs. They also show that the rules used to break the indifference of the schools perform differently: a Multiple Tie Breaking rule tends to hurt less the minority students then the Single Tie Breaking rule.","[Combe, Julien] UCL, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Combe, J (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",j.combe@ucl.ac.uk,,,ERC [682417]; European Research Council (ERC) [682417] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This work was part of my Master thesis done at the Paris School of Economics under the supervision of Olivier Tercieux and the review of Laurent Lamy.

Specifically, cultural diversity pushes the technology frontier of the economy outwards, which improves export sophistication level. Our theoretical results suggest that cultural diversity also increases the growth rate of export sophistication by improving the economy's ability to operate closer to its technology frontier. We use panel data that covers 85 countries over the 1995-2014 period to empirically evaluate our theoretical predictions. Pooled and random effects regression results show that cultural diversity and the degree of export sophistication are positively related and this association is statistically significant. However, fixed effects estimation results show that the impact of cultural diversity on growth rate of export sophistication is statistically insignificant. Finally, we find that the impact of cultural diversity on export sophistication does not vary significantly on an annual basis.

In contrast to the earlier literature, which focused on inefficient health behavior of the less educated, we investigate the extent to which the education gradient can be explained by fully rational and efficient behavior of all social strata. Specifically, we consider a life-cycle model in which the loss of body functionality, which eventually leads to death, can be accelerated by unhealthy behavior and delayed through health expenditure. Individuals are heterogeneous with respect to their return to education. The proposed theory rationalizes why individuals equipped with a higher return to education chose more education as well as a healthier lifestyle. When calibrated for the average male US citizen, the model motivates about 50% percent of the observable education gradient by idiosyncratic returns to education, with causality running from education to longevity. The theory also explains why compulsory schooling has comparatively small effects on longevity and why the gradient gets larger over time through improvements in medical technology.","[Strulik, Holger] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Strulik, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",holger.strulik@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,"Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,82,16,16,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-828X,2212-8298,,J ECON AGEING,J.

It perceives the challenges of multi-level governance in postcolonial sub-Saharan African countries, such as weak local government capacity for urban planning, as effects of ill-conceived constitutional rules. The paper draws ideas from constitutional political economy (CPE) to problematize the constitutional rules underlying Ghana's current state of decentralization. I argue that these constitutional rules, embodied in Ghana's 1992 Constitution and Local Government Act (462), evince both continued dominance of state control over local governance and a systemic transfer of the logics and instruments of the authoritarian Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) military regime to the choice of constitutional rules for Ghana's decentralization. In other words, Ghana's decentralization patterns and processes must be examined in the context of the constitutional regime from which they were born. One such pattern is the creation of new local governments (a gerrymandering strategy) by successive governments without commensurate improvement in local democratic and pro-poor developmental outcomes. The paper's discussions, largely conceptual but interlaced with empirical moments, serve to stimulate debate about the relationships between the constitutional rules for decentralization and their socioeconomic and political effects. I conclude by reflecting on the conceptual and methodological challenges of using CPE to analyze constitutional rules for decentralization and offer ideas to address these challenges in future research.

Theorists have long argued that media freedoms are necessary for democratic development, but effects on individual-level orientations and behaviors have not been fully explored. Specifically, there has been limited work on the effects of radio exposure on political participation in Africa, and individuals' self-selection of the media they consume complicates the measurement of causal effects. However, the fact that access to FM radio signals is largely exogenously determined provides a possible identification strategy. Here, data on station technicalities and local topography are used to predict FM propagation in Uganda soon after the implementation of media liberalization. Analyses of results from an Afrobarometer survey demonstrate that radio exposure is significantly associated with higher self-reported political participation. With regard to mechanisms, there is no evidence that exposure is associated with significantly greater efficacy, interest in politics, attitudinal extremism, or perceptions about distributional politics or violence, but those who listened to the radio with greater frequency were more knowledgeable about politics.

We correct for the endogeneity of R&D using tax-induced changes to R&D costs. While rising imports from China lead to slower sales growth and lower profitability, these effects are significantly smaller for firms with a larger stock of R&D (about half when moving from the bottom quartile to the top quartile of R&D). We provide evidence that this effect is explained by R&D allowing firms to increase product differentiation. As a result, while firms in import-competing industries cut capital expenditures and employment, R&D-intensive firms downsize considerably less.","[Hombert, Johan] HEC Paris, Jouy En Josas, France; [Hombert, Johan] CEPR, London, England; [Matray, Adrien] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Princeton University,"Hombert, J (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, Jouy En Josas, France.;Hombert, J (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",,,,Investissements d'Avenir Labex [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047]; Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance,Investissements d'Avenir Labex(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance,"We thank Nick Bloom; Gerard Hoberg; Rich Mathews; Stephen Redding; Amit Seru; Stefan Zeume; Michael Roberts; and two anonymous referees as well as seminar participants at INSEAD, Copenhagen Business School, Stanford University, CSEF-University of Naples, Imperial College, Montreal University, Erasmus University, Ghent University, the Harvard Business School; and conference participants at the Labex Ecodec Workshop at HEC Paris, the London Business School 2015 Summer Finance Symposium, the 2015 Western Finance Association meeting, the 2015 Workshop on Entrepreneurial Finance and Innovation Around the World, the 2015 Workshop on the Economics of Corporate Ownership, the European Summer Symposium in Financial Markets (Gerzensee) 2015, the 2015 Econometric Society World Meeting, and the 2016 NBER Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship.

Although many empirical studies have substantiated the impact of HSR on urban economic outcomes, the role of HSR in urban spatial expansion is seldom empirically measured. Previous studies have shown that the improvement of transportation infrastructure and technology can promote the expansion of cities, mostly on the construction land area announced by the government. This study, which is based on high-precision calibrated nighttime light satellite images, accurately measured the impact of HSR on urban expansion. We estimated a difference-in-differences model after eliminating selection bias by propensity score matching. HSR has a positive effect on urban expansion with an elasticity of 0.12-0.13. In addition, HSR is almost twice as successful at promoting urban expansion in the underdeveloped central and western cities as in the developed eastern cities in China. Governments should consider the varying responses of cities at different levels of development when using HSR to promote urban development. For future HSR line planning in China, the governments should appropriately focus on the central and western regions in order to achieve the most efficient use of resources and balanced regional development.","[Long, Fenjie; Zheng, Longfei; Song, Zhida] Tsinghua Univ, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Long, Fenjie; Zheng, Longfei; Song, Zhida] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Long, Fenjie] Guizhou Inst Technol, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Guizhou Institute of Technology,"Zheng, LF (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Room 3-405,West Main Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhenglf17@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,,"ZHENG, Longfei/0000-0002-1381-7568; LONG, Fenjie/0000-0002-5098-0380",National Social Science Foundation of China [14AJY012],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This work was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (14AJY012) for funding.,,42,69,74,12,114,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

In a developing country context, few studies have attempted to analyse the influence of various factors that contribute to a low ridership of bicycle. Using data collected through a questionnaire survey in the Indian city of Bangalore, the present study investigates the extent to which variables capturing the attitudinal and social norms, in childhood, affect an individual's decision to continue or discontinue bicycle on transition to adulthood. Further, the study elicits the influence of various adulthood perceptions that limit the usage of bicycles and that can motivate the future usage of bicycles. The study also examines the substitutive effect between bicycles, and the sustainable modes of walking and public transit. The results suggest that a negative social image attached with cycling in childhood contribute to an individual's decision to continue or discontinue cycling after childhood. Further, the results show that part-time cyclists are more sensitive to structural barriers (infrastructure, build environment) while non-cyclists weigh more heavily on personal barriers (attitudes and social norms). Portrayal of cycling in positive light through promotional programs also has a strong positive impact on the choice to bicycle. The study findings shed light on policies and strategies that can help improve the attractiveness of bicycling and augment bicycle use in Indian cities.","[Verma, Meghna] Ramaiah Inst Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Rahul, T.

Motivation is taken from the aftermath of the dramatic trade collapse in 2008-2009, which, despite a substantial recovery, has left a persistently slower growth rate in trade. We find conditions under which a transitory financial shock significantly reduces the investment by firms in entering the export market, and that this can have long-lasting effects on the range of goods exported and hence overall trade. Important to our mechanism are endogenous capital structure decisions by firms in response to the financial shock, and firm entry investment that requires traded goods. This mechanism provides an example of how firm dynamics can serve as a potent propagation mechanism, generating very long-lasting effects of transitory macroeconomic shocks.","[Bergin, Paul] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bergin, Paul] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Feng, Ling] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Feng, Ling] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai Key Lab Financial Informat Technol, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Lin, Ching-Yi] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, 101,Sec 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; National Tsing Hua University,"Bergin, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Bergin, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",prbergin@ucdavis.edu; feng.ling@mail.shufe.edu.cn; lincy@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,31,2,3,1,9,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Bank leverage of 85% or higher emerges because bank seniority both dramatically reduces bank asset volatility and incentivizes risk-taking by producing a skewed return distribution. Nonfinancial firms choose low leverage to protect their banks, presenting a partial resolution to the low-leverage puzzle. Our setup naturally extends to include government actions as we model bank assets using a modified Basel framework. Deposit insurance and bailout expectations lead banks and borrowers to take on more risk. Capital regulation lowers bank leverage but can increase bank risk due to a compensating increase in borrower leverage. Despite this, doubling current capital requirements reduces bank default risk by up to 90%, with only a small increase in loan interest rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper attempts to answer that question by examining how government systems influence macroeconomic performance. We find that presidential regimes consistently are associated with less favorable outcomes than parliamentary regimes: slower output growth, higher and more volatile inflation and greater income inequality. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect is sizable. For example, annual output growth is between 0.6 and 1.2 percentage points lower and inflation is estimated to be at least four percentage points higher under presidential regimes relative to those under parliamentary ones. The difference in distributional outcomes is even starker; income inequality is 12 to 24% worse under presidential systems.","[McManus, Richard] Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Christ Church Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Ozkan, F.

We attempt to overcome this challenge by utilizing the potential outcomes framework and quantile treatment effects analytical approaches applied on panel household data collected from Central Africa. Our findings show that adoption of AR4D technologies reduced the probability of being poor by 13 percentage points. A large share of this poverty reduction is causally attributable to adoption of improved crop varieties (32%) followed by adoption of post-harvest technologies (28%) and crop and natural resource management (26%), with the rest 14% attributable to unidentified and/or unmeasured intermediate outcomes or factors. The findings further indicate that relatively poor farm households benefit from adopting improved crop varieties more than the relatively better-off households. Correspondingly, the relatively better off households benefit from adopting post-harvest technologies enhancing crop commercialization much more than the relatively poor households. The findings reveal interesting policy implications for successful targeting of agricultural interventions aimed at reducing rural poverty. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The stated objective of this policy is to reduce emissions and promote sustainable development in the global South. In spite of the widespread use of this policy tool, very little is known about its effect on emissions. In this paper we perform an empirical audit of the effectiveness of energy-related aid in tackling CO2 and SO2 emissions. Using a global panel dataset covering 128 countries over the period 1971-2011 and estimating a parsimonious model using the Anderson and Hsiao estimator, we do not find any evidence of a systematic effect of energy-related aid on emissions. We also find that the non-effect is not conditional on institutional quality or level of income. Countries located in Europe and Central Asia do better than others in utilizing this aid to reduce CO2 emissions. Our results are robust after controlling for the environmental Kuznets curve, country fixed effects, country-specific trends, and time-varying common shocks.","[Bhattacharyya, Sambit; Intartaglia, Maurizio; Mckay, Andy] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Bhattacharyya, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",S.bhattacharyya@sussex.ac.uk,"Bhattacharyya, Sambit/F-6814-2011","Bhattacharyya, Sambit/0000-0001-5932-6943; McKay, Andy/0000-0002-5815-1739",Directorate-General for Research and Innovation [308601],Directorate-General for Research and Innovation,"Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Grant/Award Number: 308601",,34,13,14,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We design an experiment to distinguish and test the relationship between two easily-confounded biases, optimism and overconfidence, both of which can contribute to wishful thinking. We find that optimism and overconfidence are positively correlated at the individual level and that both help to explain wishful thinking. These findings suggest that ignoring optimism results in an upwardly biased estimate of the role of overconfidence in explaining wishful thinking. To illustrate this point, we show that 30% of our observations are misclassified as under- or overconfident if optimism is omitted from the analysis. Our findings have potential implications for the design of information interventions since how agents incorporate information depends on whether the bias is ego-related.","[Heger, Stephanie A.] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Papageorge, Nicholas W.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Papageorge, Nicholas W.] Wyman Pk Bldg 544E,3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",University of Sydney; Johns Hopkins University,"Heger, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Merewether Bldg H04 Room 370, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",stephanie.heger@sydney.edu.au; papageorge@jhu.edu,,,"Center for Research and Strategy (CBES) at Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis; National Science Foundation [SES-0851315]","Center for Research and Strategy (CBES) at Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Current version: February 13, 2018.

We use a neoclassical growth framework to analyze how business cycle fluctuations interact with a long-run transition towards a skill-intensive technology. In the model, the adoption of new technologies by firms and the acquisition of new skills by workers are concentrated in downturns due to low opportunity costs. As a result, shocks lead to deeper recessions, but they also speed up adoption of the new technology. Our calibrated model matches both the long-run downward trend in routine employment and key features of the Great Recession. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A popular view is that these fluctuations were caused by speculative bubbles due to the increased financialization of oil futures markets. This hypothesis, however, is difficult to examine since the fundamental price of oil is unobservable and, therefore, econometric evidence in favor of bubbles may actually be due to misspecified market fundamentals. In this paper, we extend two recently proposed methodologies for bubble detection that alleviate this problem by using market expectations of future prices.

However, these practices can fail to yield desired results if customers feel uncomfortable about receiving things that need to be reciprocated. People differ in the degree to which they feel anxious in a situation that requires them to reciprocate or when they anticipate such a situation. This research introduces the construct of reciprocity anxiety to capture this individual difference and distinguish it from other variables. We develop an 11-item scale to measure two components of reciprocity anxiety and find that reciprocity anxiety can predict (1) consumers' avoidance behavior toward businesses that may obligate them to reciprocate; (2) consumers' eagerness to repay a benefit provided by businesses; as well as (3) consumers' intentions to make future visits to businesses that employ reciprocity relationship-building tactics.","[Zhou, Xinyue] Zhejicmg Univ, Sch Management, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Xiling; Guo, Siyuan; Gu, Li] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Dept Psychol, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Rong] St Anselm Coll, Econ & Business Dept, 100 St Anselm Dr, Manchester, NH 03102 USA",Sun Yat Sen University,"Zhou, XY (通讯作者)，Zhejicmg Univ, Sch Management, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",xxiling@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; siyuanguo@126.com; guli7@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; rhuang@anselm.edu; xinyuezhou@zju.edu.cn,"zhou, xinyue/JOJ-6874-2023; xiong, xiling/ABA-5513-2021; xiong, xiling/HJI-5801-2023","xiong, xiling/0000-0003-1541-1569","General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71672169, 71472115]",General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported in part by grants from the General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71672169 and 71472115).,,79,16,17,3,54,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-4870,1872-7719,,J ECON PSYCHOL,J.

Empirical results reveal that, prior to deregulation, QFII ownership was negatively associated with the probability of financial report restatement, but this association disappeared in the post-deregulation period. Thus, the deregulation likely attracted a wide range of institution types (e.g., short-term oriented trading institutions) to engage in Taiwan's stock market, and this change in the composition of foreign institutions generally weakened the monitoring role of QFIIs to prevent financial misreporting. Further analysis documents that this result is more pronounced for firms with higher degrees of QFII ownership and lower shareholding volatility. The results are robust to various model specifications.","[Chen, Ching-Lung; Weng, Pei-Yu; Chien, Chu-Yang] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Accounting, 123 Univ Rd,Sect 3, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology,"Chen, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Accounting, 123 Univ Rd,Sect 3, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan.",cichen@yuntech.edu.tw; g9920805@yuntech.edu.tw; jianjy@yuntech.edu.tw,"weng, pei-yu/IXN-9650-2023",,"Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan, R.O.C.

A dataset containing 161,426 GPS trajectories describing observed routes of cyclists using SoBi bikes over a 12-month period (April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016) is used for analysis. This study groups trips by origin-destination hub pairs and uses a GIS (geographic information system)-based map-matching algorithm to generate routes along with attributes such as length, number of intersections, number of turns, and unique road segments. Unique routes and their use frequencies are extracted from all the hub-to-hub trips using a GIS-based link signature extraction tool developed for this research. The most popular routes between hubs taken by cyclists are then identified as dominant routes and their attributes are compared to those of corresponding shortest path routes derived by minimizing distance traveled. The comparison finds significant differences in multiple attributes, and demonstrates that dominant routes are significantly longer than their shortest distance counterparts, suggesting that cyclists are willing to detour for routes characterized by positive features such as bicycle facilities and low traffic volumes. Detouring does, however, come at a cost increases in number of turns and number of intersections. This research not only enhances our understanding of cyclist route preferences within a bike share system, it also presents a GIS-based approach for identifying potential locations for future bike facilities based on such preferences.","[Lu, Wei; Scott, Darren M.; Dalumpines, Ron] McMaster Univ, TransLAB Transportat Res Lab, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada",McMaster University,"Scott, DM (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, TransLAB Transportat Res Lab, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",luw13@mcmaster.ca; scottdm@mcmaster.ca; dalumprf@mcmaster.ca,,"Scott, Darren/0000-0002-1545-3737; Dalumpines, Ron/0000-0002-4466-7646",Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada [RGPIN-2016-06153],Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (RGPIN-2016-06153).,,40,58,62,6,55,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

In addition, there is evidence that large, systemically important banks were more likely to obtain FDIC debt guarantees.","[Wilson, Linus] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, BI Moody III Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, 214 Hebrard Blvd,Moody Hall 253,POB 44570, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA; [Wu, Yan Wendy] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",University of Louisiana Lafayette; Wilfrid Laurier University,"Wilson, L (通讯作者)，Univ Louisiana Lafayette, BI Moody III Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, 214 Hebrard Blvd,Moody Hall 253,POB 44570, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",linuswilson@louisiana.edu; wwu@wlu.ca,,"Wu, Yan Wendy/0000-0002-1896-5383",B.I.

Evidence from the Metro Bus System (MBS) in Lahore,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bus rapid transit; Mobility; Gender,IMPACTS; IMPLEMENTATION; ACCESSIBILITY; TRANSMILENIO; PERFORMANCE; COEFFICIENT; TRANSPORT; CITIES; EQUITY,"Bus rapid transit (BRT) is a popular mode for government investment in public infrastructure, particularly in developing countries where capital resources are scarce. Enthusiastic evaluations of BRT systems worldwide are perhaps premature given that most such systems have been operational for only a short time. Further, little research on BRT systems from the user perspective is evident in the literature. The latter is problematic because one justification for government investment in BRT is the social benefit such systems bestow on groups who are traditionally without access to private modes of transportation. In order to explore the purported social benefits of a BRT system two series of multiple logistic regression models are fit. The first uses disaggregate data from inside a BRT service area and the second uses disaggregate data from inside and from outside a BRT service area. The rider and the commuter data sources, respectively, help to understand who benefits from the new Metro Bus System (MBS) in Lahore and how. To that end, descriptive results show that women are less representative of riders and of commuters, but inferential results show that females are more likely to commute via the MBS. In addition, usage patterns show that females are more habitual users and that they benefit greatly from the fare subsidy. Finally, efforts to further integrate the MBS with the greater public transportation network in Lahore will help to mitigate the monetary and the temporal costs of MBS usage which more so affect females.","[Zolnik, Edmund J.] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3351 Fairfax Dr,MS 3B1, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Malik, Ammar; Irvin-Erickson, Yasemin] Urban Inst, Ctr Int Dev & Governance, Washington, DC 20037 USA",George Mason University; Urban Institute,"Zolnik, EJ (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3351 Fairfax Dr,MS 3B1, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",ezolnik@gmu.edu; amalik@urban.org; Yirvin-erickson@urban.org,,,Growth and Economic Opportunities for Women (GrOW) initiative [108112-001]; International Growth Center; JICA,Growth and Economic Opportunities for Women (GrOW) initiative; International Growth Center; JICA,"This work was carried out with financial support under the Growth and Economic Opportunities for Women (GrOW) (108112-001) initiative.

The developed framework is embedded in a micro founded network model, which features interbank funding as an over-the-counter phenomenon and replicates financial system phenomena of network formation, monetary policy transmission, and endogenous money creation. This setup is used to shed light on the interbank market's role for allocation and stability in the financial system. I show that the amount of interbank funding depends on the persistence and magnitude of liquidity shocks, as well as banks' liquidity requirement. Optimal monetary policy experiments show that while interbank funding allows for considerably higher loan provision to the real economy, its term segment, by increasing the size of the interbank market, reduces that effect. Furthermore, the central bank's interest rate policy can effectively mitigate systemic risk and allow for higher sustainable loan supply of the real economy in regimes with lenient capital requirements. However, it is less effective in stimulating loan provision in more restrictive regulatory regimes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We employ four different indicators of sovereign risk (including market- and opinion-based assessments), a rich set of theoretically and empirically motivated banking sector characteristics, and a Bayesian inference in panel estimation as a methodology. We show that a higher proportion of non-performing loans is the single most influential sector-specific variable that is associated with increased sovereign risk. The sector's depth provides mixed results. The stability (capital adequacy ratio) and size (TBA) of the industry are linked to lower sovereign risk in general. Foreign bank penetration and competition (a more diversified structure of the industry) are linked to lower sovereign risk. Our results also support the wake-up call hypothesis in that markets re-appraised a number of banking sector-related issues in the pricing of sovereign risk after the onset of the sovereign crisis in Europe.

Empirical results suggest evidence in favor of regime-switching properties in all returns series. These findings provide strong evidence in favor of nonlinear relation between the conventional and Islamic stock markets and thus, it is necessary to employ the MS-VAR models to determine the dynamic relationship between series. The regime-dependent Granger causality test and impulse-responses analysis results suggest that Islamic stock market is affected from conventional stock markets in both the bear and bull markets regimes.

Our findings suggest that the BC carbon tax had a short-term negative effect on gasoline consumption per capita and led to an amplified behavioural response, but only initially. This amplified response might have been the consequence of a constant carbon tax after July 2012. In comparison, we find weak evidence that the QC carbon tax had a negative effect on gasoline consumption per capita and created an amplified behavioural response. Moreover, these impacts appeared only years after the introduction of the QC carbon tax. This delay might be explained by the increase in carbon cost incurred by QC fossil fuel distributors after their participation in the Western Climate Initiative Regional Carbon Market, which started in January 2015.

For concreteness, we also assess whether the sustained financing supply of Islamic banks is justified by a concomitant increase in Islamic deposit growth and is not linked to excessive risk taking. Utilizing a panel sample of 25 Islamic banks and 114 conventional banks from 10 dual-banking countries, we observe sustained financing supply by Islamic banks but significant reduction in the lending growth by conventional banks during the crisis period. The results further suggest that the financing growth of Islamic banks is higher than the lending growth of conventional banks during the crisis period. However, we find no clear evidence that the deposit growth of Islamic banks behaves differently during the period. Finally, there is no indication to suggest that Islamic banks exhibit excessive risk taking in times of stress.

This study departs from the OLG model to focus on marital bargaining arising from heterogeneity in a nonunitary model. Specifically, this paper examines how pension policies affect the fertility of a bargaining couple with different life spans. The analysis reveals a new channel from pension policies to fertility decisions, whereby an increase in pension size affects fertility not only via the changes in current and future income but also through a change in marital bargaining power. This result suggests that an increase in a pay-as-you-go pension may induce a negative effect on fertility through women's empowerment.","[Komura, Mizuki] Musashi Univ, Nerima Ku, 1-26-1 Toyotamakami, Tokyo 1768534, Japan; [Ogawa, Hikaru] Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Komura, M (通讯作者)，Musashi Univ, Nerima Ku, 1-26-1 Toyotamakami, Tokyo 1768534, Japan.",m.komura@cc.musashi.ac.jp; ogawa@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Komura, Mizuki/AAY-4040-2020",", Mizuki/0000-0001-7694-8488","Kampo Zaidan Foundation; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Establishing a Consortium for the Development of Human Resources); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K17074, 17H00988]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K17074, 17H00988] Funding Source: KAKEN","Kampo Zaidan Foundation; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Establishing a Consortium for the Development of Human Resources); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The Kampo Zaidan Foundation; The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Establishing a Consortium for the Development of Human Resources); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant nos. 15K17074 and 17H00988).",,63,1,1,2,16,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2018,74.0,2,,,,,235,259,,10.1628/fa-2018-0003,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN5CG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439061300003,0

The estimation of the effect of the EMU on the ratio of government outlays to GDP is based on synthetic counterfactuals. It is found that the average size of the public sector in the EMU countries is higher than what it would have been without the monetary unification. The estimated effects are particularly strong in countries that have had the most unstable governments and the highest level of political competition in the eurozone. These findings support the hypothesis that political distortions of short-sighted governments that produce excessive deficits already under monetary autonomy may be worsened by accession to the monetary union.,"[Makela, Erik] Univ Turku, Rehtorinpellonkatu 3, SF-20500 Turku, Finland",University of Turku,"Mäkela, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Rehtorinpellonkatu 3, SF-20500 Turku, Finland.",erik.makela@utu.fi,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,6,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2018,74.0,2,,,,,200,234,,10.1628/fa-2018-0004,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN5CG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439061300002,0

I relax the common assumption that all forms of globalization are equivalent in their effects on civil conflict. I also incorporate the cross-sectoral heterogeneity of investments in existing arguments about the socioeconomic externalities of foreign direct investments as determinants of conflict. With long time horizons and managerial control of their foreign affiliates, foreign direct investors are strategic players aiming to maximize profits and uniquely able to alter their environment through socio-political channels. This distinguishes FDI from trade and foreign portfolio investments. Through a combination of political agency and socio-economic influences on grievance and greed among domestic groups, some types of FDI are likely to alleviate the risk of civil conflict (service sector FDI), while others exacerbate it (primary sector FDI). Analyses using a new data set of sector-specific FDI stock, 1980-2013, lend empirical support to the argument. Showing that economic globalization can have simultaneous positive and negative externalities, these findings are informative for the current dialogue on the role of global markets in sustainable development.

Combining geo-spatial data on eight environmental risks and household survey data from 2010-2014 for the case study of Vietnam, this paper shows: (i) at the district level, the incidence of poverty is higher in high risk areas, (ii) at the household level, poorer households face higher environmental risks, (iii) for some risks the relationship with household-level consumption varies between rural and urban areas, and (iv) environmental risks explain consumption differences between households, but less so changes over time. While altogether these analyses cannot establish a causal relationship between environmental risks and poverty, they do indicate that Vietnam's poor are disproportionally exposed. Given growing pressures due to climate change, addressing such risks should be a focus of poverty reduction efforts.","[Narlochand, Ulf; Bangalore, Mook] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Bangalore, Mook] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",The World Bank; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Bangalore, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.",M.Bangalore@lse.ac.uk,,,Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work is part of programmatic work on Climate Change, Poverty and Climate Resilience in Vietnam and was developed under the oversight of Christophe Crepin and Stephane Hallegatte.

While agglomeration economies arising from low transaction costs are a clear advantage of industrial clusters, a drawback is the ease of imitation, which leads to the gap between social and private benefits of innovation. An important observation is that multifaceted innovation, consisting of the quality improvement of products, improved internal management, and the introduction of new marketing systems, takes place in many industrial clusters in Asia, but such innovation seldom occurs in SSA. This article attributes this to greater endowment of entrepreneurial human capital, and increased possibility of learning advanced technologies and management methods from neighboring countries in Asia than in SSA. This article also discusses evidence suggesting that multifaceted innovation can be stimulated by offering management training to entrepreneurs in SSA.","[Otsuka, Keijiro] JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan; [Otsuka, Keijiro] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Sonobe, Tetsushi] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan",Kobe University; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Otsuka, K (通讯作者)，JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Mihama Ku, 3-2-2 Wakaba, Chiba, Chiba 2618545, Japan.",otsuka@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Sonobe, Tetsushi/M-2499-2014","Sonobe, Tetsushi/0000-0002-9961-9764",,,,,16,5,5,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Macro stress tests for the aggregate U.S. commercial banking system are conducted and probabilities of default are estimated.

Linear effects are through a broad-based macroeconomic (Leading Economic Index), and labor market (Coincident Economic Activity Index) indicators. The 90% and 95% quantiles of NPLs for various stress tests under adverse scenarios are estimated in the range of 4.27-4.86%.

This impacts directly the emissions of greenhouse gases from commuting.

This suggests that differences in industry structures across domestic stock markets proxy for international information asymmetries.","[Schumacher, David] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, 1001 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada",McGill University,"Schumacher, D (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, 1001 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada.",david.schumacher@mcgill.ca,,,Institute of Financial Mathematics of Montreal (IFM2); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [435-2015-0615]; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec (FRQSC) [2016-NP-193354],Institute of Financial Mathematics of Montreal (IFM2); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec (FRQSC),"This paper is based on the first chapter of my PhD thesis.

To do so, I applied complementary statistical (cross-sectional and time series) and econometric (dynamic tri-probit) analyses to an original panel dataset, based on addressed issues (i.e., pollution vs. resource, trans-boundary vs. domestic; flow vs. stock) rather than on implemented policies (i.e., EU legislation aiming at optimal pollution production, optimal resource use, and market competition). It would be impossible to perform similar analyses by referring to realized policies rather than tackled issues due to the unbalanced sample characterizing the former with respect to the latter, as well as due to overlapping objectives, interrelated policies, and non-univocal relationships between objectives and policies. In contrast with previous studies of single EU environmental policies, characteristics of the EU environmental policy, or EU environmental objectives, I found that the overall EU environmental policy system is internally coherent, dynamically causal, and ex ante effective. Moreover, the evidence suggests that many issues are correlated: trans-boundary issues became more relevant in 2012, pollution production was more significant than resource use, and flow issues were more important than stock issues from 1995 to 2010. Finally, I show that few objectives overlapped: a safe environment objective (1987-1997) was preferred to a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction objective (2003-2012, but pursued with a 2-year lag), although the latter has recently become preferred to the former. In addition, a GHG reduction objective was preferred to a sustainable development objective (1998-2002).","[Zagonari, Fabio] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Anghera 22, I-47921 Rimini, Italy",University of Bologna,"Zagonari, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Anghera 22, I-47921 Rimini, Italy.",fabio.zagonari@unibo.it,,"ZAGONARI, FABIO/0000-0002-9872-8731",,,,,114,2,2,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Specifically, we consider the potential for knowledge spillover from the auditing of triennial Long-Term Plans (LTP) to the annual report audit for a large sample of New Zealand municipals over the period 2005-2013. We find the LTP audit fees are positively related to municipal annual report audit fees and other fees (audit of for-profit subsidiaries, non-audit services) are not. This suggests that knowledge spillovers are dependent on the nature of the additional services. We also find evidence of higher fees for private sector auditors for both the annual report and the LTP audit. The LTP (forecast) audit fee is associated with municipal size, complexity, and political competition.","[Bradbury, Michael E.] Massey Univ, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Raftery, Adrian] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Scott, Tom] Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand",Massey University; Deakin University; Auckland University of Technology,"Scott, T (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Accounting, 42 Wakefield St, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",thomas.scott@aut.ac.nz,"Bradbury, Michael/N-2751-2013; Raftery, Adrian/P-2042-2015","Bradbury, Michael/0000-0001-8369-878X; Scott, Tom/0000-0002-8694-6344; Raftery, Adrian/0000-0001-6281-1667",AFAANZ research grant,AFAANZ research grant,"We gratefully acknowledge that this research was partly funded by an AFAANZ research grant.

We study the role of unique dyad-specific synergies in the selection of takeover targets in the global mobile telecommunications industry. Firms use their foresight to select specific targets: First, they lower integration costs by selecting geographically close targets. This effect is stronger when buyer and target are in the same country, but only if the market is not so concentrated that it provokes regulatory interventions. Second, they select targets that can be acquired at a modest bid premium because they have asymmetric bargaining power. Finally, they select targets which can generate significant synergies due to technological synergies. Our work expands the existing target selection literature by studying dyad-specific factors within a single industry. This helps us in identifying unique synergies as drivers of acquisition performance.","[Claussen, Joerg; Kretschmer, Tobias] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Kaulbachstr 45-2, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Claussen, Joerg] Copenhagen Business Sch, Kaulbachstr 45-2, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Koehler, Rebecca] CDTM, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Koehler, Rebecca] Telefon Germany, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Kretschmer, Tobias] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Kaulbachstr 45-2, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Kretschmer, T (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Kaulbachstr 45-2, D-80539 Munich, Germany.;Kretschmer, T (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, Kaulbachstr 45-2, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",j.claussen@lmu.de; ermecke@cdtm.de; t.kretschmer@lmu.de,"Claussen, Joerg/H-4206-2016","Claussen, Joerg/0000-0001-8432-8860",DFG project The Impact of Interdependencies and Fit for the Success of Mergers and Acquisitions [KR3479/5-1],DFG project The Impact of Interdependencies and Fit for the Success of Mergers and Acquisitions,"We thank Christoph Dehne, our colleagues at LMU Munich and CDTM and participants of the 2012 Academy of Management for helpful comments and Daniel Oehling for support with the outsourcing data.

Measuring resilience capacity and how it varies over time is extremely significant for policy makers and people living in risk-prone environments. More specifically, there is a gap of empirical evidence about what drives changes in resilience capacity status (i.e. moving from a low resilience profile to a high one, and viceversa). This paper applies econometric techniques for estimating household resilience and adopts transition matrices to estimate how it changes over time. Finally, multinomial logit and bivariate probit models are estimated to identify the main drivers of change. Our study finds that female headed households are less likely to become the most resilient; also this paper demonstrates that education and participation to household enterprises are positively associated with increased resilience capacity. This paper innovates the resilience literature by providing an evidence based analysis of the main drivers of resilience; it brings this evidence in the Uganda's context, focusing the attention of the policy makers on sub-sample of population which are worse off. More generally, our study suggests that resilience enhancing policies can bridge humanitarian and development interventions by demonstrating how long-term perspectives (i.e. those investing in education) can lead to an immediate increase of resilience.

As extractivist rents fall with the commodities bust and smallholders' exclusion becomes more apparent, the MAS' overextension in facilitating capital accumulation is beginning to show signs of a legitimacy crisis. The politics of agrarian change remain as contested as the dynamics within the state-society-capital nexus.","[McKay, Ben M.] Univ Calgary, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"McKay, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",ben.mckay@ucalgary.ca,,"McKay, Ben/0000-0002-5737-5255",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [752-2012-1258],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: 752-2012-1258",,75,13,13,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Using the fifth and fourth waves of the Ghanaian Living Standard Household Survey, we investigate the extent to which the implementation of the National Health Insurance Scheme affects health-related outcomes and making or receiving informal transfers. Our findings suggest that there is a reduction of out-of-pocket expenditures for health services and a significant crowding out of informal transfers. We conclude that the provision of formal health insurance does not only relieve ill individuals from out-of-pocket expenditures, but also their network partners from making informal transfers.

Manufacturing production exhibits increasing returns-to-scale if the production level is sufficiently high. There are multiple long-run equilibrium labour allocations towards which the economy may converge. Under decentralized resource management, a tendency to over-extract the resource relative to the federal optimum makes convergence to a low-income equilibrium more likely.

We apply a local projection method to a new dataset of major country-and country-sector-level reform shocks in various areas of labor market institutions and product market regulation covering 26 advanced economies over the past four decades. Product market reforms are found to raise productivity and output, but gains materialize only slowly. The impact of labor market reforms is primarily on employment, but it varies across types of reforms and depends on overall business cycle conditions-unlike that of product market reforms. Reductions in labor tax wedges and increases in public spending on active labor market policies have larger effects during periods of slack, in part because they usually entail some degree of fiscal stimulus. In contrast, reforms to employment protection arrangements and unemployment benefit systems have positive effects in good times, but can become contractionary in periods of slack. The economy's response to such reforms is significantly improved when they are accompanied by fiscal or monetary stimulus.","[Duval, Romain; Furceri, Davide] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dfurceri@imf.org,,,,,,,64,45,51,2,18,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Egocentric economic evaluations constitute an important determinant of SNP support over the entire period, being this effect stronger among the male electorate. The results are consistent with the electors holding the incumbent Labour Party accountable for their personal financial situation, though financial security augments the nationalist propensity among partisan voters. Furthermore, retrospective economic evaluations form a significant determinant of incumbent Labour Party support in both the 1999-02 and 2003-06 intervening electoral cycles.","[Marios Chrysanthou, Georgios; Dolores Guillo, Maria] Univ Alicante, Ap Correos 99, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Chrysanthou, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Ap Correos 99, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",,"Chrysanthou, Georgios Marios/AAO-8144-2020; Guillo, Maria Dolores/S-7260-2018","Chrysanthou, Georgios Marios/0000-0003-3004-0508; Guillo, Maria Dolores/0000-0002-9587-4426","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional [ECO2013-43119-P, ECO2015-70540-P, ECO2016-77200-P]; University of Alicante [GRE13-04]",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional(European Union (EU)); University of Alicante,"We thank Stanislav Kolenikov, Pedro Albarran, Raquel Carrasco, the editor and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

We study these issues in an agency framework where headquarters maximize total expected firm returns by providing managers incentives based on firm equity and divisional profits. The resulting incentives serve as a rich alignment mechanism for enhancing total firm returns and provide new insights. An interesting model insight is that, although spillover effects arise spontaneously from own-division effort and incentives are costly to provide, managers with larger spillovers should receive higher equity incentives. The return-maximizing incentives also encourage greater cooperation from managers with riskier divisional performance and have useful implications for leveraging spillover and collaborative capabilities in various organizational forms (e.g., conglomerates, M-form, 'up-stream' divisions).","[Pandher, Gurupdesh S.] Univ Windsor, Odette Sch Business, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Vu, Joseph D.] Depaul Univ, Dept Finance, Driehaus Coll Business, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",University of Windsor; DePaul University,"Pandher, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Odette Sch Business, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",gpandher@uwindsor.ca; jvu@depaul.edu,,,Canadian Social Science & Humanities Research Council (SSHRC Grant) [430-2012-0359],Canadian Social Science & Humanities Research Council (SSHRC Grant),"The first author acknowledges support for this research from the Canadian Social Science & Humanities Research Council (SSHRC Grant #: 430-2012-0359).

The intertemporal and consumption-based CAPM, along with an extended version of CAPM framework examines the excess return on Fama and French portfolios sorted on size-BE/ME and momentum across the economies. The frequently used priced factors in anomaly literature include, Fama and French factors, momentum, dividend yield, bond market factors, saving, along with aggregate market and human capital component. Using unique panel data sets of emerging and developed economies, the panel regression, IV-GMM with random effects and PCA, finds the aggregate market and human capital are the strongest predictors of asset returns across the economies. Furthermore, the aggregate market and saving are strong predictors of asset return in emerging economies, whereas aggregate market and human capital emerge the best predictors of asset return in developed economies. Interestingly, human capital subsumes the predictive ability of Fama and French factors and becomes redundant along with momentum, dividend yield, and bond market factors.

Our econometric analysis focuses on differences in the FDI response from BIT-partner and non-partner countries of developing host countries. This approach allows us not only to distinguish competing hypotheses about BIT function, but also to address endogeneity concerns in earlier studies. We find that BITs stimulate bilateral FDI flows from partner countries-but only so long as the developing host country has not had a claim brought against it to arbitration.

Shock transmission is no different on days with big spread changes and small changes. This is the case even though a significant number of the countries in our sample have been extremely affected by their sovereign debt and fiscal situations. The risk spillover among these countries is not affected by the size or sign of the shock, implying that so far contagion has remained subdued. However, the US crisis does generate a change in the intensity of the propagation of shocks in the eurozone between the 2003-2006 pre-crisis period and the Nov. 2008-Nov. 2011 post-Lehman one, but the coefficients actually go down, not up! All the increases in correlation we have witnessed over the last years come from larger shocks and the heteroskedasticity in the data, not from similar shocks propagated with higher intensity across Europe. These surprising, but robust, results emerge because this is the first paper, to our knowledge, in which a Bayesian quantile regression approach allowing for heteroskedasticity is used to measure contagion. This methodology is particularly well-suited to deal with nonlinear and unstable transmission mechanisms especially when asymmetric responses to sign and size are suspected. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the context of globalization and integration of agricultural markets, the necessity of guaranteeing food safety is imperative for the functionality of contemporary agricultural systems. The radical transformation of the national agricultural systems as a result of the influences imposed by the convergence with the requirements and directions of the European agricultural model entails a significant change for the markets of agri-food products, affecting the food trade, its structure and, implicitly, food safety. In this context, the main objective of the present paper is to examine food safety in Romania using an econometric approach to the phenomenon. Nine fundamental variables are considered, for which the causal relationship between food safety and the exogenous variables taken into analysis is tested. The time frame for data availability for all the variables is 1990-2011. The obtained results highlight the transformations of paradigm of the national agricultural model from the perspective of the dimensions regarding food safety, confirming results from previous studies.","[Dragoi, Mihaela Cristina; Dobrota, Carmen Elena; Ladaru, Raluca Georgiana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Andrei, Jean Vasile; Panait, Mirela] Petr Gas Univ Ploiesti, Ploiesti, Romania; [Mieila, Mihai] Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Oil & Gas University of Ploiesti; Valahia University of Targoviste,"Dragoi, MC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaelacristina.dragoi@gmail.com,"Jean-Vasile, Andrei/A-5270-2011; Mirela, Panait/K-3300-2019; Drăgoi, Mihaela Cristina/B-6426-2016","Jean-Vasile, Andrei/0000-0002-8332-6537; Mirela, Panait/0000-0002-5158-753X;",,,,,47,23,23,1,17,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2018,20.0,47,,,,,134,150,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ8BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427829800009,0

The empirical evidence suggests that undertaking ODI leads to an increase in the innovation performance of these Chinese firms. The impact of ODI on innovation is contingent on firm characteristics such as in-house R&D, strategic orientation, and international experiences as well as contextual factors associated with investment destinations and industry contexts. We also find that learning through ODI is a complex process. There is a substitution between ODI and in-house R&D in Chinese MNEs.

Based on semi-structured research interviews as a conduit to a literature review, this paper shows how the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment impede the vitality of its climate change adaptation efforts. Enclosure refers to when adaptation projects transfer public assets into private hands or expand the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when adaptation projects limit access to resources or marginalize particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when adaptation projects intrude on bio-diversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when adaptation projects aggravate the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsen concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. In the case of Bangladeshi, climate change policies implemented under the country's National Adaptation Program of Action have enabled elites to capture land through public servants, the military, and even gangs carrying bamboo sticks. Exclusionary forms of adaptation planning exist at both the national and local scales. Climate protection measures have encroached upon village property, char (public) land, forests, farms, and other public commons. Most egregiously, community coping strategies for climate change have entrenched class and ethnic hierarchies ultimately trapping the poor, powerless, and displaced into a predatory patronage system that can aggravate human insecurity and intensify violent conflict. Planners and practitioners of adaptation need to become more cognizant of the potential for projects to harm others, or admit complicity in the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment, if they are ever to be eliminated.

This, in the case of the EU referendum where multiple factors influence the decision simultaneously, failed to predict the eventual outcome. On June 23, 2016, Britain's vote to leave the EU came as a surprise to most observers, with a bigger voter turnout than that of any UK general election in the past decade. In this research, we apply multivariate regression analysis and a Logit Model to real voting data to identify statistically significant factors influencing the EU referendum voting preference simultaneously as well as the odd ratio in favor of Leave. Visualizations of the key findings are also provided with heat maps and graphs. We find that higher education is the predominant factor dividing the nation, with a marginal effect on the referendum decision being stronger than any other factors particularly in England and Wales, where most Leave voters reside. An increase of about 3% in the proportion of British adults accessing to higher education in England and Wales could have reversed the referendum result in the UK. We also find that areas in England and Wales with a lower unemployment rate tend to have a higher turnout to support Leave while areas in Scotland and Northern Ireland with a higher proportion of university-educated British adults have a higher turnout to support Remain. Further we find that areas with high proportions of British male adults show a higher percentage of Leave votes. A higher proportion of elderly British contributes to a higher percentage of Leave votes, but does not lead to Leave outcomes on their own. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We survey the existing evidence, which suggests that inflated house-price expectations across the economy played a central role in driving both the demand for and the supply of mortgage credit before the crisis. The great misnomer of the 2008 crisis is that it was not a subprime crisis but rather a middle-class crisis. Inflated house-price expectations led households across all income groups, especially the middle class, to increase their demand for housing and mortgage leverage. Similarly, banks lent against increasing collateral values and underestimated the risk of defaults.

By contrast, the overvalued acquirers that receive high investor attention and use stock as the payment method in their listed target acquisitions experience negative announcement period abnormal returns. The widely documented evidence that stock-financed acquisitions are associated with significant announcement period wealth losses is primarily driven by deals in which the acquirers are subject to high investor attention.

In this regard, it is important to consider the empirical knowledge of the interface among the variables of factors in the supply chain governance structure choices, the chain actors' choice of governance models, and the effects of these on the supply chain performances. The aim of this study was to empirically verify the relationships between factors existing in the business scenarios, the chain actors' governance structure choice, and supply chain performances of dairy chains in Ethiopia. The chains were assessed using the survey data that were collected from 215 chain actors and analyzed using structural equation modelling and IBM SPSS and IBM AMOS of version 24 software. The data collected were tested for the Cronbach's alpha reliability test for the internal consistency and using the different model goodness of fit measure tests. The results showed that the transaction cost, trust, and uncertainty significantly (P<0.001) predicted the chain actors' supply chain governance model choice. On the other hand, uncertainty, willingness to collaborate, and collaborations advantages explained trust significantly (P<0.001). The correlations analysis among the factors showed that there existed negative significant correlation between transaction cost and willingness to collaborate. The correlation between willingness to collaborate and collaborative advantages was found positive and significant. Similarly, the correlation between uncertainty and transaction specific investments was found positive and significant. Moreover, chain actors' supply chain governance structure choice significantly explained the supply chain performances, such as efficiency, flexibility, level of dairy losses, and level of integrations in the dairy chains. Promoting established dairy chain governance system, either through dependable relational governances or through formal contractual structure has been found improving the performances of the studied dairy chains.","[Amentae, Tadesse Kenea; Gebresenbet, Girma; Ljungberg, David] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Energy & Technol, Div Logist, POB 7032, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Amentae, TK (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Energy & Technol, Div Logist, POB 7032, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",tadesse.kenea.amentae@slu.se,"穆, 儒/HGC-6534-2022; Amentae, Tadesse Kenea/M-9209-2015","Amentae, Tadesse Kenea/0000-0003-0659-0120",RELOAD project,RELOAD project,We are grateful to RELOAD project for funding the activities of this study.,,60,8,8,5,41,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

While firms with positive expected exposure reduce their exposure through currency derivatives, internal transactions with foreign subsidiaries, and foreign currency debt financing, firms with negative expected exposure do so only through exchange rate pass-through activities.

In fact, the so-called corporate value is only the central point of all corporate activities. For example, the corporate management activities including financing, investment and governance are based on the value of the company. Corporate management is nothing more than value-based activity with the goal of maximizing value, which belongs to the strategic content of the company. Although the China's capital market developed relatively late, which also has undergone a once-through reform of equity splitting, it has overcome some of institutional deficiencies that have appeared in the past capital markets. For basic research on corporate value, there has also been new verification in a specific context. This paper takes the ownership structure as a research point, and the company's value is regarded as the research core, combined with the mainline of equity structure-capital structure-company value path, to explore the relationship between the company's shareholding structure and value.","[Bao Siyan] Univ Illinois, LAS, Math & Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Bao, SY (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, LAS, Math & Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-05-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,512,517,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450396400111,0

Controlling for credit score and other risk factors, AfricanAmerican and Hispanic borrowers are 103% and 78% more likely to receive high-cost mortgages for home purchases. Alarge part of the increase is attributable to sorting across lenders (55%-65%), and this, in turn, can be largely accounted for by the lender's ex post foreclosure risk. The remaining within-lender differences are also concentrated in high-risk lenders, revealing the central role of these institutions in explaining market-wide racial and ethnic differences.","[Bayer, Patrick] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Bayer, Patrick; Ferreira, Fernando] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ferreira, Fernando] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ross, Stephen L.] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania; University of Connecticut,"Ross, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 309 Oak Hall,365 Fairfield Way U-1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",stephen.l.ross@uconn.edu,,,Ford Foundation; Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton; Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies at the University of Connecticut,Ford Foundation; Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton; Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies at the University of Connecticut,"This work was supported by the Ford Foundation, the Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton, and the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies at the University of Connecticut.",,44,53,62,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

While the Bank's recent land report provides insights for improving land governance in Africa, it fails to acknowledge the exploitative and contentious politics that often characterize customary land tenure systems, and the local power dynamics that undermine the ability of marginalized groups to secure land rights. Using insights from recent fieldwork, the paper analyses the links between land law reform and conflict in Ghana, and the gendered dynamics of reforming land governance in Tanzania. These crucial cases illustrate how land law reform can provoke conflicts over land and threaten the rights of vulnerable populations (e.g. migrants and women) when customary practices are uncritically endorsed as a means of improving land governance. As such, the paper concludes with a series of recommendations on how to navigate the promise and perils of customary practices in the governance of land.","[Collins, Andrea] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resources & Sustainabil, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Mitchell, Matthew I.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Polit Studies, 9 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A5, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Saskatchewan,"Mitchell, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Polit Studies, 9 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A5, Canada.",m.mitchell@usask.ca,"Mitchell, Matthew/JSK-9297-2023","Collins, Andrea/0000-0001-9211-3093",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors wish to thank Catherine Boone, Barry Driscoll, Jeffrey Paller, Amanda Pinkston, and Aili Tripp for their valuable comments on previous versions of this paper.

Design/methodology/approach - The research question is analyzed using a panel data from 23 MFIs in Ethiopia over a period of 2006-2011. Random effects panel data estimation is applied to analyze the link between board committees and MFI's performance. Findings - In MFIs with larger than average boards, the findings demonstrate significant ties between financial and outreach performance and how their boards are structured. The structure of board committees moderates the relation between board size and financial and outreach performance measures. Importantly, board committee benefits MFIs through better operational self-sufficiency, lower operating expenses, greater outreach to customers, and outreach to poorer customers using average loan size as the proxy. Practical implications - Practitioners within microfinance sector, and those operating in advisory and regulatory roles to the sector could benefit from the argument advanced in the paper in that normative recommendation to restructure boards or establish committees requires reevaluating the board characteristics vis-a-vis the optimal monitoring, controlling, and advising needs of the institution. Originality/value - Prior literature focuses on who sits on boards, how large are the boards, and how independent are they. This paper advances the understanding of the structure of board committees and how this may affect the performance of MFI. This approach provides better representation of director's role and is thereby a good test of board effectiveness.","[Dato, Muluneh Hideto] Univ Libre Bruxelles, CEB, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Brussels, Belgium; [Dato, Muluneh Hideto] Univ Libre Bruxelles, CERMi, Brussels, Belgium; [Dato, Muluneh Hideto] Univ Agder Okon & Samfunnsvitenskap, Sch Business & Law, Kristiansand, Norway; [Mersland, Roy] Univ Agder, Econ & Social Sci, Kristiansand, Norway; [Mori, Neema] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Business Sch, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Mori, Neema] Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Solvay SA; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; University of Agder; University of Dar es Salaam; University of Agder,"Dato, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, CEB, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Brussels, Belgium.;Dato, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, CERMi, Brussels, Belgium.;Dato, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Agder Okon & Samfunnsvitenskap, Sch Business & Law, Kristiansand, Norway.",mulunehh@uia.no,"Mori, Neema/IRZ-0105-2023","Mori, Neema/0000-0002-2119-2000; Mersland, Roy/0000-0002-6683-2737","Marie-Christine Adam Foundation; Universite libre de Bruxelles (ULB); Southern Norway Competence Development Fund; School of Business and Law, University of Agder (UiA)","Marie-Christine Adam Foundation; Universite libre de Bruxelles (ULB); Southern Norway Competence Development Fund; School of Business and Law, University of Agder (UiA)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Marie-Christine Adam Foundation, Universite libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and the Southern Norway Competence Development Fund as well as the School of Business and Law, University of Agder (UiA) for the generous financial support without which the present study could not have been possible.

The results provide the beneficial suggestions for the coordination development of regional economy.","[Dong Jianping] Tianjin Agr Univ, Dept Finance, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China",Tianjin Agricultural University,"Dong, JP (通讯作者)，Tianjin Agr Univ, Dept Finance, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China.",dongjianping68@163.com,,,"Financial Bureau of Tianjin; Accounting Society of Tianjin, China [Y170902]","Financial Bureau of Tianjin; Accounting Society of Tianjin, China","The research was funded by the key accounting research project from 2017 to 2018 of Financial Bureau of Tianjin and the Accounting Society of Tianjin, China (No. Y170902).",,12,0,0,0,2,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-05-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,551,554,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450396400118,0

The study shows that loss-aversion manufacturer does not behave positively in the option purchase, and the option order quantity decreases as the loss-aversion coefficient increases; the option execution proportion increases as the aversion coefficient of manufacturer increases. Through the comparative analysis of expected profit of system supply chain with option order adopted for both loss-aversion manufacturer and risk neutral manufacturer, it is found that the expected profit of system supply chain increases first and decreases later on as the loss-aversion coefficient of manufacturer increases, which is yet always larger than the expected profit of system supply chain for option purchase of risk neutral manufacturer.

The responsibility for many of these pervasive problems has been placed at the door of an economic system that does not account for the negative externalities it generates and has a penchant for uncontrolled consumption and growth. The global population that now stands at about 7.5 billion is projected to grow to approximately 9.7 billion by the year 2050 and the likelihood of our finite planet adequately providing for a population of that size seems remote. It is in this context that important questions about role of business in the context of social, environmental, and inter-generational justice need to be answered. The sustainability movement has gained tremendous momentum in the last few years, with many calling for a paradigm shift in the purpose and functioning of the business sector. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of the sustainability movement in business including the formation of the United Nations Global Compact and its academic counter-part, the United Nations Principles for Responsible Management Education (UNPRME). In particular, while many advocates for sustainability have used the notion of the business case as their primary argument, this paper will argue that a paradigm shift calls for a reexamination of the fundamental principles and values of business focusing on responsibilities not only toward shareholders, but also toward all stakeholders including those who are often invisible and voiceless. The paper focuses on the management challenges that both businesses and business schools that will need to address to not only ensure our survival as a species, but also that all species on the planet will flourish forever.","[Farias, Gerard] Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Silberman Coll Business, Management Dept, Madison, NJ 07940 USA",Fairleigh Dickinson University,"Farias, G (通讯作者)，Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Silberman Coll Business, Management Dept, Madison, NJ 07940 USA.",gfarias@alu.edu,,,,,,,65,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-58589-5; 978-3-319-58588-8,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,169,184,,10.1007/978-3-319-58589-5_13,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL0QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446372200013,0

Theoretical models, such as the one proposed by Wang (J Polit Econ 102(1):127-167, 1994) suggest that this relation reveals the information asymmetry in the market and the role of private information. According to the models, the trade generated by risk-sharing and public information tends to decrease autocorrelation of returns, while the trade generated by private information has the opposite effect. To test this empirically we compared the coefficients obtained from the return-volume relation with other approximations of information asymmetry, based on liquidity. Unlike other works we have used dynamic regression to obtain the coefficients for 52 stocks, assuming that coefficients for individual stock can vary from month to month. Then we used panel regression with random effects to test the relationship between coefficient of information asymmetry and liquidity. We find an evidence supporting the compliance of measure of information asymmetry, especially for medium and small capitalization companies.","[Garsztka, Przemyslaw; Kliber, Pawel] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Kliber, P (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",przemyslaw.garsztka@ue.poznan.pl; p.kliber@ue.poznan.pl,"Garsztka, Przemysław/V-5430-2019; Kliber, Paweł/AAD-2543-2022","Garsztka, Przemysław/0000-0002-9877-5634;",,,,,19,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-76228-9; 978-3-319-76227-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,3,11,,10.1007/978-3-319-76228-9_1,0.0,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1UI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448435600001,0

However, in some streets it may not be possible to install such cycling paths (e.g. due to financial or space constraints). The current paper investigates which physical factors could increase parents' perceptions of environmental supportiveness for children's transportation cycling, across six different types of cycling infrastructure. Parents completed a choice-based conjoint task by indicating which photographed street they preferred to let their child cycle along. The streets were experimentally manipulated on 7 physical factors (e.g. traffic speed, vegetation). Interactions between type of cycle path and the other environmental factors were identified. When no or limited separation from motorized traffic is present, street characteristics increasing parents' safety perceptions (traffic density and speed) should be prioritized when aiming to improve the supportiveness of streets for children's transportation cycling. Comfort and aesthetics can further improve streets' environmental supportiveness when cycling paths are more separated from traffic.","[Ghekiere, Ariane; Deforche, Benedicte; Van Cauwenberg, Jelle] Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Ghekiere, Ariane; Deforche, Benedicte; Clarys, Peter; Van Cauwenberg, Jelle] Vrije Univ Brussel, Fac Phys Educ & Phys Therapy, Dept Movement & Sport Sci, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Ghekiere, Ariane; Van Cauwenberg, Jelle] Fund Sci Res Flanders FWO, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [De Bourdeaudhuij, Ilse; Mertens, Lieze; Cardon, Greet] Univ Ghent, Dept Movement & Sport Sci, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [de Geus, Bas] Vrije Univ Brussel, Fac Phys Educ & Phys Therapy, Human Physiol Res Grp, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Nasar, Jack] Ohio State Univ, City & Reg Planning, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Ghent University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Ghent University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Van Cauwenberg, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Ariane.Ghelciere@UGent.be; Benedicte.Deforche@UGent.be; Ilse.Debourdeaudhuij@UGent.be; pclarys@vub.ac.be; Lieze.Mertens@UGent.be; Greet.Cardon@UGent.be; Bas.de.Geus@vub.ac.be; nasar.1@osu.edu; Jelle.Van.Cauwenberg@UGent.be,"Mertens, Lieze/AAG-3340-2020; Van Cauwenberg, Jelle/H-7962-2014; De+Bourdeaudhuij, Ilse/AAC-5528-2019; Cardon, Greet/AEK-0110-2022; de Geus, Bas/F-5335-2011","De+Bourdeaudhuij, Ilse/0000-0001-9969-7597; Cardon, Greet/0000-0003-4983-6557; Van Cauwenberg, Jelle/0000-0003-1292-6241; de Geus, Bas/0000-0001-7447-0230; Mertens, Lieze/0000-0001-7144-2656",,,,,33,16,16,0,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Following maize market deregulation and subsequent entry of private buyers in the Zimbabwean grain sector, marginalised poor farmers remained confined to the low return private buyer market that offered very low prices, as they avoided GMB whose payment plan was uncertain and delayed. The question therefore was: To what extent did farmers' risk aversion attitude and time preference explain the poor farmers' choice for low return private buyer market at the expense of the high return GMB market ? Using survey data obtained from 433 maize farmers in Makonde and Zvimba districts, an instrumental variable probit regression model was estimated. The results confirmed that risk aversion attitude and time preferences (as measured by farmers' discount rate) reduced the likelihood of a farmer participating in a high return state-owned GMB market. Poor farmers were found to be more risk averse and impatient than non-poor farmers in marketing channel selection. Their high risk aversion attitude and impatience constituted the greatest market impediments that restricted them to the low return private buyer market. To make agricultural markets work for poverty reduction the study recommended that policies that promote the development of risk transfer markets and futures markets for maturity transformation of farmers' payments are critical in guaranteeing effective participation of poor households in high return markets.","[Kamoyo, Michael] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Dept Mkt, POB 7724, Chinhoyi 263, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe; [Makochekanwa, Albert] Univ Zimbabwe, Fac Social Studies, Dept Econ, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Zimbabwe,"Kamoyo, M (通讯作者)，Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Dept Mkt, POB 7724, Chinhoyi 263, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe.",mkamoyoheart@gmail.com,"Kamoyo, Michael/AAU-5260-2021",,,,,,54,3,3,2,13,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2018,57.0,3-4,,,,,233,250,,10.1080/03031853.2018.1523016,0.0,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HD1WR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452303600005,0

Profit loss is the difference of wealth between the state, what the party suffering the damage (unfair competition) achieved, and what it would achieve if the damage did not occur. It is therefore a foregone gain of property which was prevented by the harmful event. Assets (wealth) of the owner of ABC Holding suffering the damage represent the value of its 100% stake in the company, which includes the value of the brand ABC. Therefore, for the purposes of quantifying lost profits in this paper, we first need to quantify the value of the brand ABC affected by the consequences of a damage event and the hypothetical value of the brand ABC under the ordinary course of things. For appraising the fair value of a brand of an unlisted (private) company in this paper, we apply the Verifiable Interdependent Model (VIM), which has been designed specifically for the conditions of the business environment with the lack of empirical data for intangible assets appraisal or their low quality.","[Krabec, Tomas] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Finance & Business Valuat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic; [Cizinska, Romana] SKODA AUTO Univ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29331, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Skoda Auto University,"Krabec, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Finance & Business Valuat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",tomas.krabec@vse.cz; cizinska@is.savs.cz,"Čižinská, Romana/ABG-2544-2020",,"Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of the University of Economics, Prague [7/2016]; University of Economics, Prague [IP 100040]","Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of the University of Economics, Prague; University of Economics, Prague","This paper has been prepared within the research project under the registration number IP 100040 and Internal Grant Agency (IGA) 7/2016 of the University of Economics, Prague.",,16,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68762-9; 978-3-319-68761-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,173,180,,10.1007/978-3-319-68762-9_19,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL3UH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450036900019,0

Over the last few years we observe in Poland significant changes in the age structure of its inhabitants. Rapid progress in the field of medicine that allows earlier and more accurate diagnosis of diseases, and thus more effective treatment, as well as a healthier lifestyle, improves the health of Poles and makes their lives longer. The changes that occur in the structure of the population's age cause that the number of people receiving retirement benefits increases, while the number of people paying contributions decreases. What's more, extending the average life expectancy of a person means a longer period of receiving retirement benefits. From the point of view of the pension system, the phenomenon of lengthening the average duration of human life causes an increase in the number of beneficiaries, and thus the total amount of retirement benefits. Unfavorable demographic trends thus have a direct impact on the pension system leading to the undermining of its stability and adequacy.","[Lesna-Wierszolowicz, Elwira] West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Lesna-Wierszolowicz, E (通讯作者)，West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland.",elesna@zut.edu.pl,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,LODZ UNIV TECHNOLOGY PR,LODZ,"BIBLIOTEKA POLITECHNIKI LODZKIEJ-BUDYNEK B22, UL WOLCZANSKA 223, LODZ, 90-924, POLAND",,,978-83-7283-900-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,205,212,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470276200018,0

The years 2016 and 2017 also witnessed spectacular cyberattacks, for example: medical records breach of 3.3 million people because of an unauthorized access to a server in the US, some WannaCry ransomware attacks on the UK hospitals, some MongoDB Database Leaks in the US or NotPetya ransomware attacks in the US hospitals. Entities performing medical activity are processing personal data concerning health that is classified as a sensitive data and needs a special protection. The article presents the results of the survey - interviews with IT managers (or designated persons) in entities performing medical activity in Lodz Voivodeship in Poland. The aim of the research was analysis and evaluation of information security management in these entities. The interviews had been performed between December, 2017 and January, 2018. As the results of the research, the ways of information security management were identified (in particular such aspects as: characteristics of the information security teams, information security management system auditing, risk management, information security incidents, budgets for information security, training and the General Data Protection Regulation implementation).

It contends that current arguments for taxing the informal economy suffer from a Eurocentric understanding of taxation and state formation, and a fiscally essentialist and undifferentiated notion of the informal economy. Drawing on fieldwork in northern Nigeria, this paper shows that history, gender, wealth and ethno-religious identity influence how taxing the informal economy shapes governance outcomes. Evidence from Nigeria suggests an inverse relationship between informal economy taxation and political voice, posing the risk that increased taxation will exacerbate social divisions rather than rebuild the social contract.","[Meagher, Kate] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Meagher, K (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.meagher@lse.ac.uk,,,"Nigeria Research Network (NRN), University of Oxford; Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs","Nigeria Research Network (NRN), University of Oxford; Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs","I would like to thank the Nigeria Research Network (NRN), University of Oxford, and the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs for organising and funding earlier research carried out through the Islam Research Programme (http://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/research/research-networks/nrn).

The risk-compensating feature of CPSD can alleviate the inefficiencies arising from debt overhang and asset substitution.

Proposed model is an attempt to combine the fuzzy methodology with financial ratios (both in static and dynamic form) and in contrast to the most popular solutions in this area, it covers wider range of enterprise's performance dimensions, in particular financial condition, financial results, cash flows and operating efficiency, as well as development potential. Such a comprehensive approach to enterprise's fundamental strength assessment makes it more resistant to changes of business conditions, and thus should be more objective in comparison with taxonomic models mostly based on several, often limited in terms of information, financial ratios. In addition, it should be noted, that the use of fuzzy logic allows for significant flexibility in both - the model-creating step and during its later use.

However, introducing international accounting standards in Italy (as for any other country) has not been necessarily straightforward. This is because international rules may conflict with local accounting standards which are embedded into the culture, history and economic background of any country. This may create a clash between valid rules and traditional standards.

The unit of observation was 720 employees in local government organizations. The data analysis was conducted by using SEM Amos. The findings of this study show that SPI is inseparable from local government governance systems. The influence of leadership on accountability is significant with the magnitude of influence on the strong level. In contrast, organizational culture has an effect on accountability at a low level. Both variables significantly affect accountability. SPI strengthens leadership and culture towards accountability. SPI is embedded in the OPD governance system and is integrated into OPD organizational structures. Thus, leadership and organizational culture are significant predictors for accountability in OPD which is strengthen by SPI.

The key focus is on the mobility of labor migrants, ensuring freedom of movement of workers and differentiation in the Russian labor market of migrant workers from the EEA. analyzed Employment profiles of representatives of various socio-demographic and ethnic groups, informal and illegal employment. Relying on an extensive information database of the results of research showing the trend of mobility of citizens of Member States of EAEU, identified problematic links in a new integration space. Research has shown that by restraining factors of movement of workers in the EAEU include incomplete development of normative and legal regulation, lack of experience in management of migration processes in the format of a labor market and a migration infrastructure. There is no single database by industry data, specialties, regions and employers needed by the recipient country of labor, not a unified database of the executive authorities of the Member States EAEU (tax, law enforcement, immigration, social, employment).

Certified, elder and educated farmers who have off-farm income and trust in the cooperative leadership have been found to side-sell significantly less. Nonetheless, cooperative group size and late payment favoured more side selling.

The population of this study was 250 companies of the food industries in Iran. The inputs and outputs of the success of the new product development were obtained from the research literature. Moreover, Ansoff matrix was applied to select the market-product strategy. A questionnaire was used to collect the data in this study. The adaptive neural-fuzzy network method and the fuzzy inference system are used to analyze the data. The results show that the Chief Executive Officers of companies working in the food industry may take action to predict a new product development success before developing the new product and use alternative strategies if needed.","[Soltani-Fesaghandis, Gholamreza] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Management, Int Campus,Azadi Sq, Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi, Iran; [Pooya, Alireza] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Management, Fac Adm & Econ Sci, Azadi Sq, Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi, Iran",Ferdowsi University Mashhad; Ferdowsi University Mashhad,"Pooya, A (通讯作者)，Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Management, Fac Adm & Econ Sci, Azadi Sq, Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi, Iran.",alirezapooya@um.ac.ir,"Pooya, Alireza/AEQ-7987-2022; Pooya, Alireza/ABA-1994-2020","Pooya, Alireza/0000-0001-6000-3535",,,,,46,16,16,8,45,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

A comparative analysis of two European approaches,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transit-oriented development; Regional planning; Land use and transport Integration; Spatial planning styles,TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT; URBAN-DEVELOPMENT; TRANSPORT; RAIL; STATIONS; DENSITY; MODEL,"Transit-oriented development (TOD), first coined and mainly applied in the US, has received increasing interest in Europe over the past two decades as a sort of reinterpretation of typical intrinsic European planning principles and values. In the Old continent, it especially focuses on transport and land use integration, extending the approach from the local to the regional framework. This regional shift implies an intergovernmental cooperative approach with vertical and horizontal institutional coordination that constitutes both a strategic value and one of the main barriers to the implementation of TOD. This paper focuses on the role of regional planning for TOD by analysing its benefits, tools and barriers, both theoretically and through two European case studies. The latter, which were conducted in the Netherlands and in Italy, were selected as they belong to two different planning families, in order to underscore how and to what extent they apply this multi-level governance approach and overcome institutional barriers to the implementation of TOD. The analysis reveals that, albeit the two planning styles lead to different results, the main issue remains the deep coordination of land use and transport, which is hard to achieve despite dedicated efforts.","[Staricco, Luca; Vitale Brovarone, Elisabetta] Politecn Torino, Interuni Dept Reg & Urban Studies & Planning, Viale Mattioli 39, I-10125 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Staricco, L (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Interuni Dept Reg & Urban Studies & Planning, Viale Mattioli 39, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",luca.staricco@pollto.it,"Elisabetta, Vitale Brovarone/AAC-7016-2020","Elisabetta, Vitale Brovarone/0000-0002-9030-9188",,,,,51,34,37,5,47,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Improving the quality of life of population is one of the most important tasks facing interstate, state, regional and municipal government. Moreover, for an adequate solution of the existing problems, it is necessary to identify both objective (from the position of the authorities of different levels) and subjective determinants of quality of life recorded by individuals. In the article degree of life satisfaction is used as an indicator of subjective quality of life. To determine the list of variables affecting the degree of life satisfaction, and, consequently, the quality of life, gamma (y) Goodman-Kraskel criterion between the considered features was used. Taking into account the fact that all the variables in databases are ordinal, the analysis of contingency tables was carried out for it. Integral indicators were constructed to reduce the dimension of the study population and to eliminate multicollinearity in the model PCA for selected features was used. This indicators were after re-linearization used as independent variables in ordinal regression. For Russian respondents integral assessments of financial situation, work, health status, as well as a factor variable describing the opportunities to improve their lives are significant. Significant variables for respondents in European countries: factor variable that combines estimates of the quality of life in the country of residence, financial situation of the family, work, difficulties with the payment of debts, as well as integral (factor) variable of the respondent's opinion weight within the country and abroad.

South Asia has the highest rates of open defecation worldwide, and although the incidence declines as household income rises, differences across South Asian countries are not explained by differences in per capita income. The rate of open defecation in sub-national regions of Bangladesh, India and Nepal is highly correlated with the fraction of the population that identifies as Hindu, in part because certain rituals of purity and pollution discourage having latrines in close proximity to one's home. Almost all open defecation occurs in rural areas, and this paper estimates how much the rate could be reduced if rural households in regions that have a higher fraction of Hindus, where open defecation is still common, altered their behaviour to reflect that of non-Hindu households in regions that are predominantly non-Hindu, where the rate of open defecation is much lower. Using nonparametric reweighting methods, this paper projects that rural open defecation in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal could be reduced to rates of between 6 and 8 per cent, compared to the prevailing level of 65 per cent.","[Vyas, Sangita; Spears, Dean] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 2225 Speedway, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Vyas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 2225 Speedway, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",sangita@riceinstitute.org,,,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1125318]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1125318] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"Partial support for the authors' work was provided by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1125318].

Especially pig farming is criticised due to a discrepancy between farmers' and citizens ' perception of animal welfare in modern livestock farming. With regard to the increasing use of the internet, social media, picture and film materials have become essential in communication about livestock production. In this context, it is important to deal with the effects of pictures and videos on citizens' perception and evaluation. In general, the perception of videos is affected by the viewers' characteristics. Apart from that, the perception of videos is affected by picture design and picture elements. The aim of the present study is to analyse people's perceptions and evaluations of film material showing a pig fattening pen. For this purpose, 464 participants were randomly shown four out of sixteen videos in an online experiment. The videos varied according to housing conditions (e.g. weight of the pigs, stocking density) and recording conditions (e.g. camera angle, lighting conditions). A cluster analysis based on belief in animal mind, interest and knowledge about pig farming and meat consumption was conducted. Subsequently, the identified segments, the different housing conditions and the recording conditions of the videos were used as independent variables to perform an analysis of variance with the evaluations of the videos as dependent variable. The results show that the identified clusters significantly differ in the evaluations of the videos. Furthermore, housing conditions have a higher impact than recording conditions. The results indicate that high stocking densities lead to negative evaluations. It can be assumed that respondents do not recognise minor differences in film material. In general the videos were rated poorly. This implies for PR that improving recording conditions of the videos might not lead to a better evaluation of livestock farming than improving housing conditions.

Our study investigates the effect of CSR on information asymmetry between firms and creditors. Using Chinese listed firms as samples, our paper adopts propensity score matching to reconstruct the new samples to randomly assign CSR reportage to firms. We then use a differences-in-differences approach to construct our hypotheses as follows. First, firms that employ CSR strategies possess higher leverage than firms that do not. Second, the presence of CSR reports reduces the speed of capital structure adjustment, and the adjustment speeds of above-target leverage firms tend to be slower than those of below-target leverage firms. Third, CSR reports provide long-term predictions to creditors, enabling firms that issue them to maintain higher long-term leverage compared with firms that do not incorporate CSR into their operations. In summary, on the basis of causal inference, we conclude that CSR can considerably reduce information asymmetry between firms and creditors.","[Yang, Shenggang; He, Feiying; Li, Shihao] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qi] Guotai Junan Secur Co Ltd, Postdoctoral Workstn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qi] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Fudan University,"Zhu, Q (通讯作者)，Guotai Junan Secur Co Ltd, Postdoctoral Workstn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Zhu, Q (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zhuqi@hnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,75,32,33,5,76,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

However, little is known about tomato juice consumers in the United States. The goal of this research was to determine consumer attitudes towards current tomato juice offerings and willingness to pay for high flavor quality products. A sensory panel and a nation-wide survey were conducted to learn about consumer preference toward tomato juice consumption. A new label, including taste review ratings, was incorporated into a choice experiment to verify whether this information successfully assisted consumers in their purchase decisions. Both the sensory analysis and the consumer online survey showed a demand for tomato juice with better flavor. The results suggest that a premium quality tomato juice with fresh aroma notes and better taste made from a premium tomato will encourage consumer purchase intent. Consumers would be willing to pay up to 30% more if trusted taste review score information was provided.","[Zhu, Yaozhou] Mission Foods, 5601 Execut Dr, Irving, TX 75038 USA; [Shen, Meng] Boston Strateg Partners, 4 Wellington St,Suite 43, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [House, Lisa A.] Univ Florida, Food Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Sims, Charles A.; Marshall, Maurice R.; Sarnoski, Paul J.] Univ Florida, Food Sci & Human Nutr Dept, POB 110370, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Sarnoski, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food Sci & Human Nutr Dept, POB 110370, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",psarnoski@ufl.edu,"House, Lisa/V-5724-2017",,University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultrural Sciences,University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultrural Sciences,The authors thank the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultrural Sciences for funding support for this project.,,23,10,12,6,21,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

We compare systemic resilience of three types of banks in six GCC member countries with dual banking systems: fully-fledged Islamic banks (IB), purely conventional banks (CB) and conventional banks with Islamic windows (CBw). We employ market-based systemic risk measures such as MES, SRISK and CoVaR to identify which sector is more vulnerable to a systemic event. We also compute weighted average GES to determine which sector is most synchronised with the market. Moreover, we use graphical network models to determine the most interconnected banking sector that can more easily spread a systemic shock to the whole system. Using a sample of observations on 79 publicly traded banks operating over the 2005-2014 period, we find that CBw is the least resilient sector to a systemic event, it has the highest synchronicity with the market, and it is the most interconnected banking sector during crisis times.

In the context of a two-sector model with intermediates and nominal wage rigidities in one sector, contractionary monetary shocks account for only a third of the fall in GDP. Intermediate linkages play an important role, as the output decline without intermediates is almost a third larger at the trough.

More exposure to risk has two competing effects on an agent's willingness to pay for insurance: a positive effect, as in standard expected utility models; and a negative one, due to a reference effect.

We tested our hypotheses on a sample of 133 firms listed on TSE during the period 2006-2014, using multivariate regression analysis on panel data. Our results revealed that the audit report delay is longer for firms with higher investment opportunities. The research results also show that small companies, lost companies and companies that have major weakness in internal controls, are likely to have a longer delay in the audit report. The delay in the audit report of companies that had an independent auditor change is greater during the current period.

Its central elements consist of new capital requirements, the single rulebook, and rules for bank recovery and resolution. These legislations have been adopted to reduce the call for government bail-out of distressed banks in future crises. The present study performs a detailed quantitative assessment of the reduction in public finance costs brought about by the introduction of these rules. We use a microsimulation portfolio model, which implements the Basel risk assessment framework, to estimate the joint distribution of bank losses at EU level. The approach incorporates the complete safety-net set up in EU legislation to absorb these losses, explicitly modelling enhanced Basel III capital rules, the bail-in tool and the resolution funds. Using a near-full sample of commercial, cooperative and savings banks in the EU, we quantify the cumulative effects of this safety-net and the contribution of each individual tool to the total effect. Considering a crisis of a similar magnitude as the recent one, our results show that potential costs for public finances decrease from roughly 3.7% of EU GDP (before the introduction of any new tool) to 1.4% with bail-in, and finally to 0.5% when all the elements we model are in place. This latter amount is very close to our estimate of leftover resolution funds and the size of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. This exercise extends the quantitative analyses performed by the European Commission in its Economic Review of the Financial Regulation Agenda by developing additional scenarios, crucial robustness checks, simulations for different annual data vintages, and by implementing some methodological improvements.

Their contribution is to offer combinatorics insights into the implications of such asymmetries in the form of three new indicators: Winningness, Vulnerability, and Fragility. They then explore the magnitude and effects of these three measures for the presidential elections of 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. The major contribution of this note is to extend their analyses of these measures to an additional 34 elections: every election in the modern two-party post-Civil War era from 1868 to 2016. We find the Winningness measure to predict very well over the entire set of 38 presidential elections. Inspired by their work, we also offer a new and simpler metric for partisan asymmetries in noncompetitive states and show how it can predict the expected closeness of EC outcomes as well or better than the more complex combinatorics measures they propose.","[Cervas, Jonathan R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Grofman, Bernard] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Jack W Peltson Chair Democracy Studies, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Cervas, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",jcervas@uci.edu,"Cervas, Jonathan/AAF-3563-2021","Cervas, Jonathan/0000-0001-9686-6308; Grofman, Bernard/0000-0002-2801-3351","Jack W.

We argue that while perceived PPE enhances offspring's perceived entrepreneurial desirability and feasibility because of exposure mechanisms, it inhibits the translation of both desirability and feasibility perceptions into entrepreneurial career intentions due to upward social comparison mechanisms. Thus, perceived PPE acts as a double-edged sword for the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship. Our predictions are tested and confirmed on a sample of 21,895 individuals from 33 countries. This study advances the literature on intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship by providing a foundation for understanding the social psychological conditions necessary for such transmission to occur.","[Criaco, Giuseppe] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,Mandeville Bldg,Room 7-47, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Sieger, Philipp] Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Wennberg, Karl] Linkoping Univ, IAS, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Wennberg, Karl] Ratio Inst, SE-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Chirico, Francesco] Jonkoping Univ, Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Ctr Family Enterprise & Ownership CeFEO, POB 1026, SE-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Chirico, Francesco] Tecnol Monterrey EGADE Business Sch, San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico; [Minola, Tommaso] Univ Bergamo, Dept Econ & Technol Management, I-24044 Dalmine, BG, Italy; [Minola, Tommaso] Univ Bergamo, Ctr Young & Family Enterprise CYFE, Bergamo, Italy",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Bern; Linkoping University; Jonkoping University; Tecnologico de Monterrey; University of Bergamo; University of Bergamo,"Criaco, G (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,Mandeville Bldg,Room 7-47, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",criaco@rsm.nl; philipp.sieger@imu.unibe.ch; karl.wennberg@liu.se; francesco.chirico@ju.se; tommaso.minola@unibg.it,"Minola, Tommaso/AAE-3049-2020; Kuo, Aircraft/T-5262-2017","Minola, Tommaso/0000-0003-0337-9741; Kuo, Aircraft/0000-0001-8329-6801; Chirico, Francesco/0000-0002-3742-542X; Criaco, Giuseppe/0000-0001-8738-1915",,,,,89,66,71,4,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This success is attributable to the tremendous leverage the futures provide to market participants. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing a trading strategy which benefits from this leverage by using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and cost-of-carry relationship. We apply the technical trading rules developed from spot market prices, on futures market prices using a CAPM based hedge ratio. Historical daily prices of twenty stocks from each of the ten markets (five developed markets and five emerging markets) are used for the analysis. Popular technical indicators, along with artificial intelligence techniques like Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms, are used to generate buy and sell signals for each stock and for portfolios of stocks. The performance of the trading strategies is then calculated and compared. The results show that, although equal amounts invested in both spot and futures markets, the profit from the strategies applied on futures is considerably higher than that from the spot market in both developed and emerging markets. Moreover, the overall performance of the artificial intelligence strategies is far better than the traditional ones.","[Er, Hakan; Hushmat, Adnan] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Business Adm, Dumlupinar Bulvari, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Hushmat, A (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Dept Business Adm, Dumlupinar Bulvari, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",erhakan@akdeniz.edu.tr; adnan.hushmat@gmail.com,"ER, HAKAN/A-4116-2018","ER, HAKAN/0000-0003-2302-7639; HUSHMAT, ADNAN/0000-0001-6657-905X",,,,,50,6,7,4,32,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

This article studies the effect of home confinement under electronic monitoring as a noncustodial alternative to imprisonment on the risk of relationship dissolution and being single, thereby distinguishing between effects of incarceration and of committing crime. We study a policy that expanded the use of electronic monitoring to address nonrandom selection into electronic monitoring instead of in prison. Results from a sample of 4,522 men show that home confinement under electronic monitoring significantly and persistently lowers the risk both of being single and of becoming single during the first five years following conviction.

Hawkes models can be used to model the occurrence of extreme events in financial markets. Our specific testing focus is on extending a univariate model to a multivariate model, that is, we examine whether there is a conditional dependence between extreme events in markets. Simulations show that the test has good size and power, in particular for sample sizes that are typically encountered in practice. Applying the specification test for dependence to U.S. stocks, bonds, and exchange rate data, we find strong evidence for cross-excitation within segments as well as between segments, which cannot simply be explained by volatility spillovers. Therefore, we recommend that univariate Hawkes models be extended to account for the cross-triggering phenomenon.

The first structural alternative involves expanding the universe of businesses subject to the tax by clearly defining both the base of the new US. business tax and its tax nexus requirement as domestic consumption, and thereafter treating foreign importers and other sellers equivalently, rather than imposing a deduction disallowance or an import tax. The second alternative involves adopting a business activities tax, and then enacting a business-level incentive for encouraging employment that is as a legal matter separate from the tax. Either approach avoids the key World Trade Organization concerns.","[Grinberg, Itai] Georgetown Univ, Law Ctr, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Grinberg, I (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Law Ctr, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",ltai.grinberg@law.georgetown.edu,,,,,,,17,6,7,0,8,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Some researchers have examined how these new business models shape market mechanisms and, in the case of home sharing, economists have examined how the sharing economy affects the hotel industry. There is currently limited evidence on whether home sharing affects the housing market, despite the obvious overlap between these two markets. As a result, policy makers grappling with the effects of the rapid growth of home sharing have inadequate information on which to make reasoned policy decisions. In this paper, we add to the small but growing body of knowledge on how the sharing economy is shaping the housing market by focusing on the short-term effects of the growth of Airbnb in Boston neighborhoods on the rental market, relying on individual rental listings. We examine whether the increasing presence of Airbnb raises asking rents and whether the change in rents may be driven by a decline in the supply of housing offered for rent. We show that a one standard deviation increase in Airbnb listings is associated with an increase in asking rents of 0.4%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This paper shows in a general equilibrium setting that rollover risk as a disciplining device is effective only if all intermediaries face purely idiosyncratic risk. However, if assets are correlated, a two-sided inefficiency arises: Good aggregate states have intermediaries taking excessive risks, while bad aggregate states suffer from costly fire sales. The driving force behind this inefficiency is an amplifying feedback loop between asset values and market discipline.

It is still an unclear question whether these standards are beneficial for an organization, besides the fact that they might be required or expected by law or customers. The question, whether MSS increase the efficiency, the output, or the performance of an organization is still discussed in scientific research. One reason might be that performance measurement itself is not fully understood or in constant development ranging from pure financial evaluations over intellectual capital rating to calculating of levels of environmental, social or economic expectations known as the Trible Bottom Line. The Balanced Scorecard is one possible solution for performance measurement on a strategic and operational level and therefore useful for the measurement of the influence of MSS within organizations. This study summarized current research in the field of performance measurement in the context of MSS and IMS and the use of BSC and quantitatively and qualitatively tests the usefulness of BSC in measuring the effect of MSSs using the Execution Premium. It was found that BSC is often used, that an average number of companies integrate their measurement initiatives of their MSSs into the BSC-process, and that a high integration of MSS into the BSC improves the organizational performance. This research is useful for researchers and practitioners in order to understand the benefits of the usage of the BSC in the context of MSS or Integrated Management Systems.","[Kopia, Jan; Kompalla, Andreas; Buchmueller, Melanie; Heinemann, Bastian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Kopia, J (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",j.kopia@gmail.com,,,,,,,104,5,8,0,34,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2017,19.0,,,,11,,981,1002,,,,,,22,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9VF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413858500005,0

Some main results emerge from our analysis regarding an adverse shock of either country-wide productivity or country-wide government expenditure. First, the decline in output is greater for a country with low openness under both regimes. Second, the monetary union will result in a greater decline in output if the monetary authority attaches a higher weight to output stabilization.

We find that, in both cases the optimum level of product differentiation is negatively related to Process R&D. We also allow the local firm to imitate MNE's product differentiation level as well as its Process R & D; and we find that, under spatial Hotelling price competition, the local firm has no incentive to imitate the MNE's product design, i.e. the level of product differentiation of the MNE, at Nash Equilibrium. Compared to the behaviour of a social planner, the MNE provides more differentiated goods than a social planner and when the local firm does not do undertake any R&D activities but can imitate the Process R&D of the MNE, a social planer has no incentive to enforce strong IPR at the optimum level.","[Nabin, Munirul H.; Visser, Robin; Sgro, Pasquale M.] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Dept Econ, Geelong, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,"Sgro, PM (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Dept Econ, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",sgro@deakin.edu.au,"Sgro, Pasquale M/C-7629-2013","Visser, Robin/0000-0003-2014-053X",,,,,15,4,5,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

This paper aims at answering to the following research question: how does GIs' process (protection and management) help to rationalize the role of the state in the coffee sector? In Colombia, the National Coffee Growers Federation took all initiatives for the registration and implementation of Cafe de Colombia as a GI both in Colombia and in European Union and manages also the GI use. In Kenya, the Coffee Directorate registered the certification trademark Coffee Kenya, So Rich So Kenyan and acts as public body in charge of managing the coffee sector. Although both countries conceived different approaches, there is a common strategic line, which consists in attempting to secure downstrearri value of the long lasting origin coffee branding and in strengthening the quality management system. This paper shows that discrepancies in public intervention in the coffee industry depend on the empowerment of producers in this industry irrespective of the legal tool to protect GIs.

Various trends such as population ageing put these schemes under serious pressure, however. Whether this is good or bad depends among other things on two factors: one is the value of the risk sharing between generations that is organized by pension schemes, and another is the cost of the distortions of labour supply decisions that these collective schemes imply. This paper constructs a model with overlapping generations of households and a pension scheme to assess the role of these two factors.

Income insurance from shareholders to workers explains these term structures. Risk-sharing smooths wages but only concerns transitory risk and hence enhances short-run dividend risk. As a result, actual labor-share variation largely forecasts the risk, premium, and slope of dividend strips. A simple general equilibrium model in which labor rigidity affects dividend dynamics and the price of short-run risk reconciles standard asset pricing facts with the term structures of the equity premium, volatility, and macroeconomic variables, which are at odds in leading models.","[Marfe, Roberto] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy",Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Marfè, R (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy.",,,,NCCR FINRISK of the Swiss National Science Foundation; Associazione per la Facolta di Economia dell' Universita di Torino,NCCR FINRISK of the Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Associazione per la Facolta di Economia dell' Universita di Torino,"Roberto Marfe is at Collegio Carlo Alberto.

And yet, our attempts at conceptualizing welfare regimes focus on the national level. In China, local authorities have shaped social policy implementation since economic reforms. In this paper, I answer three questions about subnational variation in social policy provision in China: (1) Have Chinese provinces diverged in their social policy provision?; (2) How do provincial social policy regimes differ from one another?; (3) What explains variation in provincial social policy spending? To answer the first question, I conduct a cluster analysis of provincial social policy spending data. I find that provinces systematically diverge in their social policy priorities. While some provinces invest in education to develop human capital and promote economic growth, others emphasize poverty alleviation. I propose a typology to conceptualize these tendencies. I then test for these divergent approaches using betweeneffects regression models of provincial social policy spending. Although provincial wealth and needs sometimes play a role in allocations for social policy, I find that economic development strategy and social instability are associated with distinct approaches to social welfare spending. These distinct provincial welfare regimes have implications for the adoption, implementation, and ultimately, effectiveness of social policy in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Consistent application of marginal cost pricing shows that the efficient tax on laundries is positive when the number of laundries is finite and that the tax approaches zero in the limit as the number of laundries approaches infinity. The efficient tax on factories is bounded away from zero, regardless of the number of factories. Our framework is an application of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves family of truth-telling mechanisms that require each agent to bear the full social cost of changing the outcome that would have prevailed had she not participated in the decision.

I model an originator who screens assets whose cash flows are later sold in secondary markets. Screening improves asset quality but gives rise to asymmetric information, hindering trade of the asset cash flows. In the optimal mechanism (second-best), costly retention of cash flows is essential to implement asset screening. Market allocations can feature too much or too little screening relative to second-best, where too much screening generates inefficiently illiquid markets. Furthermore, the economy is prone to multiple equilibria. The optimal mechanism is decentralized with two tools: retention rules and transfers.","[Vanasco, Victoria] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Vanasco, V (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Vanasco, Victoria/A-5191-2019","Vanasco, Victoria/0000-0002-2309-1449",Clayman Institute for Gender Research,Clayman Institute for Gender Research,"Victoria Vanasco is from the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University.

Harnessing a comprehensive collection of walking and bicycling traffic counts over 10 years in Chittenden County, Vermont, US, along with socioeconomic characteristics, transit accessibility indices, land use attributes and characteristics of intersections and roadway networks, this study utilizes GWR models to identify whether there are spatially varying relationships between active mode travel demands and ambient built-environment attributes. One Ordinary Least Square (OLS) model and two GWR models were parametrically calibrated: a full GWR model of all local variables and a mixed GWR model of both global and local variables. K-fold cross-validation method is used to select variables that significantly influence the volume of active travel modes in the OLS model. The uniform set of variables is investigated in two GWR models. Only residuals of the mixed GWR model exhibit spatial independence. The prediction accuracy of the three models is respectively compared by means of the k-fold cross-validation method. Results show that the mixed GWR model has higher prediction accuracy, while the other two models have roughly the same level of performance. We find that not all independent variables possess a spatially varying relationship with active mode volumes. The flexibility of the mixed GWR model that allows some independent variables to be global strengthens its prediction power. With these findings, transportation planners can dynamically estimate bicycle and pedestrian volumes at widespread intersections, and this geographical realism would facilitate local transportation planning, facility design, safety enhancement and operation analysis, as well as instilling new insights into interdisciplinary spatial research domain.","[Yang, Hongtai; Lu, Xiaozhao; Liu, Xiaohan; Li, Yanlai] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Transportat & Logist, 01117,111 First Sect,North Second Ring Rd, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Cherry, Christopher] Univ Tennessee, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 321 John D Tickle Bldg, Knoxville, TN USA",Southwest Jiaotong University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Lu, XZ (通讯作者)，Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Transportat & Logist, 01117,111 First Sect,North Second Ring Rd, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",yanghongtai@home.swjtu.edu.cn; lxz@swjtu.cn; cherry@utk.edu; liuxiaohan1@my.swjtu.edu.cn; yanlaili@home.swjtu.edu.cn,"zhu, zhu/JDN-0159-2023; Yang, Hongtai/AAZ-1699-2020; Cherry, Christopher/B-3270-2009","Cherry, Christopher/0000-0002-8835-4617; Yang, Hongtai/0000-0002-3608-1936","Service Science and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, P.R.

Based on econometric analysis of data reflecting patent activity of emerging entrepreneurial life sciences firms and thousands of academic publications, we find that higher-quality academic science associates with higher-quality industrial innovation. Importantly, we document that the degree that a given firm conducts basic science moderates this relationship. Our work develops a novel theoretical and empirical link between academic knowledge quality and industrial innovation and identifies the contingencies that allow this link to materialize.","[Zahringer, Kenneth; Kalaitzandonakes, Nicholas] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO USA; [Kolympiris, Christos] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Bath,"Kolympiris, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England.",ZahringerKA@missouri.edu; c.kolympir-is@bath.ac.uk; kalaitzandonakes@missouri.edu,"Zahringer, Kenneth/R-4223-2019","Kolympiris, Christos/0000-0003-1933-6332","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [2008-38420-18747]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This material is based upon work supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, under Agreement No. 2008-38420-18747",,107,15,15,4,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Relative price changes would therefore affect rich and poor consumers differently. Yet, the standard price indices are not income-specific, and hence, they cannot account for such differences. In this paper, we study consumption inequality in India, while fully allowing for non-homotheticity. We show that the relative price changes during most of the period from 1993 to 2012 were pro-poor, in the sense that they favored the poor relative to the rich. As a result, we also find that conventional measures significantly overstate the rise in real consumption inequality during this period. The main lesson from our study is the importance of accounting for non-homotheticity when measuring inequality. The price index literature has, as of yet, paid relatively little attention to this. In our application, however, it turns out that the allowance for nonhomotheticity is quantitatively much more important than much discussed adjustments, such as those for substitution in consumption.

Many of these individuals came to the United States to find a more successful place to raise a family due to increased work opportunities. After the Great Recession, many of these opportunities were terminated with the closure of industrialized manufacturing corporations. With the loss of jobs, increased economic pressure mounted and hardships, especially in the educational system, increased. The current study addresses how immigrant Latinos view the education environment in North Central Indiana. A 3 year ethnographic research project presents a greater understanding of the complex economic and educational ecology. For this study, 40 families consisting of 63 parents were identified, along with seven school liaisons. Fifty-six percent of the participating Latinos received less than a high school diploma, adding additional economic strain to families. Qualitative reports are framed around in-vivo coding factors resulting in two themes, Policy, Educational Practices, and Sociological Perceptions and Cultural Desire to Better One's Family.

Using a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the staggered introduction of reforms, we find that prices for Basic' service declined systematically by about 5.5 to 6.8 per cent following the reforms, but we find no statistically significant effect on average price for the more popular Expanded Basic' service. We also find that the reforms led to increased actual entry in reformed states, by about 11.6% relative to non-reformed states. Our analysis shows that the decline in price for Basic' service holds for markets that did not experience actual entry, consistent with limit pricing by incumbents. To control for potential state-level shocks correlated with the reforms, we undertake a sample-split test that finds larger declines in prices for both Basic' and Expanded Basic' services in local markets which faced a greater threat of entry (because they were close to a prominent second entrant). Our results are consistent with limit pricing models that predict incumbents respond to increased threat of entry, and suggest that the reforms facilitated entry and modestly benefited consumers in reformed states.","[Bagchi, Sutirtha] Villanova Univ, Dept Econ, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Sivadasan, Jagadeesh] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Villanova University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Bagchi, S (通讯作者)，Villanova Univ, Dept Econ, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",sutirtha.bagchi@villanova.edu; jagadees@umich.edu,,,,,,,65,5,5,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

We attribute this variation in bond correlation to variation in risk factor correlation reflecting time-varying flight-to-quality behavior of investors. We show that risk factor correlation increases when investor sentiment worsens, i.e., corporate bond investors exhibit stronger flight-to-quality when their sentiment is bad. Thus, bad investor sentiment leads to flight to-quality behavior and, ultimately, high bond correlation. Very good sentiment, in contrast, can cause risk factor correlation and bond correlation to be negative. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

What are the main potential determinants of such variations? Over a cross-section of Italian provincial data, we analyze the association between two specific facets of women's empowerment, the percentage of women holding office in local political bodies and the percentage of women in high-ranking jobs, and the religious and cultural conditions which facilitate or hinder women's inclusion. Our hypothesis is that culture, in particular those values embodied by religious culture, plays a central role in shaping norms and beliefs about the role and involvement of women in society. Moreover we suggest that these cultural norms are inherited from the past and therefore have a high degree of inertia. Both OLS and IV results indicate that our measures of women's empowerment are strongly associated with religious culture, as proxied by religious marriages. These results are robust and consistent across specifications.","[Bozzano, Monica] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dipartimento Econ Marco Biagi, Via Berengario 51, I-41121 Modena, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Bozzano, M (通讯作者)，Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dipartimento Econ Marco Biagi, Via Berengario 51, I-41121 Modena, Italy.",monica.bozzano@unimore.it,,"Bozzano, Monica/0000-0001-9720-3821",Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Modena; Italian University Ministry; University of Modena and Reggio Emilia,"Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Modena; Italian University Ministry(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); University of Modena and Reggio Emilia","I would like to thank Graziella Bertocchi, Thomas Bassetti, Giacomo Pasini, Giulio Zanella, for their help and suggestions.

After estimating the volatility process without assuming any specific form of its behavior, we find the volatility to be long-term dependent with the Hurst exponent on a verge of stationarity and nonstationarity. We then apply the detrended cross-correlation coefficient to overcome this complication and find evidence of a significant and negative relationship between current stock market returns and current market volatility. Additionally, we find the strength of the negative return-volatility relation is different for specific scales and is stronger in longer time horizon. We further investigate the presence of volatility feedback and leverage effects in international stock markets by examining the lead-lag relation between stock returns and volatility and confirm that the negative return-volatility relation seems to be return-driven (the leverage effect). Finally, we exaniine the dynamic behavior of the return-volatility relation by applying a rolling window approach and find that time-varying negative return-volatility relation is more likely to generate an asymmetric response with a greater effect when returns decline, which is the common characteristic of international stock markets.","[Jin, Xiaoye] East China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Int Sch Financial Law, Shanghai, Peoples R China",East China University Political Science & Law,"Jin, XY (通讯作者)，Room B118,HuiXian Bldg,555 Long Yuan Rd, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",auraxa.jin@gmail.com,,"Jin, Xiaoye/0000-0002-5250-1160",,,,,70,28,28,3,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Most of the existing multi-population mortality models are built on the hypothesis of coherence, which assumes that there always exists a force that brings the mortality differential between any two populations back to a constant long-term equilibrium level. This hypothesis prevents diverging long-term forecasts, which do not seem to be biologically reasonable. However, the coherence assumption may be perceived by market participants as too strong and is in fact not always supported by empirical observations. In this article, we introduce a new concept called semicoherence, which is less stringent in the sense that it permits the mortality trajectories of two related populations to diverge, as long as the divergence does not exceed a specific tolerance corridor, beyond which mean reversion will come into effect. We further propose to produce semicoherent mortality forecasts by using a vector threshold autoregression. The proposed modeling approach is illustrated with mortality data from U.S. and English and Welsh male populations, and is applied to several pricing and hedging scenarios.","[Li, Johnny Siu-Hang] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Chan, Wai-Sum] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Rui] Univ Manitoba, Warren Ctr Actuarial Studies & Res, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Waterloo; Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Manitoba,"Li, JSH (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",shli@uwaterloo.ca,,"Chan, Wai-Sum/0000-0002-6021-0312; Zhou, Rui/0000-0002-0071-4703",,,,,54,20,22,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

It then studies the effects of disenfranchisement laws, which prohibit convicted felons from voting. The removal of ex-convicts from the pool of eligible voters reduces the pressure politicians may otherwise face to protect the interests of this group, and thereby causes the political process to push the sentences for criminal offenses upwards. Therefore, disenfranchisement further widens the gap between the optimal sentence and the equilibrium sentence, and thereby exacerbates the problem of over-incarceration. Moreover, this result is valid even when voter turnout is negatively correlated with people's criminal tendencies, i.e., when criminals vote less frequently than non-criminals.","[Mungan, Murat C.] George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Mungan, MC (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Antonin Scalia Law Sch, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",mmungan@gmu.edu,,"Mungan, Murat/0000-0003-1948-6488",,,,,24,17,19,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2017,172.0,3-4,,,,,377,395,,10.1007/s11127-017-0448-6,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FD8CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407753200005,0

In this paper, we develop a methodology based on input-output analysis to compare the employment content of each economic sector to the national average. The differences are broken down into five components: the import rates of final goods, the import rates of intermediate goods, taxes and subsidies, salary levels and the share of labor in value added. We then estimate the employment content and the greenhouse gases (GHG) content of all French economic sectors in 2010, in order to study intersectoral substitutions stemming from an energy transition. We find that employment content variations are explained, in order of importance, by salary levels, the share of labor in value added, the import rates of final goods, the import rates of intermediate goods, and finally taxes and subsidies. In addition, our results show that the EU ETS covers sectors with high GHG content and low employment content, but not sectors with high GHG content and high employment content. Concerns about employment impacts might be part of the explanation for this. Finally, we identify intersectoral substitutions that would encourage sectors with lower GHG content and higher employment content.","[Perrier, Quentin; Quirion, Philippe] CIRED, Int Res Ctr Environm & Dev, Paris, France; [Perrier, Quentin] ENGIE, Paris, France; [Quirion, Philippe] CNRS, Paris, France",AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Perrier, Q (通讯作者)，CIRED, Int Res Ctr Environm & Dev, Paris, France.;Perrier, Q (通讯作者)，ENGIE, Paris, France.",perrier@centre-cired.fr; quirion@centre-cired.fr,"Quirion, Philippe/E-9686-2011",,,,,,43,1,1,0,12,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We compare the consequences of emission quotas and emission taxes under trade liberalization on location of two manufacturing sectors with different emission intensities and degrees of carbon leakage.

J,"Maity, B",,,,"Maity, Bipasha",,,Comparing Health Outcomes Across Scheduled Tribes and Castes in India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,health; tribes; castes; women; decomposition analysis; India,,"The Scheduled Tribes and Castes (STs and SCs) are the two most disadvantaged social groups in India. Previous studies have usually grouped the STs and SCs together as one disadvantaged group and have compared their educational and occupational mobility with the higher castes. We instead seek to compare health outcomes of the STs with not only the upper castes but also especially the SCs. We find that STs consistently perform poorly even relative to the SCs in terms of knowledge and usage of modern contraceptives, antenatal and postnatal healthcare, incidence of anemia and child immunization. However, female infant mortality is significantly higher among SCs than among STs, with no significant difference in male infant mortality between these groups. We find that ST women enjoy high social status and thus are unlikely to face impediments in accessing healthcare due to social norms that restrict women's autonomy. Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition methodology reveals that the health disparity between the STs and SCs for some key outcomes cannot be fully explained by differences in attributes between them. Suggestive evidence indicates that the health disparity can be likely attributed to the potentially greater marginalization that STs face even relative to SCs when accessing healthcare. This indicates the necessity to study STs in isolation from SCs so that policy can be designed to specifically target and mitigate health inequalities prevalent even among the most disadvantaged social groups.

We also find that the incidence of such effects is more pronounced for domestic banks which are less efficient and less based on traditional activities. Foreign banks exert more pronounced impacts on domestic banks' risk when they enter the host market via M&A, as opposed to greenfield investments, and when they belong to foreign conglomerates which provide strong internal support.

Employing a balanced provincial panel dataset, we find a significant variation in the factors determining regional labor productivity between the three macro-regions. The factors of capital investment intensity, foreign intensity, and export intensity behave differently with a significant regional diversity. Only human capital, the real wage, and firm size are identified as the common determinants across regions. A strong self-reinforcing effect has been found with a high degree of persistence in the behavior of, and hence slow or negligible convergence in labor productivity between regions. We find that the labor efficiency gains have been generated more from internal rather than external economies of scale across regions as well as the country as a whole. We also find that the government privatization reforms have had both a short run and increasingly long-term positive impact on the TVE labor productivity across the regions. This finding may indicate that institutional privatization can be an effective tool in promoting industrialization and labor productive performance in China as well as in other transitional economies.

The model highlights the contrast between two idealized views of Federal Reserve appointments. In one view, politicians prefer to appoint conservatively biased central bankers to overcome credible commitment problems that arise in monetary policy. In the other, politicians prefer to appoint allies, and appointments are well described by the spatial model used to describe appointments to other agencies. Both ideals are limiting cases of our model, which depend on the level of economic uncertainty. When economic uncertainty is extremely low, politicians prefer very conservative appointments. When economic uncertainty increases, politicians' prefer central bank appointees closer to their own ideal points. In the typical case, the results are somewhere in between: equilibrium appointments move in the direction of politician's preferences but with a moderate conservative bias.","[Schnakenberg, Keith E.] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Louis, MO USA; [Turner, Ian R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Uribe-McGuire, Alicia] Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, Urbana, IL USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Turner, IR (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",irturner@tamu.edu,,,NSF [DGE-1143954],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"NSF, Grant/Award Number: DGE-1143954",,32,6,7,0,4,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene produces an enzyme that regulates dopamine levels (among many other chemicals) in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. I find that borrowers who have one or two of the A alleles (or more formally, the methionine allele) are significantly more likely to strategically default than those who possess the G (or valine) allele. I find no significant association for the DRD4 7-repeater or the 5-HTTLPR markers.

This study provides a novel perspective on the factors driving this relationship in the market for 10-year Treasury note futures: Target rate surprises and the complexity of the monetary policy statement language are important determinants. Differences of opinion resulting from interpretation of complex language appear to result in more trading volume despite relatively low levels of liquidity (a negative liquidity-volume relationship), while large target rate surprises reduce trading activity (a positive liquidity-volume relationship). The dynamic changes over time, as unconventional polices are adopted by monetary authorities and, high frequency traders become more pervasive. Central bankers may aid market liquidity by minimizing surprises, and issuing statements that are easier to understand (with shorter sentences and more familiar words). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, this intraday rate correlates with market liquidity, suggesting that rates contain a liquidity premium.

Distributional concerns are often given as a justification for the lower carbon price faced by households, but there is little rationale for carbon prices associated with the use of gas to be lower than those for electricity. We consider reforms that raise carbon prices faced by households and reduce the variation in carbon prices across gas and electricity use, improving the efficiency of emissions reduction. We show that the revenue raised from these reforms can be recycled in a way that ameliorates some of the distributional concerns. Whilst such recycling is not able to protect all poorer households, existing policy also makes distributional trade-offs, but does so in an opaque and inefficient way.","[Advani, Arun; Stoye, George] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Advani, Arun; Stoye, George] UCL, London, England; [Advani, Arun] Kings Coll, Cambridge, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London; University of Cambridge,"Advani, A (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.;Advani, A (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;Advani, A (通讯作者)，Kings Coll, Cambridge, England.",arun_a@ifs.org.uk; g.stoye@ifs.org.uk,"Stoye, George/AAM-2292-2021","Advani, Arun/0000-0002-4131-0609",Esmee Fairbairn Foundation [11-2886]; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP) at the Institute for Fiscal Studies [RES-544-28-0001]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Esmee Fairbairn Foundation; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP) at the Institute for Fiscal Studies; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"With thanks to Paul Johnson and Andrew Leicester, who were involved in other parts of this project, to James Browne and Andrew Hood for assistance with the tax and benefit modelling, and to Claire Crawford (editor) and two anonymous referees for their comments.

We measure banks' marginal cost by their rate on new deposits, contrary to the literature that focuses on money market rates. This allows us to account for banks' risks. We focus on the interest rate on new short-term loans granted to non-financial corporations in these countries. Our analysis is based on an error-correction approach that we extend to handle the time-varying long-run relationship between banks' lending rates and, banks' marginal cost, as well as stochastic volatility. Our application is based on a harmonised monthly database from January 2003 to October 2014. We estimate the model within a Bayesian framework, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC). We reject the view that the transmission mechanism is permanent over time. The long-run relationship moved with the sovereign debt crises to a new one, with a slower pass-through and higher bank lending rates. Its developments are heterogeneous from one country to the other. Impediments to the transmission of monetary rates depend on the heterogeneity in banks marginal costs and therefore, its risks. We also find that rates to small firms increase compared to large firms in a few countries. Using a VAR model, we show that overall, the effect of a shock on the rate of new deposits on the unexpected variances of new loans has been less important since 2010. These results confirm the slowdown in the transmission mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using survey data from more than 5000 firms in 29 European countries, we find that support policies for innovation, both monetary and non-monetary, are related to an increase in the degree of openness of individual firms, both in terms of the number of external partners with whom they collaborate and the number of open innovation activities they perform. However, the relationship between support and openness seems to be negatively moderated by the existence of previous innovative activity within the firm. Public support has more impact on less innovative firms and less influence when the firm is already innovative, which could potentially indicate the existence of crowding-out effects. Additionally, our results suggest that non-financial support is more strongly linked to openness than financial support. For policy makers facing salient budgetary constraints, this implies that institutions and government policies could potentially play a more important role than money in fostering open innovation. This article contributes to the open innovation literature by tapping into the underexplored question of the role of public policies and has crucial implications for academics and policy makers.","[Cano-Kollmann, Marcelo] Ohio Univ, Dept Management, Coll Business, 536 Copeland Hall, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Hamilton, Robert D., III; Mudambi, Ram] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Dept Strateg Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Cano-Kollmann, M (通讯作者)，Ohio Univ, Dept Management, Coll Business, 536 Copeland Hall, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",canokoll@ohio.edu; rdhiii@temple.edu; ram.mudambi@temple.edu,"Mudambi, Ram/A-8580-2008; Mudambi, Ram/N-1145-2019","Mudambi, Ram/0000-0002-5396-5602",,,,,92,60,63,0,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Research also has shown that maternal kin play a central caregiving role in families. This paper examines the extent to which maternal family involvement is associated with father identity. Data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 1836) showed that, net of a number of confounding factors, maternal family involvement was associated negatively with father identity, although nonresident fathers were significantly likely to feel less good about themselves as fathers regardless of maternal family involvement. Overall, results suggested that the extended family context in which parents (of young children) are embedded may contribute to how men identify as fathers.","[Hognas, Robin S.; Williams, Heidi] Univ Louisville, 103 Lutz Hall, Louisville, KY 40217 USA",University of Louisville,"Högnäs, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Louisville, 103 Lutz Hall, Louisville, KY 40217 USA.",robin.hognas@louisville.edu,,,,,,,59,4,7,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Asset and income losses were substantial, especially in seriously affected areas. Our main finding is that there was an overwhelming government response to the disaster. Subsidies provided to households in 2008 were so large that mean income per capita was 17.5% higher in 2008 than in 2007 and the poverty rate actually declined from 34% to 19%. Using distance from the epicenter as an instrument for earthquake damage, we find a strong positive statistical relationship between lost value of housing and other assets due to the earthquake and increases in income per capita and government transfers received, and much weaker responsiveness of private transfers, wage labor supply, and borrowing.

We evaluate the quality of interest rate forecasts for the three months interbank rate in the UK (LIBOR) and Germany (EURIBOR) as well as the corresponding 10Y government bond yields using the root mean squared error as well as the Theil's U measure and also apply models of time series analysis (i.e. cointegration and causality analysis). Finally, we check for possible implications from uncertainty measures (i.e. High-Low-Spread of forecasts as well as forecast errors) and structural breaks. We are able to find some links to the real economy. Applying our methodological approach both to the UK and Germany we are able to draw conclusions with regard to the quality of international forecasts in times of uncertainty. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The number of open defecators in India dwarfs that of other states, and most live in rural places. Open defecation is often approached as a problem scaled at the site of the individual, who makes a choice not to build and/or use a toilet. Attempts to end rural open defecation by targeting individuals, like social marketing or behavior change approaches, often ignore the structural inequalities that shape rural residents' everyday lives. Our study explores the question, What is the role of remoteness in sustaining open defecation in rural India? We deploy the concept of remoteness as an analytical tool that can capture everyday practices of open defecation as a function of physical and social distance. Using ethnographic methods, we interviewed and observed 70 participants in four villages in Uttarakhand, India over a three-month period in 2013. We find that remoteness in general, and its lived nuances, form a context for prevalent open defecation. Structural inequalities across space will need to be addressed to make latrine building and usage viable in remote places. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A typical application is to form portfolios based on the cointegrated relationships found in a set of financial assets in an attempt to generate profits. However, some high-net worth investors may find these portfolios too risky, particularly during a bear market, and hence they lose interest in adopting them in their trading strategies. A plausible method to relieve such burden to the investors is to construct a cointegrated portfolio which is also market-neutral. We name such cointegrated market-neutral portfolio as COINMAN. In this paper, we will tackle the problem of identifying COINMAN. We will discuss how to determine the number of COINMAN portfolios available among a set of assets. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to identify COINMAN portfolios consisting of the constituent stocks of Hang Seng Index and Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index in Hong Kong. Our empirical results demonstrate that the trading strategies based on COINMAN portfolios are more profitable and less sensitive to the market than their cointegrated counterparts.","[Yu, Philip L.

In this paper we empirically investigate the relationship between social capital and households' probability of living under poverty. We used a large-scale cross-sectional survey in western Chinese provinces to explore the impact of households' social capital on four different poverty measures. Our results indicate that in addition to the structural and relational properties of households' social networks, the types of resources embedded in these networks such as business ties, political ties, and appropriable social organizations can contribute significantly to poverty reduction. Moreover, since our study is situated in China's emerging economy context, we can thus further explore how variations in macrolevel institutions affect the usefulness of various social resources in reducing poverty. We discovered that the quality of local institutions as measured by local residents' trust toward the institutions can modulate the effectiveness of political ties and appropriable social organizations, such that the impacts of political ties and appropriable social organizations tend to diminish in communities with higher level of institutional trust than they are in communities with lower level of institutional trust, while business ties turn out to be effective in alleviating poverty in both high-and low-trust communities.

This article discusses how it managed this, when many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa failed to achieve theirs, and assesses the sustainability of its solutions. Determined government policies involving investment in health and education and their energetic implementation with the support of development partners are identified as ultimately responsible for this success in improving the lives of ordinary Rwandans. The major mechanisms for implementation have been the provision of relatively local health centers, payment of health providers by results, setting up an affordable health insurance scheme (with support for those most in poverty) and the appointment of volunteer Community Health Workers who are unpaid but are encouraged and supported to form cooperatives for their own and their families' support. The effectiveness of this level of community involvement suggests that the Sustainable Development Goals which replace the MDGs may also be attainable. A marked reduction in Official Development Assistance because of the success would be counterproductive, however, probably putting the cost of medical and preventative supplies beyond the reach of the average Rwandan citizen.

We detect this problem by pricing options with a known volatility and reverse engineering to back into the implied volatility from the model price that was derived from the assumed volatility. The returned volatilities follow distinctive patterns resulting from algorithmic choices of the user and the quotation unit of the option. In particular, the common practice of penny pricing on option exchanges results in a significant loss of accuracy in implied volatility. For the most common scenarios faced in practice, the problem primarily exists in short-term options, but it manifests for virtually all cases of moneyness of at least 10 % and often 5 %. While it is theoretically possible to almost eliminate the problem, practical limitations in trading prevent any realistic chance of avoiding this error. It is even more difficult to identify and control the problem when smiles also arise from market imperfections, as is widely accepted. We empirically estimate a very conservative lower bound of the effect at about 16 % of the observed smile for 30-day options. Thus, we document a previously unknown phenomenon that a portion of the volatility smile is not of an economic nature. We provide some best-practice recommendations, including the explicit specification of the algorithmic choices and a warning against using off-the-shelf routines.","[Chance, Don M.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Finance, 2909 BEC, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Hanson, Thomas A.] Minnesota State Univ Moorhead, Paseka Sch Business, Moorhead, MN 56563 USA; [Li, Weiping] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan Provinc, Peoples R China; [Li, Weiping] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Finance, MSCS 526, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Muthuswamy, Jayaram] Kent State Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business Adm, POB 5190, Kent, OH 44242 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Minnesota State University Moorhead; Southwest Jiaotong University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent,"Hanson, TA (通讯作者)，Minnesota State Univ Moorhead, Paseka Sch Business, Moorhead, MN 56563 USA.",dchance@lsu.edu; thomas.hanson@msntate.edu; wli@math.okstate.edu; jmuthusw@kent.edu,"Hanson, Thomas A/J-6583-2019; Li, Weiping/AAE-3442-2021","Hanson, Thomas A/0000-0001-9074-8829;",,,,,53,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Recent studies have, however, concluded that a considerable disjuncture exists between this framework and the actual agricultural policies and programmes implemented by the government. In this paper, I provide a broad overview of the agricultural and rural development policies under the Correa government and analyse some of the causes of the gap between the policy framework and policy implementation. I argue that Ecuador under Correa speaks to the difficulties of reconciling a via campesina approach to rural development with a neo-developmental economic model. I focus on several issues in particular in order to explain the disjuncture: how the growth of via campesina proposals and political discourse in Ecuador since the 1980s coincided with significant processes of agrarian change; the transformation of rural social movement federations from a sociopolitical force into a political/electoral force and the subsequent decline of these movements; and the deepening integration of small-scale producers into domestic agribusiness commodity chains and the growth of national agribusiness firms during the Correa government.","[Clark, Patrick] Carleton Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Clark, P (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",patrick_clark@carleton.ca,,,,,,,85,27,31,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

It then tests the hypotheses by means of a unique survey on transnational R&D centers in China. The results indicate that the embedding of transnational R&D centers has positive effects on the host country's MS. Relational embedding, structural embedding, and virtual embedding have different influences with different lag periods of effects; the first two modes are the most influential.

Using bank holding company level data, we analyze whether better-governed banks create higher levels of liquidity. We find that this effect is positive and significant but only for large bank holding companies. Further analysis reveals that specific internal governance categories: CEO education, compensation structure, progressive practices, and ownership have a significant effect on bank liquidity. However, this positive effect occurs mostly during the crisis period, and for large banks that are also high liquidity creators. Finally, we find that the effect of governance on liquidity creation increases during the crisis period.

As predicted, illiquidity is higher on days when the fraction of toxic arbitrage opportunities and arbitrageurs' relative speed are higher.

To address this knowledge gap, we perform data mining on the Fannie Mae mortgage portfolio of the fourth quarter of 2007, which includes 340,537 mortgages with a total principal value of $69.8 billion. This portfolio had the highest delinquency rate in the agency's history: 19.4% versus the historical average of 1.7%. We find that although a number of information variables that were available at the time of mortgage acquisition are correlated with the subsequent delinquencies, building an accurate model proves challenging.

This paper focuses on the joint use of Fuzzy Logic (FL) reasoning and Social Network Analysis (SNA) to assess the cargo allocation pattern in Brazilian ports while shedding some light on policy-making directions and future research venues. Results suggest that cargo allocation patterns vary depending on the cargo type and product type. One can also infer that shippers prioritize distance in relation to other port allocation criteria. In the case of containerized cargo, this may be due to its higher value added compared to bulk cargo. Sensitivity analyses are also performed on the weights of port allocation criteria to explore opportunities for cargo relocation among ports in Brazil. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study explored ways young adult cohabiters (N = 691) financially combined their lives and the associations with subsequent relationship outcomes. Results indicated cohabiters were intertwining credit histories and bank accounts, and acquiring assets such as purchasing homes together. Sharing a mortgage was associated with an increased likelihood of marriage, whereas joint credit card accounts increased the odds of dissolution. Cohabiters with an intent to marry were much more likely to start integrating their finances prior to marriage. This study sheds light on the heterogeneous ways that a recent cohort of young adult couples manages their finances and navigates relationships.","[Addo, Fenaba R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Consumer Sci, Sch Human Ecol, 1300 Linden Dr,4204 Nancy Nicholas Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Addo, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Consumer Sci, Sch Human Ecol, 1300 Linden Dr,4204 Nancy Nicholas Hall, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",faddo@wisc.edu,,,NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD047873] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,67,23,29,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Although seminal theorizing on the determinants of entrepreneurship gives culture a unique and important role, systematic empirical evidence linking the distinct cultural identity of regions to their local entrepreneurial spirit and vitality is still scarce. This study offers a first, systematic overview on the nexus between regional cultural identity and latent and manifest entrepreneurship across the USA. To directly assess regional cultural identity, we apply the American Nations and Patchwork Community Types approaches and explore in which way these distinct spatially based cultural regions are reflected by significant differences in entrepreneurial activity and underlying biologically based propensities. We combine annual entrepreneurship rates at the county level with personality data collected in a large-scale, Internet-based study of 3,457,270 US residents. The findings suggest that entrepreneurship culture reflects the dynamic interplay between the region's cultural identity and its latent and manifest entrepreneurship.","[Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Inst Dev Strategies, 1315 East 10th St, Bloomington, IN USA; [Obschonka, Martin] Univ Saarland, Dept Psychol, Campus Bldg A1 3, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany; [Gosling, Samuel D.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, 1 Univ Stn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gosling, Samuel D.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Potter, Jeff] Atof Inc, Cambridge, MA USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Saarland University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Melbourne,"Obschonka, M (通讯作者)，Univ Saarland, Dept Psychol, Campus Bldg A1 3, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany.",martin.obschonka@uni-saarland.de,"Gosling, Sam/AAL-5718-2020","Gosling, Sam/0000-0001-8970-591X; Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762; Obschonka, Martin/0000-0002-0853-7166",Fritz-Thyssen-Stiftung [Az. 20.14.0.051],Fritz-Thyssen-Stiftung,Financial support by the Fritz-Thyssen-Stiftung (Az. 20.14.0.051) is gratefully acknowledged.

Prior studies find that illiquid assets have a strong expected influence on bequests, which suggests volatile housing markets will alter household bequest expectations, particularly since housing is generally the largest share of household wealth. I calculate shocks to housing wealth as the deviation in values from their growth trend over the last three years, and I exploit the geographic variation in housing market volatility to explore the relationship between housing value shocks and bequest expectations over the housing boom and bust. I find that housing price shocks, and especially negative shocks, have a consistent influence on bequest expectations for homeowners, particularly for older homeowners, and for those without stocks. A complementary analysis of elasticities also reveals a larger influence of housing values on bequests than other forms of wealth. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We first show the information advantages sellers had over buyers in both the issuance of CDOs and, through vertical integration, performance of the CDO collateral that could well have disrupted trading after the onset of the crisis. Using a workhorse model for pricing securities under asymmetric information and a novel dataset, we show how adverse selection could explain why the bulk of these securities either traded at significant discounts or did not trade at all.

Difference-in-differences and instrumental variable estimates show that towns that gained access experienced substantial relative increases in population, though such growth mainly reflected a relocation of economic activity. Over the twentieth century, we find little evidence of convergence in town populations, despite the railroad network expanding further to connect nearly all towns. Evidence on historical investments and present-day factors is consistent with the idea that the transitory shock of the first railroads gave rise to path dependence in the location of economic activity.

This paper focuses on the way bankruptcy is managed in Tunisia, a country characterized by the importance of its banking sector. We collected data on a set of bankrupt firms (1995-2009). We address several questions. Do the Tunisian bankruptcy procedures generate substantial overall recoveries? Are the secured creditors (mostly banks) well-enough protected under bankruptcy, and do they influence the courts' decisions? To which extent the creditors compete together? The highest recoveries are found mostly under reorganization procedures. Yet, despite a high level of competition between the classes of claimholders, the secured creditors' recovery rate remains similar to one of the unsecured creditors. Last, the court's decision to liquidate/reorganize the debtor seems not influenced by the structure of claims. The likely consequences on development are twofold: higher risks of capital misallocation/credit rationing, and stronger incentives for the banks to prioritize informal workouts.

Family firms provide the benefits of political connections, but at the same time they are more prone to expropriate minority shareholders themselves. This cost-benefit trade-off depends on the quality of country governance: families are attractive investment opportunities in countries in which the value of political connections is high, but the majority shareholders have limited ability to expropriate, i.e., useful countries. Foreign investors more sensitive both to the risk of expropriation by the government and to the risk of expropriation by majority shareholders are particularly responsive to this trade-off.

We find that (i) relationship lenders are more likely to provide liquidity to their closest borrowers, (ii) particularly opaque borrowers obtain liquidity at lower rates when borrowing from their relationship lenders, and (iii) during the crisis, relationship lenders provided cheaper loans to their closest borrowers. Our results hold after controlling for search frictions as well as a large set of (time-varying) bank and bank-pair control variables and fixed effects. While we find some indication that lending relationships help banks reduce search frictions in the over-the-counter interbank market, our results establish that bank-pair relationships have a significant impact on interbank credit availability and pricing due to mitigating uncertainty about counterparty credit quality.","[Brauning, Falk] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA; [Fecht, Falko] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Bräuning, F (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",,,"Fecht, Falko/0000-0001-5659-2381",,,,,46,45,49,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

We shed light on this debate using evidence from France in the 1930s. In 1936, France departed from the gold standard and implemented mandatory wage increases and hours restrictions. Deflation ended but output stagnated. We present time-series and cross-sectional evidence that these supply-side policies, in particular the 40-hour law, contributed to French stagflation. These results are inconsistent both with the standard one-sector New Keynesian model and with a medium scale, multisector model calibrated to match our cross-sectional estimates.

Territorial User Rights (TURF) is one example increasingly promoted to enhancing sustainability of small-scale fisheries. Despite rising global interest empirical inquiry into the factors contributing to TURF outcomes remains limited and focus has centered on the ecological and fisheries outcomes, largely neglecting documentation of social consequences and social determinants of success. This paper aims to move the theoretical and empirical work on the role of social capital and leadership in natural resource governance (particularly fisheries) forward by deepening the discussion around the conceptualization and operationalintion of social capital. We also extend empirical work on TURF performance by examining multiple social and ecological outcomes. We put forth four theoretically informed propositions about the relationship between key explanatory variables and outcomes. Using empirical data from six Chilean Territorial User Rights areas we provide an early assessment of the validity of these propositions using a case comparative approach, and test their usefulness in operationalizing and analyzing such multifaceted data. Findings show that social capital may not be a useful predictor of success, while the presence of engaged leadership and agreement among members around sanctions appears more closely linked to performance across all social and ecological outcome variables. A key finding is that the use of social capital as a broad term encompassing multiple pro-social variables may not be a fruitful way forward for improving our understanding of the determinants of success in resource management. Instead results indicate that leadership interacts with specific aspects of what is generally referred to as social capital to affect outcomes. To allow theoretical refinement and hypotheses testing regarding determinants of governance outcomes we suggest the social processes measured under the broad umbrella of social capital should be kept separate.

The study effectively mitigates potential estimation bias by estimating income growth using three explanatory variables for housing markets: the stock price, the federal funds rate, and non-farm-employment growth. The moving-average thresholds track housing boom-bust regime shifts from a forward-looking perspective. Although only California displays high housing-bubble vulnerability in all dimensions analysed, all selected states show signs of housing-bubble vulnerabilities because income fundamentals lack explanatory power for housing price dynamics.

To explain urbanization, standard models emphasize rural-urban migration, focusing on rural push factors (agricultural modernization and rural poverty) and urban pull factors (industrialization and urban-biased policies). Using new historical data on urban birth and death rates for 7 countries from Industrial Europe (1800-1910) and 35 developing countries (1960-2010), we argue that a non-negligible part of developing countries' rapid urban growth and urbanization may also be linked to demographic factors, i.e. rapid internal urban population growth, or an urban push. High urban natural increase in today's developing countries follows from lower urban mortality, relative to Industrial Europe, where higher urban deaths offset urban births. This compounds the effects of migration and displays strong associations with urban congestion, providing additional insight into the phenomenon of urbanization without growth.

For identification of the structural parameters, we exploit the policy-induced variation in effective car prices and the location of product-specific vehicle taxes as instruments. The estimated demand system allows us to simulate counterfactual Bertrand-Nash equilibria in response to alternative policy scenarios. Our results indicate that Japan's feebate policy induced a sizable increase in economic surplus, yet only a small improvement in sales-weighted average fuel efficiency, relative to the no-policy counterfactual. We also design an optimal feebate policy, which maximizes total economic surplus subject to a tax revenue constraint, by explicitly accounting for market power, product attributes, and carbon dioxide emissions rates. The policy is predicted to induce sizable improvements in both economic surplus and average fuel efficiency over Japan's feebate policy without requiring any decrease in tax revenues.","[Konishi, Yoshifumi] Sophia Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Chiyoda Ku, 7-1 Kioi Cho, Tokyo 1028554, Japan; [Zhao, Meng] Gakushuin Univ, Fac Int Social Sci, Tokyo 171, Japan",Sophia University; Gakushuin University,"Konishi, Y (通讯作者)，Sophia Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Chiyoda Ku, 7-1 Kioi Cho, Tokyo 1028554, Japan.",y-konishi@sophia.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [25780171]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780171] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The study was in part supported by financial support from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (grant 25780171).

The remaining wealth may be invested in a zero expected value risky project (i.e., gambled). The risk of bankruptcy is endogenous since either fully insuring or forgoing the project will guarantee solvency. We show that, for a range of parameters, it is optimal to both insure and gamble. The amounts insured and invested are chosen to create the potential for bankruptcy.

The first approach explores how the health regime affects savings in the country. The second evaluates the impact on savings of familias en accion, a major antipoverty conditional cash transfer program. The results suggest that the savings of informal households are higher than those of formal households, because, with little incentive to enter the formal job market, informal households need to cover slightly greater non-covered risks.

One possible explanation is that comovement increased because fundamental values became more correlated. However, I find that changes in fundamentals account for only 23% of the increase in covariance. The remaining increase is attributed to changes in liquidity and the market price of default risk. In contrast, counterparty risk played an insignificant role. Although both contributed, the increase in covariance was driven more by variation in exposures than factor variance-covariance.","[Anderson, Mike] George Mason Univ, Sch Business, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Anderson, M (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Business, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",mander19@gmu.edu,,,Dice Center,Dice Center,I also thank the Dice Center for research support.,,60,6,7,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Does this mean that the decision to become an entrepreneur should be discouraged? The answer depends in part on whether we believe that entrepreneurs report their income truthfully or not. Adjusting for what is considered to be underreporting by entrepreneurs lifts entrepreneurial earnings by between 10 and 40 %, reversing the fortunes of the entrepreneur such that they appear to be earning much more than their counterparts in a wage-earning job. If this adjustment should prove to be appropriate, then there is no obvious reason to increase the incentive for individuals to become entrepreneurs (such as with tax breaks or direct start-up subsidies) in developed countries, and there is reason, instead, to discuss decreasing these subsidies.","[Astebro, Thomas] HEC Paris, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris,"Åstebro, T (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France.",astebro@hec.fr,,,HEC Foundation; HEC Leadership Center,HEC Foundation; HEC Leadership Center,Support from HEC Foundation and the HEC Leadership Center are gratefully acknowledged.,,29,17,22,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using a change in the legal environment in Delaware as an exogenous event, we document that a subset of firms with a relatively longer term focus (innovative firms) benefit from ATPs. Particularly, these firms experience an increase in Tobin's Q following a state law change in Delaware that increases the effectiveness of ATPs in defending against hostile takeovers. This increase is greater than that for non-innovative firms in Delaware as well as for innovative firms outside Delaware. Furthermore, the innovative firms in Delaware experience a stronger positive market reaction around the state law change dates, relative to other firms. Finally, in a cross-sectional setting we find that innovative firms with above-average takeover protection outperform other firms and are less likely to engage in harmful real earnings management. Taken together, these results provide empirical evidence of potential benefits of ATPs and help explain why such protection continues to be prevalent in the United States. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this urging, schools across the country continue to start well before that time. A common argument against the change is potential negative impacts on working household members. Using data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), this paper therefore examines the potential impacts of nationally standardizing school start time at 8:30 AM with a focus on household members who give children rides to/from school and their travel patterns before and after escorting children. In addition to estimating the number of household members and workers that may be directly affected by delayed school start time, the paper examines through multinomial logit and probit models the individual and household characteristics of children who take rides from household members and the workers who may be adversely affected by delayed school start time of household children. Analysis showed that around 4% of the country's population may have to adjust their trips before and after escorting children to/from school. Around 65% of them are workers. A comparison of adversely affected workers with other workers revealed that the delay of school start time is not likely to have disparate impacts on disadvantaged populations, but the impacts may be more significant in some regions of the country than others.

Both macro (country level) and micro (project level) determinants are considered. The paper employs a variety of econometric techniques to examine evaluation data for countries in the Asia-Pacific from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for period 1970-2010. At the macro level, the rate of per capita income growth is positively associated with aid project and program success. Aid interventions are found to have a lower probability of success in the Pacific and, surprisingly, in countries with higher levels of democracy. There is little association between project and program ratings and the level of governance. At the micro level, projects are more likely to be successful than programs, as are larger aid interventions. Interventions which received less funding than anticipated, possibly due to capacity constraints, are found to have a lower probability of success. Despite these statistically significant findings, both macro and micro variables contribute very little to the explanatory power of models explaining the variation in project and program outcomes. The paper concludes that the ADB should reconsider its performance based aid allocation model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the area of bank capital regulation, the general view is that more bank capital is better, irrespective of who provides it. In this paper, we investigate whether the investment horizon of bank capital providers matters for bank performance during the recent financial crisis. We observe that banks with more short-term investor ownership have worse stock returns during the crisis. Further exploration suggests that this is partially because banks with higher short-term investor ownership took more risk prior to the crisis but mainly because they experienced higher selling pressure during the crisis. Our results confirm the economic benefit of bank capital in helping banks to perform better during crises. However, when we decompose bank capital by the nature of its providers, we show that more capital is associated with worse performance when it is provided by short-term institutional investors.

A more appropriate definition is one that controls for the economic vulnerability and human capital of developing countries. Econometric analysis of cross-section and panel data is presented that supports this contention. The paper also contends that performance and exogenous economic shocks are likely to be pro-cyclical. This implies a double punishment when aid is allocated according to performance. Evidence of such punishment is also provided.

The application of the methodology is tested in four streets in the Spanish city of Seville, following a retailer survey to collect all the relevant data. The results provided by the application in terms of number and location of loading zones are simulated together with other scenarios with different numbers of loading zones, and the outcomes are compared with the existing situation. The new methodology results in an improvement in the level of service provided with a similar - or smaller - number of loading zones, but most importantly causes a significant reduction in the distances between loading zone parking spaces and final destinations.

J,"Rocaboy, Y",,,,"Rocaboy, Yvon",,,Competition Among National Football Leagues. Does It Exist? Should We Regulate?,SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BALANCE,"It is often supposed that the stakeholders of a national football league draw more satisfaction from their sport if the league is balanced, that is, if a large number of clubs have a reasonable chance of winning. This is the so-called Competitive balance hypothesis. This hypothesis can be challenged, however, in the context of international competition like the European champions league. It could be that the utility of national leagues' stakeholders would be higher if the probability of victory for their nation's club at the international level were higher. If this were the case, a league's governing body intending to maximize the quality of the national league by making use of redistributive schemes would face a trade-off between national competitive balance and international performance of the national representative club. We propose a simple microeconomic framework to model this trade-off. If a non-cooperative game exists among the national league governing bodies, whether it is a Nash or a Stackelberg one, this game would result in inefficient redistributive policies. We find soft' empirical evidence of such a competition among the big 5 football leagues in Europe. This result supports the idea of the creation of an international regulatory body. We derive the conditions under which the international regulatory body should ensure that the leagues' governing bodies implement redistributive schemes guaranteeing the respect of the national competitive balance. We also emphasize the risk of experiencing a drop in the quality of leagues if one of them becomes too big relatively to the others, what we call the tragedy of the wealthy.","[Rocaboy, Yvon] CNRS, CREM, Paris, France; [Rocaboy, Yvon] Univ Rennes 1, Rennes, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes,"Rocaboy, Y (通讯作者)，CNRS, CREM, Paris, France.;Rocaboy, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, Rennes, France.",,,,,,,,13,6,7,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We incorporate health-damaging pollution into a three period overlapping generations model in which life expectancy, fertility and economic growth are all endogenous. We show that environmental factors can cause significant changes to the economy's demographics. In particular, the entrepreneurial choice of less polluting production processes, induced by a tax on emissions, can at some point in time lead to such changes as higher longevity and lower fertility rates. Thus, we provide a novel explanation on the positive relation between fertility rates and pollution. According to this, the causality on this relation may also work from the latter to the former. Furthermore, our model can account for the empirically observed N-shaped correlation between pollution and income per capita.","[Varvarigos, Dimitrios] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Astley Clarke Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Zakaria, Intan Zanariah] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Jalan Gombak, Kuala Lumpur 53100, Selangor, Malaysia",University of Leicester; International Islamic University Malaysia,"Varvarigos, D (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Astley Clarke Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",dv33@le.ac.uk,,"Varvarigos, Dimitrios/0000-0003-0337-9493",,,,,55,4,4,3,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Using high-frequency panel data from northern Ethiopia, this study attempts to quantify seasonal fluctuations in children's weights. Consistent with earlier studies, we document considerable seasonality in children's age and height adjusted weights. While children located closer to local food markets are better nourished compared to their counterparts residing farther away, their weights are also subject to considerable seasonality. Further analysis shows that children located closer to food markets consume more diverse diets than those located farther away but the content of the diet varies across seasons. This leads us to conclude that households located near these food markets are not able to insulate their children from seasonal weight fluctuations.

The first quarter of 2017 in Indonesia saw resilient GDP growth, moderate inflation, stable exchange rates, an increase in the growth of non-oil exports, and an investment upgrade from ratings agency Standard & Poor's. Investment growth, however, did not pick up enough to drive overall growth to a higher rate. The poor quality of banking-sector assets and the gaps in tax revenuedespite the fulfilment of the government's tax-amnesty programare two of the most immediate economic concerns. President Joko Widodo (Jokowi), who is well into the second half of his term, is under pressure to deliver on his development platform, which includes making progress in sustainable development and climate change mitigation. The effective management of forests is key to this platform. There has been longstanding tension over Indonesia's forests between the protection of environmental values, including carbon storage, and the production of valuable commodities, including timber, palm oil, and pulpwood, which generate revenue and employment. We survey recent developments in four storylines related to forestry and climate change: first, Indonesia's commitment to reducing emissions to 29%-41% below projected business-as-usual levels by 2030, as well as the international climate agreements and finance that can help achieve this commitment; second, land-use rights and regulations, including a moratorium on clearing, draining, or setting fires on peatland; third, measures to prevent catastrophic forest fires like those during the 2015 El Nino, including the establishment of the Peatland Restoration Agency; and, fourth, the actions of non-state actors, especially large agribusinesses, in managing forests and peatland. We conclude by discussing differences in the approaches of Jokowi's administration and those of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's administration and by questioning whether Indonesia's budgeted resources, actions, and results to date are commensurate with its climate commitments.","[Alisjahbana, Armida S.] Univ Padjadjaran, Kabupaten Sumedang, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Busch, Jonah M.] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA",Universitas Padjadjaran,"Alisjahbana, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Padjadjaran, Kabupaten Sumedang, Jawa Barat, Indonesia.",,,,ANU Indonesia Project; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation,ANU Indonesia Project; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"We thank interviewees in Jakarta for their time and their generous insights, and members of the Indonesia Study Group at ANU for their helpful comments.

The analysis of the main banking supervision models showed that there are specific features of the banking supervision organization established historically and enshrined in national legislation in each country. Based on the results of the main banking supervision organization models research and its development trends, it was concluded that, irrespective of the model chosen for implementing supervisory functions in the financial sector, the role of central banks in this process would remain key for a long time. The paper substantiates the need for regression analysis when selecting indicators. A mathematical model using different combinations of options indicators of the credit institutions' activities. Mathematical models are made and used for three generalized purposes such as for explanation, prediction and management. To increase the efficiency of banking supervision, the work should be continued on further implementation of internationally recognized banking regulation approaches, including the recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

We consider nonlinear functional forms for the extraction cost and resource demand to develop an empirical Hotelling model with technological progress and stock dependent extraction costs. Using panel data on fourteen nonrenewable natural resources to estimate this empirical Hotelling model, we get qualitatively different results as compared to the related literature. We find evidence of stock-dependent extraction costs for most resources. There is no evidence against the linearity of the optimal extraction rate in the resource stock for almost all resources studied. Furthermore, the Hotelling model may sustain a zero long-run growth rate in resource prices. These results depend on whether firms use different extractive technologies or whether the structural break observed on resource prices is taken into account.","[Atewamba, Calvin] United Nations Univ, Inst Nat Resources Africa, Int House,2nd Floor,Annie Jiagge Rd, Accra, Ghana; [Nkuiya, Bruno] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Atewamba, C (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, Inst Nat Resources Africa, Int House,2nd Floor,Annie Jiagge Rd, Accra, Ghana.",atewamba@unu.edu; bnkuiya@bren.ucsb.edu,"Nkuiya, Bruno/AAB-2497-2020; Atewamba, Calvin/GWU-8149-2022; Nkuiya, Bruno/AAE-5896-2022","Nkuiya, Bruno/0000-0001-6268-3001; Atewamba, Calvin/0000-0001-7609-0397",,,,,14,11,12,4,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find that public expenditure on health care reduces the IMR. Our baseline specification shows that an increase in public health expenditure by 1 per cent of state-level net domestic product is associated with a reduction in the IMR by about nine infant deaths per 1000 live births.

Multinational corporations' existence is based on efficiency derived from setting certain activities in other countries in order to reduce the costs and to access the best resources. Based on efficiency analysis, the company's management also decides which activities will carry out and which activities will be contracted outside the company. The brain drain phenomenon related to the migration of high-skilled labor force from developing countries to developed countries leads to the openness of managers to choose those employees with relevant interpersonal and professional competences. In addition, literature recognizes that the main advantage of internationalization comes from employee diversity and creativity that lead to innovation and development of the companies. The purpose of this article is to analyze the dynamics of Romanian graduates' required competences due to the development of multinationals. The conclusion includes a comparison of students' expectations regarding their future career and their perception of the required competences for high-skilled employees. In addition, this paper highlights the importance of students' practical experience for their future career and the availability of graduates to take part in trainee programs in the home country or abroad.

The present experimental study aims at investigating possible differences in moral judgement between students of Economics at their first year and students at the end of university training. This population has been compared to a similar group of students of the School of Psychology. Also the weight of religiosity and gender has been taken into consideration. Results show that gender and academic seniority can directly drive moral decision making, while the fact to be enrolled in different academic courses (i.e. Economics vs. Psychology) can probably only indirectly modulate this behavior. In fact, the analysis of type of answer (i.e. the evaluation concerning the appropriateness of the action depicted in each dilemma) showed that females are more inclined toward a claim of inappropriateness of moral scenarios than males. Moreover it has been seen that students in their 5th year tend to spend less time in reading dilemmas and thus they decide quickly to pass immediately to the answering phase. More specifically, it appeared that females and students of Economics showed to be the readiest to answer to the dilemma. Finally, with respect to the time spent in responding to dilemmas again students at the 5th year were faster to decide (and to answer) about the moral appropriateness of the scenario depicted in the dilemma. These results confirm some effects already known in the literature, and suggest some newly observed differences between samples under investigation. Some explanations to these phenomena will be put forward and discussed in a critical way.","[D'Aurizio, Giulia; Peracchia, Sara; Curcio, Giuseppe] Univ Aquila, Sch Psychol, Laquila, Italy; [Santoboni, Fabrizio; Porretta, Pasqualina] Sapienza Univ Rome, Sch Econ, Rome, Italy; [Vento, Gianfranco A.] Regent Univ, Sch Business & Management, London, England",University of L'Aquila; Sapienza University Rome,"D'Aurizio, G (通讯作者)，Univ Aquila, Sch Psychol, Laquila, Italy.",giulia.daurizio@gmail.com; fabrizio.santoboni@uniroma1.it; sara.peracchia@gmail.com; pasqualina.porretta@uniroma1.it; ventog@regents.ac.uk; giuseppe.curcio@univaq.it,"Curcio, Giuseppe/M-1635-2014; porretta, pasqualina/Z-1456-2018; PORRETTA, Pasqualina/AAD-2148-2021","porretta, pasqualina/0000-0001-8361-1832; PORRETTA, Pasqualina/0000-0001-8361-1832",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,552,563,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900034,0

The author shows how regulatory and structural weaknesses in the Chinese dairy sector may prompt escape investment and how outsider firms might use such a strategy to regain competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach - The paper develops and refines an important international business concept which has received very little research attention, within the setting of an industry study. Findings - The concept of escape FDI is critiqued and extended to consider cases where discrimination occurs and industry restructuring triggers escape FDI. Research limitations/implications - The discussion is based on a single industry and home country. Further work to develop and test these ideas in a broader context is needed. Practical implications - The author identifies the conditions most likely to trigger escape FDI as well as firm and home country characteristics favouring such a strategy. Originality/value - The author extends the concept of escape FDI in the context of government-driven structural reform and political discrimination creating favoured insider firms and disadvantaged outsiders.","[Enderwick, Peter] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Management, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Enderwick, P (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Management, Auckland, New Zealand.",peter.enderwick@aut.ac.nz,,,,,,,51,11,12,1,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

It offers a tentative framework that explains how democratic regression is likely to continue by virtue of the further mainstreaming of conservative Islamic morality and reactionary hyper-nationalism in Indonesian political discourse and practice. It contends that such mainstreaming has been a growing feature of intraoligarchic competition in Indonesia, the effect of which is to accentuate longstanding illiberal features within Indonesian democracy. While the article focuses on the conflicts surrounding the highly polarising and emotive Jakarta gubernatorial election of 2017 in order to expand on this framework, other controversies are also discussed, including those regarding corruption eradication and continuing impediments to a national reconciliation' with former Indonesian communists. Developments in Indonesia are set against a global background characterised by growing threats to liberal democracy and the emergence of anti-pluralist political impulses in a range of societies. Tulisan ini mengemukakan argumen bahwa tahun 2017 adalah tahun kemunduran demokrasi di Indonesia. Penulis menawarkan sebuah kerangka pemikiran tentatif untuk menjelaskan bagaimana kemunduran demokrasi mungkin akan berlanjut akibat semakin kuatnya pengaruh nilai-nilai moral Islam konservatif dan hiper-nasionalisme reaksioner dalam praktik dan diskursus politik di Indonesia. Menguatnya nilai-nilai ini tidak terlepas dari kompetisi oligarki di Indonesiasebagai salah satu dampaknya, sikap anti-kebebasan yang sudah lama ada dalam demokrasi Indonesia kembali menonjol. Tulisan ini berfokus pada konflik-konflik seputar pilkada DKI Jakarta yang sangat terpolarisasi dan sarat emosi. Namun, untuk memperluas kerangka diskusi, penulis juga membahas berbagai kontroversi lain, termasuk isu pemberantasan korupsi dan terhalangnya proses rekonsiliasi' nasional dengan sejumlah pihak yang pada masa lalu mendukung komunisme di Indonesia. Pembangunan di Indonesia dibahas dengan latar belakang global bangkitnya perlawanan terhadap demokrasi liberal serta munculnya dorongan-dorongan politik anti-pluralis di berbagai lingkungan masyarakat.","[Hadiz, Vedi R.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Hadiz, VR (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,51,53,52,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Furthermore, when analysing millennials' willingness to pay, variables such as prior experience and previous comparisons between price & rating should be considered. These results may help hotel managers to understand the importance of online reputation in regards to Millennials' booking behaviour and which factors influence on it. Moreover, provides hotel professionals with the status quo in willingness to pay more for hotels' better online rating.","[Hernandez-Maskivker, Gilda; Rauch, Andre] Ramon Llull Univ, Sch Tourism & Hospitality Management St Ignasi, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull,"Hernandez-Maskivker, G (通讯作者)，Ramon Llull Univ, Sch Tourism & Hospitality Management St Ignasi, Barcelona, Spain.",gilda.hernandez@htsi.url.edu; andre.rauch@gmail.com,"Hernandez-Maskivker, Gilda/ABH-2192-2020","Hernandez-Maskivker, Gilda/0000-0002-1453-4885",,,,,32,0,0,2,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-11-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,633,640,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0GY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000490868000047,0

The main reason for the increase in beef producer prices is the high input cost and drought, leading to excessive culling of breeding herds among commercial farmers. Johansen multivariate test of co-integration and multivariate vector error correction model are used to investigate the price adjustment and the existence of long-run relationship among the beef prices at various stages of the value chain. The results show that the beef cattle prices are integrated and exhibit a long run relationship. Formal (for grade A) and informal (grade C) beef cattle prices suggest that they adjust to long-run equilibrium at different speeds. For instance, prices in the formal markets adjust to disequilibrium at about 81 per cent, while prices in informal markets adjust to disequilibrium at 63 per cent. Granger causality results indicates the log price of grade C beef cattle in the informal market does not cause Granger log price of grade A beef cattle in the formal market, log of wholesale beef price of grade A beef and log of export beef price of grade A unidirectional at the 1 per cent level of significance. The adjustment can be attributed to the objectives and the nature beef markets understudy, coupled to the lack of efficient price information linkages between formal and informal beef cattle markets.","[Kalundu, Kennedy Sean] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Meyer, Ferdi] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Bur Food & Agr Policy BFAP, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Kalundu, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",skkalundu@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,1,,,,,53,66,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1283242,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EO1XP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396491500005,0

However, some argue that non-accounting financial experts, compared to accounting financial experts, are not sufficient to ensure audit committee effectiveness because the former lack accounting knowledge. Accounting experts on audit committees may require higher audit efforts, while auditors may assess audit committees with accounting financial experts as effective, decreasing audit efforts. This paper first inspects the effect of audit committee accounting expertise on audit fees as a proxy for audit efforts, and then investigates whether the effect is moderated by powerful CEOs. Using post-SOX period data, our results show that, on average, firms with accounting experts on audit committees are more likely to pay higher audit fees, and the effect is less pronounced when a powerful CEO manages a firm.","[Kim, Hyungtae] Arkansas State Univ, Coll Business, State Univ, AR 72467 USA; [Lim, Youngdeok] Univ New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia; [Kwak, Byungjin; Yu, Jaeyoon] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Finance & Accounting, Daejeon, South Korea",Arkansas State University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Arkansas State Univ, Coll Business, State Univ, AR 72467 USA.",hkim@astate.edu,"Lim, Youngdeok/Q-9943-2019; Kwak, Byungjin/C-1682-2011; Yu, Jaeyoon/AAL-6147-2021","Yu, Jaeyoon/0000-0001-6958-3353; Lim, Youngdeok/0000-0002-3715-2927",,,,,41,19,21,3,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

It is, therefore, understandable that it tries to search for trade partners outside of these traditional markets, which would subsequently allow it to reduce its own economic dependence from the EU and Russia. One of these potential trade partners for Ukraine is China that is one of the world's leading economies of the 21st century. The range of areas, in which Ukraine and China cooperate, is constantly being expanded. Historical development confirms that China is particularly interested in the Ukrainian agricultural sector. An important milestone in further development of Ukraine-China relations is Ukraine's participation in the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, by which the Chinese government intends to connect and transform transportation corridors in the EU, Africa, Central Asia or the Middle East, in a way that would facilitate a transfer of Chinese goods to their final consumers and reduce the time needed for such a transfer. The research paper analyses the development of trade relations between Ukraine and China in a historical context and scrutinises the presence of Chinese investments in Ukraine. Subsequently, the paper also analyses Ukraine's role and significance for the OBOR initiative and highlights potential consequences that it brings for the future of Ukraine's relations with China.","[Kralovicova, Michaela; Zatko, Matus] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Královicová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",mk.kralovicova@gmail.com; zatko.matus@gmail.com,,,VEGA [1/0897/17],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is the result of the VEGA project No. 1/0897/17 The importance of European energy union project for strategic interests of this grouping in the context of the enhancement of competitiveness of the Slovak Republic (2017 - 2019).,,15,0,0,0,5,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4429-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,256,265,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP5LI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000556157800031,0

The theoretical framework for this study is built from two streams of literature. The first part elucidates the concept of luxury and further introduces the three dimensions of luxury brands based on previous research: the functional, the experiential and the symbolic. In the second part semiotics is applied to explain the structure of brand meanings, and the model of interactive transfer among three elements-the culture, the brand and the individual-is introduced to demonstrate how these brand meanings are co-created in the marketplace. The qualitative data was generated through the projective Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (later ZMET) in China. Based on the various and heterogeneous brand meanings that respondents associated with luxury fashion brands, eight meaning orientations were formed, which organize respondents' beliefs and emotions towards the luxury fashion brands. The interpretive repertoire of Chinese respondents extends the meanings far beyond the ones that brands have created by themselves and those that have been recognized by prior research. This shows considerable sophistication and dedication from the consumers in the interpretation and co-creation of brand meanings. The findings may assist brand managers in developing global brand strategies that are sensitive to local differences and focus on creating personally meaningful brand experiences.","[Lahtinen, Sonja; Tuominen, Pekka] Univ Tampere, Sch Management, Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Tuominen, P (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Sch Management, Tampere, Finland.",sonja.lahtinen@uta.fi; pekka.tuominen@uta.fi,,,,,,,45,0,0,1,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-50164-2; 978-3-319-50163-5,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,6.0,,,,,,193,209,,10.1007/978-3-319-50164-2_11,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4WA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464091900011,0

In the information age, in the general context of quality-oriented education, the traditional teaching methods in colleges and universities can no longer meet the requirements of society in terms of both the quality and quantity of talents. The arrival of the Internet Plus Era is an important opportunity for the reform of higher education.

With the development of the times and the progress of science and technology, various changes are taking place in our work and life. Colleges and universities, at the forefront of new technologies, are most sensitive to these changes. Yet, they are relatively backward in educational methods owing to historical reasons, limited conditions and guidance of outdated educational concepts. In recent years, many scholars and men of insight have realized the seriousness of problems and have done some constructive and innovative work both in theory and practice, which, on the whole, have produced very satisfactory results. One of the innovative and forward-looking achievements is the advancement of teaching means in the context of the Internet Plus Era.

We study anchoring, defined as the central bank's ability to manage expectations, by paying special attention to the impact of the ECB inflation target and ECB inflation projections on inflation expectations. Our analysis indicates that in the post-crisis period longer-term inflation expectations have become somewhat more sensitive to shorter-term ones and to actual HICP inflation. We also find that the ECB inflation projections have recently become more important for short- and medium-term expectations of professional forecasters and at the same time the role of the ECB inflation target for those expectations has diminished. Overall, our analysis suggests that in recent years inflation expectations in the euro area have shown some signs of de-anchoring.","[Lyziak, Tomasz] Narodowy Bank Polski, Ul Bwietokrzyska 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland; [Paloviita, Maritta] Bank Finland, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Narodowy Bank Polski; Bank of Finland,"Paloviita, M (通讯作者)，Bank Finland, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",Tomasz.Lyziak@nbp.pl; Maritta.Paloviita@bof.fi,,"Lyziak, Tomasz/0000-0002-0488-4259",,,,,47,33,36,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Therefore, from the perspective of English teaching, it is helpful for us to further promote the development of Sino foreign cooperative education program and promote the training mode of internationalized talents.","[Ma, Haiying; Cai, Rangjia] Northwest Minzu Univ, Sch Econ, Lanzhou 730124, Gansu, Peoples R China",Northwest Minzu University,"Ma, HY (通讯作者)，Northwest Minzu Univ, Sch Econ, Lanzhou 730124, Gansu, Peoples R China.",lxmahaiying8888@163.com; 522766108@qq.com,,,USU [2017XJZYZHGGSD-01]; NWUN [2017XJZYZHGGSD-01]; Northwest Minzu University [2017XJJG-12],USU; NWUN; Northwest Minzu University,"This work was supported by the Pilot project of comprehensive professional reform of International Economics and Trade (Joint Program, USU and NWUN) (Grant No:2017XJZYZHGGSD-01) and by Research project on education and teaching reform (Grant No:2017XJJG-12) of the Northwest Minzu University.",,8,0,0,1,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,922,926,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200189,0

Unfortunately, their share on total municipal revenues is low. In this paper the position of municipal own revenues in the municipal budget is compared to other revenue budget items. The evolution of municipal budget items in question is influenced by several factors. The implementation of fiscal decentralization (in two phases with beginnings in 2001 and 2005) as the most accentuated factor is accompanied and mainly affected by the financial crisis coming in 2009. The financial crisis tested the robustness of the sub-national financial system and it is obvious that the low financial autonomy of municipal government units observed in the period of 2000 - 2016 persists. Results show, that the main part of tax revenues is consisting in the revenues from shared tax. The share of own tax revenues on total municipal revenues is low despite of total tax revenues create in average 40% of total municipal revenues. Non tax-revenues of municipalities in the SR create in average 17% of total municipal revenues in monitored period from 2000 to 2016. The composition of municipal non-tax revenues is unstable in time. Positively could be evaluated the increase of the share of revenues from entrepreneurship and administration fees on total municipal non-tax revenues.","[Malicka, Lenka] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Malická, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",lenka.malicka@tuke.sk,"Malicka, Lenka/AAH-4283-2019",,project VEGA [1/0559/16],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"The paper is published within the project VEGA no. 1/0559/16 Indebtedness of local municipalities of Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary and its impact on financing of public services.",,16,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,499,507,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700052,0

The firms' behaviour is studied here in two alternative scenarios: (i) a protected domestic market, and (ii) a non discriminated domestic market (i.e. absence of trading cost etc across the border). In the first scenario, we argue that a higher degree of competition in the domestic market encourages exports when advanced technology prevails and vice versa. Similar effects are noticed in the second scenario. These propositions are analysed both theoretically and empirically.","[Marjit, Sugata] Ctr Studies Social Sci, R-1, Kolkata 700094, W Bengal, India; [Ray, Moushakhi] Salesian Coll, Don Bosco Rd, Siliguri 734001, W Bengal, India",,"Ray, M (通讯作者)，Salesian Coll, Don Bosco Rd, Siliguri 734001, W Bengal, India.",marjit@gmail.com; rmoushakhi@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,7,7,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

For financing the universally available care, we should stick to proven public finance methods with respect to the specifics of health care sector. That way the valuable properties of Czech health system such as general accessibility and social responsiveness could be preserved.

Insights about job attributes attractiveness as well as their impact on job satisfaction lead to a more transparent environment in which employers and employees can make better-informed decisions and redesign the professional environment, resulting in increased job satisfaction, performance and career sustainability. For this purpose, a survey was undertaken from August 2013 to February 2015 through a questionnaire examining the preferences and perception of employees (N=229) regarding job characteristics. The theoretical background of the study is Warr's vitamin model, which assumes non-linear relationships between job characteristics and job satisfaction. The strongest connections with job satisfaction among employees are with future prospects and conflict between work-and-family. The study is one of the first of its kind to provide a detailed overview of job satisfaction of different groups of employees in German horticulture.","[Meyerding, Stephan G.

Customer behaviour has changed over the last ten years since technology and its use became part of our daily life. In this new environment, retailers must react and re-examine their strategies. The choice of certain channels for purchasing products, is a complex process and depends on many different factors like acceptance of technology, perceived security, flexibility and many others. Nowadays retailers are overthinking their strategy and looking for a combination of online and offline channels or specializing in one. The article is showing how customer behaviour changed through influence of internet and usage of mobile devices. Customers are using different channels while gathering information, the actual purchase process and the post selling process. Retailing changed in the last decades and the success story of the internet redrafted the retailing from the classic brick-and-mortar retailers to worldwide acting and selling concerns. Nowadays for SMEs the need of an online shop is an important decision and is one of the big questions. It is difficult for companies to understand and explain channel choice for purchase of consumers. The aim of this article is to the different motivations of consumers are having for shopping online vs brick-and-mortar shop or shopping using an omnichannel approach. The research was accomplished by a comprehensive literature review and comparison of common models in the field, comparing consumer and shopping behaviour. In the article, it will be shown that there are many different motivations and factors, like acceptance and use of Technology to choose the channel of purchasing products, like personal innovativeness, perceived security, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, products and many others. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. The results of different studies provide converging evidence and show that online-offline channel integration lead to a competitive advantage and channel synergies rather than channel cannibalization.","[Nendwich, Michael] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Nendwich, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,16,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,398,406,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400040,0

Governments were forced to bailout or inject huge sums of money sometimes in form of guarantees that significantly increased the sovereign risk. Since then many academics, regulators and professionals alike have committed in closing this gap. The analysis of the paper is conducted by literature survey as well as regulator's documentation and market analysis. First this paper analyses the various definitions of systemic risks and systemic events; and its implications in relation to Latvia as small open economy where different status quo persists than the large G8 economies. Afterwards paper develops cause identifier with distinct agents (banks/financial institutions, depositors, the regulator, market itself). The final part of paper deals with consequences of systemic risk in form of fire sales, deterioration of value of balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet positions, loss in confidence that turns into higher interest rates, market freezes that have the ability to slow down the whole economy, broken interbank linkages and shadow banking expansion. Causes and consequences are analysed in relation to situation in Latvia during 2007-2013 and several causes like asset bubbles (housing market), deposit insurance, limited liability by financial institutions and moral hazard problems to name a few are identified.","[Petrovska, Kristine] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Petrovska, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,417,426,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400042,0

It contains only one school Gymnasium, Frylant nad Ostravici, which shows extremely high values in the income of a subsidy from the Erasmus Programme. From the point of the obtained financial resources, the most similar schools in the region are two schools (Gymnasium and Commercial Academy in Orlova and Grammar Secondary School in Ostrava-Hrabiwka). This is also clear from the results of the cluster analysis. On the other hand, about 8 schools (grammar schools) are the least similar from a total of 29.

The amount of time the city cat or other pet operates in the absence of people, leads to activities that are not adequately documented. Generally, the research of behavior of urban cats lacks data and it is difficult to obtain it. City cat is considered a senior municipal predator and its impact on the ecosystem is always essential. There are a number of collars for pets (dogs, cats, etc.) available on the market, which allow monitoring of movement in an outdoor environment (mainly using GPS technology). What is missing is the ability to track reliably inside buildings and rooms. There are a number of ways to visualize movement inside buildings. Display modes can be divided into two main groups, namely three-dimensional and two dimensional views. This paper discusses the visualization options in two dimensions.

Judging from the three regions, comprehensive technical efficiency in the eastern region is the highest while that of the central region is the lowest.

In order to measure and evaluate the youth awareness on agriculture the index of agricultural awareness was used which encompasses seven thematic areas connected with agriculture including the meaning of agriculture, rural policy, the influence of agriculture on the natural environment, information concerning plant and animal production, processing and food marketing. The statistical analysis of the studied material encompassed aggregate statistical indicators as well as the non-parametric test chi square. Apart from the primary sources they also used secondary sources which encompassed both domestic as well as foreign literature. The completed studies among Polish students enabled the identification of factors determining and diversifying the level of agricultural awareness of this group of respondents. The determinants included gender, faculty, abode and the fact of the respondents or their parents having a farm. A higher level of agricultural awareness was characterised by men, students of technical faculties, people from rural areas as well as the respondents who run a farm. The thematic area which requires urgent educational actions is the issue concerning the influence of agriculture on the natural environment. In this case students marked the most wrong answers.

In contrast to the extant evidence that futures leads in fundamental-driven price movements, the authors show the dominance of the crossing in the index in continuing the price trend after the crossing. Even when synchronized crossings occur, the index rises more than the index futures during upward crossings, whereas the index futures falls more than the index during downward crossings. While volatility is significantly reduced before upward crossings, but not for downward crossings, it is significantly higher during the crossing, and significantly lower after the crossings in both markets.

This abnormal return is robust to risk adjustment using standard asset pricing models.

The British rail network has seen considerable growth of both freight and passenger activity in the last 20 years, leading to concerns about its capacity to absorb continued growth. A number of infrastructure initiatives focused on increasing capacity and reducing conflicts have been implemented. This includes the North Doncaster Chord, opened in June 2014 primarily to provide a more direct route from the port of Immingham to the major Aire Valley power stations (Le. Drax, Eggborough and Fenybridge). The paper analyses the freight impacts of the new chord, focusing on three key operational measures (i.e. train routing, scheduled journey times and train punctuality) during 10-week survey periods before and after the opening of the chord. The analysis is based on real-time data relating to coal and biomass trains operating between Immingham and the three power stations. This is a novel approach as the data have been made publicly available only recently, allowing a detailed investigation of the flows on this corridor at a highly disaggregated level. The use of this empirical method to assess the detailed rail freight operational impacts is an important element in the process of evaluating the effects of network enhancement. The results demonstrate improvements in each of the three operational measures, but also reveal a situation considerably more complex than that suggested by the published material relating to the justification for this new infrastructure.

Because of its traditional mechanism, the incentive mechanism for project managers of state-owned enterprises faces with significant challenges. Because of their work level, political consciousness and working environments, the state-owned enterprise project managers are deemed to be a special group among project managers. Based on the job characteristics model, this paper examines the effect of the specific dimensions of the job characteristics model on the state-owned enterprise project managers' work emotions, work attitudes, work behavior and work role performance through the questionnaire survey, variable correlation analysis and regression analysis. It is finally proved that the JCM-based task design indeed has positive effects on the state-owned enterprise project managers' work behavior and work performance. This is helpful for the state-own enterprises to design incentive models for their project managers and provides valuable implications for enterprises to effectively manage their core project talents and ultimately helps increase the managing efficiency for the government project management and the state-owned enterprise management.","[Yang, Ying] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Int Business Sch, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [He, Lu] Xiamen City Land Dev Corp, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Ma, Feng] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Informat Sch, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Yunnan University of Finance & Economics; Yunnan University of Finance & Economics,"Yang, Y (通讯作者)，Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Int Business Sch, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Ma, F (通讯作者)，Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Informat Sch, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",11476423@qq.com; 84451591@qq.com; 375090618@qq.com,,,YUNFE Project [YC2015D16],YUNFE Project,I want to give my first and special thank you to my friends and colleagues.

Owing to their innovate work, superior talents can create innumerable value more than the company have invented. There, also, are games between provinces in the aspects of attracting and developing technological talents. The more contentment that these technological talents receive from governmental policies, the more appealing these provinces seem. Besides, technological talents are likely to concern about chronic disease, which will degrade the quality of their life and work. Fundamental endowment insurance and medical insurance, however, fail to appeal to them. In this paper, first, according to the different property and distinct development progress, we classify the technological innovational talents and point out the characters TIAA-CREF, and put forward the feasible scheme of the government to provide insurance guarantee for science and technological talents. On the third part, we refer to the content and pricing methods of the high-end commercial insurance of domestic insurance companies, and put forward the pricing of guarantee insurance for technological talents. Finally, the article uses a game model to expound the progress of determining both sides pay scales between government and units, determining the controllable factors and put forward policy Suggestions. Analyzing satisfying and comprehensive commercial insurance system, not only can make governmental policies more magnetic and then enhance the technological competitiveness of the whole province, but also is in favor of companies' human resource management. In this paper shows that we have know the talent recruitment policy, the specific kind of technological talents' health, accident and endowment insurance, including their scale and main problems, by interviewing some insurance companies in and out of Zhejiang province, government department, technological companies. Using normative analysis, we classify the technological talents in sever types and identify the classified standards. Refer to relevant literatures and theories, finding out the existing risk state of different types of science and technological innovational talents, economic security situation and insurable risk. By constructing a theoretical model which is suitable for different types of health science and technological innovational talents, accident and pension, make up the theoretical defects in design of person insurance system and operation mechanism. Through the design of a game model, we find out the control factor that can affect both sides pay scales, and point out a cooperation method to government and units. In the end, synthesizing the commercial insurance demand from technological talents and the policies of attracting talents from the government and companies nowadays, we put forward an specific and practical technological innovational talent insurance system, which is fit for those talents who are in different types and progress.","[Zhang Daijun; Ye Fuying] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, DJ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zdj0303@126.com; 1550865725@qq.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,147,162,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700011,0

This suggests that market participants perceived that bank risk is shared within the euro area.","[Breckenfelder, Johannes; Schwaab, Bernd] European Cent Bank, Financial Res, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Breckenfelder, J (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",johiumes.breckenfelder@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,58,15,15,2,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

This finding is puzzling because downgrades, especially substantial ones, often include lending restrictions and thus would be expected to have a strong effect on real activity. We use the local projections approach to investigate whether this anomaly can be explained by nonlinearities or asymmetric effects; our empirical results indicate that they are indeed present. In particular, we find that the effects are asymmetric: bank downgrades lead to a pronounced decline in real activity, while upgrades do not result in its increase. Furthermore, we document the presence of nonlinear effects for the downgrade-but not upgrade-shocks, as their impact increases disproportionately with its size. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a new dataset covering the years 2006-2015, we find evidence supporting the notion that local banks extend a helping hand to SMEs and act in this role efficiently. We establish that SMEs operating in regions where local banks hold a relatively strong position suffer losses less frequently, accumulate lower losses in relation to equity capital, report shorter series of losses, have a lower probability of legal bankruptcy or serious financial distress, and recover more easily from financial difficulties. Therefore, our study suggests that policies shaping the local structures of banking markets have a material impact on distressed SMEs' prospects.","[Iwanicz-Drozdowska, Malgorzata] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Finance, Warsaw, Poland; [Jackowicz, Krzysztof; Kozlowski, Lukasz] Kozminski Univ, Dept Banking Insurance & Risk, Jagiellonska 57, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Kozminski University,"Kozlowski, L (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Banking Insurance & Risk, Jagiellonska 57, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland.",kjtrist@kozminski.edu.pl,"Iwanicz-Drozdowska, Malgorzata/AAI-6707-2020; Kozłowski, Łukasz/I-6015-2015","Iwanicz-Drozdowska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-8490-5178; Kozłowski, Łukasz/0000-0002-2887-9067; Jackowicz, Krzysztof/0000-0002-9891-530X","Polish National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki) [2016/23/B/HS4/01876, UMO-2016/23/B/HS4/01876]",Polish National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki),"Krzysztof Jackowicz and Lukasz Kozlowski acknowledge the financial support provided by the Polish National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki), project number 2016/23/B/HS4/01876, contract number UMO-2016/23/B/HS4/01876, entitled Decyzje lokalizacyjne dotyczace placowek bankowych - konsekwencje dla bankow i lokalnej aktywnosci gospodarczej.",,42,9,10,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1566-0141,1873-6173,,EMERG MARK REV,Emerg.

J,"Jorgensen, PL",,,,"Jorgensen, Peter Lochte",,,An analysis of the Solvency II regulatory framework's Smith-Wilson model for the term structure of risk-free interest rates,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Solvency II; Financial regulation; Term structure of interest rates; Calibration; Market valuation,,"In the European Union financial regulation requires that life and pension (L&P) companies use the Smith and Wilson (2000) model for the term structure of risk-free interest rates when valuing their liabilities and long term guarantees. Some key features of this model are that it allows for a perfect fit to market observed bond prices, and that its extrapolated long rates converge towards a constant level, the Ultimate Forward Rate (UFR). Both this level and the rate at which convergence towards it takes place are directly specified via parameters of the model. Since the Smith-Wilson model is not one of finance theory's standard term structure models, we introduce the model and summarize its most important mathematical properties. We also describe how the European Solvency II regulation came to embrace this particular model. The paper moves on to document how the regulation also imposes quite detailed and tight restrictions on how the Smith-Wilson model should be parameterized and applied. We argue that many of these implementation instructions - one of which is the regulator's specification of a very high UFR - seem biased in the same direction and that this could indicate a systematic attempt to lift the term structure curve up and away from its true location whereby artificially high discount rates are induced. The result of the bias is not only significant undervaluation of L&P liabilities but also a peculiar contradiction of the Solvency II overall objective of enhancing financial stability and of protecting policyholders via the promotion of economic valuation in accordance with market consistent principles. The paper's analysis is accompanied by valuation illustrations based on data on the liability composition of an actual medium-sized Danish pension fund. The results suggest that the undervaluation of liabilities resulting from use of the regulation compliant Smith-Wilson model can be massive compared to results obtained from some alternative and more freely calibrated models.

Furthermore, later polling data (January-March 2016) suggests that while Trump (who achieved less than 50% of the total Republican primary vote) was the Plurality Winner, he could have been beaten in pairwise contests by at least one other candidate and may have been the Condorcet Loser.

On average, we find that investors' attention to a merging firm increases as the announcement date approaches, peaks on the announcement day, and remains elevated for a few days afterward. More importantly, abnormal attention on the day of the announcement has a heterogeneous relationship with post-announcement abnormal returns, which depends on the amount of news coverage received by the merging firm. The relationship is positive for mergers with higher news coverage and appears to be due to positive price pressure induced by retail investors. In contrast, the relationship is negative for mergers with low news coverage and is likely due to faster assimilation of new information by relatively more sophisticated investors who anticipate that the market generally overvalues M&A transactions.

The arrival of low cost carriers (LCC), with cheaper air fares, greatly leveraged the tourist flow around the world. However, as argued by some authors, if the destination is unique the importance of accessibility could be less relevant. Using quarterly data from 2000 to 2015, the paper assesses the effect of LCC on tourism demand focusing on Brussels. The peculiarity of Brussels comes from the high concentration of European and International institutions located in the city, which makes it a very interesting and singular case of research. Results reveal that LCC per se have a smaller positive effect on tourism demand for business purpose than the specific characteristic of Brussels. Indeed, the presence of European institutions complements the higher availability of low air fares, especially for business travellers.","[Santos, Anabela; Cincera, Michele] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, ICite, CP146,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Cincera, Michele] ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Solvay SA; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Santos, A (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, ICite, CP146,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",asantos@ulb.ac.be; mcincera@ulb.ac.be,,"Santos, Anabela/0000-0003-1079-0395",,,,,43,21,21,1,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Islamic rural banks are also tend set high margins when they do not diversify their revenue, referring to the cross-subsidization strategy. We also find that the impact of competition and diversification on bank margins are more pronounced in the banks with lower bank's loan contract diversification and also banks with a higher proportion of profit-and-loss sharing (PLS) lending.

There are various names for this new form: competitive-authoritarian, illiberal democracy, or simply hybrid. Some obvious examples are Hungary, Poland and Turkey. Some connect the origin of hybrids in modern times to the rise of populism. Populism is connected to the illiberal or hybrid idea in that populists tend to repress minorities as a way of appealing to the majority. Authoritarian populists typically divide the population into us versus them. This paper develops a model of how a hybrid can arise from democracy. I introduce a strongman or strongwoman as a leader who can implement repression and gain power. I develop a simple model of a hybrid regime in which repression is less than that under dictatorship but greater than that under liberal democracy. The hybrid regime is a special case of Wintrobe's general theory of dictatorship, but it goes further than that by endogenizing equilibrium extremism of the regime as well as repression. I show how the hybrid regime reacts to exogenous shocks, and develop optimal policy for other countries and institutions interested in reducing repression (the UN, US or EU) towards hybrids.","[Wintrobe, Ronald] Western Univ, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Wintrobe, R (通讯作者)，Western Univ, London, ON, Canada.",rwintrob@uwo.ca,,,,,,,19,9,10,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2018,177.0,3-4,,,SI,,217,233,,10.1007/s11127-018-0574-9,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GW2IX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446708000003,0

The hypotheses are proposed based on the integration of theory of planned behavior (TPB) and identity theory-religiosity. Design/methodology/approach The survey method was used to test the proposed hypotheses by using PLS. A total of 296 out of 407 questionnaires were collected among global Moslem students in a big city of Indonesia. Findings The results indicate that perceived behavioral control and religiosity is the significant predictor of the intention to consume halal products in international chain restaurants. Surprisingly, attitudes toward halal products and subjective norms have no significant effects on their intention. Research limitations/implications This study mainly investigates from international students' perspectives, and future studies could diversify the respondents. Further, although the studies were done in the biggest Moslem populated country, conducting a multi-country study further validates the results of this study. Additional variables, such as personality or cross-cultural variables, could enhance the prediction of the developed model. Originality/value This study proposes religiosity as an important predictor of halal products consumption among global consumers, which increases the predictive capability of TPB. The results suggest that it is important for managers and governments all products targeted for global Moslem consumers to be halal certified.","[Asnawi, Nur; Fanani, Muhammad Asnan] Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic Univ Malang, Dept Management, Malang, Indonesia; [Sukoco, Badri Munir] Univ Airlangga, Dept Management, Surabaya, Indonesia",Airlangga University,"Sukoco, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Airlangga, Dept Management, Surabaya, Indonesia.",nurasnawi9@gmail.com; badri@feb.unair.ac.id; ma.fanani@gmail.com,"Fanani, Muhammad Asnan/HKF-1920-2023; Sukoco, Badri Munir/AAD-8880-2019","Fanani, Muhammad Asnan/0000-0003-1571-4439; Sukoco, Badri Munir/0000-0002-0416-1480; Asnawi, Nur/0000-0002-5087-4799",,,,,94,21,21,1,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

A survey of performance variations in 210 African food processors,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food processing industry; African enterprise strategy; Determinants of SME performance; Industrial development policy,FIRM PERFORMANCE; BUSINESS; CAPABILITIES; INVESTMENT; NETWORKING; STRATEGY; ECONOMY; RISE; SMES,"Purpose To understand African small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) performance and its antecedents is essential, both from a strategic management and an industrial development perspective. While a substantial literature on African SMEs has emerged in recent years, studies of their performance specifically are few and inconclusive. The purpose of this paper is to address this lacuna in the literature by examining variations in performance of 210 East African SMEs. Design/methodology/approach The paper employs OLS and logistic regression and Classify k-means test to analyze performance variations in a unique data set of 210 food processing enterprises in Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia. Findings Three generic types of African SMEs are identified based on performance: laggards, followers and gazelles. The gazelles are typically medium-sized, skill-intensive companies selling relatively differentiated products in niche markets. The laggards are typically small, capital-intensive companies involved in grain milling that adopt a cost differentiation strategy. A key driver of variation in performance is found to be the quality of the external business environment (in particular the quality of intermediary markets), and also capability factors such as the strength of management. Strategy factors such as differentiation and political strategies explain performance variations. Practical implications Among the policy implications are that African industrial policy should focus on improving the functioning of intermediary markets, e.g. by reducing the transaction costs of inter-firm collaboration. Moreover, rather than focusing industrial policy on SMEs per se, policymakers should focus on those types of enterprises that are capable of generating high performance, e.g. skill-intensive enterprises with strong managerial capabilities, engaged in differentiation strategies. Originality/value The paper integrates the extant literature on African SME performance, develops an analytical framework for studying it and presents novel empirical insights based on one of the most detailed surveys of SME performance in the continent to date. The findings have important and tangible implications for literature, as well as for industrial policy.","[Hansen, Michael Wendelboe] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Ishengoma, Esther K.] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Sch Business, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Upadhyaya, Radha] Univ Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya",Copenhagen Business School; University of Dar es Salaam; University of Nairobi,"Hansen, MW (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",mwh.msc@cbs.dk; esther.ishengoma@gmail.com; radha@njora.com,,,Danish Development Research Council [11-053CBS],Danish Development Research Council,"Financial support for the research has been provided by the Danish Development Research Council, Grant 11-053CBS.",,80,6,7,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The global trade flows of the BRICS countries have significantly increased during the last one-and-a-half decade. The purpose of this paper is to examine the intra-BRICS and BRICS-EU trade flows. Design/methodology/approach To study the intensity of trade among BRICS countries and with EU, the Trade Intensity Index is employed for the period 2001-2015. Balassa's revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index is computed for the assessment of comparative advantages of exports by BRICS countries in the year 2015 in the global markets. A comparative analysis of export similarity is done for India and other BRICS countries in EU. Findings The findings of trade intensity showed large bilateral trade flows among BRICS member. Russia has emerged as the main trading partner with EU in BRICS. For the year 2015, the comparative study of RCA at HS-two digits and HS-four digits classification highlights marginal structural changes in the export composition of these countries. The analysis revealed that Brazil and Russia have comparative advantages in natural resource-based products, while India and China possessed comparative advantages in manufactured and processed products. The export similarity index shows the presence of competition between India and China in EU. Practical implications This paper highlights the need for closer cooperation to promote intra-BRICS trade and to make structural transformations in the basket of trading products by them to have trade benefits at large. Originality/value Numerous studies are available on bilateral trade of BRICS members. However, limited studies are available to get a holistic view of intra-BRICS trade. This paper is an attempt to examine the BRICS countries trade profile both at global levels and within the group.","[Maryam, Javeria; Mittal, Ashok] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Econ, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Banday, Umer Jeelanie] Cent Univ Haryana, Dept Econ, Sch Arts Humanities & Social Sci, Mahendragarh, India; [Banday, Umer Jeelanie] Dept Commerce, New Delhi, India",Aligarh Muslim University; Central University of Haryana,"Banday, UJ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Haryana, Dept Econ, Sch Arts Humanities & Social Sci, Mahendragarh, India.;Banday, UJ (通讯作者)，Dept Commerce, New Delhi, India.",javeriamaryam117@gmail.com; ubanday@gmail.com; askmittal@yahoo.com,"Banday, Umer Jeelanie/V-8481-2017","Banday, Umer Jeelanie/0000-0002-2714-670X",,,,,29,12,14,9,47,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Our main finding overall is that income or asset diversification does not enhance bank stability. However, there is evidence of a non-linear relationship between non-interest (non-financing) income and stability indicating that banks are able to reduce risk at higher levels of diversification. Conventional banks appear to be more adversely impacted on the risk side than Islamic banks.

This paper assesses the potential global poverty impacts of AMR using a unique macro-micro framework. To estimate poverty effects of AMR, price, wage, and employment results from a dynamic, multi-country, multi-sector computable general equilibrium CGE model are used in a microsimulation model that integrates household surveys from 104 countries. The analysis in this paper advances other studies of AMR in two ways: (1) it links macro results to a microsimulation model to provide insight on poverty impacts for the world economy and countries of different income levels; and (2) it uses a global multi-sector model, rather than an aggregate global model, to generate macroeconomic results with structural details for capturing the economy-wide impact within countries and the spread across countries via trade flows. Relative to a world without AMR, the progression of antimicrobial resistance is expected to make it more difficult to eliminate extreme poverty, potentially adding 24.1 million people to become extremely poor, of whom 18.7 million live in low-income countries. The expected losses during 2015-50 may sum to $85 trillion in gross domestic product and $23 trillion in global exports (in present value). By 2050, the global gross domestic product could deviate negatively by 3.8 percent from the baseline (in the worst-case scenario considered). Because it is a global public bad, the optimal policy response will require global cooperation. The poverty outcomes induced by AMR in all country groups will deteriorate with short-sighted isolationist policies. Moreover, assistance from high-income countries to improve the economic resiliency of lower-income countries will also benefit the higher-income countries and world economy in general.

We endogenously determine the investment scale, investment threshold, optimal coupon and default threshold under managerial discretion. We demonstrate that time-inconsistent managers each have a trade-off between the timing and scale of investment. Among a number of important implications, by exploring agency costs of equity as deviations from the investment and financing policies that maximize equity value, our analysis reveals that a certain degree of time inconsistency in managerial preferences decreases the agency costs of equity. We also find that a naive manager more severely distorts the investment and financing policies than does a sophisticated manager, which leads to higher agency costs of equity. Finally, we document that the impacts of corporate governance variables, such as the managers' property parameter and/or the level of managers' ownership, depend on the managers' beliefs regarding their future time-inconsistent behavior; this prediction provides novel empirical tests.","[Gan, Liu] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Xia, Xin] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yifei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Xia, X (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",ganliu2016@163.com; start0121@126.com; chenyifei02@hotmail.com,,,Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province of China [2018JJ3262]; China Scholarship Fund for Studying Abroad [201706480036],Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); China Scholarship Fund for Studying Abroad,The authors are grateful to the two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Our empirical results suggest that volatility is not always spilled over from the directly affected markets to surrounding markets in crisis periods. The East Asian markets who directly suffered from the Asian currency crisis are the ones to which volatility is spilled over from other markets during the Asian currency crisis period, whereas uni-directional volatility spillovers from the U.S. market to other markets are observed during both crisis periods. This difference can be explained by a pre-determined hierarchy in which volatility spillovers tend to start from the U.S. market regardless of the geographical origin of the crisis. Furthermore, our results reveal that the markets in three major Asian financial hubs, i.e., Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, are the markets to which volatility is spilled over uni-directionally from several other countries during the subprime credit crisis period, but not during the Asian currency crisis period.

We use data from the 2014 World Bank Global Findex and supplement it with macroeconomic indicators of old-age security to investigate the financial security of households across both developed (OECD) and developing (non-OECD) countries with various aging populations. Five fundamental indicators of financial security are examined. Results show an aging effect for all measures. The aging effects are largest for those who report saving for old age. Older age groups living in countries with larger aging populations are more likely to save, regardless of OECD status. Also, those who are female, have less education, and lower incomes are particularly vulnerable, especially those living in developing countries. Further, the financial security of those living in non-OECD countries is significantly more likely to be affected by public pension spending and other key indicators of old-age security. Financial inclusion and technological usage also have a significant and positive impact on financial security. These factors could play a key role in promoting savings and improving financial security in aging populations worldwide. The findings from this study have important policy implications given the pressures that some countries' social support and public transfer systems will face in the coming years.","[Lyons, Angela C.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 440 Mumford Hall,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Grable, John E.] Univ Georgia, Dept Financial Planning Housing & Consumer Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Joo, So-Hyun] Ewha Womans Univ, Div Consumer Studies, Seoul, South Korea",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Ewha Womans University,"Lyons, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 440 Mumford Hall,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",anglyons@illinois.edu; grable@uga.edu; sohyunjoo@ewha.ac.kr,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Grable, John/0000-0001-7093-8510",,,,,62,29,30,5,40,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-828X,2212-8298,,J ECON AGEING,J.

We employ difference-in-differences research design to show that infants born in districts severely affected by the earthquake are 13.8% less likely to complete middle school and 10% less likely to complete high school. Our findings demonstrate that children belonging to high caste groups mitigate the negative environmental shock in the long run. However, infants belonging to low caste groups are 17.6% less likely to complete middle school and 11.9% less likely to complete high school. We also find that male infants exposed to a severe earthquake perform significantly better than their female counterparts, suggesting prospects of gender bias in a patriarchal society.

Competitiveness, as part of the supply side, is addressed in view of the supply-demand correlations, and we consider the attractiveness of tourist destinations from the tourists' perspective as the link between the two sides. For the analysis are selected exactly the 16 countries participating in the 16+1 platform initiated by China in 2011, tourism being one of the components of sectoral cooperation in this framework. We demonstrate that tourism infrastructure (its upgrading and development) is one of the main determinants of tourism competitiveness, even surpassing in importance the tourism assets. In this context, the China factor might play a significant role for the CEE-16 in terms of spurring competitiveness, as it is not antagonistic, but complementary with other determinants of competitiveness, including the EU funds From the perspective of attractiveness, 16+1 cooperation can boost Chinese tourists' arrivals in the region. In order to test these hypotheses, as part of the methodology, the authors calculate a specific travel and tourism competitiveness index (STTCI), starting from the main objectives of the 16+1 cooperation platform, namely prioritization, openness, environmental sustainability, transport infrastructure and specific infrastructure for tourism services. The authors correlate this STTCI with other qualitative indicators and obtain two categories of clusters among the CEE16 countries. In Romania's case, one can remark the following paradox. The cumulative amount of investment in tourism during 2000-2017 is the largest among the CEE-16 countries, corresponding to its tourism assets and the necessity to connect them; however, Romania lags behind most of the analyzed countries in terms of qualitative indicators such as revealed comparative advantage, direct productivity and multiplier effect of GDP. Therefore, the cluster it belongs to does not reflect its real tourism assets.","[Popescu, Delia; Bulin, Daniel; Tanase, Ion Alexandru] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Oehler-Sincai, Iulia Monica] Romanian Acad, Inst World Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Bulin, D (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",daniel.bulin@yahoo.com,"Popescu, Delia/P-1873-2016; Oehler-Sincai, Iulia Monica/AAV-6377-2020","Popescu, Delia/0000-0002-7386-2985; Oehler-Sincai, Iulia Monica/0000-0002-5103-4601; Bulin, Daniel/0000-0001-6649-0784",,,,,34,6,6,3,23,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,833,853,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/833,0.0,,,21,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700002,0

Using panel data (pre- and post-refugee inflow) from Kagera, a rural region of Tanzania, we find that the refugee shock led to women being less likely to engage in employment outside the household and more likely to engage in household chores relative to men. This is probably the result of the environmental degradation that accompanied the arrival of refugees and the additional competition for natural resources such as wood and water. However, the results differ by (pre-shock) literacy and math skill. For women who could read and perform simple written mathematical operations the refugee shock resulted in a higher likelihood of engaging in outside employment. In contrast, higher exposure to the refugee shock resulted in illiterate women being more likely to engage in farming and household chores.","[Ruiz, Isabel] Univ Oxford, Harris Manchester Coll, Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TD, England; [Vargas-Silva, Carlos] Univ Oxford, Ctr Migrat Policy & Soc, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Ruiz, I (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Harris Manchester Coll, Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TD, England.",isabel.ruiz@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Ruiz, Isabel/AAG-4308-2022; Ruiz, Isabel/ACI-7611-2022","Ruiz, Isabel/0000-0002-8195-4943",UNU-WIDER,UNU-WIDER,This paper has received support from UNU-WIDER.,,57,12,12,3,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Yet smallholder farmers and pastoralists are affected by multiple processes of land alienation. Drawing on the case of Tanzania, we illustrate the analytical purchase of a comprehensive examination of dynamics of land alienation across multiple sectors. To begin with, processes of land alienation through investments in agriculture, mining, conservation, and tourism dovetail with a growing social differentiation and class formation. These dynamics generate unequal patterns of land deprivation and accumulation that evolve in a context of continued land dependency for the vast majority of the rural population. Consequently, land alienation engenders responses by individuals and communities seeking to maintain control over their means of production. These responses include migration, land tenure formalization, and land transactions, that propagate across multiple localities and scales, interlocking with and further reinforcing the effects of land alienation. Various localized processes of primitive accumulation contribute to a scramble for land in the aggregate, providing justifications for policies that further drive land alienation.","[Bluwstein, Jevgeniy; Lund, Jens Friis] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, 25 Rolighedsvej, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Lund, Jens Friis] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Askew, Kelly] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, 1085 Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Askew, Kelly; Stein, Howard] Univ Michigan, Dept Afroamer & African Studies, 505 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Noe, Christine] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Geog, POB 35049, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Odgaard, Rie; Maganga, Faustin] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Inst Resource Assessment, POB 35097, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Engstrom, Linda] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, POB 7012, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Odgaard, Rie] Danish Inst Int Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Dar es Salaam; University of Dar es Salaam; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Bluwstein, J (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, 25 Rolighedsvej, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",jevgeniy@ifro.ku.dk,"Bluwstein, Jevgeniy/AAB-4954-2020; Maganga, Faustin/W-3436-2019; Lund, Jens/D-8776-2015","Bluwstein, Jevgeniy/0000-0002-1162-5028; , Christine Noe/0000-0002-3031-8074; Lund, Jens/0000-0002-7336-0395","Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme [NE/L00139X/1]; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Torben & Alice Frimodts Foundation; Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark [15-P02-TAN]; Danish Council for Independent Research (FSE) [6119-00012]; National Science Foundation in the USA [0921757]; Royal Danish Embassy in Dar es Salaam [104.Tanzania.809-300-1]; Swedish Research Council [229-2011-1417]; SIDA [SWE-2011-140]; NERC [NE/L00139X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0921757] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0921757] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme; Department for International Development (DFID); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Torben & Alice Frimodts Foundation; Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark; Danish Council for Independent Research (FSE); National Science Foundation in the USA(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Royal Danish Embassy in Dar es Salaam; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); SIDA; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank two anonymous reviewers for comments and feedback.

Do arms producing countries use weapon deliveries as a means to affect their external security? Whereas free-riding in alliances is extensively discussed by researchers and practitioners, the literature has surprisingly neglected the effect of transfers in defense goods on domestic military budgets. We develop a formal theoretical framework that conditions a country's budgeting calculus on its arms trade decisions. The general conclusion is that exports lead to domestic cuts in military spending-provided suppliers expect positive security externalities. We use an innovative measure for external security based on UN voting records and regime type to test our model predictions on data covering both the Cold War as well as the post-Cold War period. Our results strongly suggest that democratic and non-democratic countries behave very differently.

Evidence from Structural Estimation,REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLICY; MODEL; DETERMINANTS; EARNINGS; GROWTH; PAYOUT; INCOME,"I study the driving forces behind dividend smoothing by developing a dynamic agency model in which dividends signal the earnings persistence of firms. In equilibrium, managers treat dividends and earnings as informational substitutes. They smooth dividends relative to earnings to smooth negative news releases and lower their turnover risk. Empirical estimates of the model parameters imply that 39% of observed dividend smoothness among U.S. firms is driven by managers' own career concerns, not shareholders' preferences. Managers cut investments and adjust external financing policies to accommodate this career-concern-based dividend smoothing. These effects lead to a 2% decline in firm value.","[Wu, Yufeng] Univ Illinois, 315 Wohlers Hall,1206 South Six St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Wu, YF (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, 315 Wohlers Hall,1206 South Six St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",yufengwu@illinois.edu,,,,,,,47,25,26,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

With this purpose, the role of women in leading modern corporations and the pending gaps in equality were analyzed. Tourist corporations composed the sample of firms, due to its growing economic impact in a post-global financial crisis scenario. The study sample is comprised by the 118 companies listed at the STOXX (R) Global 3000 Travel & Leisure. Financial and corporate governance data provided by Reuters.com, were used for the period ending 2017. Additional data on corporate governance of each entity were gathered from official corporate website of each firm. We designed ad hoc indicators for gender diversity, along with differences in salary and seniority. Special attention was paid to the specific position held by women in each board, and its relationship to emotional intelligence, as a first step to a full research agenda. The results suggested very relevant gap in the three analyzed dimensions: presence, salary and seniority. Women tend to be focused only on several corporate tasks like those related to marketing and human resources management. This bias, which in a first view can be considered an additional manifestation of gender gap, is at the same time an opportunity to link modern corporations to a new style of management in which approaches like emotional intelligence could play a most prominent role. This research contributes in two different ways: (1) it demonstrate the enormous gap still existing between men and women at the top of tourist organizations worldwide and (2) it suggests several research pathways given the type of gender gap detected.

Over the last few years, several hedge funds have used different ways to successfully implement this trading strategy. The most extensively used techniques (correlation, distance, stochastic, stochastic differential residual and cointegration) use different methodologies and statistical tools to determine the two key elements of the strategy: pairs selection and the establishment of the long-term relationship between them. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the process of selecting pairs and determining the residual series using each one of the different techniques and comparing the outputs. Results indicate that far from being differentiated systems, relationships exist between the various techniques in terms of pairs selection and residual series creation. However, some techniques are more efficient at creating residual series than others, which then means that these techniques would have the highest probabilities of generating profits. The analysis concludes that cointegration is the most efficient method of structuring a pairs trading strategy. (C) 2018 AEDEM.

Using evidence from randomized IRS audits during the 2006-2009 period, we find that EITC participants who are audited show much larger increases in reported income in subsequent years, both compared to a control group of EITC filers and compared to audited filers who were not EITC claimants. We find behavioral impacts on the extensive margin as well, with the probability of a filer claiming an EITC dropping by over 6 percentage points within four years following the audit, as well as changes in filing status and the reported number of dependents.","[Debacker, Jason] Univ South Carolina, Darla Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Heim, Bradley T.; Tran, Anh] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA; [Yuskavage, Alexander] US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC 20226 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; United States Department of the Treasury,"Debacker, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Darla Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",Jason.debacker@moore.sc.edu; heimb@indiana.edu; trananh@indiana.edu; alexander.yuskavage@treasury.gov,,,,,,,24,7,8,0,3,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Our model provides interesting insights into the hedging of house market risk and determination of housing rents. In addition to the parameters describing the expected changes and volatility on stock and house returns, we also show that individual precautionary savings motive, idiosyncratic risk premium, and the correlation between stock and housing have important implications for the determination of housing rents.

We identify three possible sources that may change the size of the provisions. These are: The length of the balance sheet, the central bank revenues, and measures of fiscal stress. Using data of the 11 founding members of the Eurosystem for the years 1999-2015, we are able to test each of the three determinants. We find that provisions are increased with the size of the balance sheet especially in the recent financial crisis. Moreover, provisions are increased at the cost of lower central bank revenues. While this holds for the pre-crisis period this relationship seems to be less pronounced in the crisis period probably because of the more active collateral policy. Finally, central banks do not tend to lower provisions because of fiscal tensions. This is even more true in the crisis period.","[Klose, Jens] THM Business Sch, Giessen, Germany",,"Klose, J (通讯作者)，THM Business Sch, Giessen, Germany.",,"Klose, Jens/H-3800-2019","Klose, Jens/0000-0001-6234-5272",,,,,23,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

After the introduction of index futures, signs of positive feedback trading emerge in only two markets (India and Poland). In contrast to the evidence in developed markets, positive feedback traders migrate from spot to futures markets in four markets, which suggests that the introduction of index futures may destabilize some emerging stock markets. Another interesting finding is that positive feedback trading becomes more intense when there is a market decline in the majority of the markets.","[Kutan, Ali M.] Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Business, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; [Shi, Yukun; Wei, Mingzhe] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, RCFMRP, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville; University of Glasgow; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Shi, YK (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.;Zhao, Y (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.;Zhao, Y (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, RCFMRP, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",yukun.shi@glasgow.ac.uk; zhaoyang8@jxufe.edu.cn,,"Zhao, Yang/0000-0002-7833-1657; wei, mingzhe/0000-0002-8817-7788",Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Jiangxi Province [JD16063],Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Jiangxi Province,We wish to thank the two anonymous referees for useful comments.

However, it is unclear whether the rents present in a growing economy are sufficient to finance the socially optimal investment. We prove that the social optimum can be attained if the income share from a fixed factor, such as land, exceeds the public investment requirement. We thus translate the Henry George Theorem from urban economics to neoclassical and endogenous growth settings: here, the socially optimal land rent tax rate is below 100 %.

A review and comparison of several conceptual and theoretical frameworks that were identified to be relevant to the subject of digital business transformation was conducted with the aim of assessing their suitability and robustness in addressing the subject, which is gaining prominence as a pathway for achieving and maintaining competitiveness for businesses as digital technologies continue to shape and transform the business landscape. The background information required for the comparison of the frameworks was obtained after a comprehensive review of each of the frameworks, and based on the insights obtained following the review, their relevance and applicability to the subject of digital business transformation was determined. A qualitative approach was adopted in conducting desk research using reputable business and scientific data sources. The output of the literature search was narrowed down by applying elimination parameters that ensured only relevant articles and journals were included in the final comparison of literatures that contained relevant conceptual and theoretical frameworks. The research established that there is a lack of alignment between industry-based research and academic-based research on the subject of digital business transformation.

This study demonstrates that, under a regionally decentralised authority system, the effect of China's abolition of the agricultural tax (AAT) in 2004-05 extended beyond the realm of agriculture. We find that, following the AAT reform, Chinese counties with higher reliance on agricultural taxation for budgetary revenue prior to the AAT reform experienced higher agricultural economic growth, as expected, but lower non-agricultural economic growth in the short run. This growth-inhibiting effect of the AAT reform on non-agricultural production in the short run can be explained, to some extent, by the increased non-agricultural taxation due to the insufficient funds that Chinese county governments received from the upper-level governments following the AAT reform; the magnitude of this tax increase was associated with the degree to which each county relied on agricultural taxation for budgetary revenue prior to the reform. In addition, our results show that the AAT reform resulted in a high level of regional inequality in terms of non-agricultural GDP per capita. In summary, our study shows that although the AAT reform succeeded in promoting agricultural production, such accomplishments were achieved at the cost of lower non-agricultural output growth and higher regional inequality of non-agricultural GDP per capita at the county level.","[Shi, Hao; Ye, Bing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Ye, B (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",shihao79@sjtu.edu.cn; qinhanqing@sjtu.edu.cn,"Shi, Hao/JFS-5082-2023","Ye, Bing/0000-0001-9284-7281",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403167],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors thank the editor and two anonymous referees for very useful comments and suggestions.

We single out Qatar as a case study. We consider two types of migrants: target migrants, and non-target migrants. If migrants are target migrants, we show that in order to neutralize the effect of a tax on their earnings, Qatar needs to extend the length of time migrants are allowed to stay. Such a scheme can work even when the migrants experience utility loss from staying longer in Qatar. If migrants are non-target migrants, we show that implementation of a lottery scheme in which the prizes are life-long residency in Qatar can compensate for the imposition of the tax.

Smart factories need to develop effective managerial early warning systems to identify and respond to subtle threats or opportunities, i.e. weak signals, in order to adapt to an ever-changing environment in a timely manner and thus gain or maintain a competitive advantage on the market. These factories need to develop and implement a several-stage early warning system that is specific to their industry. The aim of our study is, with the help of semi-structured group interviews, to examine which stages of a managerial early warning system are present in the case of a global innovative supplier in the automotive industry. As such, a four-stage managerial early warning system model for a knowledge-based automotive smart factory is proposed, in which aggregate activities and management decision-making strategies are defined for each stage, with the importance of intuition being taken into consideration. We found that managers rely on intuition and extensive analysis for satisficing strategies and teamwork for optimizing strategies, when using their managerial early warning system.","[Bertoncel, Tine; Mesko, Maja] Univ Primorska, Koper, Slovenia; [Erenda, Ivan] Grp TPV, Novo Mesto, Slovenia",University of Primorska,"Bertoncel, T (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Koper, Slovenia.",tine.bertoncel@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,7,7,0,38,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2018,20.0,49,,,,,805,819,,10.24818/EA/2018/49/805,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO8SD,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440364100018,0

Specifically, it investigates if transfers: 1) induce higher spending on alcohol or tobacco; 2) are fully consumed (rather than invested); 3) create dependency (reduce participation in productive activities); 4) increase fertility; 5) lead to negative community-level economic impacts (including price distortion and inflation); and 6) are fiscally unsustainable. The paper presents evidence refuting each claim, leading to the conclusion that these perceptions-insofar as they are utilized in policy debates-undercut potential improvements in well-being and livelihood strengthening among the poor, which these programs can bring about in sub-Saharan Africa, and globally. It concludes by underscoring outstanding research gaps and policy implications for the continued expansion of unconditional cash transfers in the region and beyond.","[Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Daidone, Silvio] UN Food & Agr Org FAO, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Peterman, Amber; Palermo, Tia] United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEF, Off Res Innocenti, Florence, Italy; [Davis, Benjamin] UN Food & Agr Org FAO, Strateg Programme Reducing Rural Poverty, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Pereira, Audrey] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Yablonski, Jennifer] United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEF, Ghana Country Off, Accra, Ghana",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Handa, S (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",shanda@email.unc.edu; Silvio.Daidone@fao.org; apeterman@unicef.org; Benjamin.Davis@fao.org; audrey.pereira@cgiar.org; tmpalermo@unicef.org; jyablonski@unicef.org,"Daidone, Silvio/AAJ-4490-2021; Palermo, Tia/ABI-8328-2020; Daidone, Silvio/ABC-5526-2021","Daidone, Silvio/0000-0002-1789-5635; Peterman, Amber/0000-0002-3921-5936; Pereira, Audrey/0000-0001-7982-7454","Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Ghana); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Malawi); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Zimbabwe); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Ghana); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Lesotho); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Ethiopia); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Malawi); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Kenya); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Zambia); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Zimbabwe); EU, European Union (Lesotho); EU, European Union (Malawi); EU, European Union (Zimbabwe); Irish Aid (Malawi); Irish Aid (Zambia); KfW Development Bank (Malawi); NIH, The United States National Institute of Health (Kenya); Sida (Zimbabwe); SDC, Swiss Development Cooperation (Zimbabwe); USAID, United States Agency for International Development (Ghana); USAID, United States Agency for International Development (Malawi); U.S. Department of Labor (Malawi); U.S. Department of Labor (Zambia); UNICEF Mozambique","Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Ghana); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Malawi); 3IE, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (Zimbabwe); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Ghana); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Lesotho); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Ethiopia); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Malawi); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Kenya); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Zambia); DFID, UK Department for International Development (Zimbabwe); EU, European Union (Lesotho); EU, European Union (Malawi); EU, European Union (Zimbabwe); Irish Aid (Malawi); Irish Aid (Zambia); KfW Development Bank (Malawi); NIH, The United States National Institute of Health (Kenya); Sida (Zimbabwe); SDC, Swiss Development Cooperation (Zimbabwe); USAID, United States Agency for International Development (Ghana)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); USAID, United States Agency for International Development (Malawi)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); U.S. Department of Labor (Malawi); U.S. Department of Labor (Zambia); UNICEF Mozambique","This work was supported by a large number of donors across evaluations and institutions.

In the cross section of stock returns, we find an asymmetry premium: Higher downside asymmetric comovement with the market indicates higher expected returns.","[Jiang, Lei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ke] Renmin Univ China, Hanging Adv Inst Econ & Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Guofu] Washington Univ, Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Tsinghua University; Renmin University of China; Washington University (WUSTL),"Wu, K (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Hanging Adv Inst Econ & Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jianglei@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; ke.wu@ruc.edu.cn; zhou@wustl.edu,,"Wu, Ke/0000-0001-8112-9620",AXA Research Fund; Tsinghua University [20151080398]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71572091]; Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology,AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Tsinghua University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology,"Jiang, jianglei@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn, Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management; Wu (corresponding author), ke.wu@ruc.edu.cn, Renmin University of China Hanqing Advanced Institute of Economics and Finance; and Zhou, zhou@wustl.edu, Washington University in St. Louis Olin School of Business.

This paper proposes a conceptual framework within which to view automation and technological unemployment. The overarching conceptual framework pertains to the concepts of optimal and just factor shares. Within this framework, the issues associated with technological unemployment including the non-neutrality of technology, the subsequent inevitability of automation, the mechanisms via which this impacts work and the case for a re-invention of capitalism are explored. Sharing work is proposed as a modest institutional reform. The specific policy proposals within the broad area of sharing work are work-sharing and shortened work-week. The theoretical literature on the sharing work concept and the empirical literature on the two specific reforms are then reviewed. While these reforms are incremental and hence perhaps the most politically acceptable, they nonetheless represent a reinvention of capitalism if broadly implemented. It is argued that such re-inventions are well rooted in history during crises periods such as the one technological unemployment is likely to lead to based on the evidence provided. It is further argued that taxing capital to pay for these reforms, to the extent that they are not self-financing, is socially just.","[Khan, Shahrukh Rafi] Mt Holyoke Coll, Dept Econ, 50 Coll St, S Hadley, MA 10175 USA",Mount Holyoke College,"Khan, SR (通讯作者)，Mt Holyoke Coll, Dept Econ, 50 Coll St, S Hadley, MA 10175 USA.",khans@mtholyoke.edu,,,,,,,61,1,1,0,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

In this paper, we contrast the two and their impact on children's schooling using longitudinal data from Nicaragua. To address endogeneity, we utilize both household fixed effects and locality-year fixed effects. Our results indicate that, on average, children from borrowing households fare worse than children from nonborrowing households, with male borrowers having a disproportionately negative effect on boys, and vice versa for girls and female borrowers. Informal credit is found to have a protective effect on school attendance, but the effects of formal and informal credit on cumulative schooling are found to be statistically equivalent. However, this appears to mask considerable heterogeneity within informal borrowing.","[Kondratjeva, Olga] Washington Univ St Louis, Ctr Social Dev, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Chen, Joyce J.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Chen, Joyce J.] Inst Labor Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany",Washington University (WUSTL); University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kondratjeva, O (通讯作者)，Washington Univ St Louis, Ctr Social Dev, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",olga.kondrat@gmail.com,"Chen, Joyce/AAV-3126-2021","Chen, Joyce/0000-0003-1933-3692",,,,,52,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Using a case study, we focus on the relationship between labor migration, agrarian livelihood diversification, and climate change to further a more nuanced understanding of migration as adaptation than is implied by a simple dichotomy of success versus failure. Smallholder diversification, both on- and off-farm, has largely been framed as a risk spreading practice that lowers climate change vulnerability. But after decades of advocating livelihood diversification, with labor migration now increasingly a part of smallholder livelihood activities, it is urgent to pose a number of questions: Why do smallholders migrate? How does labor migration unfold for them and with what outcomes? Our primary goal here is to explore the nature of the relationship of labor migration to climate change and climate change adaptation. Through empirical fieldwork in northwestern Nicaragua, we explore the role of labor migration in smallholder household production and reproduction, as families confront increasingly difficult climatic conditions for agricultural production and a relative absence of the state within a neoliberal political economy. Our analysis draws on household surveys and qualitative interviews and focus groups we carried out in the municipality of Somotillo, in northwestern Nicaragua, over three years (2013-15). Our findings demonstrate that household labor migration neither facilitates adaptation to climate change nor reflects a failure to adapt, but rather reflects the weak position of smallholders in interlocking relations of power and the relative land scarcity experienced by many. We argue that labor migration barely maintains semi-subsistence agricultural production and reinforces existing social inequalities, raising questions regarding a conceptualization of migration as adaptation and the benefits of this type of livelihood diversification.

The magnitude of the health damage caused by air pollution depends on the location of emission sources. In this paper, we look into the spatial distribution of coal-fired power plants, which are the major emission sources in China, and investigate the determining factors behind the distribution. We find that the driving factors are economic development and expansion of electricity grid coverage; the latter factor plays a key role in provinces that are less developed but have abundant coal resources. This suggests a way to reduce health damages caused by air pollution without harming the economy: attracting coal-fired plants to less populated areas by developing trans-province electricity trade and grid coverage.","[Xie, Lunyu; Huang, Ying; Qin, Ping] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Qin, P (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pingqin@ruc.edu.cn,,", Lunyu/0000-0002-7519-5143",Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9174037]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703163],Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (9174037) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (71703163).,,41,7,8,6,45,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Using a structural VAR model with Bayesian sign restrictions, we show that adverse shocks to aggregate demand and supply cause an increase in the persistent component of both stock and bond market volatility, and that adverse shocks to the persistent component of either stock or bond market volatility cause a deterioration in macroeconomic fundamentals. We find no evidence of a relationship between the transitory component of volatility and macroeconomic fundamentals. Instead, we find that the transitory component is more closely associated with changes in investor sentiment. Our results are robust to a wide range of alternative specifications. Out-of-sample forecasting shows that the components of volatility can improve forecasts of macroeconomic fundamentals, and vice versa. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To elicit preferences for retirement timing in the laboratory, we ask subjects to make retirement choices under different payoff schemes that introduce variation in financial incentives. Testing ceteris paribus conditions of the financial incentive alone shows a considerable delay of retirement once early retirement becomes financially less attractive. However, varying available information as another treatment parameter reveals considerable heterogeneity in the functioning of these incentives. Subjects who are explicitly informed about the expected pension wealth respond more strongly to financial incentives compared with those who only know their pension annuity. Being informed about a forward-looking measure of pension benefits makes the financial consequences of retirement choices more salient to the decision maker.","[Giesecke, Matthias] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Essen, Germany; [Yang, Guanzhong] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Duisburg Essen,"Giesecke, M (通讯作者)，RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Essen, Germany.",matthias.giesecke@rwi-essen.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHN553/1-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are grateful to Jeannette Brosig-Koch, Colin Green, Timo Heinrich, Christoph Helbach, Reinhold Schnabel, and numerous seminar participants for helpful discussions and suggestions.

Finland is an interesting case because countervailing effects may exist: a high level of education might increase financial literacy, while the high provision of social security may decrease it and weaken its relationship with pension planning. The results indicate that the level of financial literacy in Finland is comparatively high, although it is unequally distributed among the population. With respect to pension planning, we find that there is little evidence of a relationship between the three core financial literacy questions and retirement planning; however, a statistically significant and positive relationship exists between retirement planning and an extended measure of financial literacy, consisting mostly of more demanding questions. When we split the sample by gender, we find evidence of a positive relationship between financial literacy and retirement planning among women but not among men. The results indicate that scaling down publicly guaranteed pension benefits may pose a challenge to the less financially literate segment of the population.","[Kalmi, Panu] Univ Vaasa, Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland; [Ruuskanen, Olli-Pekka] Univ Tampere, Kanslerinrinne 1, Tampere 33100, Finland",University of Vaasa; Tampere University,"Kalmi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Vaasa, Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland.",panu.kalmi@uva.fi; olli-pekka.ruuskanen@staff.uta.fi,,,Academy of Finland; OP Research Foundation; Foundation for Economic Education; Finnish Financial Ombudsman Bureau; Wage Earner Foundation; Vaasa Aktia Foundation; Finnish Foundation for Share Promotion,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); OP Research Foundation; Foundation for Economic Education; Finnish Financial Ombudsman Bureau; Wage Earner Foundation; Vaasa Aktia Foundation; Finnish Foundation for Share Promotion,"We thank Annamaria Lusardi for her support and mentoring when writing this paper and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Given its magnitude, diversity and uniqueness, the Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative, as a multi-country platform along the contemporary Eurasia trade routes, underpins our diagnoses. The Chinese government posited B&R Initiative as an economic prescription which is premised on the provision of infrastructural connectivity across the Eurasia continent. By treating human and non-human elements symmetrically, ANT possesses wide scope elasticity that helps describe the dynamic interrelationships among various actors/actants, including the ways how government and state-controlled actors rationalized cross-border infrastructure projects by anchoring discourses about the thriving B&R network. Based on the analyses of three case studies, we argue that B&R Initiative has been a catalyst and obligatory passage point (OPP) for facilitating transnational transport infrastructure projects in garnering required resources and supports, though its efficacy might be subdued by other factors such as political contentions.","[Wang, James Jixian] City Univ Hong Kong, Res Ctr One Belt One Rd, Coll Business, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yau, Selina] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Wang, JJ (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Res Ctr One Belt One Rd, Coll Business, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jamewang@cityu.edu.hk,"Wang, James/JAD-0675-2023",,,,,,44,43,47,9,52,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Using a composite index of banking sector development, the estimation results show that population density and simultaneous openness to trade and capital promote banking sector development while financial liberalisation hinders banking sector development. This study reveals that institutional quality, population density, and trade openness increases the depth of the banking sector. Also, it demonstrates that law, inflation, and religion promotes the efficiency of the banking sector while latitude, trade openness, income level, and ethnic diversity reduce banking sector efficiency. In addition, it shows that law and simultaneous openness to trade and capital enhances the stability of the banking sector while land area, financial liberalisation, economic growth, and inflation adversely affect banking sector stability.

Using income tax record data in combination with survey data is a potential approach to address the problem; we consider here the UK's pioneering SPI adjustment' method that implements this idea. Since 1992, the principal income distribution series (reported annually in Households Below Average Income) has been based on household survey data in which the incomes of a small number of very rich' individuals are adjusted using information from very rich' individuals in personal income tax return data. We explain what the procedure involves, reveal the extent to which it addresses survey under-coverage of top incomes and show how it affects estimates of overall income inequality.

Using a sample of 1310 married individuals, we found evidence of partial mediation in that materialism was negatively associated with perception of marriage importance, and this association partially explained why being materialistic was associated with lower marital satisfaction.

This research develops and tests the construct validity of a virtual audit tool of the street environment for route choice analysis of pedestrians with an aim to ease the burden of data collection process, while maintaining the quality of data. The research collected walking routes data from 178 individuals in Brisbane, Australia. Participants were asked to indicate the reasons for their chosen routes in a 16-item question measured on a 3-point Likert scale. Their responses as well as the literature inform the development of the tool (content validity), which contained 22 indicators that potentially influence route choice. The tool was applied to collect street environment data virtually using Google Street View for each street segment of the routes taken. The tool was also used to collect street environment data physically for 47 randomly selected street segments from all the segments forming the routes. The construct validity was tested by comparing indicator level scores between virtual and physical surveys using three statistical measures-i.e., % agreement, Kappa Coefficient, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient. The results show that 90% of street environment indicators have an acceptable level of agreement, which justifies that the tool can validly be used to collect street environment data for route choice analysis. The methodological implication of this study is that scholars and local planners can use the tool to collect street environment data efficiently, effectively, and free of charge by using Google Street View.","[Shatu, Farjana; Yigitcanlar, Tan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Yigitcanlar, T (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",farjana.shatu@hdr.qut.edu.au; tan.yigitcanlar@qut.edu.au,"Yigitcanlar, Tan/J-1142-2012","Yigitcanlar, Tan/0000-0001-7262-7118; Shatu, Farjana/0000-0002-3045-6637",,,,,101,36,44,5,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Debt-based compensation, so-called inside debt, aligns the interests of CEOs with those of external creditors. We examine whether inside debt induces CEOs to pursue less risky acquisitions. Consistent with this, we show that acquisitions announced by CEOs with high inside debt incentives are associated with a wealth transfer from equity to debt holders. After the completion of a deal, banks where acquiring CEOs have high inside debt incentives display lower market measures of risk and lower loss exposures for taxpayers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It measures and analyses three facets of these policies: the potential for a modal shift from the car to public transport, the environmental consequences (CO2 emissions) and the social consequences (transport costs) of such a shift. The increase in travel costs brought about by higher fuel prices or from charges for access to urban centres, together with a reduction in the costs of travelling by public transport, are the three elements which - according to the models - have the biggest influence on modal shift and the reduction in CO2 emissions.

Drawing on the work of economists, political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists, we examine seven policy categories: (1) rewards and penalties; (2) monitoring; (3) restructuring bureaucracies; (4) screening and recruiting; (5) anti-corruption agencies; (6) educational campaigns; and (7) international agreements. Notably, rigorous empirical evaluation is lacking for the majority of commonly prescribed anticorruption policies. Nevertheless, we find growing evidence of the effectiveness of policies based on monitoring, including anti-corruption audits and e-governance. In addition, adequate civil service wages seem to be a necessary but insufficient condition for control of corruption. An emerging skepticism regarding the effectiveness of anti-corruption agencies also is apparent in the literature. We conclude with broader lessons drawn from our review, such as the recognition that when corruption is a systemic problem, it cannot be treated in the long term with individual-level solutions.

We here propose a comprehensive framework model for structuring multiple sustainability principles and practices, detected in the literature as different sustainability categories related to both macro and micro perspectives of sustainability in the economy and society. The focus is on relevant sustainability principles of technology and business innovation in relation to basic technology and business innovation models as a contribution to less investigated theoretical aspects of sustainable business development. We developed a set of related matrices indicating the relevant roles and relationships between these principles in achieving sustainable business goals related to sustainable economy dimensions. Finally, the paper shows that the proposed Related Matrices Framework fulfils the main objective set in the initial research stages, i.e. to be of both theoretical and practical relevance. As a contribution to the theory it meets the need of building a structured, integrated, comprehensive model that serves the needs of better understanding different sustainability of macro and micro categories, indicating mutual relations and influences. In a practical sense, it can be used as a tool to support the management of change in companies oriented at achieving sustainable business goals based on sustainable technology and business innovation.","[Jaksic, Maja Levi; Rakicevic, Jovana; Jovanovic, Milica] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Jovanovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia.",milica.jovanovic@fon.bg.ac.rs,"Jovanović, Milica/AAM-6283-2020; Rakicevic, Jovana/HGC-0105-2022; Jakšić, Maja/JHU-9704-2023","Jovanović, Milica/0000-0001-7618-6356;",,,,,69,8,10,3,34,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,418,436,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/418,0.0,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL6OW,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437308600002,0

Applying instrumental variables methods to data on approximately 90 U.S. bank holding companies over the 1999-2015 period, we argue that these inconclusive results are due to the fact that there is a non-linear, U-shaped relationship between gender diversity on boards and various measures of bank performance: female participation has a positive effect once a threshold level of gender diversity is achieved. Furthermore, this positive effect is only observed in better capitalized banks. Our results suggest that continuing the voluntary expansion of gender diversity on bank boards will be value enhancing, provided that they are well capitalized.

It has been suggested that when evaluating the impact of an intervention, the affected population should be allowed to define well-being (requiring a subjective measure), and impacts (requiring a participatory approach), but very few, if any, conservation evaluations live up to these standards. We used a participatory impact evaluation approach with the Global Person Generated Index (GPGI) to investigate the relative impacts of strict protection and community forest management on local well-being in Madagascar's rainforests. The GPGI captures the subjective and multidimensional nature of well-being by asking respondents to identify the five most important domains for their quality of life, to evaluate their own performance in each domain, and the relative importance of the five identified domains. Participatory impact evaluation establishes local perceptions of the cause-effect relationship between an intervention and respondents' performance in each domain. Over half the respondents perceived no positive or negative impacts from the conservation interventions. We found no significant difference between strict protection and community forest management in the measures we used to examine the magnitude of their relative impacts, but there were differences in the characteristics of domains impacted and in the priority domains that could be targeted to improve well-being in locally meaningful ways. Because of its subjectivity, the GPGI cannot provide quantitative information on the magnitude of impacts. Its strength lies in the wealth of information it provides on what life domains people value and their performance in these domains. Combined with the participatory impact evaluation approach, the GPGI provides highly relevant insights that can be used to improve interventions in ways which increase the local legitimacy and acceptability of conservation initiatives.

Using these correlations, we consider that the transition from the linear economic model to the circular economic model has positive effects, as proven by this study. The proposed model uses data for the 28 member states of the European Union, in the 2005-2016 time frame. The novelty of this study lies in using a data panel model for estimating the impact that the measures associated with the circular economy have on the resource productivity and economic growth. The obtained results show that the resource productivity improves by 0.01307 considering one percent increase in the recycling rate of the municipal waste, by 0.159988 if the research and innovation as percentage in the GDP increases by one percent and by 0.068711 when the number of patents in the EU (as for 1 million inhabitants) increases by one unit. All these values stress out the positive effects the circular economy model may have on the society's sustainable development.","[Vuta, Mariana; Vuta, Mihai; Enciu, Adrian; Cioaca, Sorin-Iulian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Vuta, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",vuta.mariana@fin.ase.ro,"Cioaca, Sorin-Iulian/P-8265-2016; mariana, vuta/ABC-8195-2020","mariana, vuta/0000-0002-1165-4021",,,,,33,30,30,5,56,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,248,261,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/248,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN9XV,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439567500002,0

After extensively surveying the relevant theoretical and empirical literature, the paper reports estimates of saving determinants relying on the newly constructed and largest available database covering 165 countries over 1981-2012. The empirical specification includes determinants not considered in the literature, explores differences in saving behavior nesting the 2008-10 crisis period and four different country groups, searches for commonalities across key saving aggregates (national, private, household, and corporate saving rates), and is subject to a robustness analysis based on different estimation techniques. The results confirm in part existing research, but also shed light on some ambiguous or contradictory findings and highlight the role of neglected determinants. Compared to the literature, we find a larger number of significant determinants, changes across periods and country groups, and similarities across different saving aggregates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The firm in each country chooses first the environmental quality of its product (which reflects the emissions generated in the production process) and then the price. In equilibrium one country will be more polluted than the other because firms choose different levels of environmental quality of their products. We find that a country's optimal commodity tax is higher if the domestic firm is the more polluting supplier. Furthermore, non-cooperative commodity tax rates are inefficiently high in equilibrium. This is because, in this framework with environmentally aware consumers, commodity taxes affect the choice of firms regarding their emissions. Therefore, a domestic tax reduction not only raises the profits of the foreign firm but also lowers its emission levels, resulting in higher welfare for the other country. We also analyse the optimal cooperative and non-cooperative commodity and emission taxes with border tax adjustments. With these two policy instruments available, commodity taxes are higher.","[Karakosta, Ourania] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Ioannina 45110, Greece",University of Ioannina,"Karakosta, O (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Ioannina 45110, Greece.",okarakosta@cc.uoi.gr,"Karakosta, Ourania/AAT-8809-2021","Karakosta, Ourania/0000-0003-0787-0781",European Social Fund (ESF); Greek State,European Social Fund (ESF)(European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek State,The research project is implemented within the framework of the Action Supporting Postdoctoral Researchers of the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning (Action.s Bene.ciary: General Secretariat for Research and Technology) and is co-financed by the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Greek State.,,15,6,6,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

While the set of players and the set of strategies of those games are unambiguously defined and controlled by the experimenter, utility is typically either assumed to coincide with monetary payoffs or is estimated ex post based on observed actions. We follow a different path and discuss results from an experiment on simple 2-person games in which participants were repeatedly asked to report their expectations on the opponent's behavior and their own level of satisfaction for each possible outcome of the game. This approach allows us to reflect on experimental methodology by directly comparing monetary incentives with (perceived and declared) utility. We find that, albeit helpful, repetition and experience are unable to completely align utility with monetary incentives. While most participants (57%) seek to maximize money earnings in the experimental laboratory and tend to perceive the games in the intended way, a small - yet non-negligible - fraction (27%) of the subject pool consistently interprets the game and, therefore, acts in an unexpected way.

Public transit system, as an integral part of multimodal transportation ecosystem, has been supporting such shift by exploring the adoption of electric vehicles. In recent years, the advancement in Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) and their supporting infrastructure technology made them a viable replacement for diesel and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) buses. Yet, it remains a challenge on how to optimally deploy the BEB system due to its unique spatio-temporal characteristics. To fill this gap, this research introduces a spatio-temporal optimization model to identify the optimal deployment strategies for BEB system. The identified spatio-temporal deployment of BEB system can minimize the cost associated with vehicle procurement and charging station allocation, while satisfying transit operation constraints such as maintaining existing bus operation routes and schedules. The proposed method is implemented onto the transit network operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) to showcase its effectiveness. As many transit agencies are testing electric buses and considering the integration of electric buses into future fleet, this research will help transit agencies make informed decisions regarding strategic planning and design of BEB systems.","[Wei, Ran] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Geospatial Sci, Sch Publ Policy, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Liu, Xiaoyue; Fayyaz, S.

How do they distribute this aid? While donors agreed to prioritise particularly vulnerable countries, we know from the general aid allocation literature that donors (also) use aid as a foreign policy tool to promote their own economic and political goals. In this paper, we analyse data on bilateral adaptation aid from 2010 through 2015 to assess to what extent adaptation aid is provided in response to recipient need (that is, vulnerability to climate change impacts) as opposed to recipient merit (that is, good governance) and donors' interests. In contrast to previous research, we find that donors partly take into account vulnerability to climate change. Countries that are physically more exposed to climate change tend to be more likely to receive some adaptation aid and also receive more adaptation aid per capita, as do poorer countries, small island developing states and to a lesser extent least developed countries. Countries with lower adaptive capacity, however, do not receive more adaptation aid; instead, donors reward well-governed countries with adaptation aid as well as use adaptation aid to promote their own economic interests. Furthermore, adaptation aid flows very closely follow general development aid flows. The extent to which adaptation aid is new and additional thus remains unclear. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we show how a life-cycle perspective alters our impression of how the UK tax and benefit system affects women's work incentives. Given that actual longitudinal data conflate age effects, cohort effects and policy effects, and, in the UK, are not available covering the full life cycle, we use simulated data produced by a rich, dynamic structural model of female labour supply and human capital that incorporates family formation and fertility. We find that individuals experience considerable variability in work incentives across life that outweighs the variability across individuals. Changes in the presence of children and a partner, as well as the level of any partner's earnings, are key to explaining these patterns: work incentives vary dramatically depending on family composition and the earnings of any partner, especially for the lower-skilled, and most women experience a number of different family types during the course of their lives.","[Brewer, Mike] Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester, Essex, England; [Brewer, Mike; Shaw, Jonathan] IFS, London, England; [Shaw, Jonathan] Alan Turing Inst, London, England",University of Essex,"Brewer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester, Essex, England.;Brewer, M (通讯作者)，IFS, London, England.",mbrewer@essex.ac.uk; jonshaw@turing.ac.uk,,"Brewer, Mike/0000-0003-0759-0384","ESRC/HMRC [RES-194-23-0016]; SRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS [ES/M010147/1]; ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change at the University of Essex [ES/L009153/1]; NORFACE ERA-NET (New Opportunities for Research Funding Agency Cooperation in Europe Network) [462-14-010]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1, ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L009153/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC/HMRC; SRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change at the University of Essex; NORFACE ERA-NET (New Opportunities for Research Funding Agency Cooperation in Europe Network); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are very grateful to Alex Beer, Jennifer Bradley, Juliet Clarke, Christoph Erben, Saranna Fordyce, Jonathan Gillham, Ivan Mathers, Kate Mieske, Stefania Porcu, Matthew Whittaker and Edward Zamboni for discussing this research and its policy implications.

An in-depth analysis provides unique evidence that suggests the following: First, fiscal rules reduce public deficits. The effect is stronger the better the analyzed budget position corresponds with the variable targeted by the rules. Second, cantonal debt brakes exhibit some unintended effects, i.e., an evasion into unconstrained accounts, emphasizing the importance of constraining all accounts. Third, the existence of political budget cycles depends on the institutional context, i.e., the timing of elections and the presence of debt brakes. Fifth, cantonal debt brakes dampen the fiscal deterioration during unexpected deficit shocks by more rapid fiscal adjustments.","[Burret, Heiko T.; Feld, Lars P.] Walter Eucken Inst, Goethestr 10, Freiburg, Germany",,"Feld, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Walter Eucken Inst, Goethestr 10, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",feld@eucken.de,,"Burret, Heiko/0000-0003-2483-9049",,,,,146,27,27,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

It finds that the adoption of management delegation leads the MNE to a higher level of optimal technology transfer. It also leads the direct-entry MNE to optimally transfer more technology than an acquisition one. This result is reversed in the no delegation case. The management delegation decreases the likelihood of direct-entry mode being optimally chosen if the transfer cost of technology is sufficiently high, while it increases this likelihood if otherwise. When the entry fee of direct-entry mode is sufficiently high, the acquisition mode becomes the equilibrium but it may induce a lower level of technology transfer than the off-equilibrium mode. As far as the domestic welfare is concerned, when the entry fee is sufficiently low (high), the acquisition (direct-entry) mode generally achieves higher domestic welfare but is not the equilibrium mode of the MNE. There exists some intermediate range of entry fees such that both the host and the MNE identically prefer direct entry mode. Such identical preferences becomes more likely with the adoption of a higher delegation incentive.","[Chen, Ho-Chyuan] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, HC (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan.",hcchen.ccu@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C.

On the other hand, however, these projects may generate larger negative externalities for certain parts of society. One example is the erection of a nuclear power-plant, a measure that is widely considered to render a country's energy provision less dependent on supply from outside. On the other hand, it possibly causes a feeling of insecurity among people who live in the vicinity of such a power station, and can furthermore have negative economic consequences in so far as the price of land and of houses may decline in this area. How should decisions on public projects with larger negative externalities be taken? Assuming that the benefits for all those who are directly or indirectly affected by such a project are roughly the same, a cost-sharing or burden-sharing method is proposed that focuses on a weighted difference between the economic performance of a particular region and the average performance of all regions concerned. The weight is to be determined by an impartial observer.","[Colombo, Camilla] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Gaertner, Wulf] Univ Osnabruck, Dept Econ, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany; [Gaertner, Wulf] Ctr Philosophy Nat & Social Sci LSE, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University Osnabruck,"Gaertner, W (通讯作者)，Univ Osnabruck, Dept Econ, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany.;Gaertner, W (通讯作者)，Ctr Philosophy Nat & Social Sci LSE, London, England.",wulf.gaertner@uni-osnabrueck.de,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

By contrast, the model-averaged forecasts based on both parametric (Autoregressive Integrated model) and nonparametric models (SSA-HW) are able to provide improved forecasts, particularly for the ten trading days ahead forecasting horizon. For robustness purposes, we build two trading strategies based on the aforementioned forecasts, which further confirm that the SSA-HW and the ARI-SSAHW are able to generate significantly higher net daily returns in the out-of-sample period.

Moreover, among the many commonly cited influences on tax incidence, only interprovincial trade has a strong and broad negative association with tax progressivity. Domestic trade's impact also varies considerably over time and often is the inverse of that discussed in the literature, with receding trade levels associated with rising progressivity. Many domestic influences on incidence are stronger than most transboundary ones.","[Haddow, Rodney] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Haddow, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,39,5,5,0,3,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Participants typically make ten decisions with different variance options, with one of these choices randomly chosen for actual payoff. For this mechanism to provide an accurate measure of risk aversion, participants need to understand the choices and give consistent responses. Unfortunately, inconsistent and even dominated choices are often made. Can these mistakes lead to a misrepresentation of economic phenomena? We use gender differences in risk taking to test this question. In contrast to many findings in the literature, HL results typically do not find significant gender differences. We compare the HL approach, where we replicate the lack of significant gender differences, with a simpler presentation of the same choices in which participants make only one of the ten HL decisions; this simpler presentation yields strong gender differences indicating that women are more risk averse than men. We also find gender differences in the consistency of decisions. We believe that the results found in the simpler case are more reflective of underlying preferences, since the task is considerably easier to understand. Our results suggest that the complexity and structure of the risk elicitation mechanism can affect measured risk preferences. The issue of complexity and comprehension is also likely to be present with elicitation mechanisms in other realms of economic preferences.","[Charness, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, 2127 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Eckel, Catherine] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Gneezy, Uri] Univ Calif San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gneezy, Uri] Univ Amsterdam, CREED, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kajackaite, Agne] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Amsterdam,"Charness, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, 2127 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",charness@econ.ucsb.edu; ceckel@tamu.ed; ugneezy@ucsd.edu; agne.kajackaite@wzb.eu,"Charness, Gary/JVP-0357-2024",,,,,,19,24,25,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Accountability studies increasingly acknowledge that studying one type of accountability relation at a time is too restrictive. Our study aims to correct for this and explores the effectiveness of combinations of different accountability mechanisms. We take the World Development Report's accountability triangle as a starting point and adapt it in three ways. First, we refine the long route to accountability into three tracks by differentiating between the three groups of demand side actors; political accountability (opposition), citizen-led, and civil-society-led social accountability. Second, for each track we take into account the demand and supply side and the availability of supply-demand interfaces. Finally, we adopt a holistic approach through the simultaneous incorporation of both the short and long (with the different tracks) routes. To test its usefulness, we use our refined accountability framework to study the accountability constellations and their link to performance in Uganda's rural water sector. Building on QCA, our findings identify the long three track route (supply interface all three demand actors) and the citizen-led social accountability route as viable routes to high water service performance in Ugandan districts. Additionally, a set of new hybrid accountability arrangements are identified while contrary to theoretical assumptions the short route (clients to service providers) does not prove effective.

This type of funding might tap into the wisdom of crowds who were previously disconnected from the funding process. We distinguish between in-crowd and out-crowd funders (with and without ties to project creators) in order to test for heterogeneity in their information use. Based on the analysis of a large-scale survey amongst project funders, this paper shows that in-crowd investors rely more on information about the project creator than out-crowd investors. Out-crowd investors do not seem to attach more importance to information about the project itself than in-crowd investors, except in the case of donation-based crowdfunding. For financial return crowdfunding, financial information becomes less important once a strong relationship with the project creator is established. Our study allows project creators to target information to specific audiences based on their relationship strength across different types of crowdfunding projects.","[Polzin, Friedemann; Stam, Erik] Utrecht Univ Sch Econ USE, Kriekenpitpl 21-22,POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Polzin, Friedemann] SFL, Kriekenpitpl 21-22,POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Toxopeus, Helen] Erasmus Sch Accounting & Assurance, ICE, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Polzin, F (通讯作者)，Utrecht Univ Sch Econ USE, Kriekenpitpl 21-22,POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",f.polzin@uu.nl,"Polzin, Friedemann/AAA-7566-2019; Polzin, Friedemann/AAY-9879-2021; Stam, Erik/E-6605-2017","Polzin, Friedemann/0000-0002-9768-8694; Stam, Erik/0000-0001-9827-0516",,,,,107,95,104,3,80,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Thus, the anticipated future benefits should be weighted by the recipient's survival probabilities - the probabilities that the recipient is alive when the benefits will be received. Many published papers, mainly by business schools' professors, assume that benefits will be received on average throughout the recipient's expected remaining lifetime and estimate the present value of Social Security benefits by discounting the cash flow through life expectancy. This paper shows that the preferred approach is to estimate the Actuarial Present Value (APV) which weighs each future payment by the probability that it will be received. Based on survival probabilities and life expectancy tables that are compiled by the CDC the paper demonstrates that the present value through life expectancy approach overstates the APV by approximately 5-8 percent. Therefore, timing decisions that are not based on the APV are incorrect.","[Friedman, Joseph] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Friedman, J (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",jfriedman@temple.edu,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,1,LODZ UNIV TECHNOLOGY PR,LODZ,"BIBLIOTEKA POLITECHNIKI LODZKIEJ-BUDYNEK B22, UL WOLCZANSKA 223, LODZ, 90-924, POLAND",,,978-83-7283-900-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,57,62,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470276200005,0

Based on the above conclusions, this paper puts forward relevant policy suggestions on resisting risks of fiberboard futures markets to guarantee the rapid development of spot market of fiberboards in the end.","[Gu Xuesong; Zhu Xuanying; Huang Jiayi] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,"Gu, XS (通讯作者)，Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",,"Gu, Xuesong/ABR-7906-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703007]; Research Project of the Humanity and Social Science Fund of the Ministry of Education of China [15YJC790022]; Fundamental Research Funds of the Central Universities [2017ZY69],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Project of the Humanity and Social Science Fund of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fundamental Research Funds of the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71703007), Research Project of the Humanity and Social Science Fund of the Ministry of Education of China (No. 15YJC790022) and Fundamental Research Funds of the Central Universities (No. 2017ZY69).",,20,0,0,1,1,DALIAN UNIV TECHNICAL ELECTRONIC & AUDIO-VISUAL PRESS,DALIAN CITY,"NO.80 SOFTWARE PARK ROAD, HI-TECH ZONE, DALIAN CITY, LIAONING PROVINCE 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-202-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,342,348,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7UP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455659900049,0

EFC argues that a carefully designed fiscal consolidation could lead to increases in aggregate output and consumption of firms and households through shifts in fiscal policy (expenditure and tax changes). Further, it is suggested that the higher the initial fiscal spending to GDP ratio, the greater the expansionary effect of fiscal spending reductions. The aforementioned argument is completely different from a Keynesian perspective, according to which a reduction in government expenditures or more taxation have contractionary effects on aggregate demand. This chapter analyses the theoretical pillars of EFC thesis and assesses its implications in specific countries of the euro area in the period 2010-2016. It is argued that permanent fiscal consolidation is detrimental to economic growth in the euro area economies. This chapter is organized as follows: after a brief introduction, Sect. 2 analyses the pillars of EFC thesis and discusses its main weaknesses. Section 3 analyses the effects of the EFC thesis on key macroeconomic variables in selected eurozone states, and Sect. 4 concludes.","[Hazakis, Konstantinos J.] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Komotini, Greece",,"Hazakis, KJ (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Komotini, Greece.",krohazaki@otenet.gr,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-93452-5; 978-3-319-93451-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,3,15,,10.1007/978-3-319-93452-5_1,0.0,,,13,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BQ4NA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000591182600001,0

However, this seemingly optimistic message is strongly weakened as our analysis points to a bias if the potential endogeneity of fiscal rules is not explicitly taken into account. Furthermore, our analysis provides evidence for the presence of a publication bias. Both sources of bias reduce the statistical precision of obtained effects below usual levels of statistical significance.

With the longtime productivity slowdown and the present long recession, a question arises about the threat of secular stagnation of the advanced world. In searching for the roots of this threat, leading world economistst accentuate either the demand side, or the supply side of the economy. In this respect, the authors add globalization as another important factor. Globalization has resulted in long-term global and internal imbalances, and caused deep problems in the advanced countries - deindustrialization, unemployment, growing dependence on the social safety net, and a permanent increase of government intrusion into the economy. After the 2008 crisis, fiscal and monetary policy concentrates on short-term support of economic recovery, leaving aside the deeper long-term deficiencies. With multiple negative trends acting in the same direction, the threat of secular stagnation should not be overlooked.","[Janacek, Kamil] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic; [Janackova, Stanislava] Inst Vaclava Klause, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Janácek, K (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.",kamil.janacek@vse.cz; slavka.janackova@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,5,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Conventional four-wheeled tractors (4WTs) are not feasible for many smallholders owing to their high capital costs, unsuitability for fragmented holdings as well as topography and slope. More appropriate technologies are needed such as two-wheeled tractors (2WTs) and their requisite accessories. Our findings show that opportunities exist for the introduction of 2WTs in maize based systems through service provider models combining a number of operations that can be offered throughout the year and targeted to niche areas where 4WT access is unlikely.

Based on the data aggregated from the Croatian Financial Agency (FINA) for the period of 2007-2017, cumulative financial statements are generated for the entire hotel industry. The findings of ratio analysis reveal that although hotel companies have experienced strong growth in real estate investments and capital reserves accumulation during the period, the overall hotel industry in Croatia is nevertheless highly leveraged, operationally inefficient, unprofitable and plagued with liquidity problems. Most of these issues can be attributed to the unfinished transition of select hotel companies to a free market economy. The study's results are relevant both for the scientific and the professional field, as empirical analyses of financial performance of the domestic hotel industry have been scarce to date. In that respect, this has been a first study of its sort conducted for the hotel industry in Croatia which addresses the lack of existing literature and is expected to provoke similar studies in the future.","[Karanovic, Goran] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Opatija, Croatia; [Karanovic, Bisera] PAR Univ Coll, Trg Rijecke Rezolucije 4, Rijeka, Croatia; [Stambuk, Ana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Karanovic, G (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Opatija, Croatia.",gorank@fthm.hr,"Štambuk, Ana/Y-9689-2018; Karanovic, Goran/H-1617-2019","Štambuk, Ana/0000-0002-5138-1662; Karanovic, Goran/0000-0002-6515-935X",University of Rijeka [ZP UNIRI 2/17],University of Rijeka,"This paper has been financially supported by the University of Rijeka, for the project ZP UNIRI 2/17.",,33,2,2,1,3,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,88,106,,10.18502/kss.v3i10.3532,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7SJ,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455399000006,0

These unique characteristics lead us to investigate whether managers change their firms' accounting policy to protect their pension plans when their firms face imminent default risk. Identifying a firm's default risk with various proxies, we find that managers with executive pension plans are more likely to engage in income-increasing earnings management during a year of high default risk as compared to managers without such pension plans. The result remains robust with the use of propensity score matching and two-stage least squares regression analysis to alleviate the endogeneity issues in our hypothesized relationships.

Based on a simple perpetual discounted cash flow model, we argue that the valuation will be lower for a target with higher information uncertainty and acquiring a target with high information uncertainty can potentially create value for an acquirer's shareholders. The empirical findings lend support to our arguments. Specifically, we observe that a target's valuation multiple obtained from an acquirer is negatively correlated with the target's information uncertainty level. An acquirer's announcement return is negatively correlated with the valuation multiple given to the target but positively correlated with the target's information uncertainty level.

This paper analyses the relation between commuting and subjective well-being by considering several cognitive (e.g., satisfaction with family life, leisure, income, work, health) and affective (e.g., happiness, anger, worry, sadness) components of subjective well-being. Fixed-effects models are estimated with German Socio-Economic Panel data for the period 2007-2013. In contrast to previous papers in the literature, according to which commuting is bad for overall life satisfaction, we find no evidence that commuting in general is associated with a lower life satisfaction. Rather, it appears that longer commutes are only related to lower satisfaction with particular life domains, especially family life and leisure time. Time spent on housework, child care as well as physical and leisure activities mediate the association between commuting and well-being.","[Lorenz, Olga] Trier Univ, Inst Labour Law & Ind Relat European Union, IAAEU, Campus 2, D-54286 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Lorenz, O (通讯作者)，Trier Univ, Inst Labour Law & Ind Relat European Union, IAAEU, Campus 2, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",lorenz@iaaeu.de,,,,,,,83,77,79,11,67,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

From colonial times, onward, government institutions have dissolved local political orders and territorialized and reordered spatial frontiers. Local resource users, on the other hand, have aligned with, or undermined, the spatial ordering. We analyze government-citizen encounters in West Java and the dynamics of recognition in the fields of government territorialization, taxation, local organization, and identity politics. Spatial categories are struggled over, and groups of actors seek to legitimate their presence, their activities, and their resource use by occupation, mapping, and construction of public infrastructure. In the case of conservation in the Mount Halimun-Salak National Park, we find that rather than one overarching recognition of a single direct spatial claim to property, a web of direct and indirect claims for recognition emerges between and among claimants and institutions. If direct claims to resources are impossible to pursue, people lodge indirect claims. In everyday situations, indirect recognition can perform important legal and political work. After the authoritarian New Order regime, in particular, claims to citizenship worked as indirect property claims, and indirect recognition of such claims are important because they serve as pragmatic proxies for formal property rights. Two case studies examine how people struggle over the past, negotiating the constraints of social propriety for legitimation and indirect recognition of their claims. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

From approx. 5% of US GDP level, China grows to 26% and India to 11% of current US levels. The ratio of foreign trade to GDP is similar for both countries as well as capital flows to GDP. So why did China outperform India twice in terms of GDP growth and why is India first now catching up? This is of extreme relevance in relation to implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030 in which the objective is to eradicate poverty and to enhance economic growth in developing countries. The reduction of poverty in shortest time was best mastered by China over the last 30 years; hence, to put developing countries on the same track is the beginning of the path of their development. A theoretical comparison analysis, backed by observations of China, India, Uganda, and Chad GDP as well as their population growths, indicates that population growth is the major negative enabler of GDP growth per capita of developing countries. Using our drafted methodology, we can assess if certain levels of development aid will be sufficient to overcome the negative GDP per capita pull driven by overpopulation and calculate how much development aid is needed to get countries on sustainable GDP per capita growth path.

The results of a CGE analysis largely depend on the database, policy shock and elasticities. Trade elasticities, such as the Armington elasticities, play a central role in CGE models to determine the demand substitution between commodities from different sources as a result of changes in relative prices. Because of their role, modellers are keen to know the correct elasticities for use in CGE models. Despite their importance, elasticities for South African agricultural commodities are outdated, leaving researchers to rely on value judgements. We address this limitation by estimating the Armington and export supply elasticities for individual and aggregate agricultural commodities using updated time-series data (1980-2016). The results for the two sets of trade elasticities show that estimates for an aggregate agriculture tend to be inelastic compared to estimates for an individual product, indicating a higher sensitivity of products to relative price changes. The Armington estimates were found to be closer to unity for the majority of products, suggesting that agricultural imports are imperfect substitutes for domestic products. The export supply elasticities for grains were found to be more elastic than for fruit and meat, implying that domestic grain production is relatively more responsive to price changes in the export markets. The long-run estimates for the two sets of elasticities were found to be larger than the short-run estimates for all agricultural products.","[Ntombela, S.

The results of the study indicate that there was a rapid decline in the development of Ukraine's financial system during 2010-2015 and positive tendency in the development of Polish financial system. The results of the paper deny the findings of some researchers that in countries with a less developed financial system, the role of external financing is lower. The results of the study showed that the dependence of Ukrainian farms on external financing increased significantly during 2010-2015. The main feature was that external financing grew not due to an increase in bank loans but due to informal sources. Contrary to Ukraine in Poland, the study revealed a strong statistical relationship between the integral indicators of the financial system and indicators characterizing the financing patterns of agricultural enterprises. This gives some arguments in favour of the confirmation of the hypothesis that the stable development of the financial system in advanced economies, generates a gradual increase the role of long-term debt and perpetuates its own sources of financing of agricultural enterprises.","[Oliynyk-Dunn, Olena] Natl Univ Life & Environm Sci Ukraine, Fac Econ, Dept Banking, Kiev, Ukraine; [Adamenko, Viktor] Kyiv Natl Univ Trade & Econ, Fac Econ Management & Psychol, Dept Econ & Business Finance, Kiev, Ukraine",National University of Life & Environmental Sciences of Ukraine; State University of Trade & Economics,"Oliynyk-Dunn, O (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Life & Environm Sci Ukraine, Fac Econ, Dept Banking, Kiev, Ukraine.",,"Adamenko, Victor/N-1953-2016","Adamenko, Victor/0000-0002-6908-6522",,,,,13,2,2,0,1,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

The importance of cosmetics has increased, as many people want to stay young and look attractive. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating effect of social media on the consumer behavior and intention to purchase the cosmetic product in Brunei Darussalam based on Theory of planned behavior (TPB). Consumer behavior is determined by the individual's intention to perform the behavior, intention is determined by attitudes toward the behavior, which are informed by beliefs needed to engage in the behavior; subjective norm, the social pressures to perform or not to perform the behavior and perceived behavioral control refers to people's perceptions of their ability to perform a given behavior. The study adopted a descriptive research design in form of cross-sectional and survey in nature. A sample size of one hundred and eighty-seven (187) respondents drawn from Brunei Muara district of Brunei Darussalam. Stratified random sampling was used as all the respondents were drawn from different levels or strata within the district. Structured questionnaires were used for data collection with help of Personal Research Assistant as they were easy to administer and cheap in terms of cost and time by hand delivery. Data was collected and analyzed by use of Structural Equation Modelling - Smart Partial Least Square SEM - PLS. The reliability, content validity, discriminant validity and convergent validity are determined from the measurement model while structural model assessment, was done to test the significance of path coefficients for hypothesis testing of direct and indirect relationships. The results of the findings revealed that there is a strong significant positive impact on attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control on consumer intention/buying behavior to purchase cosmetic products. Also, the social media has a significant positive mediating effect on consumer behavior and intention to purchase the cosmetic product in Brunei Darussalam. The conclusion of the findings was that the cosmetic products quality, price, friends, and acquaintances are important factors that will change the consumer behavior unexpectedly. Based on the findings, the results stated that the consumer buying behavior on cosmetic products through social media can be predicted by attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. The study made a recommendation and suggestion for future research.","[Ringim, Kabiru Jinjiri] Univ Teknol Brunei, Mukim Gadong A, Brunei; [Reni, Andi] Hasanuddin Univ, Makassar, Indonesia",University of Technology Brunei; Universitas Hasanuddin,"Ringim, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Brunei, Mukim Gadong A, Brunei.",kabiru.ringim@utb.edu.bn; andirenireni@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,0,0,4,12,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-786-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,92.0,,,,,,291,308,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP5ZL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000558679400033,0

Cobalt and lithium are source of power batteries that are utilized in electric cars. Tesla Motors Inc. company became a key player on electric vehicles market. The stability of production of electric vehicles and their subsequent commercialization is affected by many risk factors. The shortage of renewal of cobalt and lithium, limited resources and the instability of some supplier countries like D. R. of Congo are some of them. The dependence of Tesla Motors Inc. on these two metals is evident. In addition to this, the profit of Tesla Motors Inc. reached negative values despite of annual revenue growth. Operating costs including raw materials for batteries (lithium cobalt included) grew proportionately. The aim of this paper is to model prices shocks of cobalt and lithium on Tesla Motors Inc. volatility. In this paper, the Dynamic Conditional Correlations model has been estimated to examine potential effects of cobalt and lithium price fluctuations on volatility of Tesla shares. The results of estimated models suggested that changes in lithium price have statistically significant impact on volatility of Tesla Motors Inc. shares during testing period of 2013-2017. In the case of cobalt prices fluctuations, the hypothesis of significant impact on Tesla Motors Inc. volatility can be rejected.","[Seda, Petr] Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Carlos Casas-Rosal, Jose; Antonio Jimber Del Rio, Juan; Ceular Villamandos, Nuria] Univ Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain",Technical University of Ostrava; Universidad de Cordoba,"Seda, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",petr.seda@vsb.cz; jcasas@uco.es; jjimber@uco.es; nuria.ceular@uco.es,"Jimber-Del Río, Juan Antonio/Q-4343-2019; Seďa, Petr/X-1866-2018; Casas del Rosal, José Carlos/S-6406-2018; Villamandos, Nuria Ceular/B-4219-2009","Jimber-Del Río, Juan Antonio/0000-0001-6886-7434; Seďa, Petr/0000-0002-2205-6377; Casas del Rosal, José Carlos/0000-0002-6954-6517; Villamandos, Nuria Ceular/0000-0003-2055-5487",,,,,15,0,0,1,22,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-7-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,172,181,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM3BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461826900016,0

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of target-country related factors on international market selection of NPOs. Design/methodology/approach - Analysis is based on a logistic regression procedure using a self-compiled data set of 2,440 observations of de-facto entry or non-entry occurrences made by 19 large development-focused NPOs. Findings - The study reveals that NPOs select target markets that are less developed, characterized by greater risk profiles, where other NPOs tend to cluster, and those that are preferred by their home-country governments. Moreover, findings suggest that with respect to institutional strength, NPOs balance mission to help strengthen institutions where needed, and avoidance of environments with extremely dysfunctional institutions, hence opting to operate in environments with medium levels of institutional strength. Research limitations/implications - The study only looked at external environmental factors, it must be acknowledged that a more complete understanding of NPO market selection decisions must also include variables internal to the organization. Further the study is based on a sample of NPOs dealing with poverty alleviation, which limits the generalization. Finally, the use of data from secondary sources creates its own limitations. Originality/value - This study represents one of the few cross country studies done on the area, thus contributing for the development of the field.","[Sirisena, Amila Buddhika; Shneor, Rotem] Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Dept Management, Kristiansand, Norway",University of Agder,"Sirisena, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Dept Management, Kristiansand, Norway.",amila.b.sirisena@uia.no,"Shneor, Rotem/C-3544-2011","Shneor, Rotem/0000-0001-9053-568X",,,,,133,6,7,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Utilizing a high-frequency dataset, with broker identifiers enabling classification of trades executed through institutional and retail brokers, the author investigates all trades submitted on the Australian Securities Exchange over the period of December 2007 to December 2014. The author identifies a rapid, asymmetric, price adjustment to the announcement, which is larger when the target rate decision results in lower-than-expected rates, and is accompanied by a sharp increase in market activity. Institutional brokers tend to execute trades more quickly following the announcement, and target more liquid large-cap stocks. Trades executed through institutional brokers appear to be more profitable, although profits are concentrated in buy trades. The evidence supports the notion that institutional investors have an advantage in processing the news resulting from target rate decisions.","[Smales, Lee A.] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box 41987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Smales, LA (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box 41987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",lee.smales@curtin.edu.au,,"Smales, Lee/0000-0002-9094-9089",Curtin Business School JPS,Curtin Business School JPS,The author received funding support from the Curtin Business School JPS Scheme.,,43,2,2,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

From a production-related and environmental protection point of view, consumer demands cannot be implemented without conflicts. Trade-offs are induced in different dimensions, for example between animal welfare, climate protection and profitability. Little is known about consumer reaction to trade-offs in broiler production. With the help of ten 90-minute half structured guideline-based interviews, which were supported by images, it was investigated if consumers were aware of the trade-offs in broiler production systems. During these interviews, participants were shown pictures of both, floor systems with litter and free-range housing. Afterward they were given short, neutral texts with information to help illustrating the trade-offs. The results show that consumer awareness regarding trade-offs in broiler production systems hardly exists. Furthermore, reactions of citizens when confronted with trade-offs were analyzed. The decision process to solve the trade-offs problems was heterogeneous and dominated by animal welfare preferences. In general, participants' decision behavior was different between the positively framed (outdoor access) and the negatively framed (floor system with litter) system. Participants' consideration regarding the negative system (floor system with litter) was very emotional in most cases. Furthermore, cognitive dissonances and suppression could be observed. In contrast, the pros and cons of the positively framed system (outdoor access) were evaluated more rational, with goal dominance for animal welfare arguments.","[Sonntag, Winnie Isabel; Golze, Stefan; Spiller, Achim; von Meyer-Hofer, Marie] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Sonntag, WI (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung Mkt Lebenmitt, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",winnie.sonntag@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,,,,,90,4,4,0,13,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

This paper provides a brief historical review of efforts dealing with capital markets emphasizing their efficiency and counter-tendencies whose goal was to falsify the assumption of independence of returns and their normal distribution. This paper applies a measure of long-range dependence rediscovered and promoted by Mandelbrot to daily returns of 27 selected stock indices. This measure is called Hurst exponent and was estimated using rescaled range analysis. The results are in line with similar papers stating that the series of daily returns are prevailingly persistent which implies the presence of local trends.

This research investigated the potential barriers to big data integration within businesses, and sought to understand how these could be removed. In order to achieve an in depth understanding, an interview based approach was used. A wide range of business sources were examined to further understand the gaps identified by previous research. Primary research took the form of in-depth interviews. Respondents were carefully selected based on industry knowledge and experience, working for companies such as Ebiquity PLC, Satalia and Barclays. The interviews were used to compare and contrast the experts' opinions and establish whether the key themes identified in the literature held true in the primary research. This approach enabled real insight to be gathered in order to concisely examine and critique the current literature as well as enabled further themes to be investigated. This investigation found how critical big data is becoming to business success, including understanding an emerging gulf between those who have adopted data big sets and those who have not. It was also understood that, on the whole, knowledge and understanding is lagging far behind benchmarks set by some businesses.

To fully account for the increasing trends in life expectancies, we implemented a custom extrapolation model for mortality rates, based on deep learning techniques. Our results show that the recent reforms can effectively stave off the pension crisis and bring back the system on a sounder fiscal footing. At the same time, increasingly more workers can expect to spend greater share of their lifespan in retirement, despite the eligibility age rises. The population ageing due to the postponement of death until advanced old age often occurs with the compression of morbidity, and thus will not, perforce, intrinsically strain healthcare costs. To a lesser degree, the future pension cost dependency ratio will depend also on the post-Brexit relations between the UK and the EU, with soft alignment on the free movement lowering the relative cost of the pension system compared to the hard one.

This study addressed a gap in literature by investigating the correlation between demand for taxi, land use patterns, and accessibility to other modes using detailed GPS and GIS information collected from the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. The results of the models showed a strong link between demand for taxi, land use patterns, and accessibility to other modes. Mixed land use did not show a strong correlation with taxi demand. The study also found that the taxi mode is likely to complement metro trips, but compete with bus trips, although both of these modes of travel are considered public transit. Airport trips were found to be the most important source for taxi travel. These findings were further supported by the time-of-day and seasonality analysis.","[Yang, Zhuo; Zhu, Shanjiang] Sid & Reva Dewberry Dept Civil Environm & Infrast, 400 Univ Dr,MS 6C1, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Franz, Mark L.; Mahmoudi, Jina; Nasri, Arefeh; Zhang, Lei] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1173 Glenn Martin Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Yang, Zhuo; Zhu, Shanjiang] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Franz, Mark L.] Ctr Adv Transportat Technol Lab, College Pk, MD USA; [Mahmoudi, Jina; Nasri, Arefeh] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zhang, Lei] Natl Transportat Ctr, Baltimore, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; George Mason University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Franz, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5000 Coll Ave, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",zyang10@gmu.edu; mfranzl@umd.edu; szhu3@gmu.edu; zhina@umd.edu; aanasri@umd.edu; lei@umd.edu,,,TransInfo UTC; National Transportation Center at the University of Maryland [DTRT13-G-UTC30]; US Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration through a BAA [DTFH6116C00001],TransInfo UTC; National Transportation Center at the University of Maryland; US Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration through a BAA,"The research team thanks the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG) and District of Columbia Department of For Hire Vehicles for sharing their valuable data for this study.

However, the empirical evidence strongly suggests that additional capacity only makes congestion worse. This study analyzes the differential effects of additional freeway capacity versus additional arterial capacity on vehicle kilometers of travel (VKT) in metropolitan areas across the U.S. The analysis uses vehicle data and household data from the 2001 and the 2009 National Household Travel Surveys (NHTS) and includes stock and flow measures of road capacity, road congestion, commuter demand, and economic growth for metropolitan areas. Taking into account differences between metropolitan areas on each measure, the study adopts a novel multilevel model approach to estimate how additional capacity affects VKT. Results indicate that adding more arterial capacity slightly decreases VKT over a lag period from six years (1995 to 2001) to eight years (2001 to 2009), probably because adding arterials shortens routes between origins and destinations more so than adding freeways. Consistent with expectations, VKT is lower in more congested metropolitan areas, and in metropolitan areas that got more congested. Results also indicate that rebound effects (higher fuel-economy vehicles are driven much more than lower fuel-economy vehicles) will at least partially offset the demand management benefits of (gasoline) price sensitivity (higher gasoline prices decrease VKT).","[Zolnik, Edmund J.] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3351 Fairfax Dr,MS 3B1, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Zolnik, EJ (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3351 Fairfax Dr,MS 3B1, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",ezolnik@gmu.edu,,,,,,,51,4,4,0,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Cointegration among CO2 emissions, militarization, energy consumption and economic growth was determined by using panel Johansen and panel autoregressive distributed lag (PARDL) methods. Further, the panel trivariate causality test was applied and unidirectional causalities from militarization to CO2 emissions and from energy consumption to CO2 emissions were found. The evidence of bidirectional causality between per capita GDP and militarization, between per capita GDP and energy consumption, and between energy consumption and militarization was determined.

In contrast to prior research from the US, CSR reporting in China is associated with greater earnings management. Results suggest that Chinese firms use CSR reporting as a strategic device for window dressing, and that auditors charge higher fees in response to heightened audit risk and greater audit effort. Further, the positive effects of CSR reporting on audit fees and earnings management are more significant for non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) than for state-owned enterprises, which suggests that non-SOEs have not fully embraced the principles of CSR and essentially use CSR reporting to create the appearance of legitimacy. In additional tests, we find that non-SOEs with more highly rated CSR performance or longer CSR reports are associated with lower audit fees and less earnings management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Respondents were asked directly what they would do under this scenario. Using the resulting stated choice data we find that respondents would on average reduce spending by 18.2 percent before retirement and 20.4 percent after retirement. About 34.1% of respondents state they would definitely work longer and they would postpone claiming Social Security by 1.1 years. We investigate how working longer and claiming Social Security later would compensate partially for the loss in benefits among the individuals who are currently working, under the assumption that individuals retire and claim at the same time. Individuals would increase their Social Security benefits from the post-reform level due to additional earnings entering the benefit calculation and a smaller early claiming penalty (or higher delayed claiming credit). As a result, the Social Security benefit people would receive would drop on average by 21 rather than 30 percent. Still, the net financial loss, even after accounting for additional earnings, is sizeable for individuals in the lowest wealth tertile. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper identifies conceptual issues in the implementation of the revealed-preference approach to nonpoint-source pollution and provides methods to overcome them. We focus on the common second-best setting where emissions are not measurable at the source and pollution reduction is incentivized indirectly through payments tied to practice adoption. First, we show through simulation that in discrete choice models estimated on microdata, the use of predicted opportunity costs provides an erroneous estimate of underlying abatement costs. We then focus on two metrics commonly used to represent the marginal social costs of abatement actions, namely, average and marginal program expenditures incurred by the regulating agency. We show theoretically and empirically that these metrics generally fail to reveal underlying social costs.","[Garnache, Cloe] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Merel, Pierre R.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA USA",Michigan State University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Garnache, C (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",garnache@msu.edu,,,,,,,39,0,0,1,29,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

This article examines the importance of ALMP targeted at entrepreneurship to explain cross-country differences in aggregate entrepreneurship rate. By using GEM data over the period 2002-2013 on OECD countries, our results show a positive impact of ALMP on the rate of necessity entrepreneurship but no significant effect on the rate of opportunity entrepreneurship. We further established that generous unemployment benefits reduce the positive outcome of ALMP on the aggregate rate of necessity entrepreneurship. Moreover, because most businesses started out of necessity do not create new jobs, we find that the economic spin-off of such programs in terms of unemployment reduction is very limited.","[Laffineur, Catherine] Univ Cote dAzur, GREDEG, CNRS, Nice, France; [Laffineur, Catherine; Barbosa, Saulo Dubard; Fayolle, Alain; Nziali, Emeran] EM Lyon, 23 Ave Guy de Collongue, F-69130 Ecully, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); emlyon business school,"Laffineur, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cote dAzur, GREDEG, CNRS, Nice, France.",laffineur@em-lyon.com; barbosa@em-lyon.com; fayolle@em-lyon.com,"Dubard Barbosa, Saulo/ABC-2078-2020","Dubard Barbosa, Saulo/0000-0001-7246-5200",,,,,106,20,21,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Our research is based on a system dynamics microsimulation of private households' investment decisions for heating systems to the year 2030. By accounting for household-specific characteristics, we investigate the welfare costs of different abatement policies in terms of the compensating variation and the excess burden. We investigate two policies: (i) a carbon tax and (ii) subsidies on heating system investments. We deduce abatement cost curves for both policies by simulating welfare costs and greenhouse gas emissions to the year 2030. We find that (i) welfare-based abatement costs are generally higher than pure technical equipment costs; (ii) given utility maximizing households a carbon tax is the most welfare-efficient policy and; (iii) if households are not utility maximizing, a subsidy on investments may have lower marginal greenhouse gas abatement costs than a carbon tax.","[Loeffler, Caroline; Hecking, Harald] Univ Cologne EWI, Inst Energy Econ, Vogelsanger Str 321, D-50827 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Hecking, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne EWI, Inst Energy Econ, Vogelsanger Str 321, D-50827 Cologne, Germany.",c.loeffler.de@gmail.com; Harald.Hecking@googlemail.com,,,,,,,54,4,4,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

More specifically, it studies the effects of leading-by-example and emotional leadership in a behavioral experiment, but also theoretically. In this experiment leaders lead-by-example by contributing publicly to the contest before followers and can show emotional leadership by selecting basic emotions that are subsequently evoked in their followers. Emotions are evoked in this study by showing specially selected and validated movie clips. Overall, we find that leaders contribute more than followers and that leading-by example as well as emotional leadership have a significant effect on the behavior of followers. Although, leaders do not always use these mechanisms wisely. This behavior contrasts strikingly with the Nash equilibrium predictions. Furthermore, we find that both leaders and followers contribute more then predicted by a standard Nash equilibrium. These results are shown to be in line with the affective tie model of van Dijk and van Winden (1997), the imitation model of Cartwright and Patel (2010), and a psychological costs model of Dufwenberg, Gachter, and Hennig-Schmidt (2011).

The Bohai Bay Rim port cluster shows the highest PTEE with a mean value of 0.601, followed by the Southern and Pearl River Delta port duster, and the Yangtze River Delta port cluster with the lowest efficiency and a mean value of 0.537. The effect of input inefficiency on the PTEE of the eight container ports is greater than that of output inefficiency. CO2 inefficiency is 0.226 in Tianjin port but is as high as 0.206 in Ningbo port. In addition, Guangzhou and Dalian ports show low CO2 inefficiency of below 0.1. Different container ports present dissimilar CO2 emission reduction potentials. Most container ports exhibit excessive CO2 emissions in significantly different levels.

We take the case of water purification technologies in India, where the technologies are still evolving, and analyze the path dependence implications of their evolution by taking the case of urban households with piped water supply.

An MR method is developed that uses multiple learning scenarios, for example about sea level rise or river peak flow development, to analyse effects of changes in information on optimal investment in flood protection. To illustrate the method, optimal dike height and floodplain development are studied in a conceptual model, and conventional and adaptive MR solutions are compared. A dynamic application of the MR decision criterion allows investments to be changed after new information on climate change impacts, which has an effect on today's optimal investments. The results suggest that adaptive MR solutions are more robust than the solutions obtained from a conventional MR analysis of investments in flood protection. Moreover, adaptive MR analysis with multiple learning scenarios is more general and contains conventional MR analysis as a special case.","[van der Pol, T.

A substantial literature has investigated informal insurance schemes, which trigger supporting exchanges after negative shocks have occurred. This paper is instead concerned with material exchanges that take place before shocks occur, which has received far less attention in the economic literature. We employ a dataset of 51 rural villages in The Gambia, and we focus on access to the most important production resource in our context land. We find that poor households are more likely to receive seasonal land usage rights. We also show that these exchanges are more likely to occur in villages where land is abundant and where ethnic fractionalization is low. We argue that this is consistent with the existing qualitative evidence, which argues that informal exchange is thought to be disappearing due to population increases and ethnic fractionalization. Our findings highlight the importance of attention to the local (i.e., village-level) context for assessing welfare and conducting effective policy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

I find that, contrary to the literature from country-level case studies, longterm exposure to conflict reduces households' likelihood of receiving any remittances at all, as well as the average amounts of remittances received. However for households in the lowest food consumption expenditure quintile, conflict has a positive effect on the likelihood of remittance receipts, which provides evidence for the existence of heterogeneous effects as well as a significant micro macro gap in understanding the causal effects of conflict on remittance receipts.

We assume that the earnings shock of an asset follows a random walk model with and without drift to incorporate the impact of financial crises. We further assume the earning shock follows an exponential family distribution to accommodate symmetric as well as asymmetric information. By using this model setting, we develop some properties on the expected earnings shock and its volatility, and establish properties of investor behavior on the stock price and its volatility during financial crises and the subsequent recovery. Thereafter, we develop properties to explain excess volatility, short-term underreaction, long-term overreaction, and their magnitude effects during financial crises and the subsequent recovery. We also explain why behavioral finance theory could be used to explain many of the asset pricing anomalies, but traditional asset pricing models cannot achieve this aim. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Using data from the Ghana Living Standard Survey round 6 (GLSS 6), we estimate a three-step sequential logit model for the determinants of secondary school enrollment and its dependence on completing primary school. We find that family resources such as parental education, household income and the gender of the head of the household play a role in households' child schooling decisions. Educated parents are relatively more likely to enroll their children in primary school and keep them in school until they complete primary education. As well, we show that educated parents do not promote a gender-biased investment in the schooling of children at the primary level. While household welfare does not influence children's entry into primary school importantly, their completion of primary school depends on household welfare. The study sheds more light on the pro-male bias phenomenon regarding entry into primary school and primary school completion. Policies to promote the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 4 in Ghana must be grade sensitive.","[Iddrisu, Abdul Malik; Danquah, Michael; Quartey, Peter] Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, POB LG 57, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Quartey, Peter] Inst Stat Social & Econ Res, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Danquah, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, POB LG 57, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",mdanquah@ug.edu.gh,"Quartey, Peter/AAR-9777-2021","Quartey, Peter/0000-0002-7347-7219",,,,,45,9,10,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

For a given debt level, higher asset prices require entrepreneurs to invest more of their own funds.

Complex statements are more difficult to interpret and may be construed in different ways by different agents. This creates heterogeneity of beliefs among market participants that manifests in increased market activity. We introduce novel measures of linguistic complexity (readability and word count) for the FOMC statements that accompany monetary policy decisions. The empirical evidence shows that monetary policy surprises have a significant impact on financial markets, and clearly demonstrates that more complex language significantly increases the trading volume, and volatility of returns, in stock, bond, and currency markets. We also establish that financial markets are more responsive to monetary policy decisions (and the language of those statements) during recession. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a province- and industry-level innovation dataset combined with regional loan structure in Chinese credit market during 19992007, we identify two measures to proxy Chinese banking structure, the long-term vs. short-term bank loans and the Big-Four vs. non-Big-Four banks, which affect technological innovation. We show that industries that are more dependent on external finance exhibit disproportionally higher level of innovation in provinces with a larger share of the long-term bank loan market. However, a larger share of the short-term bank loan market appears to discourage innovation in industries with more dependence on external finance. Moreover, the positive effect of the long-term bank loans on innovation is strengthened in provinces with a higher level of market share of the non Big-Four banks, whereas the negative effect of the short-term bank loans on innovation is mitigated in those provinces.

Using data from field observations, 86 interviews, and 13 focus group discussions from five municipalities, the research finds that cross-scale activities, including local plans and multi-stakeholder forums, and municipal budgeting processes, influence adaptation and mitigation to climate change in smallholder farming systems. Furthermore, using matrix analysis and stakeholder responses, we identify interactions, synergies, conflicts, and potential co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation, and food production practices. The analysis of climate-resiliency field school practices shows that the addition of livelihood outcomes to smallholder farming landscapes strengthen adaptation, mitigation, and food production outcomes (and vice versa). Climate-resiliency Field Schools have promoted the practice of organic farming, various systems for rice intensification, and the establishment of community seed banks. Other practices, such as soil conservation, reforestation, and agroforestry, have been used in Mindanao to maintain carbon stocks while increasing crop production. Climate-resiliency Field Schools serve as a multilevel institutional platform where farmers can access climate information, which they can use to improve farm planning (i.e., choices of crops, timing of farm preparation, and harvest). The research findings suggest that climate-smart interventions are highly location-specific, technically rigorous, involve knowledge-intensive processes, and are influenced by the knowledge and capacities of local farming communities and implementing partners. We conclude with some suggestions for the design of programs, and the types of interventions that are required to sustain and ultimately scale up efforts to enhance climate-smart agriculture.

However, research on the relationships between compliance and age, sex, education as well as income level shows inconsistent results, both regarding the direction of the relationship and its size. The current meta-analyses target to merge findings in survey studies on age, sex, education, and income and estimate the strength of the impact on compliance by taking into account geographical regions. In four meta-analyses, comprising 459 samples (N = 614,286) from 111 countries published between 1958 and 2012, average estimated effect sizes were small, ranging from r = 0.12 for the relationship between compliance and age, r = 0.06 for sex, r = 0.02 for education to r = 0.04 for income. These effects are more pronounced in Western countries. It thus appears sociodemographic characteristics have little impact on compliance, but nevertheless should be controlled for in tax research.

We analyze how these neoliberal reforms were implemented from the top-down by the World Bank and the national government, as well as how from the grassroots water users negotiated these policies and their implementation at local and national level. We show that these sectoral reforms were politically contested as it changed roles, responsibilities, and authority at different scales of governance. This is evidenced by the fact that locally the relationships between water users, differently scaled state agencies, and broader networks greatly determined how water users associations negotiated the irrigation management transfer program as well as the development of new water policies. Our analysis highlights how the alliances that differently positioned actors create to navigate water policy implementation shape the scalar and the political dimensions of sectoral reforms. It shows that actors need multi-scalar networks of support to develop political leverage, overcome opposition, and materialize projects in the water governance domain. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper uses linear panel data models with various control variables to investigate how the power of the government official in an anticorruption agency may impact the effectiveness of anticorruption campaign in China. Two types of political power are considered. Formal power is obtained when the Discipline Inspection Secretary is also named as a Vice Party Secretary of the province whereas informal power arises when the Secretary used to work with the Party Secretary of the province. It is found that both the formal and informal power of the Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's Discipline Inspection Commission (i.e., the head of the anticorruption agency) help enhance the number of corruption cases under investigation. This result offers evidence to further explore how and why the anticorruption enforcement officials play their roles in a developing transitional country. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It first provides a conceptual analysis of the interplay between changes (a) in the organizational routines of shipping lines as part of alliances, (b) the organizational routines at the level of terminal operations (i.e. direct carrier equity involvement in terminal operations) and (c) in port calling patterns. The empirical part examines the relationship between port choice of alliance members and the direct involvement of shipping lines in container terminals in North-West European ports. It does so using binary and non-binary data on the evolution of calling patterns on the North Europe-Far East trade from 2006 to 2017. In addition, the changes in both alliance formation during that period and in the container terminal involvement of carriers in North West European ports are addressed. By examining the relationship between port calling patterns of alliances and the terminal interests of alliance members, the paper addresses an under-researched theme in the extant literature on port choice/selection by carriers. The paper is also of value to port managers and shipping professionals in view of port strategy and planning decisions, as well as shipping strategy formulation.","[Notteboom, Theo E.] Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, CEMIL, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Notteboom, Theo E.] Univ Ghent, Fac Law, Maritime Inst, Ghent, Belgium; [Notteboom, Theo E.] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Antwerp, Belgium; [Notteboom, Theo E.] Antwerp Maritime Acad, Antwerp, Belgium; [Parola, Francesco; Satta, Giovanni] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ & Business, Genoa, Italy; [Pallis, Athanasios A.] Univ Aegean, Dept Shipping Trade & Transport, Aegean, Greece",Shanghai Maritime University; Ghent University; University of Antwerp; University of Genoa; University of Aegean,"Notteboom, TE (通讯作者)，Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, CEMIL, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",theo.notteboom@ugent.be; parola@economia.unige.it; giovanni.satta@economia.unige.it; apallis@aegean.gr,"Pallis, Athanasios A./B-1548-2008","Pallis, Athanasios A./0000-0003-3242-5081",,,,,49,84,93,6,79,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

But we continue to know little about the relationship between the rising top income shares and human wellbeing. Using data from 24 countries and years ranging from 2005 to 2013 in the Gallup World Poll and the World Income Database, this study examines the relationship between top income share and different dimensions of subjective wellbeing. The results are mixed, with the negative relationship between top income shares and average life ladder being driven largely by the European sub-sample. For the European countries, we also document evidence that top income is statistically significantly associated with lower average enjoyment and being well-rested yesterday, and higher average stress and sadness yesterday. Overall, our findings suggest that, at least for individuals in Europe, an economic policy that increases national incomes may have significant crowding-out effect on aggregate evaluative wellbeing if it only increases the share of income at the very top of income distribution. More generally, our results highlight the complex relationships between income inequality and subjective wellbeing across different countries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate that the taxable share of U.S. corporate equity has declined dramatically in recent years, from over 80 percent in 1965 to about 30 percent at present. We discuss the causes of these dramatic changes in the taxable share of corporate stock. Several factors explain the shift, including changes in retirement finance, demographic changes, changes in the prevalence of pass-through business organizations, and the increased globalization of capital markets. These findings are important for the development of corporate tax policy. Moving the capital tax burden to the individual income tax, as some have proposed, without reforming tax preferences that currently exempt much corporate equity from taxation under the individual income tax, would lead to a law revenue loss. These findings also have implications for other important questions in public economics, including the measurement of the cost of capital, the importance of capital gains lock-in effects, the consequences of changes in dividend taxation, and the nature of clientele effects.","[Burman, Leonard E.; Austin, Lydia] Urban Inst, Tax Policy Ctr, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Burman, Leonard E.] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Clausing, Kimberly A.] Reed Coll, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97202 USA",Urban Institute; Syracuse University; Reed College - Oregon,"Burman, LE (通讯作者)，Urban Inst, Tax Policy Ctr, Washington, DC 20037 USA.;Burman, LE (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",lburman@urban.org; clausing@reed.edu; laustin@urban.org,,,,,,,42,5,5,1,6,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

By using data from choice experiments that explicitly introduce uncertainty in harvest as a trip attribute, we specify and estimate different models of constant absolute risk aversion (CARA). With evidence that anglers exhibit disutility from randomness in the catch, we use our estimates to draw comparisons with standard linear models. We calibrate a model of the Northeast Region summer flounder fishery and run Monte Carlo experiments to simulate alternative policy strategies for enforcing the recreational total allowable catch (TAC). Our results show that risk aversion leads to different predictions on angler participation and welfare from those assuming risk neutrality. Unlike the case of risk neutrality, the same TAC enforced with different catch restrictions and season lengths results in different numbers of expected trips and welfare estimates under CARA preferences. It is the entire catch distribution rather than the mean catch that determines anglers' behavior and implied values. Under risk aversion for random catch, regulators may also find enforcement of harvest restrictions to be less costly. More broadly, our approach provides a consistent way to incorporate risk in quality attributes into the discrete choice framework that is pervasive in the literature on recreational demand modeling.","[Holzer, Jorge; McConnell, Kenneth] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 2200 Symons Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Holzer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 2200 Symons Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jholzer@umd.edu; tmcconn@umd.edu,"Holzer, Jorge G/A-8128-2015","Holzer, Jorge/0000-0001-8978-3459",,,,,59,6,9,0,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Empirically estimated for 12 international financial markets, the proposed risk-return trade-off is significantly positive even after controlling for time-varying higher moments. Moreover, the stochastic dominance test reveals that modeling time-varying skewness significantly lowers the level of the risk-return trade-off. More importantly, the empirical evidence shows that the risk-return trade-off is countercyclical in the U.S. markets, consistent with the theoretical habit-formation model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999), whereas the risk-return trade-offs in European and emerging markets appear to be procyclical over a 12-month horizon, but countercyclical for a shorter horizon of 3 months. Finally, common macroeconomic variables can significantly explain risk return trade-off dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Organizations from both the risk reduction and development fields are working to design programs that build risk understanding and risk perception to encourage protective action in communities that are often at risk from multiple, overlapping threats. We know little, however, about how individuals perceive and prioritize multiple hazards at once and how this relates to their adoption of protective action strategies in the developing world. Our work addresses environmental hazard risk perception in a multi-hazard context in eastern Uganda, with particular attention paid to the role that risk reduction and development organizations (RDOs) play in shaping risk perceptions, as well as their potential to influence protective action. To better understand risk prioritization, we used survey data from farming households to generate four indices reflecting several components of risk perception and to predict holistic risk perception through multivariate regression analysis. Our study finds that the factors shaping smallholder risk perception vary among hazards within the study population and that characteristics of both hazards and individuals are important. The regression analysis also reveals a surprising relationship between risk perception, self-efficacy, and protective action. Our findings suggest that risk reduction and development programs can play an important role in affecting both risk perception and the capacity of smallholders to respond to environmental threats. Our work adds to the growing body of literature on how people perceive and respond to risk in a multi-hazard environment, a context increasingly common in a changing world. Improved understanding of how RDO programs in the developing world are engaging with and influencing risk mitigation in the multi-hazard environments is fundamental for reducing vulnerability.

Conversely, physical access (distance, travel time) was not associated with financial services attitudes or understanding.

One the most common valuation techniques declared in the IPO prospectus to determine the offer price is the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. We develop a 'reverse engineering' model to discover the short term profitability implied in the offer prices. We show that there is a significant optimistic bias in the estimation of future profitability compared to ex-post actual realization and the mean forecast error is substantially large. Yet we show that such error characterizes also the estimations carried out by analysts evaluating non-IPO companies. The forecast error is larger the faster has been the recent growth of the company, the higher is the leverage of the IPO firm, the more companies issued equity on the market. IPO companies generally exhibit better operating performance before the listing, with respect to comparable listed companies, while after the flotation they do not perform significantly different in term of return on invested capital. Pre-IPO book building activity plays a significant role in partially reducing the forecast error and revising expectations, while the market price of the first day of trading does not contain information for further reducing forecast errors.","[Bonaventura, Matteo; Giudici, Giancarlo] Politecn Milan, Sch Management, Via Lambruschini 4-B, I-20156 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Bonaventura, M (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Sch Management, Via Lambruschini 4-B, I-20156 Milan, Italy.",matteo.bonaventura@mail.polimi.it; giancarlo.giudici@polimi.it,,,,,,,34,10,10,1,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

We find significant and robust transmission effects from sovereign risk to domestic insurers. The impact on insurers is not significantly different from that on banks but larger than for non-financial firms. We find that systemically important insurers are more closely linked to the domestic sovereign.

Using both revealed and stated preference approaches, it is estimated that the park provides recreational benefits of US$35 per person for on-site respondents and US$14 for off-site respondents per visit to the park. Given that over one million people visit the lake and its parks every year, based on different scenarios, the annual estimated amenity value of the lake ranges from INR1.76bn (US$29m) to INR3.48bn (US$58m). Thus it is recommended that park authorities double the access fee to the park from the current INR10 (US$0.16). With this increase, the government can potentially earn US$0.36-1.48m in revenues per year, which will make it possible to improve the quality of the lake and its surroundings.","[Mishra, Prajna Paramita] Univ Hyderabad, Sch Econ, Hyderabad 500046, Andhra Pradesh, India",University of Hyderabad,"Mishra, PP (通讯作者)，Univ Hyderabad, Sch Econ, Hyderabad 500046, Andhra Pradesh, India.",prajnasujit@gmail.com,,"Mishra, Prajna/0000-0002-7623-2487",South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE),South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE),"The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE).

Subjects in the experiment encountered an uncertain risk of experiencing a negative income shock over multiple periods and were able to purchase insurance at the start of each period. Subjects engaged in greater risk taking, insuring less frequently, when faced with the same risk over multiple periods. Subjects weighted experienced outcomes proportionately, in a manner consistent with rational Bayesian inference and contrary to the theory that individuals exhibit recency bias. On the other hand, subjects assigned a greater weight to outcomes that directly impacted their earnings compared to observed outcomes that had no effect on income. Unexplained autocorrelation across subjects' choices suggests that inertia also plays an important role in repeated risk settings. I explore the relevance of these findings to public policy aimed at influencing market outcomes in the presence of infrequent environmental hazards.","[Royal, Andrew] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Resources for the Future,"Royal, A (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",royal@rff.org,,,,,,,53,5,5,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We exploit a corporate governance reform to address the endogeneity of board interlocks through exogenous changes mandated by the reform requiring a subset of firms to adjust their board structure. We rely on two difference-in-differences frameworks, comparing firms affected by the reform to unaffected firms as well as comparing within the set of firms that did not have to adjust their board structure those that still experienced an exogenous increase of their network size as a result of the reform to those that did not experience a change in their network size. We find that board interlocks have significant positive effects on both R&D and patenting. The evidence suggests that the impact on R&D is induced by information transmission through interlocks. The effect on patenting is driven by firms extending patent protection by patenting inventions abroad that they have already patented in India. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Competition reduces the need of board monitoring while complexity raises the need of board advising leading to the dominance of on-job-learning effect over entrenchment effect and a positive relationship between board tenure and firm performance.

Policymakers in Korea would therefore naturally benefit from an enriched understanding of the connections that exist between the Korean and global economies. We provide a detailed summary of these linkages using the generalised connectedness methodology introduced by Greenwood-Nimmo et al. (2015). Among our principal findings is the observation that domestic conditions are only generally important in the short to medium term, with overseas conditions exerting a dominant influence on Korea's economic prospects in the long run. The economy which exerts the strongest effect on Korea is the US, with a considerable role also played by global energy markets. Furthermore, we find that the global financial crisis is associated with greater connectedness of the Korean economy with advanced economies and its reduced connectedness with emerging economies.","[Park, Hail] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Shin, Yongcheol] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Kyung Hee University; University of York - UK,"Park, H (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",hailpark@khu.ac.kr; yongcheol.shin@york.ac.uk,,,Bank of Korea,Bank of Korea,"We are mostly grateful to the Editor and anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

A large part of this contribution stems from more efficient cross-plant allocation of resources, measured by the covariance between plant size and productivity, in the pool of plants in multi-plant firms compared to the pool of plants in single-plant firms. There is less dispersion in the marginal products of the inputs, and thus less misallocation, in industries in which multi-plant firms account for a larger share of output. The patterns found in the cross-plant distribution of productivity and size are also consistent with better allocative efficiency among plants in multi-plant firms than among plants in single-plant firms.","[Sevcik, Pavel] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Ecole Sci Gest, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Sevcík, P (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Ecole Sci Gest, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",sevcik.pavel@uqam.ca,,,Tom Symons Research Fellowship from Statistics Canada; FQRSC,Tom Symons Research Fellowship from Statistics Canada; FQRSC,"I am grateful to Rui Castro and Alessandro Riboni for their valuable suggestions.

The model is usually estimated using travel survey data; however, little is known about how to use smart card data (SCD) for this purpose in a public transport network. Our study extracted trip information from SCD to model location choice of after-work activities. We newly defined the metrics of travel impedance in this case. Moreover, since socio-demographic information is missing in such anonymous data, we used observable proxy indicators, including commuting distance and the characteristics of one's home and workplace stations, to capture some interpersonal heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity is expected to distinguish the population and better explain the difference of their location choice behaviour. The approach was applied to metro travellers in the city of Shanghai, China. As a result, the model performs well in explaining the choices. Our new metrics of travel impedance to access an after-work activity result in a better model fit than the existing metrics and add additional interpretability to the results. Moreover, the proxy variables distinguishing the population seem to influence the choice behaviour and thus improve the model performance.","[Wang, Yihong; Correi, Goncalo Homem de Almeida; de Romph, Erik] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Transport & Planning, POB 5048, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [de Romph, Erik] TNO, The Hague, Netherlands; [Timmermans, H.

Economics has always been about systems that explain differential output and outcomes. However, economics has generally ignored the role of entrepreneurship in economic systems, just as entrepreneurship studies have largely overlooked the role of systems in explaining the prevalence and performance of entrepreneurship. The entrepreneurial ecosystem approach has the promise to correct these shortcomings. Its two dominant lineages are the regional development literature and the strategy literature. Both lineages share common roots in ecological systems thinking, providing fresh insights into the interdependence of actors in a particular community to create new value. But studies of both regional development and strategic management have largely ignored the role of entrepreneurs in new value creation. In this paper, we will outline contributions to the entrepreneurial ecosystem approach and conclude with a promising new line of research to our understanding of the emergence, growth, and context of start-ups that have achieved great impact by developing new platforms.","[Acs, Zoltan J.] George Mason Univ, 3351 Fairfax Dr,MS 3B1, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Stam, Erik] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Kriekenpitpl 21-22,POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Stam, Erik] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Kriekenpitpl 21-22,POB 80125,TC 3508, Oxford, England; [Audretsch, David B.] Indiana Univ, Inst Dev Strategies, 1315 E 10th Ave,SPEA Suite 201, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [O'Connor, Allan] Univ Adelaide, Level 5,Nexus 10 Bldg Cnr Pulteney St, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",George Mason University; Utrecht University; University of Oxford; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Adelaide,"Acs, ZJ (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, 3351 Fairfax Dr,MS 3B1, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",Zacs@gmu.edu; e.stam@uu.nl; daudrets@indiana.edu; allan.oconnor@adelaide.edu.au,"acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013; Stam, Erik/E-6605-2017; O'Connor, Allan/AAV-4838-2021; O'Connor, Allan/AAQ-6284-2021","O'Connor, Allan/0000-0003-1197-7805; Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762; Stam, Erik/0000-0001-9827-0516",,,,,54,437,477,37,452,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The importance of accounting for time-variation is emphasized in the context of the Basel traffic light system. We enhance the flexibility of this structure by modeling regimes with multivariate mixture copulas and by applying the dynamic conditional correlation model (DCC) to multivariate elliptical copulas. The most suitable dynamic dependence model in terms of in-sample and out-of sample valuation is the dynamic Student-t-Clayton mixture copula, followed by the dynamic Student-t copula, and the dynamic Gaussian-Clayton mixture. In comparison to the multivariate normal model, the dynamic Clayton copula also scales down significantly the number of VaR(99%) violations during the 2007/08 financial crisis period.

At face value, this kind of systemic approach to entrepreneurship offers a new and distinctive path for scholars and policy makers to help understand and foster growth-oriented entrepreneurship. However, its lack of specification and conceptual limitations has undoubtedly hindered our understanding of these complex organisms. Indeed, the rapid adoption of the concept has tended to overlook the heterogeneous nature of ecosystems. This paper provides a critical review and conceptualisation of the ecosystems concept: it unpacks the dynamics of the concept; outlines its theoretical limitations; measurement approaches and use in policy-making. It sets out a preliminary taxonomy of different archetypal ecosystems. The paper concludes that entrepreneurial ecosystems are a highly variegated, multi-actor and multi-scalar phenomenon, requiring bespoke policy interventions.","[Brown, Ross] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, Ctr Responsible Banking & Finance, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Mason, Colin] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Sch Business, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of St Andrews; University of Glasgow,"Brown, R (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, Ctr Responsible Banking & Finance, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",Ross.Brown@st-andrews.ac.uk; Colin.Mason@glasgow.ac.uk,"Lobo, Diele/I-9106-2012","Brown, Ross/0000-0002-6164-7639",Organisational for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),Organisational for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),"The authors wish to thank the Organisational for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for funding their original research on entrepreneurial ecosystems.

This paper examines short-term price and volatility transmission from major grain commodities to 41 domestic food products across 27 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. We follow a multivariate GARCH approach to model the dynamics of monthly price return volatility in international and domestic markets. The period of analysis is 2000 through 2013. In terms of price transmission, we only observe significant interactions from international to domestic markets in few cases. To calculate volatility spillovers, we simulate a shock equivalent to a 1% increase in the conditional volatility of price returns in the international market and evaluate its effect on the conditional volatility of price returns in the domestic market. The transmission of volatility is statistically significant in just one-quarter of the maize markets tested, more than half of rice markets tested, and all wheat markets tested. Volatility transmission seems to be more common when trade (imports or exports) are large relatively to domestic requirements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

So far, it is not clear whether the transmission process is purely genetic or whether parents take an active role in socializing their children. The transmission of time preferences and reciprocity is analyzed by focusing on three aspects: (1) direct transmission from parents to children; (2) the impact of prevailling attitudes in children's surrounding environment; (3) parents' positive assortative mating. The findings support all three channels. Differences in the size of the intergenerational correlation according to family or parental characteristics suggest that the process is not purely genetic. The present analysis is of even greater importance, as the analyzed attitudes determine economic success sustainably.","[Gauly, Britta] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Dept Survey Design & Methodol, POB 12 21 55, D-68072 Mannheim, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS),"Gauly, B (通讯作者)，GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Dept Survey Design & Methodol, POB 12 21 55, D-68072 Mannheim, Germany.",britta.gauly@gesis.org,,,,,,,42,19,23,3,24,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey and a differences-in-differences research design, this article examines whether any of several common state-level modifications to tort law affect consumer costs for auto insurance. Expenditures on auto insurance fall by 12 percent following no-fault repeal and 6 percent following relaxation of collateral source restrictions, but are not measurably affected by bad faith reform, modifications to joint and several liability, or noneconomic damage caps. None of the modifications to tort law generate measurable increases in auto insurance take-up. There is little variation in the impact of the reforms across income, education, and age groups, but no-fault repeal and collateral source reform do disproportionately benefit consumers with lower cost policies.","[Heaton, Paul] RAND Inst Civil Justice, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA; [Heaton, Paul] Pardee RAND Grad Sch, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA",RAND Corporation; Pardee RAND Graduate School,"Heaton, P (通讯作者)，RAND Inst Civil Justice, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA.;Heaton, P (通讯作者)，Pardee RAND Grad Sch, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA.",pheaton@rand.org,,,RAND Institute for Civil Justice (ICJ),RAND Institute for Civil Justice (ICJ),"I wish to thank Eric Helland, two anonymous referees, and seminar participants at RAND who provided useful comments on the manuscript.

The ability of a household to diversify has been shown to depend upon its demographic and economic characteristics and its physical and social context. This paper considers the effects of intra-village social networks on household income diversification in one of the poorest and most ethnically diverse areas of the Indian state of Kerala. Using techniques adapted from spatial econometrics, we find that social connections within a village magnify the impacts of household characteristics such as education and number of adults by a factor of 3.6 times. Models with alternative measures of network centrality (degree and eigenvector) indicate that the number of network connections that a household has is more important than the centrality of those connections. Finally, we use social contact information to calculate assortative mixing based on caste. The results suggest social stratification in these villages, with higher levels of stratification associated with lower levels of income diversification. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It complements previous studies that have enumerated specific financial costs of poor health, such as out of pocket medical expenses or lost earnings. Because poor health can affect wealth accumulation through several channels, the asset cost measure can provide additional insight on the health-wealth nexus. We develop a simple measure of health status based on the first principal component of HRS survey responses on self-reported health status, diagnoses, ADLs, IADLs, and other indicators of underlying health. We find a large and substantively important correlation between this health measure and wealth accumulation.

Both women's access to managerial positions (vertical segregation) and women's achievement of managerial roles that are socially associated with communal attributes (horizontal segregation) are tested. We argue that boundary-spanning (henceforth, boundary management) in export interfirm relationships benefits from relational and communal skills and therefore could not only offer an opportunity for women to gain access to management positions but also put them at risk of falling into a rut before achieving other control-based managerial roles. This empirical study examines the characteristics (personal and firm-level) of Spanish female managers in charge of export management through independent channels. A multivariate analysis has been performed to compare female managers with male managers both in boundary management and in the position of finance director, a control position closer to a socially stereotyped masculine role. The results show that women have slightly higher access to boundary management jobs than finance management jobs, as well as a significantly lower promotion time than male colleagues, but they also corroborate that there is a smaller percentage of women than men in any management positions, with female managers working in younger firms with fewer resources for export activity.

An application to weekly Eurozone data for a 2007-2014 sample reveals that a two-state Markov switching model shows economically weak, though accurately estimated, contagion effects in a crisis regime. These findings are mainly explained by a flight-to-quality channel.

It begins with global scale projections to 2100 of land use and associated goods and services, including food, fuel, timber, greenhouse gas emissions, carbon sequestration and biodiversity. This is followed by in-depth discussion of each of these services and the challenges of providing these public goods in sufficient quantities to advance societal welfareespecially that of the world's poorest households. The paper concludes with a discussion of policies aimed at promoting the provision of land-based public goods and how they could be altered to be more pro-poor.

This study uses a simultaneous equations model with a generalized method of moments estimator to investigate the effects of institutional ownership on firm performance in a new large sample of Chinese listed firms from 2004 to 2014. The results generally suggest that institutional ownership positively affects firm performance and are robust to accounting for deregulation, contemporaneous market conditions, and different stock market boards. However, not all institutional investors are active monitors and improve firm performance. In particular, the results indicate that pressure-insensitive, foreign and large institutional shareholders have greater positive effects on firm performance than pressure-sensitive, domestic, and small institutional shareholders. The results further suggest that institutional investors enhance shareholder value by attracting more analysts and reducing insider ownership (among other reasons), and these findings are robust to a series of sensitivity analyses.","[Lin, Yongjia Rebecca] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Ave Wai Long, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China; [Fu, Xiaoqing Maggie] Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Ave Univ, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology; University of Macau,"Fu, XM (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Ave Univ, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China.",yjlin@must.edu.mo; maggiefu@umac.mo,"Fu, Xiaoqing/GPK-7573-2022","Fu, Xiaoqing/0000-0002-3694-122X",Macau Foundation [0485i],Macau Foundation,We would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers and the editor for very helpful comments and suggestions on the previous version of the paper.

We take advantage of a natural experiment whereby (non linear) foreign ATM fees in one specific bank became suddenly applicable at one point in time. We also use this experiment to evaluate the substitutions between foreign ATM withdrawals and other home ATM or desk withdrawals as well as with payments by card. Using panel data on accounts, we first estimate average treatment effects on the treated before carrying on with the estimation of a simple structural model.

In 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization's Voices of the Hungry project developed an experiential measure of food insecurity, the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), translated it into 200 languages, and contracted Gallup, Inc. for collection of data through the Gallup World Poll. This is the first paper that identifies and examines the common determinants of food insecurity in 134 countries using this cross-country comparable experiential measure of food insecurity. We also investigate whether and to what extent the common determinants of food insecurity identified in a global model differ across rankings of economic development. Using a series of multilevel linear probability models, we find that the five characteristics associated with the largest increase in the likelihood of experiencing food insecurity around the world are: having low levels of education, weak social networks, less social capital, low household income, and being unemployed. We also find significant heterogeneity in the determinants of food insecurity over development rankings. This study is an important first step in utilizing the new FIES to document risk factors of food insecurity around the globe.

Finding ways to couple sustainable transportation with individual self-interest and fulfillment of human needs may be critical to shifting transportation behavior to other modes. Taking a community perspective, this study considers how individuals discuss their needs in relation to community conditions impacting personal transportation choices. We collected data through 14 community listening sessions, or modified focus groups, conducted in diverse communities across the greater San Francisco Bay Area (USA). The community context for the groups indicated three types of transportation orientation: (1) car dominant in which driving alone was the primary mode of travel, (2) mixed-mode in which driving alone as well as a variety of other transportation modes were used for travel, and (3) sustainable transportation-oriented in which alternatives to driving alone were primarily used. In all three types of communities, personal transportation choices related to physical and sociocultural conditions that allowed residents to meet different needs. Our findings suggest that considering how community-level conditions meet practical and psychological needs may offer ways to more effectively support individual-level sustainable transportation choices.

Evidence from Indian Micro data,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,gender; financial inclusion; discrimination; India,CREDIT; ACCESS; IMPACT; MATTER; POOR; PROGRAMS; GROWTH; GENDER,"The role and relevance of gender in financial inclusion has been an evolving area of research in recent times. Although there are several cross-country studies on this aspect, few within-country studies have addressed this issue in a comprehensive manner. In this context, exploiting disaggregated household-level data for India, we analyze the interface between gender and finance. More specifically, we examine whether gender matters for financial inclusion and if so, what are the possible factors that influence this relationship. Our findings suggest significant disparity in both the access to as well as the use of finance by gender. On average, female headed households are 8% less likely to access formal finance and 6% more likely to access informal finance as compared to households that are headed by males, after taking into account other relevant household and state-level characteristics that are important in explaining financial access by households. Similar evidence carries over to the use of finance: households headed by female use 20% less cash loans as compared to male-headed households. Subsequently, we investigate the possible channels which impede financial inclusion for female -headed households. Our analysis highlights that for female -headed households, education and wages are more relevant in explaining the access to finance whereas political and social factors are much more germane in explaining the use of finance.

While handheld GPS-based area measurement has become a practical alternative to farmers' error-prone area assessments in household surveys across the developing world, non ignorable shares of GPS-based area measures are often missing in public datasets. Using nationally-representative household survey data from Tanzania and Uganda, we demonstrate that the missing GPS-based plot areas constitute a non-random subset of the unit-record data, but that the missing data can be reliably simulated by multiple imputation, and that the effects of the imputation on key agricultural statistics are non-trivial. As GPS-based land areas could inform an extensive array of statistical and economic applications, we focus on one of many policy-relevant applications of the method while underscoring the importance of completed data analysis and highlighting the practicalities of operationalizing the approach to answer similar research questions. The application of the method in the estimation of the inverse scale-land productivity relationship confirms and strengthens the presence of such relationship in Tanzania and Uganda.

Unlike previous studies, our dynamic ordered probit models allow for persistence in life satisfaction which is attributable both to unobserved individual heterogeneity and to state dependence. First, we find that strong state dependence exists in adolescents' life satisfaction, that is, current life satisfaction is significantly affected by the previous state. Second, we show that academic success undoubtedly has a positive effect on adolescents' life satisfaction even after controlling for state dependence. Finally, we present that there exists an interesting gender difference: boys show stronger persistence in the state of high life satisfaction, whereas girls have stronger persistence in dissatisfaction.

Using geographic distance to represent information asymmetry, we find that corporations avoid more tax when located closer to the IRS unless they are close to an IRS industry specialist This finding is consistent with taxpayers believing proximity provides them with an information advantage over the IRS. From the perspective of the IRS, we find that the Service is more likely to audit nearby companies and to assess more tax per hour from nearby taxpayers, except during constrained budget years. IRS audit likelihood and productivity are unaffected by the presence of nearby industry specialists, consistent with industry specialist proximity already constraining avoidance.

In this analysis, we compare the efficiency of two different hedging instruments in managing the mortality risk of the life settlement firm. First, we claim and then demonstrate that conventional longevity-linked securities do not perform as effectively in the secondary life market, that is, life settlement market, as in the annuity and pension markets due to the basis risk that exists between the general population and the life settlement subgroup. Second, we show that the unique risk exposure of the life settlement firm can be specifically targeted using a new instrumentthe biomedical research-backed obligations.

In order to address this, the paper is divided into three main sections. In the first section, we analyse the transformation of agriculture under the Sandinista Revolution (1979-1990) to establish what the agricultural policies of the early FSLN had been. In the second section, we present the policies that have been implemented since 1990 to privatize land, commercial, and banking activities, and the new role of agricultural producers' and wage workers' organizations, which have remained unchanged until now despite the return of the FSLN to power. In the third section, we describe the social policies implemented by the administration of Daniel Ortega and the changes made to the productive model. Finally, in the conclusions, we explain why the policies implemented since the new Sandinista government have been so similar to the model developed between 1990 and 2007, and highlight the most significant changes that have been introduced since 2007.","[Marti i Puig, Salvador] Univ Girona, Dept Derecho Publ, Area Ciencia Polit, Montivili, Spain; [Baumeister, Eduardo] Inst Ctr Amer Estudios Sociales & Desarrollo INCE, Apartado Postal 4112, Managua, Nicaragua",Universitat de Girona,"Puig, SMI (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Fac Deecho, Area Ciencia Polit, Dept Derecho Publ, Avuiguda Univ Girona 2, Montivili 17071, Spain.",salvador.marti@udg.edu,,"Marti-i-Puig, Salvador/0000-0002-4464-4452",,,,,40,23,25,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Under the Mandatory Provident Fund system of Hong Kong, both employers and employees are required to contribute to a retirement account. Originally, employees' investment choices were restricted to a subset of funds chosen by their employers. The system was later modified so that employees are allowed to invest in any fund within the system. We present evidence that flows of fund have become more sensitive to past fund performance after this policy change, and that average fund performance in the system has also improved. Based on the improvement in fund performance, we estimate the accumulated cost of the lack of choice to be around 10% of the current total asset value of the system.

Duration and competing risks analyses were estimated to investigate the effects of ART insurance mandates on women's timing of first marriage and first birth using the 1968-2009 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The findings suggest that the mandates were associated with delayed marriage and childbearing at younger ages and an increased likelihood of marriage and motherhood at ages 30 and older, but only for college graduate women. For the full sample of women, the mandates were associated with an increased likelihood of marriage at ages 25 and older and motherhood within marriage after at ages 30 and older, but not with delay at younger ages. Results by race were similar to those for the full sample for Whites, but were generally less significant for Blacks.

High staple food prices across the world, and increasingly un-regulated food markets, have highlighted among other things the political dimensions of food-related protests. This has been the case especially in the MENA region but also in Sub Saharan Africa, East Asia, and Latin America where food-related protests have often been catalysts to contest wider processes of dissatisfaction with authoritarian and corrupt regimes. After many years of silence, food-related struggles have begun to receive more attention in the academic literature. This has mostly been in the context of emerging debates on land grabbing, food security/sovereignty, and social movements. Yet there have been few attempts to provide a systematic enquiry of existing analytical perspectives and debates, or a clear assessment of what some of the political and economic implications may be, for what now seem to be persistent food protests and social struggles. This article tries to fill this gap by mapping and reviewing the existing and emerging literature on urban and rural food-related protests. It also explores theories and methodologies that have shaped debate by locating these in an alternative world-historical analysis of political economy. The article includes, but also goes beyond, a critical review of the following authors and their important contribution to ongoing debate; Farshad Araghi; Henry Bernstein; Henrietta Friedmann and Philip McMichael; Jason Moore; Vandana Shiva, the World Bank and FAO publications and recent special issues of Review, Journal of Agrarian Change and Journal of Peasant Studies.

Our findings suggest that hedge funds are exposed to systematic risk factors and minimizing systematic risk exposure by means of, for example, hedging does not always produce good results. Our quantile regression analyses reveal that systematic risk exposure per se does not separate high-achievers (positive alphas) from low-achievers (negative alphas). Fund performance is also conditioned on the direction of exposure. Moreover, fund exposure to the types of risk factors depends On market regimes, confirming the argument that hedge funds shift strategies. Choosing the exposure to the right risk factors in the right direction according to economic regimes separates good performers from poor ones.","[Huang, Ying Sophie] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Carl R.] Univ Dayton, Dayton, OH 45469 USA; [Kato, Isamu] Nomura Funds Res & Technologies Amer Inc, New York, NY USA",Zhejiang University; University System of Ohio; University of Dayton,"Huang, YS (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Dept Finance & Accounting, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",sophiehuangying@zju.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573228],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We acknowledge the helpful comments from Wayne Ferson.

Their sustainable growth is important for the economy of most European countries. Because of this, the issues surrounding their financing, government support and public perception are widely discussed. The problems connected with external financing of SMEs are closely related to effective management of financial risk, which can minimize competition, create better financial structure and increase the firm's competitiveness. Our results of the questionnaire survey in the Czech Republic in 2015 were obtained using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and revealed a factor which the male sample believed to be an important influence on the perception of financial risk is a bank's approach to business. This factor is significantly influenced by knowledge, rules and principles including the knowledge of banks' credit conditions, their transparency and the ability of entrepreneurs to manage financial risks. In the female sample, state and public perception showed to be much more important in the perception of financial risk. Male entrepreneurs mitigate financial risks through a bank's assistance whereas female entrepreneurs emphasize the role of society.","[Kozubikova, Ludmila; Homolka, Lubor; Kristalas, Dimitris] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Kozubikova, L (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",kozubikova@fame.utb.cz; homolka@fame.utb.cz; dimitris.kristalas@gmail.com,"Homolka, Lubor/P-7714-2019","Homolka, Lubor/0000-0002-6628-8241; Kozubikova, Ludmila/0000-0003-2017-0384",[IGA/FaME/2015/022],,This paper was created at Tomas Bata University in Zlin and was supported by the Project IGA/FaME/2015/022: The influence of socio-demographic factors on the entrepreneurial orientation of SMEs' entrepreneurs.,,21,49,56,3,60,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Earlier literature has maintained that reciprocal behavior that gives rise to cooperation can be entirely self-regarding. However, experimental evidence has shown that reciprocal behavior is other-regarding in many 1-shot games. This other-regarding behavior is believed to have an emotional foundation. We hypothesized that emotions play a role in reciprocal behavior in repeated games as well. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the psychophysiological correlates of emotions from pairs of subjects as they played a repeated Cournot duopoly game. The players, who were in different rooms and remained anonymous to each other, made adjustment decisions to their production quantities that determined their payoffs in each round. Autonomic nervous system arousal was activated when the payoffs of both players decreased in a round, whereas positive affect was expressed when the payoffs of both players increased in a round. The disgust expression was related to a player's own 1-sided increase in the payoff. Anger was expressed occasionally but less frequently when the outcome was the player's ideal outcome. An upward adjustment of the production quantity was observed when the other player did not cooperate. This had the effect of decreasing the payoffs of both players, and this was also related to an increase in the level of arousal. Our results provide evidence on how emotions are present in reciprocal behavior in a repeated social dilemma game. The results challenge recent behavioral research that has advocated self-regarded motivations of cooperation in repeated games.","[Leppanen, Ilkka; Hamalainen, Raimo P.] Aalto Univ, Syst Anal Lab, Espoo, Finland; [Leppanen, Ilkka] Loughborough Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Aalto University; Loughborough University,"Leppänen, I (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Syst Anal Lab, Espoo, Finland.;Leppänen, I (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",i.leppanen@lboro.ac.uk,"Leppänen, Ilkka/AAI-1527-2021","Leppänen, Ilkka/0000-0003-3041-6819; Hamalainen, Raimo/0000-0002-4285-0092",,,,,73,1,1,1,17,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

While the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve (Fed) include price stability and long-run growth, its mission has grown to include financial stability. Surprisingly, the question of whether financial stability ought to be considered as an element of monetary policy is hotly contested. This study aims to determine whether policymakers' discussions of financial stability and other factors systematically explain deviations of observed policy rates from the rates implied by the Taylor rule. To this end, we conduct content analysis of the Fed's monetary policy discussions to discover actual topics that enter into policy. We offer two main findings: First, discussion themes extracted from released Federal OpenMarket Committee meeting minutes provide explanatory power beyond standard Taylor rule variables. Second, additional explanatory power is provided by a tri-mandate policy rule that accounts for changes in the economic and financial system as moderated by the evolving preferences of the policymakers. We show that a discussion-based thematic model with financial stability dominates Taylor-type rules during normal times. Moreover, the tri-mandate policy model with financial stability dominates Taylor-type rules in zero lower bound conditions. Taken together, these findings reveal that financial stability has mattered to the Fed continuously and remains critical in setting monetary policy in zero lower bound.","[Oet, Mikhail V.; Lyytinen, Kalle] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Oet, MV (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",,"Lyytinen, Kalle/O-8202-2017","Oet, Mikhail/0000-0003-2516-0847",,,,,88,7,7,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

This paper studies the impact of such a program in Morocco on social capital as measured by economic field experiments. We played a public goods game to measure how much people care about others in the community, an investment game to proxy interpersonal trust, as well as a dictator game to measure altruism. Our empirical strategy exploits an administrative rule stipulating that the program be rolled out only in rural communities with a poverty rate of 30% and above. Focusing on communities close to this cut-off and using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the program increases contributions in public goods games. Conversely, the program has no impact on altruism and reduces interpersonal trust. We examine possible mechanisms underlying the observed impacts by combining the behavioral data with survey information and administrative records on project spending and selection. Overall our results suggest that a shift from a centralized to a more localized decision-making process may enhance people's sense of responsibility toward their community, but not all forms of social capital are positively affected in the process.

As in the USA, European value-growth returns are concentrated among firms with existent market expectation errors, but absent among firms without such errors which can be ex ante identified by interacting book-to-market with FSCORE, an accounting-based measure of the firm's fundamental strength. The returns to an expectation errors-based value-growth strategy are highly persistent for up to three years after portfolio formation, pervasive among large firms, and cannot be explained by common risk factors. However, consistent with a mispricing-based interpretation, prior external financing activities significantly influence these market expectation errors. A financing-based misvaluation factor can explain the return behavior of value-growth strategies formed along market expectations errors.","[Walkshaeusl, Christian] Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Walkshäusl, C (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.",,"Walkshäusl, Christian/AAF-2375-2020","Walkshäusl, Christian/0000-0001-6196-7504",,,,,39,8,8,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

In this study, we change that focus by empirically examining the moderating role of two particular top manager characteristics (age and educational level) on the agglomeration economies-firm performance relationship. Using a top manager-firm matched panel data set, we find that top manager age rather than educational level helps firms to realize the potential benefits of agglomeration.

By using panel data on manufacturing FDIs from France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom between 1995 and 2008, and by developing an empirical model with first and second order interaction terms, we investigate the existence and the conditionality of the most controversial FDI-induced effects on industrial emissions, i.e., Pollution Haven, Factor Endowments and Pollution Halo hypotheses. The paper has three main findings: (1) the central hypotheses linking pollution to FDI are found to act simultaneously, with opposing effects; (2) FDIs are associated with pollution reduction, i.e., predominating pollution halo induced effect, in countries with low to average capital-to-labour ratio but not too lax environmental regulation; (3) FDIs are found to increase pollution, i.e., prevailing pollution haven and/or factor endowments induced effects, in countries with average capital endowments and lax environmental regulations, as well as in all the capital abundant countries, though with a smaller magnitude in countries having strict environmental regulations and/or a high-skilled labour force. Some specific and interesting findings are discussed regarding different FDI-origin countries and FDI-host country groups.","[Zugravu-Soilita, Natalia] Univ Versailles Saint Quentin En Yvelines, UFR Sci Sociales, CEMOTEV, 47 Bd Vauban, F-78280 Guyancourt, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Zugravu-Soilita, N (通讯作者)，Univ Versailles Saint Quentin En Yvelines, UFR Sci Sociales, CEMOTEV, 47 Bd Vauban, F-78280 Guyancourt, France.",natalia.zugravu@uvsq.fr,"Zugravu-Soilita, Natalia/AAF-8434-2020",,,,,,66,124,126,3,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The resultant low level of financial intermediation implies reduced investment and economic growth. Understanding the reason for these high and persistent spreads is important to develop a policy for improving effectiveness of the banking system. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Net interest margins of Arab GCC banks during the period 1999-2012 are examined using the balanced panel regression model with bank specific, financial/market structure specific and macroeconomic factors as determinants. The method used for estimation used is the estimated generalized least squares (EGLS) method with both fixed effects and random effects. Findings - Bank-specific variables, which explain net interest margins in GCC, are bank capitalization ratios, loan ratios and overhead expenses. Spread of banking sector (as measured by ratio of total bank credit to GDP) is positive and highly significant, implying that along with the expansion of the banking sector in GCC economies, interest margins of banks also improved. Omani banks were able to increase interest margins by aggressively marketing high yield personal and credit card loans, and, zero interest paying deposit products. The study also finds a negative relationship between concentration and net interest margin, and attempts to explain this finding which is at variance with other country studies using the price leadership model of oligopoly. Research limitations/implications - The standard, accepted econometric model of net interest margins which has been used in earlier studies is unable to explain the high net interest margins of banks in Oman although it is able to explain interest margins in other GCC countries. There is a need to develop non econometric models. More work is needed on the implications of NIM spreads for how they affect an economy. Practical implications - The study shows that as the banking sector spreads in the economy, individual banks have more opportunities to market their products while at the same time maintaining interest margins. Bank managements should note this point and look for opportunities to expand. Originality/value - There is no evidence of any empirical studies which focused on net interest margins in the GCC countries. This study attempts to fill in this gap with a view to nudge policy makers to look at the issue of high interest margins and its detrimental impact on economic growth and development in the Gulf region. The paper is useful for policy makers to understand and rectify the problem of excessive interest spreads which is hurting the financial intermediation process.","[Al-Muharrami, Saeed; Murthy, Y.

Motivated by recent developments in private flows to these economies, this paper makes two contributions: first, it constructs a new comprehensive dataset on gross private capital flows with special focus on non-FDI flows to LICs. Concentrating on LICs and more specifically on gross non-FDI private flows is intentionally aimed at closing a gap in existing datasets where country coverage of developing economies is limited mainly to emerging markets (EMs). Second, using the new data, it identifies several shifting patterns of gross non-FDI private inflows to LICs. A surprising fact emerges: since the mid-2000s periods of surges in gross non-FDI private inflows to LICs are broadly comparable to those of EMs. Moreover, while gross non-FDI inflows to LICs are on average much lower than those to EMs, we show that gross non-FDI inflows to the top quartile of LICs are comparable to those of the median EM and converging to the top quartile of EMs.","[Araujo, Juliana D.] Int Monetary Fund, Strategy Policy & Review Dept, Washington, DC USA; [David, Antonio C.] Int Monetary Fund, Western Hemisphere Dept, Washington, DC USA; [van Hombeeck, Carlos] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Papageorgiou, Chris] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; International Monetary Fund,"Araujo, JD (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Strategy Policy & Review Dept, Washington, DC USA.",jaraujo@imf.org; adavid@imf.org; carlos.vanhombeeck@bankofengland.co.uk; cpapageorgiou@imf.org,,"van Hombeeck, Carlos Eduardo/0009-0009-5205-184X",,,,,25,5,5,0,2,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

This series of events is now known as the taper tantrum'. In response to the tantrum, these five countries each took a series of macroeconomic policy measures to relieve pressure in their financial markets. Indonesia and India handled the problem in the shortest time (about seven months) and achieved macro-economic stabilisation. This article examines how Indonesia and India managed to remain relatively unscathed by the taper tantrum and escape the Fragile Five. It looks at which policies the two countries adopted at the time, and why they chose them, as well as why India's economy performed better than Indonesia's after the tantrum.","[Basri, M.

A deeper examination of academic motivation, made through analysis, synthesis, comparison and generalization of theoretical knowledge on leadership and motivation, indicates that motivation is influenced by many objective and subjective, quantitative and qualitative factors. Quality of managers' influence, respectively creative content of leadership and general managerial facilitation that managers utilize in affecting work behavior and performance of employees can be include to the strongest factors which affect the motivation. Paper is intended to investigate the motivation of universities members and its conditionalities. Methodological part of the paper contains the results of sociological questioning conducted on a sample of 122 employees of University of Zilina and focuses on examining dependence of the leadership style performed from the part of managers and the strength of motivation perceived by the university members. Specifically, three basic leadership styles are examined: authoritative, neutral and participative, versus three basic dimensions of the motivation: motivation to quality work; motivation to increase own knowledge and skills; and motivation to submitting new proposals. Applying chi-square test, the dependence of leadership style and level of motivation was confirmed in all three motivational dimensions; application of creative, participative leadership causes a higher degree of motivation. Subsequently, there is investigated in the paper whether the strength of motivation is also influenced by creating an atmosphere of trust, belongingness and encouraging to new proposals by the manager, and whether creating such a positive atmosphere is affected by the quality of leadership style. Through the use of Pearson's test and Kendall's test, dependence was also confirmed. Conclusion of the paper presents a set of recommendations which might be contributive for the universities executives when strengthening the motivation of universities members and improving their competitiveness and contribution to society and its progress.","[Blaskova, Martina; Trskova, Kristina] Univ Zilina, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Blaskova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",blaskova@fri.uniza.sk,"Blaskova, Martina/AAH-6338-2020; Blašková, Martina/ABF-3732-2021; Blaskova, Martina/I-4527-2018","Blaskova, Martina/0000-0003-2760-9724",scientific projects: VEGA Stochastic Modelling of Decision Making Processes in Motivating Human Potential [1/0890/14],scientific projects: VEGA Stochastic Modelling of Decision Making Processes in Motivating Human Potential,The paper was conducted within the scientific projects: VEGA No 1/0890/14 Stochastic Modelling of Decision Making Processes in Motivating Human Potential.,,45,2,2,2,5,"SCIENCEPARK SCI, ORGANIZATION & COUNSELING LTD",KYRENIA,"13 SUBAT ST, NO 17, KYRENIA, 99030, CYPRUS",2547-8818,,,N TR ISS P HUM SOC S,,,2017,,,,,,,23,34,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4PU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463801800004,0

Using a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 2001-2008, we estimate a set of dynamic models of program participation. True state dependence of participation in each program is found to be significant, while unobserved heterogeneity accounts for about 41 and 29 % of observed persistence in subsidy and tax credit programs, respectively. Both tend to reach mostly stable R&D performers. We also identify significant differences across programs. Highly productive firms within a given industry are more likely to obtain subsidies; the use of tax credits, in contrast, is unrelated to a firm's productivity.

First, bank operating efficiency, credit risk, and prudential behavior have improved after introducing foreign strategic investors (FSIs). However, these effects are diminished as time passes. Second, going public increases bank profitability, operating efficiency, and prudential behavior, and reduces credit risk, which are also reversed as time passes. Finally, the effects of introducing FSIs on credit risk and prudential behavior are weaker for state-owned banks than for other banks, while the opposite is true for going public.","[Cheng, Maoyong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jerry W.] Univ South Florida St Petersburg, Kate Tiedemann Coll Business, St Petersburg, FL USA",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Zhao, H (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",zhaored@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403202, 71172186, 71502138, 71572144, 71103139]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M572532]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [sk2016004]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71403202], [grant number 71172186], [grant number 71502138], [grant number 71572144], [grant number 71103139]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 2015M572532]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [sk2016004].",,46,4,5,4,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The group buying net site company extracts the commission from the seller, and the amount of the commission may depend on the bargaining power of the manufacturers themselves, that is to say, it is the store's own visibility.

The first results for estimating the crisis impact pointed out that the traditional interest rate channel was the most affected and the transmission slowed down and weakened. Based on these findings and the persistent problems in the EMU, the main objective of this paper is to assess the impact of the monetary policy conducted via interest rates and the impact of the crisis on the development of selected variables in the case of Slovakia. In order to analyse the transmission of monetary policy interest rates to the economy, the VAR method using the recursive Cholesky decomposition is applied. This method is very often used in empirical studies to measure the effectiveness of monetary policy. Based on the results, it can be stated that the impact of monetary policy interest rates was not significant for Slovakia. By observing the crisis impacts, examining reactions and variance decomposition in two different periods, we obtained results that clearly pointed to the mitigation of the monetary shocks impact on the development of the observed variables.","[Durcova, Julia; Bartokova, Ludmila] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theories, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Durcová, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theories, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",julia.durcova@tuke.sk; ludmila.bartokova@tuke.sk,"Bartokova, Ludmila/AAA-7128-2020","Bartokova, Ludmila/0000-0001-8662-660X",scientific project VEGA [1/0994/15],scientific project VEGA,This paper was written in connection with scientific project VEGA No.1/0994/15.,,20,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,171,180,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700018,0

It is a challenge to contemporary enterprises to combine economic benefits and social responsibility with pro-environmental activities. Traditional methods of evaluation of investment projects may result in undervaluing some of the analysed pro-environmental projects. Hence, there is a need for new methods of investment project assessment which would enable active project management. The method of analysing real innovation enables valuation of flexibility embedded in a project. This is of particular importance in assessing pro-ecological projects. Some types of financial option and models of their valuation can facilitate pro-environmental management of the company value. This paper presents selected types of financial exotic-flexible options and models of their valuation. Their application can make it significantly easier to manage the pro-environmental investment projects of a company. The aim of the study is to present the possibility of transferring financial option pricing models of to the area of pro-ecological investment projects.

Therefore, prevention professionals and prevention scientists started to form professional groups with the common interest: to improve the field of prevention through: (i) development and implementation of evidence-based interventions and policies, (ii) education and training of the prevention workforce, (iii) establishment of functional infrastructures in prevention, and (iv) countinuous support of prevention research and prevention science as a whole.","[Gabrhelik, Roman] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Med 1, Dept Addictol, Apolinarska 4, Prague 12800 2, Czech Republic; [Bartak, Miroslav] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Social Work, Pasteurova 40096, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Miovsky, Michal] Univ Prague, Fac Med 1, Dept Addictol, Gen Univ Hosp Prague, Ke Karlovu 11, Prague 12128 2, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Charles University Prague; General University Hospital Prague,"Gabrhelík, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Med 1, Dept Addictol, Apolinarska 4, Prague 12800 2, Czech Republic.",gabrhelik@adiktologie.cz; miroslav.bartak@ujep.cz; miovsky@cmail.cz,"Gabrhelik, Roman/C-7633-2017; Barták, Miroslav/N-9249-2017; Miovský, Michal/N-5879-2017","Gabrhelik, Roman/0000-0002-7672-3753;",,,,,10,0,0,0,4,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,211,217,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700022,0

Regardless the outcome of such decision there exists another opportunity how to help local areas within the Czech Republic (CZ) to create their own monetary policy. This study analyses the scenario of local currencies as a potential getaway possibility if the single monetary policy on the European level fails to be beneficial for the Czech communities. Local currencies are a monetary phenomenon, which in recent years, have escalated to more than four thousands of currencies circulating in more than fifty-eight countries. These grass roots initiatives operate worldwide independently of national or international monetary policies. The goal of this paper is to shed insight into the impact of the alternative currency movement on the Czech economy. The applied method of analysis adapts a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model, developed by the Czech Ministry of Finance, to variables accounting for local currencies. The results of the simulation model suggest that the economic alternatives of local currencies are conducive for enhanced socio-economic conditions in local areas, irrespective of national monetary policy or the ECB authority.","[Gawthorpe, Katerina] Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Gawthorpe, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",xzimk04@vse.cz,,,"University of Economics, Prague; Faculty of Informatics and Statistics; Faculty of Business Administration [IGA IG404035]","University of Economics, Prague; Faculty of Informatics and Statistics; Faculty of Business Administration","This work was supported by the University of Economics, Prague, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics in collaboration with the Faculty of Business Administration under the Grant IGA IG404035.",,17,0,0,0,2,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4362-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,88,95,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI4MO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411851600012,0

To address if public expenditures are used to channel redistributive outcomes, we adopt a flexible panel error correction model and proceed in two steps: Firstly, we analyse if ideological positions matter for the sizing of the public sector. Secondly, we address the actual impact of government ideology on two disjoint categories of public expenditure that are characterized by distinguished redistributive effects. Under both, left-wing and right-wing governments, public spending shows progressively redistributive effects which are indirectly channelled through their policy response to changing macroeconomic, fiscal and demographic fundamentals. While right-wing governments act progressively redistributive under favourable socio-economic conditions, their left-wing counterparts do so under unfavourable conditions. Comparing the two effects in terms of their explanatory content, we find that the latter is stronger than the former.","[Herwartz, Helmut] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Gottingen, Germany; [Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Tarragona, Spain; [Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Tarragona, Spain",University of Gottingen; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Theilen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Tarragona, Spain.;Theilen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Tarragona, Spain.",hherwartz@uni-goettingen.de; bernd.theilen@urv.es,"Theilen, Bernd/Z-1589-2019","Theilen, Bernd/0000-0001-7141-2780",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2013-42884-P],Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),"We thank the associate editor Jan-Egbert Sturm, two anonymous referees, Niklas Potrafke and the participants at the XXIII Encuentro de Economia Publica in Orense and the 18th INFER Conference in Reus for their valuable comments.

I show that this result breaks down when taking the interaction between input and output markets into account, even if the dominant firm perceives market power in the permit market alone. I then examine the empirical evidence for price manipulation by the ten largest electricity firms during phase I of the EU ETS. I find that some firms' excess allowance holdings are consistent with strategic price manipulation, and that they cannot be explained by price speculation or by precautionary purchases to insure against uncertain future emissions. My results suggest that market power is likely to be an empirically relevant concern during the early years of emission permit markets.","[Hintermann, Beat] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Hintermann, B (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",b.hintermann@unibas.ch,,,,,,,40,55,59,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Based on pure theory, there might be both positive and negative effects of deflation on economic development. The historical record is, if anything, also ambiguous. As recent literature reveals, a substantial number of deflationary periods were accompanied by robust economic growth. The two frequently mentioned examples of dismal deflationary periods-the Great Depression in the United States and the lost decades in Japan-seem to be exceptions. Taking into account the arguments presented in this paper, we argue that central banks should revise their communication strategy. If there is a need to defend easy monetary policy, the main argument should be based, dominantly, on the divergence of forecasted inflation from the inflation target, with a much lesser emphasis on the need to avoid the allegedly destructive effect of deflation.","[Kovanda, Lukas; Komrska, Martin] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kovanda, L (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.",lukas.kovanda@seznam.cz; martin.komrska@vse.cz,,,,,,,61,1,1,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

As a conclusion, in order to increase consumer preferences on the mulberry tea, the taste of the tea should be improved by conducting further research to determine the proper amount of lime used in the tea formulation.","[Larasati, Aisyah; Issutarti] Malang State Univ, Malang, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Malang,"Larasati, A (通讯作者)，Malang State Univ, Malang, Indonesia.",,"Larasati, Aisyah/S-8184-2019; Larasati, Aisyah/GLU-2388-2022","Larasati, Aisyah/0000-0001-7084-8777",,,,,30,0,0,0,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-410-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,40.0,,,,,,41,51,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9IB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416100900004,0

In global village, no one is completely able to avoid the influence from life form, and no one can be really far away from cross-cultural communication. As a new emerging country, China is playing a more and more important role in international affairs. Finding out cross-cultural communicative strategies based on communicative philosophical ideas will help Chinese people with effective communication in the world stage. Wittgenstein (1889-1951) lived in the European continent about 40 years, accepting the scientific tradition of Russell, et al. He lived in the UK about 20 years, getting the influence of the Anglo-American culture, but also accepting Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, the people of this ideology. Therefore, his philosophy both contain the ingredients of scientism, with humanism ingredients. Many philosophical researchers called him one of the traditional fusion of modern Western philosophy. Wittgenstein finished his Tractatus early in 1919, which made him famous overnight. The book was spoke highly by Russell, Moore and the logical positivists. In this early study, the concept of logical form occupies an important position. In his view, the language has been able to performance precisely because the language and reality have a common form of logic. Of logical positivism, this view has undergone a profound impact, and thus he was seen as an important representative of analytic philosophy. 1920s, young British philosopher Ramsay and Italian economist Sraffa expressed sharp criticism to this book. It was these fierce opposition that prompted Wittgenstein's philosophy was transformed from a focus on language logic research to the empirical study of the language. In later stage, the concept of life form instead of the status of the concept of logical form. Wittgenstein has been de-emphasizing language and it is a common form of logic, instead emphasizing that language is part of the forms of life. Wittgenstein's purpose in doing so is to make the language out of the use of the metaphysical, which combined with the living reality of the world and people's actual lifestyle. Late Wittgenstein's view of language is a direct result of the generation of the ordinary language school.","[Li, Yabo] Harbin Normal Univ, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Harbin Normal University,"Li, YB (通讯作者)，Harbin Normal Univ, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",liyabohsd@sina.com,,,Philosophy and Social Sciences Research Project of Heilongjiang Province [14B092],Philosophy and Social Sciences Research Project of Heilongjiang Province,Fund Project: Philosophy and Social Sciences Research Project of Heilongjiang Province in 2014 (14B092),,6,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,172,175,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200038,0

Design/methodology/approach - The study employed empirical research through a survey of 1,508 consumers to establish a typology. Findings - Drawing on typologies in the literature, the study found that some dimensions should be combined to create certain particular ideal types of Brazilian consumers. Specifically, the study identified four different types of Brazilian consumer, each of which has its own way of making purchase decisions. Although there are small differences from a lifestyle perspective, there are distinctions between the groups in terms of consumer preferences and personal behavioral values. Research limitations/implications - Based on the results, the paper proposes a model to understand and classify consumer behavior in the Brazilian context based on the four traits. Practical implications - The findings suggest a number of strategic measures for organization, brands, and marketing practitioners. Originality/value - The research employs recognized frameworks to develop a new typology of ideal types of consumers specific to the Brazilian context, but using a methodology that can be applied more broadly.","[Lucian, Rafael] MPGE FBV DeVry, Rua Jean Emile Favre, Recife, PE, Brazil",,"Lucian, R (通讯作者)，MPGE FBV DeVry, Rua Jean Emile Favre, Recife, PE, Brazil.",rlucian@fbv.edu.br,"Lucian, Rafael/E-8336-2015","Lucian, Rafael/0000-0001-9101-0922",,,,,55,7,7,1,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

In this circumstance, the attention to an accurate financial reporting is of particular importance. The present study reviews the regulatory framework and literature regarding the concept of compliance and good practices in business and proposes a series of perspectives on error, involving managers, state inspectors and the financial statements, focusing primarily on the connection between the types of sanctions applied by the fiscal authorities to acting companies in Romania. The effects of noncompliance with the financial regulatory reference may be measured with relevant indicators and can be monitored over time, state authorities holding a key role in this regard. Our study focuses on analyzing the gradual approach on error or fraud of state inspectors in Romania and proposes a series of reflections on the matter.

The key issues of embedding science in these chains are specified and the solutions to these problems are proposed. Changes in Russia will require overcoming the existing gaps in three dimensions: firstly, at the level of education and science where an innovative generation ( people with imagination) should be formed. Secondly, at the enterprise level, where changes will require building the relations between fundamental and applied interdisciplinary research on the one hand and introduction of the developments into production on the other hand, contributing to the achievement of a balance between international innovation and tradition. Finally, at the level of the society consumer confidence and domestic demand should be developed, stimulating new developments and implementations. The article was prepared with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (project No. 16-06-00054 The Instrumental and Methodological Approach to Adapting the Triple-Helix Model to the Russian Conditions in Line with Historical Retrospects).","[Nikitenko Mihailovich, Sergey] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Kemerovo, Russia; [Vladimirovna, Goosen Elena] Kemerovo State Univ, Dept Econ Theory & Publ Adm, Kemerovo, Russia; [Anatolievna, Pakhomova Elena; Vladimirovna, Rozhkova Olga] Dubna Int Univ, Dept Econ, Dubna, Russia",Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Kemerovo State University; Dubna State University,"Nikitenko Mihailovich, S (通讯作者)，Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Kemerovo, Russia.",nsm.nis@mail.ru; egoosen@yandex.ru,"Pakhomova, Elena Anatolyevna/B-2221-2017; Goosen, Elena V/E-1222-2014; Nikitenko, Sergey/AAO-9025-2020","Goosen, Elena V/0000-0002-1387-4802;",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,469,474,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600077,0

This diversification of old-age income sources shifts the responsibility for the level of retirement income to the individuals themselves and, at the same time, opens the question about their preparedness for such financial decisions. Inadequate savings could have enormous impact on their future life and determine their standard of living in the period of retirement. The aim of the paper is to identify key demographic and socio-economic factors determining individuals' proactive approach to the private pension savings. We also would like to point out group of individuals with a low level of the private savings involvement. These individuals are potentially poverty vulnerable in their old-age. Using representative sample of 2 826 citizens of the Slovak Republic from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey carried out by the National Bank of Slovakia, we have identified as key factors age, education, income, ownership of second real estate and other financial assets and sharing household with pensioners. Our research contributes to the extension of existing knowledge that can be used by countries with multi-pillar pension systems, absence of occupational employment funds and low availability of products for voluntary pension savings.","[Pastorakova, Erika; Brokesova, Zuzana; Peliova, Jana] Ekon Univ Bratislave, Narodohospodarska Fak, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Pastoráková, E (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislave, Narodohospodarska Fak, Bratislava, Slovakia.",erika.pastorakova@euba.sk; zuzana.brokesova@euba.sk; jana.peliova@euba.sk,"Peliova, Jana/AAQ-4757-2021","Brokesova, Zuzana/0000-0002-9188-3720; Pastorakova, Erika/0000-0003-1549-3664; Peliova, Jana/0000-0002-0305-0906",,,,,44,1,1,3,37,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The question is whether the collected taxes are sufficient to cover costs originated by the consumption of tobacco products. To provide an unbiased answer to this question, we use objective hard data and simple calculations. We try to identify average social costs per consumed cigarette and average tax receipts per consumed cigarette in the EU while applying the maximum time in which the data are available. The results show that the costs exceeded the receipts by the average of EUR 0.22 per cigarette in years 2008 to 2015. Moreover, the difference grows during the mentioned period. This means that the EU society clearly bears a substantial part of costs of individual harmful consumption of a part of population, which is a market imperfection that is difficult to eliminate by the public sector.","[Petr, David] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Petr, D (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno, Czech Republic.",david@mendelu.cz,"David, Petr/Q-5673-2016","David, Petr/0000-0002-5055-0989",,,,,21,1,1,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,12,19,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100001,0

The basic scientific methods of analysis and synthesis were used to approach the issue. In the analytical part the analysis of tools for semantic description of data and results of scientific research activity (thesauri, metadata formats, linked data, etc.) was realized. The metadata formability analysis clearly showed that the most suitable metadata formats for describing the data from the agrarian sector are VOA3R Metadata AP (Virtual Open Agriculture and Aquaculture Repository Metadata Application Profile), respectively Universal DC (Dublin Core). However, a great potential is provided by the technique of the linked thesaurus data, especially AGROVOC. AGROVOC is the most comprehensive thesaurus with over 32,000 phrases in 27 languages covering food, nutrition, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, environment and other related topics and serves to index documents in agricultural information systems, especially in the international AGRIS system.

Compared to other existing social security programs, basic income is unique in its simplicity. It also supports the individuals' freedom of use of their disposible time. The article analyzes the expected impact of the introduction of an unconditional basic income on the labor market. It also compares basic income to other social security programs (wage subsidies, targeted social programs, a negative income tax and tax credits) on a theoretical level from the perspective of a recipient. Unconditional basic income's effects on labor supply would be rather negative. However, relative to other social security programs, unconditional basic income can guarantee a higher or the same utility level, but it may not motivate to participate in the labor market. Additional positives are transparency and lack of incentives to cheat. The prospect of lower administrative costs depends on the specific basic income scheme in question.","[Specianova, Jitka] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Speciánová, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.",jitka.melzochova@vse.cz,"Špeciánová, Jitka/HHN-5506-2022","Specianova, Jitka/0000-0002-9759-6431",,,,,46,1,1,0,35,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In corporate finance literature, this phenomenon of opportunistic behavior has been controlled by various monitoring mechanisms. The new spectacle is apposite in Pakistani financial institutions that have no more strict application of compensation regulation. The current study empirically evaluates the impact of different corporate governance attributes such as institutional shareholders' activism, independence of audit committee and board structure and block holding on the level of compensation paid to CEO of Pakistani listed firms for a period of 2007-2013. All these personas worked as monitoring mechanism for CEOs is scrutiny through stepwise regression. The results found that independent audit committee and board of director along with dual CEO structure and greater family ownership are helpful in mitigating the higher level of CEO compensation with is in align with the agency cost hypothesis. Moreover, higher financial institutional ownership found positively related to CEO compensation which is in accordance with the strategic alliance hypothesis.

They changed the world in such a manner that today we rely on them almost intimately. Their capabilities to collect data about anything turned them into surveillance tools. Specialists agree with one aspect: to be used in order to reduce crime and increase public safety - In these situations, there is no doubt about the morality. The intelligence agencies are seeing things differently. They turned surveillance into a mass surveillance operation. Quite often lately, we assist to, what it is called into the mass-media, leaks - we found that data and information who supposed to be private are not anymore.

So as to it dilutes the difference between practice and commercial space in the transaction process, but it can not avoid the difference of culture. Culture is an important basis for defining the psychological trend of consumers. It has a profound impact on the outcome of cross-border e-commerce, and it can bring various obstacles to cross-border e-commerce businesses. Therefore, in the context of cross-border e-commerce, the marketing strategies of the enterprise and the cross-cultural are coinciding highly. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to explore cross-cultural marketing strategies of cross-border e-commerce enterprises and enhance their adaptability in different cultures, which is of great practical significance for breaking barriers between enterprises and markets and promoting the development of cross-border e-commerce. In view of this, this article takes the marketing adaptability of cross-border e-commerce enterprises as the research object, and it takes different cultural conforms to different target markets as a breakthrough point. On the basis of the related theories, this paper discusses the strategy of enhancing the marketing adaptability of cross-border e-commerce enterprises in China. It is hoped that the discussion of this article will be of certain reference value to the cross - cultural e-commerce business enterprise marketing research. The concept of Internet plus has made a good interpretation to the new features of the current economic form in China. At present, many industries in China are in the stage of optimization and upgrading, including export industries. Compared with the traditional cross-border trade, the advantages of cross-border e-commerce are very obvious. First, the cost of cross-border e-commerce is low. Both sides of the transaction can only complete transaction process through network transaction. It's benefit for saving the intermediate links in the transaction process, so that all kinds of additional costs generated by the intermediate links will be saved. Secondly, the efficiency of trade has been improved effectively. In the information age of the network, the information asymmetry between the buyers and sellers is gradually erased. Under the environment of cross-border e-commerce, buyers can easily get product information from all over the world through the Internet, and sellers can also connect to buyers through a variety of network channels in the shortest time. Therefore, it can be said that cross-border e-commerce has an obvious advantage in the global business environment of the network age.","[Wang, Ying] Xijing Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Xian 710123, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xijing University,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Xijing Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Xian 710123, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",190444007@qq.com,,,Scientific Research Program - Shaanxi Provincial Education Department [17JK1145],Scientific Research Program - Shaanxi Provincial Education Department,This research is supported by Scientific Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (Program No. 17JK1145).,,5,0,0,1,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,626,628,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200126,0

We analyze the relationship between the ANSI and the market responses, which includes the returns, trading values, turnover ratios and volatility index, and the ANSI is divided into five regions. Our empirical results reveal that with an increase in the ANSI in the previous month, there is a corresponding increase in the trading value along with a reduction in the investor fear gauge of the Taiwan volatility index (TVIX). Granger causality tests indicate that both the weekly and monthly ANSIs could be leading indicators of market returns if the different regions of the ANSI are accounted for. In a potential application of our findings to portfolio management, we find that when the lagged term of the ANSI is classified in the highest regions, value-weighted portfolios comprising stocks with the highest market values, lowest price-to-book ratios and lower turnover ratios will earn the highest returns. The efficiency of the news sentiment in portfolio applications is consistent over time. This study contributes to the existing literature by demonstrating that the news sentiment level reflected in qualitative news reports can be effectively incorporated as a proxy to provide valuable support to portfolio decision making.

Why such a large role attach to education? Already in ancient times it was known, that science is the key to success. Now we know that economic growth, the development of techniques and technology, is possible thanks to the development of human capital, which is closely contribution to science. Now, we can say: knowledge, skills give a better life for each of us. It is very nervous, and still modern question, should countries or regions invest more in education to promote economic growth'? Policy makers in different countries often assert that if their state spends more on educating its population, incomes will grow sufficiently to more than recover the investment. For highly developed countries, the most frequently discussed externality is education investments' fostering technological innovation, thereby making capital and labor more productive, generating income growth(1). Especially, in the last 20-30 years we've had a combination of a very powerful human capital view, that if you invest in your own education you'll get returns in a better job and better income. People also had a very powerful human rights argument that education is a fundamental right. Each of us need to do something in developing countries about getting children into schooling and developing society into education of economic. Economists have long believed that investments in education, or human capital, are an important source of economic growth. Over the last 40 years output has risen about 3,5 `)/0 a year. Growth in the productivity of labor, the major driver of increases in wages and standards of living, has measured about 2,4 % per year. The contribution of education to labor productivity growth is estimated in different studies to be between 13 % and 30 % of the total increase. Whatever the contribution of education to growth in the past, investments in human capital may rise in importance relative to investments in other forms of capital as we transition to a postindustrial, knowledge-based economy(2). Through education, development and investment in human capital, we create an innovative society that will develop innovative activities and lead to economic growth.

This paper analyzes the effects of fiscal adjustments for a panel of 17 OECD countries over the last 30 years, complemented by a case study of selected fiscal adjustment episodes. The paper shows that fiscal adjustments are likely to raise inequality through various channels including their effects on unemployment. Spending-based adjustments tend to worsen inequality more significantly, relative to tax-based adjustments. The composition of austerity measures also matters: progressive taxation and targeted social benefits and subsidies introduced in the context of a broader decline in spending can help offset some of the adverse distributional impact of fiscal adjustments.","[Woo, Jaejoon] Bank Amer Merrill Lynch, New York, NY USA; [Woo, Jaejoon; Zhang, Y.

It is found that FDI improves innovation significantly in the nation in general, especially in the eastern and western regions. However, the spillover effects disappear in the central region. Moreover, the promotion effects of FDI on design patents granted by region are much larger than those on utility model patents and invention patents.

Floods, droughts, and storms have always tested civilian governments and international humanitarian aid agencies. However, climate change threatens to make the problem worse by increasing the intensity and possibly the frequency of climate-related hazards. Humanitarian emergencies potentially upend and reverse progress on development priorities, making improved spatial awareness of likely hot spots a priority for adaptation and preparedness. This article presents the findings of the effort to map sub-national climate security vulnerability in 11 countries in South and Southeast Asia. Climate security vulnerability is defined as areas where large numbers of people are at risk of death due to exposure to climate-related hazards and the follow-on consequences of exposure, including but not limited to conflict. The Asian Climate Security Vulnerability Model Version 1 (ACSV V1) found that Bangladesh, parts of southern and western Myanmar (the Ayeyarwady region and Rakhine state), and parts of southern and northwest Pakistan (Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces) were the most vulnerable from a climate security perspective. In terms of absolute numbers, the largest numbers of people who are exposed to climate hazards are in India followed by Bangladesh. Model results are compared with a geo-referenced version of the EM-DAT Disaster Database and by creating alternative model specifications informed by a survey of 18 regional experts.

There is a dominant view in the earlier empirical literature in favor of a positive effect of capital on performance. Using panel data gathered by the French supervisor, we also find evidence of this beneficial effect of capital, but try to go one step further by distinguishing between regulatory and voluntary capital. Using a two-step estimation procedure, and controlling for many factors (risk, asset composition, etc.), we show that voluntary capital, i.e. capital held by banks irrespective of their regulatory requirements, turns out to be the sole component of capital that affects performance positively. In contrast, the effect of regulatory capital on profitability appears to be insignificant, indicating that so far the increase in capital requirements has not been detrimental to bank profitability in France.

New exotic quantity-related weather contracts proposed by major energy exchanges (EEX) show a lot of potential but are still very illiquid.

We employ a regression discontinuity design using the re-centered Democratic margin of victory as a running variable, to overcome the identification challenge posed by confounding factors. Consistent with the literature on partisan affiliation, we find that immigrants are more likely to get out of poverty in states with Democratic governors than states with Republican governors. Our results are submitted to a variety of robustness checks and sensitivity tests, to assess the validity of the identification strategy, and highlight conditional lame-duck effects. A formal mediation analysis reveals that the empirical results are mediated through better access to the labor market and possibly through higher wages and labor earnings for immigrants.

The study uses kernel density estimation for 114 regions in V4 countries. The research period covered the years 2004-2015. The results show that all V4 economies except for Hungary reduced the distance to the EU-28 average over the period considered. The external convergence process was accompanied by an increase in income inequalities at the regional level. In all the countries, the estimated distributions of regional income were bimodal, with the clearly marked second mode related to the capital region. The obtained research results should be an indication of economic decisions in the context of regional (also known as cohesion) policy and economic competitiveness. This paper contributes to the existing literature in three ways. First, the study was conducted at the NUTS3 level, which is currently the lowest possible level of disaggregation. Second, the analysis covered both the period before and after the global financial crisis. Third, the results of the internal convergence study are not biased by the method used, as this method has already been tested in previous research for a group of large European economies.","[Kokocinska, Malgorzata] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Int Econ, Zielona Gora, Poland; [Puziak, Marcin] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Management, Dept Microecon, Poznan, Poland",University of Zielona Gora; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Kokocinska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Int Econ, Zielona Gora, Poland.",m.e.kokocinska@gmail.com; marcin.puziak@ue.poznan.pl,,"Kokocinska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-6464-5268",,,,,25,13,13,1,7,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

The two measures are important risk factors which affect firm share returns. This study also demonstrates that the orthogonalized exchange rate exposure model is better at capturing the effects of exchange rate movements towards large Malaysian firm share returns. In addition to this, it was found that there were not significant differences in terms of number of exposed firms to exchange rate movements, when the Trade Weighted Index (TWI) and multi bilateral exchange rates were used, both in nominal and real terms. The study results also have shown that large Malaysian firms, including financial firms, were exposed to exchange rate movements regardless their level of foreign involvement. Interestingly, most of the exposed large firms are negatively affected when there is depreciation on home currency especially to the US Dollar (USD) and Japanese Yen (JPY). Even though the exchange rate volatility has failed to solve the exchange rate exposure puzzle among large firms in Malaysia, but the high level of sensitivity for most of the firm share returns to exchange rate volatility should not be ignored. Policymakers and financial managers should closely monitor the foreign exchange markets to mitigate the negative impact of exchange rate movements. Future research should also look into the possibility that the relationship between exchange rate movements and share returns is asymmetric.","[Lily, Jaratin; Bujang, Imbarine; Karia, Abdul Aziz] Univ Teknol MARA Sabah, Fac Business Management, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Lily, Jaratin; Kogid, Mori] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Business Econ & Accountancy, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Sabah,"Lily, J (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA Sabah, Fac Business Management, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.;Lily, J (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Business Econ & Accountancy, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia.",jaratin@ums.edu.my; imbar074@sabah.uitm.edu.my; abdulaziz@sabah.uitm.edu.my; edy@ums.edu.my,"Karia, Abdul Aziz/AAZ-8834-2020; Bujang, Imbarine/AAV-8832-2021; Lily, Jaratin/I-5485-2016; Kogid, Mori/G-4183-2012","Karia, Abdul Aziz/0000-0002-4888-682X; Lily, Jaratin/0000-0001-6384-6562; Bujang, Imbarine/0000-0002-1427-0963; Kogid, Mori/0000-0002-7519-1193",,,,,62,1,1,1,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

They try to achieve a wide range of socio-economic and environmental effects through bundles of interventions that include the process of standard setting and compliance, advocacy among consumers, capacity building for producers, building supply chains, price interventions, and the application of acceptable labour standards, overall to improve the wellbeing of farmers and agricultural workers. This paper presents the results of a mixed-method systematic review that synthesized the literature on socio-economic effects of certification systems on agricultural producers and wage workers in low and middle income countries. The review followed the Campbell Collaboration guidelines for systematic reviews, and included studies published between 1990 and 2016 in different languages, with evidence on low and middle income countries. The review included a quantitative effectiveness question focused on a range of intermediate (e.g. prices, wages) and endpoint outcomes (e.g. household income). It also included a question on barriers, facilitators and contextual factors shaping effectiveness which drew on qualitative or mixed-method studies. Eligible certification systems were based on second (industry-level) or third-party certifications, and excluded own-company standards. For the effectiveness review, quantitative impact evaluations must use experimental or non-experimental methods demonstrating control for selection bias. With these inclusion criteria, the review includes 43 studies used for analysing quantitative effects, and 136 qualitative studies for synthesizing barriers, enablers and other contextual factors. Most included studies report on initiatives in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa and focus primarily on agricultural producers. The quality of the included studies is mixed, and several studies are weak on a number of methodological fronts, especially on statistical reporting. Overall, there is limited and mixed evidence on the effects of CS on a range of intermediate and final socio-economic outcomes for agricultural producers and wage workers. There are positive effects on prices and income from the sale of produce is higher for certified farmers. However, workers' wages do not seem to benefit from the presence of CS and, further along the causal chain, we find no evidence that total household income improves with certification. The integrated synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies shows that context matters substantially in all causal chains and multiple factors shape the effectiveness and causal mechanisms that link interventions associated with certification and the wellbeing of producers, workers and their families.

The objective of the study, therefore, is to ascertain which factors and variables influence customer satisfaction and, as a result, the competitiveness of the enterprise from within the food industry. The research has been conceived in two successive steps. The first of these is to discover the influence of selected factors on customer satisfaction. Amongst these were factors which not only sometimes clearly influenced customer satisfaction (factors of customer satisfaction), but also factors which clearly influenced other types of satisfaction which were then associated with customer satisfaction (personal characteristics). In the second step, mutual relationships between the two groups of factors is described. The research was carried out on a sample of firms in the food industry along with their end customers. Multiple regression and a hierarchical mixed-effect model with the appropriate statistical tests were used for modelling. From the results it emerges that only the factors of customer satisfaction (customer expectation, perceived quality and perceived value) have an effect on overall customer satisfaction. The influence of personal characteristics was not proven. However, a (weak) relationship was shown between some of the factors of customer satisfaction (perceived value, perceived quality, competitiveness and customer expectation) and a number of factors from the group of personal characteristics (financial capacity, level of optimism and level of planning).","[Suchanek, Petr; Kralova, Maria] Masaryk Univ Brno, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Suchanek, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ Brno, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Brno, Czech Republic.",suchy@econ.muni.cz; kralova@econ.muni.cz,"Králová, Maria/D-1801-2014; Suchanek, Petr/R-9626-2019","Králová, Maria/0000-0001-8515-8402; Suchanek, Petr/0000-0002-2606-4040",project Czech Science Foundation [16-16260S],project Czech Science Foundation,This article is an output of the project Czech Science Foundation no.

The Ricardian technique is applied with panel data which accounts for both adaptation strategies and household characteristics. This study proposes a two-stage Hsiao model to correct for collinearity between climatic variables and individual effects. The results show that in the dry season, increases in temperatures are beneficial to all farms in the warmer southern regions, while increases in precipitation will damage only irrigated farms in the Central and South regions. The impact of higher temperature in the wet season is similar, except that it will negatively affect net revenue of irrigated farms in the long run. More rainfall in the wet season will increase net revenue in the North region only. Finally, this study combines the estimated results with future climate scenarios to predict how future changes in climate will affect farmers on aggregate.","[Trong Anh Trinh] RMIT Univ, Coll Business, Sch Econ Finance & Marketing, Int Dev & Trade Res Grp, Bldg 80,Level 11,445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Trinh, TA (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Coll Business, Sch Econ Finance & Marketing, Int Dev & Trade Res Grp, Bldg 80,Level 11,445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",tronganh.trinh@rmit.edu.au,,"Trinh, Trong-Anh/0000-0001-8102-7122; Trinh, Trong-Anh/0000-0003-3347-8804",,,,,22,34,35,5,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Further decomposition suggests the need to effectively allocate resources across industries in order to promote aggregate productivity. Moreover, aggregate productivity growth coming from the total reallocation effect remains quite low, lending no support to the structural-bonus hypothesis. Overall, TFP growth is mainly contributed by incumbents firms, whereas the contribution by firm mobility was larger in some years.","[Yang, Chih-Hai; Yang, Chao-Jing] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan; [Chiu, Chung-Yueh; Lin, Hsuan-Yu] Ind Technol Res Inst, Ind Sci & Technol Int Strategy Ctr, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Central University; Industrial Technology Research Institute - Taiwan,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC 102-2410-H-008-005-MY3],Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology,Chih-Hai Yang gratefully acknowledges financial support from Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology under Grant Number NSC 102-2410-H-008-005-MY3.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of hedging by US currency futures contracts by taking into account the efficiency of the currency market. Design/methodology/approach The static models for calculating hedge ratio are as popular as dynamic models. But the main disadvantage with the static models is that they do not consider important properties of time series like autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity of the residuals and also ignore the cointegration of the market variables which indicate short-run market disequilibrium. The present study, therefore, measures the hedging effectiveness in the US currency futures market using two dynamic models - constant conditional correlation multivariate generalized ARCH (CCC-MGARCH) and dynamic conditional correlation multivariate GARCH (DCC-MGARCH). Findings The study finds that both the dynamic models used in the study provide similar results. The relative comparison of CCC-MGARCH and DCC-MGARCH models shows that CCC-MGARCH provides better hedging effectiveness result, and thus, should be preferred over the other model. Practical implications The findings of the study are important for the company treasurers since the new updated Indian accounting standards (Ind-AS), applicable from the financial year 2016-2017, make it mandatory for the companies to evaluate the effectiveness of hedges. These standards do not specify a quantitative method of evaluation but provide the flexibility to the companies in choosing an appropriate method which justifies their risk management objective. These results are also useful for the policy makers as they can specify and list the appropriate methods for evaluating the hedge effectiveness in the currency market. Originality/value Majorly, the studies on Indian financial market limit themselves to either examining the efficiency of that market or to evaluate the effectiveness of the hedges undertaken. Moreover, most of such works focus on the stock market or the commodity market in India. This is one of the first studies which bring together the concepts of efficiency of the market and effectiveness of the hedges in the Indian currency futures market.","[Kharbanda, Varuna; Singh, Archana] Delhi Technol Univ, Delhi Sch Management, Delhi, India",Delhi Technological University,"Kharbanda, V (通讯作者)，Delhi Technol Univ, Delhi Sch Management, Delhi, India.",varunakharbanda@gmail.com; sarchana03@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,105,4,4,2,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

J,"Nguyen, TXT",,,,Thi Xuan Trang Nguyen,,,Corporate governance and conglomerate diversification strategy - evidence from Vietnam,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Vietnam; Corporate governance; Free cash flow; Conglomerate diversification,OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; FIRM DIVERSIFICATION; AGENCY PROBLEMS; PERFORMANCE,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of internal corporate governance mechanisms, including interest alignment and control devices, on the unrelated diversification level in Vietnam. Additionally, the moderation of free cash flow (FCF) on these relationships is also tested. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on a balanced panel data set of 70 listed companies in both stock markets, Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange and Hanoi Stock Exchange, in Vietnam for the years 2007-2014, which gives 560 observations in total. Findings The results show that if executive ownership for CEOs is increased, then the extent of diversification is likely to be reduced. However, the link between unrelated diversification level and executive stock option, another interest alignment device, cannot be confirmed. Among three control devices (level of blockholder ownership, board composition and separation of CEO and chairman positions), the study finds a positive connection between diversification and blockholder ownership, and statistically insignificant relations between the conglomerate diversification level and board composition, or CEO duality. Additionally, this study discovers a negative link between diversification and state ownership, although there is no evidence to support the change to the effect of each internal corporate governance mechanism on the diversification level of a firm between high and low FCF. Practical implications The research can be a useful reference not only for investors and managers but also for policy makers in Vietnam. This study explores the relationship among corporate governance, diversification and firm value in Vietnam, where the topics related to effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms to public companies has been increasingly attractive to researchers since the default of Vietnam Shipbuilding Industry Group (Vinashin) happened in 2010 and the Circular No. 121/2012/TT-BTC on 26 July 2012 of the Vietnamese Ministry of Finance was issued with regulations on corporate governance applicable to listed firms in this country. Originality/value This research, first, enriches current literature on the relationship between corporate governance and firm diversification. It can be considered as a contribution to the related topic with an example of Vietnam, a developing country in Asia. Second, the research continues to prove non-unification in results showing the relationship between corporate governance and conglomerate diversification among different nations. Third, it provides a potential input for future research works on the moderation of FCF to the effects of corporate governance on diversification.","[Thi Xuan Trang Nguyen] Univ Danang, Univ Econ, Danang, Vietnam; [Thi Xuan Trang Nguyen] Pecsi Tud Egyet Kozgazdasagtud Kar, Pecs, Hungary",University of Danang; University of Pecs,"Nguyen, TXT (通讯作者)，Univ Danang, Univ Econ, Danang, Vietnam.;Nguyen, TXT (通讯作者)，Pecsi Tud Egyet Kozgazdasagtud Kar, Pecs, Hungary.",trangntx@due.edu.vn,,,,,,,41,8,9,0,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Exposure to floods reduces the number of completed grades of children in Ethiopia, India, and Vietnam. For the case of Vietnam, exposure to floods also decreases school enrollment, and cognitive ability scores of children. Although floods do not have a significant effect on children in India, droughts, frosts, and hailstorms have a significantly negative effect on cognitive ability test scores of children.

Leveraging an unexplored natural experiment that changes the priority of claims on banks' assets, we document asymmetric effects that are consistent with changes in monitoring intensity by various creditors depending on whether creditors move up or down the priority ladder. The enactment of depositor preference laws that confer priority on depositors reduces deposit rates but increases nondeposit rates. Importantly, subordinating nondepositor claims reduces bank risk-taking, consistent with market discipline.

To evaluate the contribution of changes in each determinant, I construct counterfactual emissions scenarios in a sample consisting of 34 sectors in 37 countries over 1995-2009. I compare these scenarios quantitatively using a novel metric, namely the relative cumulative emissions. I find that the composition of output and the carbon intensity of sectors individually or jointly constrained emissions in a large majority of countries. This motivates an analysis of high- and low-carbon intensity sectors, denoted HCI and LCI, where emissions and value-added tend to be concentrated, respectively. I document the cross-country variation in HCI sectors' carbon intensity and show it declines over time largely due to improvements in developing countries. HCI sectors tend to account for a smaller share of employment; be more capital intensive; and employ a workforce with a lower average skill level. Employment declined in HCI sectors and increased in LCI sectors with its composition shifting towards high-skilled workers in both. Capital intensity growth was faster but multifactor productivity growth was slower in HCI sectors.","[Doda, Baran] London Sch Econ, CCCEP, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Doda, Baran] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Doda, B (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, CCCEP, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Doda, B (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",L.B.Doda@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - UK Economic and Social Research Council; ESRC [ES/R009708/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - UK Economic and Social Research Council; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was supported by the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, which is funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council.

Tax levels of 16, 60 and 290 Euro per ton of GHG emissions are used in the estimations. Our results show that consumption taxes have small mitigation effects, up to 4.9% of total agricultural emissions from the EU-27, mainly due to inelastic demand.

In this paper, we have measured the untapped work capacity of old persons, using the microdata gathered in the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR), a longitudinal survey carried out on subjects aged 50-75. Our computed results show that the volume of untapped work capacity of the Japanese elderly aged 60-79 is vast, amounting to more than 11 million workers at present. We have also applied the computed results to the National Transfer Accounts (NTA) framework, and quantified the magnitude of the use of the untapped work capacity upon potential economic growth. The accumulated effect of the economic support ratio upon potential economic growth is substantial in the long term, generating a sizable amount of the so called silver dividend. We have also examined the issue of whether or not the use of untapped work capacity provided by old persons could affect the well-being of workers in other age groups. The regression results support the view that the substitutability between the selected age groups of the elderly and the young is negligible, so that the utilization of potential work capacity of elderly persons is unlikely to pose any serious threat to the employment opportunities of their young counterparts in Japan.

Low-duration firms generate short-run cash flows and face strong reinvestment risk. High-duration firms have long-run cash flows and their present value increases when discount rates decrease as a result of a deteriorating investment environment. Our empirical analysis reveals a significant return premium of low-duration stocks, confirming that investors charge a risk premium for stocks with returns that are positively related to the investment environment. Our newly introduced risk factor carries significant risk premiums in cross-sectional asset pricing tests. These premiums are robust to including further risk factors and a variety of different test specifications. Notably, our duration risk factor retains high explanatory power on the cross-section of stock returns in a model including direct measurement of the investment environment via state variable innovations.

We study how workers who lose their jobs in establishment closures in Germany cope with their loss of employment. About a fifth of these displaced workers do not return to social-security covered employment within the next three years. Among those who do get re-employed, about two-thirds leave their old industry and one-third move out of their region. However, which of these two types of mobility responses workers will choose depends on the local industry mix in ways that are suggestive of Marshallian benefits to job search. In particular, large concentrations of one's old industry makes it easier to find new jobs: in regions where the pre-displacement industry is large, displaced workers suffer relatively small earnings losses and find new work faster. In contrast, large local industries skill-related to the pre-displacement industry increase earnings losses but also protect against long-term unemployment. Analyzed through the lens of a job-search model, the exact spatial and industrial job-switching patterns reveal that workers take these Marshallian externalities into account when deciding how to allocate search efforts among industries.","[Neffke, Frank M.

Overall, a parsimonious Vector Heterogeneous Autoregressive (VHAR) model that involves lagged daily, weekly and monthly realised covariances achieves the best performance out of the competing models. A promising new simple hybrid covariance estimator is developed that exploits option-implied information and high-frequency data while adjusting for the volatility riskpremium. Relative model performance does not change during the global financial crisis, or, if a different forecast horizon, or, intraday sampling frequency is employed.

(2009), we define and construct Granger-causality tail risk networks between 33 systemically important banks (G-SIBS) and 36 sovereign bonds worldwide. Our purpose is to exploit the structure of the Granger-causality tail risk networks to identify periods of distress in financial markets and possible channels of systemic risk propagation. Combining measures of connectedness of these networks with the ratings of the sovereign bonds, we propose a flight-to quality indicator to identify periods of turbulence in the market. Our measure clearly peaks at the onset of the European sovereign debt crisis, signaling the instability of the financial system. Finally, we use the connectedness measures of the networks to forecast the quality of sovereign bonds. We find that connectedness is a significant predictor of the cross-section of bond quality.

When the central bank does not pay interest on reserves, the price level moves one for-one with the monetary base. If, instead, the central bank can pay interest on reserves at market rates, the price level can decouple from the quantity of monetary assets in the economy: a larger monetary base need not imply a higher price level.

Gender equality is, however, at the center of the sustainable development, as emphasized by Goal 5 of the SDGs; therefore, individual-based measures are indispensable to track progress in reaching this Goal. We contribute to the literature on multidimensional poverty and gender inequality by proposing an individual-based multidimensional poverty measure for Nicaragua and estimate the gender gaps in the three l's of multidimensional poverty (incidence, intensity, and inequality). Overall, we find that in Nicaragua, the gender gaps in multidimensional poverty are lower than 5%, and poverty does not seem to be feminized. However, the inequality among the multidimensionally poor is clearly feminized, especially among adults, and women are living in very intense poverty when compared to men. We also find that adding a dimension (employment, domestic work, and social protection) under which women face higher deprivation into the analysis leads to larger estimates of the incidence, intensity, and inequality of women's poverty. Finally, we find evidence that supports earlier studies that challenge the notion that female-headed households are worse off than those led by males in terms of poverty. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The article shows that although on the level of policy choices and design, the global-Western discourse has also entered the East Asian mission-oriented innovation policy rhetoric, this has not stopped the policymakers in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan from relying on old developmentalist logics for legitimizing these policies. This also influences actual policy implementation styles: as opposed to Western models of peripheral Schumpeterian agencies offering dynamic capabilities, the East Asian innovation bureaucracies seem to rely on more visible and politicized organizations for such capabilities.

In this review paper we question the frequently stressed argument that technology-neutral schemes will promote RES-E deployment cost-effectively. We use a simple partial equilibrium model of the electricity sector with one representative investor as a vehicle to synthesize the existing literature, and review potential rationales for technology-specific RES-E support. The analysis addresses market failures associated with technological development, long-term risk taking, path dependencies as well as various external costs, all of which drive a wedge between the private and the social costs of RES-E deployment. Based on analytical insight and a review of empirical literature, we conclude that the relevance of these market failures is typically heterogeneous across different RES-E technologies. The paper also discusses a number of possible caveats to implementing cost-effective technology-specific support schemes in practice, including the role of various informational and politico-economic constraints. While these considerations involve important challenges, neither of them suggests an unambiguous plea for technology-neutral RES-E support policies either. We close by highlighting principles for careful RES-E policy design, and by outlining four important avenues for future research.","[Lehmann, Paul] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Soderholm, Patrik] Lulea Univ Technol, Econ Unit, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Lulea University of Technology,"Lehmann, P (通讯作者)，UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",paul.lehmann@ufz.de; patrik.soderholm@ltu.se,"Lehmann, Paul/F-8207-2013","Lehmann, Paul/0000-0001-7999-9125",German Helmholtz Association [HA-303]; Swedish Research Council Formas,German Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"Research for this article has been funded by the German Helmholtz Association under Grant HA-303 as well as the Swedish Research Council Formas.

This study investigates the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for additional measures to reduce the risk of invasion of the Australian mainland by the Asian tiger mosquito (ATM). The study contributes to the literature by applying a stated preference method to estimate the public's WTP to reduce the risk of an ATM invasion, expressed as a change in probability. It is the first ex ante invasive species analysis to test over two discrete invasion reduction probabilities based on management effort. Further, to overcome the challenges in valuing changes in probabilities, the study presented respondents with a well-defined discrete difference in the final probability, with one scenario reducing risk from 50 to 25% and the other from 50 to 5%. We find a significant difference in the mean WTP values between these two scenarios (A$67 vs. A$90). The overall conclusion is that estimated benefits of reducing the probability of an ATM incursion outweigh the costs.","[Mwebaze, Paul; Beebe, Nigel W.; De Barro, Paul] CSIRO, 41 Boggo Rd,Dutton Pk, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia; [Bennett, Jeff] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Beebe, Nigel W.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Devine, Gregor J.] QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, 300 Herston Rd, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University; University of Queensland; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute,"Mwebaze, P (通讯作者)，CSIRO, 41 Boggo Rd,Dutton Pk, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia.",paul.mwebaze@csiro.au,"Bennett, Jeff W/A-1084-2008; De Barro, Paul J/C-1724-2008; Mwebaze, Paul/J-5905-2013; Devine, Gregor J/H-1141-2014; Beebe, Nigel W/C-5610-2008","Devine, Gregor J/0000-0001-6312-0390; Beebe, Nigel W/0000-0003-2877-0691",CSIRO Health & Biosecurity Business Unit,CSIRO Health & Biosecurity Business Unit,"This research was funded by the CSIRO Health & Biosecurity Business Unit.

We calculate the joint characteristic function of two futures contracts in the model in analytic form and use it to price calendar spread options. In an empirical application we show that the model, in contrast to simpler nested models, can be successfully calibrated to market prices of vanilla and calendar spread options. Our second aim is to use this model to analyze the dependence structure of Crude Oil futures contracts. To this end, we propose analytical expressions giving the copula and copula density directly in terms of the joint characteristic function. These tools allow us to perform an in-depth analysis for pairs of futures, and we observe a phenomenon we call the Samuelson correlation effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper considers the case of the cut flower industry in Ethiopia to provide such quantitative evidences. We collected workers' primary data and conducted incentivized experiments to measure their cognitive abilities, risk preference, and other behavioral characteristics. Based on propensity-score matching and doubly robust estimations to facilitate rigorous comparisons, we find that production workers in the cut flower sector earn significantly more than similar workers in other sectors, most probably due to the flower farms' interest to reduce costly worker turnovers. In addition, workers in the sector save more regularly than workers in other sectors who have similar characteristics, and the amount saved relative to the income level is also higher, after controlling for the frequency of wage payment and employment status. The subjective valuation of their jobs is also higher in the cut flower sector, particularly in terms of the income level, stability, and future prospect, but workers in the sector are not necessarily more satisfied with the type of work they do. Unlike other sectors where wage payment decreases with worker's age, wage in the flower sector does not vary with age. Risk-averse individuals are more satisfied in the cut flower sector, while work experience reduces the satisfaction level on future prospect more in this sector relative to other sectors.

Web mapping services provide a new mechanism to acquire the travel cost indicators directly, saving significant time for data collection and complex calculations. Meanwhile, the spatial interaction model gives the opportunity to estimate the traveling probability and population at the macro scale without actual mobility data. In this study, we introduce population grid data into the new Gravity-Radiation model for population flow estimation, and utilize Google Maps API to acquire travel costs at grid level. Then, the new estimated potential traveling population (EPTP) weighted travel costs are proposed to measure the overall accessibility at multiple scales. The results show that the EPTP is strongly correlated with the resident population at both the SUA (significant urban area, roughly equal to city) and state levels in Australia. The national EPTP weighted travel time to SUM with maximum traveling probability is 0.26 h with an average speed of 42.53 km/h. For different SUM or states, larger populated regions tend to have a higher-level EPTP weighted travel time with a lower-level average speed. These results can provide valuable and accurate accessibility patterns for various researches and applications, such as policymaking, urban planning, epidemic spreading, and environment protection.","[Xia, Nan; Cheng, Liang; Chen, Song; Zong, WenWen; Li, ManChun] Nanjing Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xia, Nan; Cheng, Liang; Chen, Song; Zong, WenWen; Li, ManChun] Nanjing Univ, Dept Geog Informat Sci, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xia, Nan] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Cheng, Liang; Li, ManChun] Nanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr South Sea Studies, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wei, XiaoYan] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Nanjing University; Australian National University; Nanjing University; Nanjing Normal University,"Cheng, L (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Dept Geog Informat Sci, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",lcheng@nju.edu.cn,"Xia, Nan/ABG-4600-2021",,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0504205]; National Science Foundation of China [41622109, 41371017]; Special Research Fund of the Ministry of Land and Resources, China [201411014-03]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Research Fund of the Ministry of Land and Resources, China","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFB0504205), the National Science Foundation of China (41622109, 41371017) and the Special Research Fund of the Ministry of Land and Resources, China for Non Profit Sector (No. 201411014-03).

The hypothesis of this work is that the evolution of the geographical pattern of countries' foreign trade influences the inland distribution of maritime traffic and, consequently, the use of the infrastructure. The inter-port distribution of the Spanish exports in 2000 and 2015 was analysed in order to confirm the validity of this hypothesis. To that end, the Spatial Interaction Models approach was adopted. The results suggest that the final destination of the flows does influence the inland distribution of the Spanish container flows and, consequently, that the use of the inland transport infrastructure has evolved in line with the geographical pattern of foreign trade.","[Zanon Moura, Ticiana Grecco; Garcia-Alonso, Lorena] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, REGIOlab, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Zanon Moura, Ticiana Grecco] Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Rod Jorge Amado,Km 16, BR-45662900 Ilheus, Brazil; [del Rosal, Ignacio] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo; Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz; University of Oviedo,"Garcia-Alonso, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, REGIOlab, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",tgzmoura@uesc.br; lorena@uniovi.es; irosal@uniovi.es,"Del Rosal, Ignacio/AAH-5353-2019; Garcia-Alonso, Lorena/H-6256-2014; Moura, Ticiana Grecco Zanon/AAN-7341-2020","Garcia-Alonso, Lorena/0000-0001-8318-2492; Moura, Ticiana Grecco Zanon/0000-0003-3290-4269; Del Rosal, Ignacio/0000-0002-3047-398X","Government of Spain [MTM2014-54199-P]; Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte del Principado de Asturias","Government of Spain(Spanish Government); Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte del Principado de Asturias","The authors would like to thank the Editor and the anonymous reviewers for their insights and suggestions which helped to improve the paper significantly.

Simulations show that these MLPs provide investors with higher returns, lower risk, and thus a higher Sharpe ratio than the traditional strategy of buy-and-hold the S&P 500 index fund.","[Chen, Haiwei] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Management, 303Tanana Loop,St 201, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Thanh Ngo] East Carolina Univ, Dept Finance, 3127 Bate Bldg, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"Chen, HW (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Management, 303Tanana Loop,St 201, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",hchen13@alaska.edu; ngot@ecu.edu,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

Our results document that banks apply, on average, lower spreads to multi-rated firms. This effect depends on the reduction of information asymmetry about borrowers' creditworthiness (information production hypothesis) and on the benefits in regulatory terms (regulatory certification hypothesis). In addition, consistent with the rating shopping hypothesis, we find that banks price the risk that borrowers shopped for better ratings, especially in crisis periods. Our results also hold when considering crisis periods, the unobserved heterogeneity of lenders, the use of rating-based pricing, and adopting a matched sample. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SEOs represent cleaner exogenous activity alleviating the reverse causality issue plaguing many prior studies examining the relation between firm performance and CSR. Using a large sample of U.S. SEOs, we find high-CSR issuers experience fewer negative market reactions to SEO announcements. We also show ethical issuers have incentive to provide extensive and informative disclosures, which mitigate the degree of information asymmetry, thereby decreasing SEO underpricing. Among CSR categories, we find issuers engaging in community and environmental CSR activities and improving the rights of women and minorities are more effective at reducing SEO negative announcement returns and underpricing. Our findings remain robust after controlling for possible self-selection bias and endogeneity problems. Overall, our findings support the stakeholder value maximization view of stakeholder theory and ethical theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, the enhancing effect of stock market deepening on innovation requires a lower level of political democracy. Further, we find that increasing the state's openness and competitiveness in the executive recruitment of leaders is the main channel through which political democratization promotes the role of banking and stock markets for financing innovation.

This paper uses the data set provided by the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey that was conducted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank during the period from 2012 to 2014. Using a sample of 1,140 firms, it was discovered that firms having an overdraft facility from banks use more trade credit, and this supports the complementary theory of bank credit and trade credit. Moreover, the results suggest that companies that are younger, innovative, risky, with a concentrated ownership structure and operated by an experienced manager use more trade credit to purchase their material inputs and services.

We study the effects of the California Coastal Act, one of the nation's most stringent land-use regulations, on the price and rental income of multifamily housing. The Coastal Act applies to a narrow section of the California coast, allowing us to compare properties just on either side of the jurisdictional boundary. The setting is advantageous for the study of land-use regulation: boundary location is plausibly exogenous, which we confirm with historical data on boundary placement, and orthogonal to other jurisdictional divisions. We decompose the effects of the regulation into (i) a neighbor effect, the value of restrictions on adjacent properties, (ii) a local effect, which reflects the net effect of own-lot restrictions and the neighbor effect, and (iii) an external effect, the value of amenities generated by restrictions on all properties within the regulated area. Our analysis of multifamily housing prices reveals local and external effects of approximately + 6% and + 13%, respectively. We use data on rental income to estimate a zero neighbor effect. Together with evidence on building ages and assessed building and land values, this suggests that property owners anticipate that the Coastal Act will provide protection from undesirable development on adjacent properties, even though material differences have not yet appeared.","[Severen, Christopher] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Plantinga, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Plantinga, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",plantinga@bren.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,39,14,14,4,30,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

Lack of national urban policies and tensions between national and city governments are common. Yet, for decades, research has identified small-scale innovations at the urban scale. Rarely, however, are policy innovations in African cities so influential as to lead national governments to scale up city based actions. This is particularly true in sectors that have been the dominant purview of central governments. This paper examines how citizens, civil society organizations, city governments and national bureaucrats in two cities of East Africa - Kampala and Nairobi - have interacted to produce policy innovation in agriculture. Agriculture has always been a sector of high national importance in Africa, but increasingly cities are becoming focal points for agricultural policy change. The two cities compared in the paper are unusual in having a collection of interests who have been advocating for improved support and recognition of urban food production. Indeed, these cities are rare for having continually promoted the formalization of urban agriculture in local and national policy. While advocacy for urban agriculture is common globally, what is not clear is under what conditions local advocacy produces policy uptake and change. What are the conditions when city-based advocacy deepens the institutionalization of policy support locally and nationally? Drawing from theory and research on policy change and African urban politics and governance, and qualitative data collection in each country, this paper argues that while external, international assistance has helped initiate policy dialogue, domestic civil society organizations and their engagement with local and national bureaucrats are key to policy support at the local and national scales.

Stakeholder participation in initiating, designing or implementing institutions is claimed to establish a sense of ownership among the stakeholders and subsequently improve the intended outcomes of the given institution. Theoretical and empirical justifications of the hypothesis remain scarce. A better understanding of the effects of local participation can motivate more extensive and stronger participation of local stakeholders and improve institutional performance. This paper applies theories from psychology and behavioral economics to sense of ownership. The empirical investigation is a framed field experiment in the context of tropical forest conservation and payments for environmental services in Tanzania. The results lend little support to the hypothesis in this context. The participation treatment in the experiment is weak, and a possible explanation is that sense of ownership is sensitive to the participation form.","[Handberg, Oyvind Nystad] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Handberg, ON (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway.",oyvind.handberg@nmbu.no,,,"Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) - Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad); Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation (CCIAM) programme - Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)","Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) - Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation (CCIAM) programme - Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD)","The author appreciates financial support from the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and from the Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation (CCIAM) programme, both funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad).

The main rationale for the research is that because an MRA eliminates technical barriers to trade (TBT), the trade promotion effects of MRAs are inversely much stronger if TBT originally restricted trade before their entry into force. Using data on MRAs and international trade in 34 countries and 22 manufacturing sectors covering 1995 to 2009, the paper empirically shows that the trade promotion effects of MRAs can be much stronger, depending on the type of contract, time period after the entry into force, components of exports, and country and industry characteristics such as technology level and global competitiveness. The results will provide insight for policy makers and stakeholders who cooperate with foreign countries in various regulations, especially in developing countries that have low levels of technology, competitiveness, and regulatory governance capacity.","[Jang, Yong Joon] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Jang, YJ (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",yjjang@khu.ac.kr,"Jang, Yong Joon/AAJ-8754-2020","Jang, Yong Joon/0000-0001-5338-9804",,,,,45,3,3,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

To do so, we exploit a large-scale French reform that granted most firms a tax credit proportional to the wagebill of their employees paid below a given threshold. This policy effectively translated into a cut in labor cost whose magnitude varies depending on firm-specific wage structures. We use the predicted treatment intensity based on pre-reform composition of the labor force as an instrument for the actual policy-induced firm-level change in labor costs. Although our point estimates are consistent with commonly estimated firm-level trade elasticities combined with reasonable labor shares in total costs, coefficients are found to be very noisy, suggesting lack of robust evidence of a causal effect of the policy.

The banks' efforts to keep their lending margin stable, however, are not successful as we detect a significant compression. We document these findings for the euro area as a whole and for its individual member states. In particular, banks in the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland lowered their lending standards after expansionary monetary policy shocks.

They then correlate those measures with consequential outcomes, such as development lending, trade, or military disputes. Dynamic ideal point models of UNGA voting thus far have been restricted to a single dimension. We examine the existence of a stable, important, and interpretable second dimension underlying contestation in the UN. From the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, North-South conflict constitutes a stable second dimension, shaped heavily by the agenda-setting powers of the so-called Non-aligned Movement and the Group of 77. In the periods before and after, the second dimension neither is stable nor easily interpretable, though it is sometimes important. We suggest that in most applications, our original one-dimensional estimates have conceptual advantages with minimal losses in explanatory value. We illustrate that conclusion with an analysis that correlates ideal point changes with militarized interstate disputes. Yet, our findings also suggest that scholars interested in specific issues, such as the Middle East, human rights, or arms control, might benefit from more specifically tailored ideal point estimates.","[Bailey, Michael A.; Voeten, Erik] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Voeten, E (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",ev42@georgetown.edu,"Bailey, Michael A/B-1282-2009","Voeten, Erik/0000-0002-1002-3770",,,,,39,13,16,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176.0,1-2,,,SI,,33,55,,10.1007/s11127-018-0550-4,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438459400004,0

We gave participants the option to allocate up to 20% of their projected pension accrual to a lump sum. In particular, we investigated the joint effects of consumption and investment frames and gain and loss frames. We present strong evidence for framing effects in annuity demand. Framing effects remain significant when we control for individual characteristics. We also find robust evidence of individual characteristics influencing annuity demand, highlighting the importance of heterogeneity among participants, for example risk aversion, time preference and trust in the pension fund. Gender and long-term debt positions have significant impact how one responds to framing. We conclude that Dutch plan members generally welcome the partial lump sum option over mandatory full annuitization. The application of frames appears to predictively steer annuity demand. The precise effect framing may have, would probably also depend on the institutional environment, which predefines the perspective through which individuals filter annuities.","[Bockweg, Christian] Luck Probst Associates GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany; [Ponds, Eduard] Tilburg Univ, APG Asset Management, Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Steenbeek, Onno] Erasmus Sch Econ, APG Asset Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Vonken, Joyce] Tilburg Univ, APG, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Tilburg University,"Ponds, E (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, APG Asset Management, Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands.",eduard.ponds@apg.nl,,"ponds, eduard/0000-0002-8947-5795",,,,,40,13,13,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

It also identifies development narratives that social entrepreneurs (SEs) construct to represent and promote their work as an important research gap in development studies. Drawing on the development and narratology literature, and employing computational linguistics (CL) techniques, this article compares the development narratives of 1076 Ashoka SEs across two periods (2009-2013 and 1994-1998) and two economies (developing and developed). CL analyses reveal important themes that characterize the identity, framing and orientations of development SEs across time and economies. The findings demonstrate how SE development narratives i) tend to be more pragmatic and solution-centric, and contain less political ideology than conventional development narratives, ii) combine extant development ideas and models but reframe them in new ways to address contemporary, complex development challenges, and iii) reflect a 'bottom-up' approach that encourages local ownership and collaborations with various social and economic sectors to achieve development goals. Overall, this study identifies the increasing importance of SEs in the development industry and reveals new aspects of SEs their latent political framing, collective-utilitarian identities, and topical areas that require further research via development narratives.

Since liquidity creation is a major economic function of banks, their liquidity creation behavior may amplify business cycle fluctuations. Using the methodology of Berger and Bouwman (2009) to compute liquidity creation measures, we analyze the relation between GDP growth and liquidity creation of Russian banks from 2004 to 2015. Detailed quarterly data on a very large sample of banks and coexistence of different bank ownership types (state-owned, domestic private and foreign banks), makes Russia an ideal natural laboratory for study of cyclicality of liquidity creation for banks. We find that liquidity creation of banks is procyclical. We show that the liquidity creation behavior of state-owned banks and foreign-owned banks is similar to that of domestic private banks in terms of procyclicality. We further find that the magnitude of procyclicality is higher for liquidity creation than for lending. Thus, while ownership of banks does not influence the cyclicality of bank liquidity creation, liquidity creation behavior of banks can amplify business cycle fluctuations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a method to measure how the built environment and socioeconomic diversity play a role in the subjective definition of the boundaries of the PWN. The methodology is based on discrete choice models and was applied to data coming from a survey to 170 residents of Santiago, Chile, who reported their PWN shape by sketching it over a digital map. Results show that built environment and individual characteristics have a significant and heterogeneous impact on the size and shape of the PWN.

Agricultural development programs, aiming to integrate the Sahara in the national economy, were based on an agribusiness model implemented outside existing oases - in the so-called extensions - through the conquest of new agricultural land and the use of pumped groundwater. The rehabilitation of existing 'traditional' oases received less attention as their capacity for agricultural development was thought limited. While the new agricultural landscape is considered by policy makers to be a creatio ex nihilo, we demonstrate that the extensions are in fact, the creatio ex materia of the ancient oases, and that the two Saharan agricultural landscapes are firmly connected. The objective of this article is then to challenge the dichotomous view of Saharan agricultural development and the underlying binary policy categories. This demonstration is based on a study of the Sidi Okba oasis and the surrounding extensions. The results of this study first show that the binary framing of agricultural development in Algeria's Sahara is inadequate, as it neglects the temporal and spatial continuities and the hybridity of both landscapes. However, the study also shows that binary policy categories, even when they are inaccurate, participate in the construction of the new Saharan agricultural realities. We conclude that the new extensions are a better-adapted version of the traditional oasis in the context of globalization but in continuity with the ancient oasis. Questions concerning the social, economic and environmental sustainability of this model remain to be answered. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The generalized methods of moments estimation results suggest that firms have a target accounts receivable level and move toward this target quickly. In addition, we find that short term finance, internal cash flow, positive sales growth, product quality, and profitability are playing an important role in the trade credit policy. The study recommends that firms must pay attention to their relationship with customers because they represent an important investment opportunity.

To this end we build a two-country macroeconomic model with banking sectors that are owned by residents of one (big and foreign) country. Consistently with empirical findings, in our model foreign ownership of banks amplifies spillovers from foreign shocks. It also strengthens the international transmission of monetary and macroprudential policies. We next use the model to replicate the financial crisis in the euro area and show how, by preventing bank capital outflow in 2009, the Polish regulatory authorities managed to reduce its contagion to Poland. We also find that under foreign bank ownership such policy is strongly preferred to a recapitalization of domestic banks. Finally, we check how foreign ownership of banks affects transmission of domestic shocks to find that it has a stabilizing effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, when bidders are opportunistic, the fraction of stock in the deal payment will be lower for better informed targets. We test this intuitive prediction against the alternative that stock payments primarily reflect bidder concerns with target adverse selection, which implies a greater fraction of stock in the deal payment for better informed targets. Discriminating between these two mutually exclusive and nested predictions requires measures of target information about the bidder but not of market mispricing. We find that public bidders systematically use more stock in the payment when the target knows more about the bidder. Tests exploiting exogenous variation in bidder market-to-book ratios also fail to support bidder opportunism. Finally, greater potential competition from private bidders is associated with greater propensity for public bidders to pay in cash. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Eckbo, B.

They are widely regarded to be the province of the most socially and economically disempowered members of society. What is unclear is whether the low status of buses deters wider bus use. This paper explores the interplay between status and habitus, suggesting that an anti-bus disposition (an ingrained feeling of incompatibility with bus use) deters bus use amongst a middle-class group of managers and professionals. Further, it proposes that this anti-bus disposition operates in a geographically limited field; that is, people who are deterred from bus use in one location may quite happily use buses in another. The paper concludes with brief recommendations on how to address an anti-bus disposition and encourage bus use.","[Fitt, Helen] Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Fitt, H (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",helen.fitt@canterbury.ac.nz,"Fitt, Helen/J-4355-2014","Fitt, Helen/0000-0002-8741-0701",,,,,66,10,11,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

This personalization includes buyer reviews, personal pictures and profiles, and other biographical information intended to reduce buyers' perceived purchase risk or to facilitate trust in the sellers. However, this phenomenon is transforming what started as an essentially anonymous market to one susceptible to traditional market failures, including potential racial discrimination, in a manner similar to its brick and mortar counterparts. In this paper, we examine the effect of on-line host information (race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) on the price of available rental listings in San Francisco on Airbnb.com. We find that on average, Asian and Hispanic hosts charge 8%-10% lower prices relative to their White counterparts on equivalent rental properties, after controlling for all renter-available information on rental unit characteristics, as well as additional information on neighborhood property values, area demographics, and occupancy rates. We do not find any differences in occupancy rates between minority and White hosts. This may suggest that minorities price lower because they are forward-looking, perhaps due to an expectation of discrimination in the online marketplace or have a preference to increase demand to either maintain their target occupancy level or to attract a larger pool of potential renters to choose from. Overall, our findings are consistent with but not conclusive of a market test of potential racial discrimination affecting Hispanic Airbnb hosts, manifested in an anticipation of disparate market demand for their rentals, and responded to by lower listing prices.

The key factor underlying the change in their views was what they learned from their study of U.S. historical experience, especially their empirical confirmation of the Fed's role in the Great Depression.

The current study explores 2 main questions that relate to risk preferences among people with disabilities. First, it explores the potential relationship between risk preferences and employment by comparing the risk preferences of employed and unemployed people with disabilities. Second, it questions whether the risk preferences of people with disabilities are different from those of people without disabilities. To measure risk preferences in these 3 populations, we used 2 common elicitation methods: the Holt-Laury task and the balloon analogue risk task. The 2 methods complement each other, as the Holt-Laury task measures decisions from description and explicit risk-taking, whereas the balloon analogue risk task measures decisions from experience and implicit risk-taking. The results revealed no difference in risk preferences between people with and without disabilities. However, contrary to propositions from earlier studies, employed people with disabilities were found to be more risk-averse than unemployed people with disabilities. One possible interpretation of the results could be that risk aversion increases the willingness of people with disabilities to make compromises in order to participate in the labor market.","[Pinto, Ofir Y.] Natl Insurance Inst Israel, Jerusalem, Israel; [Pinto, Ofir Y.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federmann Sch Publ Policy & Govt, Jerusalem, Israel; [Ert, Eyal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Ert, Eyal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Agr Econ Res, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Ert, E (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.;Ert, E (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Agr Econ Res, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Jerusalem, Israel.",eyal.ert@mail.huji.ac.il,", Eyal/AAW-1928-2020",", Eyal/0000-0001-6507-3532",National Insurance Institute of Israel [87185],National Insurance Institute of Israel,"This research was supported by a grant from the National Insurance Institute of Israel (87185).

Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore terminal competition and selection criteria in the dry bulk market with a case study applied in Izmir, Turkey. A mixed methodology approach that combines qualitative and quantitative data is employed. The paper reveals seven main criteria for dry bulk terminal selection. One of them, the physical and technical capability of the terminal, is found to be a pre-condition that cannot be traded off. The importance weights of the other six selection criteria are ascertained using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis. Cargo handling costs are the most important criterion, while the other criteria in rank order are damage/loss performance, location, handling speed, responsiveness, and storage facilities. The results indicate that dry bulk shippers have different rankings of selection criteria, thus suggesting that shippers' expectations are heterogeneous. Although dry bulk terminal selection criteria are similar to those in container shipping, the content is quite different.

The sign-test generally dominates the signed-rank test in terms of size, and dominates both the t-test and the signed-rank test in terms of power. Traditional adjustment methods often lead to a misspecified sign-test. We propose a new and parsimonious method (the spread-matched method), which leads to a well-specified and more powerful sign-test. The superiority of the spread-matched method is particularly evident for observations characterized by extreme levels of CDS spread. Analyses of CDS samples differing by contract maturity, data source, and time period confirm these results. We perform an event study on rating downgrades to illustrate how the choice of tests and adjustment methods can affect inference. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We develop an intrahousehold decision-making model to illustrate how technology adoption can influence bargaining processes on farms in harsh agricultural environments of West Africa, where staple food production by extended families is organized collectively under the leadership of a senior head. The head, who assumes primary responsibility for household food security, also allocates fields to members who manage production individually. Drawing on this and the intrinsic complementarity of labor and fertilizer as divisible inputs, we test the nature of the linkage between fertilizer use on collective and individual plots by applying bivariate probit and tobit models to nationally-representative, panel data from Burkina Faso. We find evidence of input sharing, though bargaining is inadequate to sustain efficient allocation of fertilizer. Plot manager characteristics that influence bargaining power, such as literacy, gender, age, contact with extension, and membership in farmer organizations differ between collectively- and individually-managed plots-confirming the differential status of household members in technology adoption. Agroforestry practices are strongly and positively associated with fertilizer use, regardless of plot manage type. Programs aimed at increasing use of modern agricultural inputs should consider impacts on bargaining positions within the household. Providing inputs to women and young men will increase their influence on other decisions, which may lead to greater equity within the household. It may also enhance efficiency in production, since currently, inputs are not allocated efficiently within the household. (C) 2017 The Authors.

While significant profits are available on strategies that involve writing put options, our findings cast doubt on whether these profits can be genuinely attained in practice. After bid-ask spreads are included, we find that the profitability is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the implementation of the trades is generally difficult owing to margin requirements as investors have to set aside a large proportion of their wealth into margin accounts and also face a high likelihood of margin calls. Overall, the profitability of volatility trading tends to hinge on the capability of investors to capture the volatility risk premium and to wisely time its trades.","[Hong, Hui] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Int Inst Financial Res, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Sung, Hao-Chang] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jingjing] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Normal University; Jinan University; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies,"Yang, JJ (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",hui.hong1982@yahoo.com; frrg4125@hotmail.com; ysydnc@hotmail.com,"Sung, Hao-Chang/ABP-4794-2022; Hong, Hui/C-7459-2016","Sung, Hao-Chang/0000-0002-0437-9754; yang, jingjing/0000-0002-1871-930X","National Social Science Foundation [16CJY079, 15BJY011]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71563020]",National Social Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Hong acknowledges the financial support from the National Social Science Foundation (Grant No: 16CJY079); Sung appreciates the financial support from the National Social Science Foundation (Grant No: 15BJY011); and Yang thanks for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 71563020).

However, empirical evidence on how urbanization affects these farmers is scarce. To fill this gap, this paper explores the relationship between proximity to a city and the production behavior of rural staple crop producers. More in particular, we analyze data from teff producing farmers in major producing areas around Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. We find that farmers more closely located to Addis Ababa face higher wages, land rental rates, and teff prices, leading to better incentives to intensify production as seen in the uptake of modern inputs. Moreover, we observe that land and labor productivity as well as profitability in teff production improve with urban proximity. Our results suggest that better connectivity of rural farmers to cities and growing urban demand for food are important associates of the process of agricultural intensification and transformation in Ethiopia.

However, little consensus exists on the extent to which environmental regulation might generate profitability enhancing innovation offsets. This paper reports on a meta-analysis of 103 publications that estimate the relationship between environmental regulation and firm- or country-level productivity or competitiveness. We find considerable heterogeneity in both the sign and significance level of over 2,000 estimated effect sizes in these studies. A positive effect of environmental regulation is more likely at the state, region, or country level, compared to facility, firm, or industry levelalthough in both cases the most likely scenario is statistical insignificance. These findings are consistent with the strong version of the Porter hypothesis whereby strict but flexible environmental regulations induce innovation and over time increase country-level competitiveness.","[Cohen, Mark A.] Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Cohen, Mark A.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Tubb, Adeline] UCL, London, England",Vanderbilt University; Resources for the Future; University of London; University College London,"Cohen, MA (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.;Cohen, MA (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",Mark.Cohen@owen.vanderbilt.edu,"Cohen, Mark A/H-6449-2011","Cohen, Mark A/0000-0002-1548-2773",Centre for International Governance Innovation and Institute for New Economic Thinking (CIGI-INET Partnership); Owen Graduate School of Management,Centre for International Governance Innovation and Institute for New Economic Thinking (CIGI-INET Partnership); Owen Graduate School of Management,"Mark A.

Our approach captures the main topological and spatial changes from a complex network perspective. We find that the SAAN combines a relatively stable topological structure with a changing multilayered geographical structure. Statistical analysis indicates that the SAAN is a scale-free network with an increasing number of hub cities and has been characterized by small-world properties since 1996. Furthermore, the SAAN exhibits a recently intensified disassortative mixing pattern, suggesting an increasing dependence of small cities on hub-and-spoke configuration for better accessibility. A decomposition analysis is used to disaggregate the SAAN into a hierarchical core-bridge-periphery structure. The core layer consists of capital cities, the most economic vibrant secondary cities, and tourist destinations. This core layer is also densely interconnected with its center of gravity moving towards the north. The periphery layer, comprised of cities in remote areas, sustains a low significance with declining internal connectivity despite a rising number of cities being connected. The bridge layer lies in between both extremes, and is characterized by a high volatility over time. The connections and passengers between different layers increase, especially those between core and bridge after 1996. In our discussion, we trace these changes back to a series of socio-economic and politico-institutional dynamics in Southeast Asia.","[Dai, Liang; Derudder, Ben] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Liu, Xingjian] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Urban Planning & Design, 8-F Knowles Bldg, Hong Kong 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Ghent University; University of Hong Kong,"Derudder, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",liang.dai@ugent.be; ben.derudder@ugent.be; xliu6@hku.hk,"Derudder, Ben/ABH-5648-2020; Derudder, Ben/A-1616-2008","Liu, Xingjian/0000-0003-4158-3655; Derudder, Ben/0000-0001-6195-8544",,,,,73,62,73,6,92,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The study focuses on millennials because past studies have often depicted them as distinct, optimistic, more favorable to cities and mass transit, and less enthusiastic about cars and driving. By using data from the General Social Survey for the period 1984 to 2016, the study compares the millennials' perception of spending with the perception of all others as well as with the perception of the same age cohort from the two previous generations. The first set of comparison examines how different the millennials' perceptions are relative to the rest of society, whereas the second set examines if the millennials brought forth a generational shift in perception of public spending on cities, transit, and highways. Tukey's range tests as well as generalized mixed ordinal logit models, linear models, and binary logit models were used. The analyses consistently showed that the millennial's perception of spending is no different from society as a whole regarding spending on cities and mass transit, but they are less supportive of spending for highways. Because no difference was found between their perceptions and the perceptions of people in the same age cohort from the two previous generations, the study concludes that the millennials did not bring forth a generational shift in perception of spending.","[Deka, Devajyoti] Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, Alan M Voorhees Transportat Ctr, 33 Livingston Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Deka, D (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Edward J Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, Alan M Voorhees Transportat Ctr, 33 Livingston Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",ddeka@ejb.rutgers.edu,"Deka, Devajyoti/JRW-7004-2023","Deka, Devajyoti/0000-0003-4416-9900",,,,,43,2,3,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Drawing on the asset-pricing model proposed by Mele and Sangiorgi (2015), which incorporates market ambiguity, we measure individual information demand using daily Google searches and measure market ambiguity using a metric based on the market trades of institutional investors. We find that individual investors increase their information demand during periods of greater market ambiguity. We also provide evidence that information demand from individual investors spikes around earnings announcement days primarily when market uncertainty is driven by net-selling activity. Overall, these results suggest that the disagreement among institutional investors either represents uncertainty or contributes to the uncertainty related to a stock, leading to increased demand for information from individual investors.","[Hasan, Rajib] Univ Houston Clear Lake, Houston, TX USA; [Kumas, Abdullah; Smith, Joyce van der Laan] Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Houston Clear Lake; University of Richmond,"Kumas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",hasan@uhcl.edu; akumas@richmond.edu; jvanderl@richmond.edu,,,,,,,35,5,5,2,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1815-5669,,,J CONTEMP ACCOUNT EC,J.

The term premia for average long-term bond yields for four maturity categories are derived using the stationary vector-stochastic process for the expectation hypothesis of Campbell and Shiller (1987, 1991). The bivariate VAR model identifies term premia for the bond yields that are mean-stationary and increase on average to about 100 basis points. The coefficients on the expectations components of the term spreads in linear estimations are found to be equal to those on the term premium components for all maturity categories, suggesting that there is no addition information about future GDP growth in the term premium components. However, regime-switching estimations that stochastically divide the sample period into high- and low-variance regimes indicate that the equality of the coefficients on both components of the term spreads can easily be rejected for all maturities in both regimes. The expectations component is found to be more important than the term premium component when future output growth is volatile, while it is not found to be important during 'normal times' when the variability of GDP growth is relatively low. Probit model estimations suggest that the expectations component of the term spread (removing the term premium component) produce relatively more reliable predictions of future recessions than the term premium component, which has only marginal information for predicting future recessions.","[Lange, Ronald Henry] Laurentian Univ, Dept Econ, Ramsey Lake Rd, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada",Laurentian University,"Lange, RH (通讯作者)，Laurentian Univ, Dept Econ, Ramsey Lake Rd, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.",rlange@laurentian.ca,,,,,,,9,9,9,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

We find that both the how'' and the when'' matter, but the heterogeneity related to the composition is more robust across different specifications. Adjustments based upon permanent spending cuts are consistently much less costly than those based upon permanent tax increases.

Each group is fragmented into subgroups. Each subgroup allocates effort between production and contestation. Perfect coordination is assumed within subgroups, but subgroups cannot coordinate with one another. All subgroups choose effort allocations simultaneously. We find that the group that is more internally fragmented receives the smaller share of the public good. Aggregate rent-seeking increases when the dominant subgroups within both communities have larger population shares. Any unilateral increase in fragmentation within a group reduces conflict and increases the total income of its opponent. Strikingly, the fragmenting community itself may, however, increase its total income as well, even though its share of the public good declines. Hence, a smaller share of public good provisioning cannot be used to infer a negative income effect on the losing community.","[Dasgupta, Indraneel; Neogi, Ranajoy Guha] Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, 203 Barrackpore Trunk Rd, Kolkata 700108, W Bengal, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata,"Dasgupta, I (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, 203 Barrackpore Trunk Rd, Kolkata 700108, W Bengal, India.",indraneel@isical.ac.in,,"Dasgupta, Indraneel/0000-0002-3212-0782",,,,,27,7,7,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2018,174.0,3-4,,,,,315,334,,10.1007/s11127-018-0506-8,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FW2PM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425146200007,0

This subjective component turns out to be large, especially for the low-rated countries. Countries that are rated as investment grade tend to be positively influenced by it, and vice versa. Subjective judgment in credit ratings does have predictive value: it helps in identifying chances of sovereign defaults in the short-term.

We find that during the Great Recession of 2007-2009, firm-specific volatility increased moderately but never substantially exceeded its sample mean.

Utilizing original data from a large-scale household survey conducted in Costa Rica from October 2013 to April 2014 (n=4,200), we find that the observation of police violence significantly reduces citizens' willingness to report crime. The implications of this finding are explored using a game-theoretic model of crime, crime reporting, and police misconduct. The model reveals that although the prospect of police violence against criminals may generate a degree of deterrence for criminal behavior, permissiveness toward police violence also raises expectations about the likelihood of police abuse against law-abiding citizens. Consistent with our empirics, this reduces citizens' propensity to report crime, thereby fostering a climate of impunity for criminal activity.","[Gingerich, Daniel W.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Oliveros, Virginia] Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",University of Virginia; Tulane University,"Gingerich, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Polit, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",dwg4c@virginia.edu,"Oliveros, Virginia/J-5108-2019","Oliveros, Virginia/0000-0002-8335-1628",,,,,41,14,17,1,27,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

First, the standard approach to assessing benefits of air quality improvements by transferring the value of a statistical life from labor market studies embeds several untested (but testable) assumptions. Second, if the cost of an environmental policy exceeds its capitalized effect on housing prices, then the capitalization effect is an insufficient statistic for determining whether benefits exceed costs.

A simple two-factor model containing the market and alternative indicators of economic activity as risk factors industrial production, capacity utilization rate, retail sales, and a broad economic index offers considerable explanatory power for the cross-section of price and industry momentum portfolios. Hence past winners enjoy higher average returns than past losers because they have larger macroeconomic risk. The model compares favorably with popular multifactor models used in the literature. Moreover, our model is consistent with Merton's Intertemporal CAPM framework, since the macro variables forecast stock market volatility and future economic activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In India, important legislation was passed in 2005 to guarantee rural households 100 days of work paid at a statutory wage rate. This Right to Work legislation has enabled the implementation of the world's largest public works program the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme or NREGS. This study explores variation in policy outcomes under NREGS within a rural district of North India (Uttar Pradesh). It finds that this variation is the product of the interaction between formal and informal institutions. As such, the demand for work benefits does not emerge spontaneously from self-selecting rural citizens, but is articulated by local elected officials who are pressurised to accommodate demands for rents from the bureaucracy. Specifically, local elected officials are compelled to proceed to a selective activation of the demand for benefits to ensure the generation of a surplus which will form the basis of bureaucratic rent payments. The study relies on qualitative data, specifically interviews with past beneficiaries of the scheme, bureaucrats tasked with policy implementation, and elected village leaders (the Gram Pradhans in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh) to document the conditions under which a surplus is extracted and rent payments made. The study shows that caste and political leadership structures at the local level affect the generation of surpluses and the payment of rents by Gram Pradhans to the bureaucracy. While the Right to Work legislation represents progress for poverty alleviation, policies such as NREGS that emphasize rights and the expression of a demand for benefits need to consider more carefully the conditions under which this demand emerges as well as the ways in which discretionary authority can thwart the goals of public policy.

Our results based on the wavelet approach show that BRICS index returns co-move with the WTI crude oil price at low frequencies (long horizons). Moreover, the strong level of co-movement is particularly captured during the onset of the global financial crisis. On the other hand, we find no evidence of co-movement between the BRICS stock markets and the gold price, indicating that gold can act as a hedge or a safe haven asset for the BRICS against extreme market movements. The implications of these results for the BRICS-commodity portfolios show that the portfolio risk (measured by the Value at Risk) is affected by the co-movements between stock and oil markets.","[Mensi, Walid] Univ Tunis El Manor, Dept Finance & Accounting, BP248, Tunis 2092, Tunisia; [Mensi, Walid; Al-Yahyaee, Khamis H.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Finance, Muscat, Oman; [Hkiri, Besma] Higher Inst Commerce & Accounting Bizerte, Dept Finance, Carthage, Tunisia; [Kang, Sang Hoon] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Busan 609735, South Korea",Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Sultan Qaboos University; Pusan National University,"Kang, SH (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Busan 609735, South Korea.",walid.mensi@fsegt.rnu.tn; besma_hkiri@yahoo.fr; yahyai@squ.edu.om; sanghoonkang@pusan.ac.kr,"hkiri, besma/K-2699-2019; mensi, walid/R-6139-2016","Al-Yahyaee, Khamis/0000-0003-2669-0663; HKIRI, Besma/0000-0002-0747-8483",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A2A03926111],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016S1A5A2A03926111).,,45,103,104,0,65,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Applied to agricultural value chains, PPP5 seek to catalyze new investments, support chain upgrading, or improve the performance of poorly functioning chains through joint activities that capitalize on the complementary resources and competencies of public and private partners. Smallholder farmers are frequently the intended beneficiaries. However, there is little understanding of how the terms of value chain participation affect farmer perceptions of and behavior within chains, or the role of the public sector in influencing these arrangements. This paper analyzes in-depth case studies from Ghana, Indonesia, Rwanda, and Uganda to better understand a surprising empirical finding: that farmers that experience strong PPP results in terms of productivity and incomes may nevertheless remain dissatisfied, while those experiencing much more modest gains can view the PPP favorably. At the heart is an analytical framework based on five attributes of procedural justice. It finds that public sector actors, through PPP5, are able to shape governance within value chains, influencing the relative skills, knowledge, and resources which different actors possess, the way that farmers are organized to engage in the value chain, and the attributes of procedural justice reflected in chain arrangements. Where procedural justice is weak, farmers are more likely to exit or neglect the arrangements, leaving the value chain underperforming with sub-optimal outcomes for all: for farmers, for lead firms, and for government agencies. Government involvement in value chains should be premised on facilitating relationships that are more procedurally just than those which would be expected to arise through the market alone.

This article draws on interviews with over 350 local authorities in decentralized Senegal to call attention to a third level of analysis: the meso-level of the local state itself. Though local elites dominate positions of authority everywhere, the article argues that local government performance varies subnationally as a function of elites' relations among each other across villages. Where denser cross-village social ties generate higher cohesion among elites, individual opportunism is constrained and local government performance improves. Where such cross-village relations are weaker, elites see local institutions as a zero-sum game among villages. The composition of local social relations, in other words, drives better or worse governance at the local level. Because West African cross-village relations are largely determined by historical settlement patterns, notably the presence or absence of a precolonial state, the article suggests that local political strategies are historically constrained. The link between history and local government performance documented here holds important implications for the nature of political representation and local development outcomes following the recent wave of democratic decentralization in sub-Saharan Africa.

Understanding whether a market exhibits an MMB is crucial, in particular, for derivative pricing. An MMB precludes the existence of a risk-neutral probability measure. The benchmark approach allows to study MMBs and is formulated under the real world probability measure. It does not require the existence of a risk neutral probability measure. Using a range of well-known stochastic volatility models, we study the existence of an MMB in the US economy, and find that the US market exhibits an MMB for all models considered that allow it.

We implement various tax trajectories and options for using the revenue collected by the tax and describe their impact on household welfare and its distribution across income levels. Overall, we find that our top-down/bottom-up models affects estimates of the distribution and cost of emission reductions as well as the amount of revenue collected, but that these are mostly insensitive to the way the revenue is recycled. We find that substantial abatement opportunities through fuel switching and renewable penetration in the electricity sector allow the economy to accommodate extensive emissions reductions at relatively low cost. While welfare impacts are largely determined by the choice of revenue recycling scheme, all tax levels and schemes provide net benefits when accounting for the avoided global climate change benefits of emission reductions. Recycling revenue through capital income tax rebates is more efficient than labor income tax rebates or uniform transfers to households. While capital tax rebates substantially reduce the overall costs of emission abatement, they profit high income households the most and are regressive. We more generally identify a clear trade-off between equity and efficiency across the various recycling options. However, we show through a set of hybrid recycling schemes that it is possible to limit inequalities in impacts, particularly those on the lowest income households, at relatively little incremental cost.","[Caron, Justin; Reilly, John M.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cohen, Stuart M.; Brown, Maxwell] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Caron, Justin] HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Caron, J (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Caron, J (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",justin.caron@hec.ca,,,,,,,21,17,19,3,35,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Although the mandate does not require firms to spend on CSR, we find that mandatory CSR reporting firms experience a decrease in profitability subsequent to the mandate. In addition, the cities most impacted by the disclosure mandate experience a decrease in their industrial wastewater and SO2 emission levels.

The earlier literature on Islamic banking built a foundation using normative judgment, descriptive analysis, theoretical development, and appraisal of country experiences. The paper discusses scholars' concerns that have led to a paradigm shift in the system and highlight practitioners' disquiet about recent practices. Subsequent research focuses on empirical investigations without extensive analytical and theoretical exploration in the area. Recent studies focus on the financial crisis, solvency, maqasid, disclosure and financial inclusion, and regulations. Even with the spillover effect on the Islamic banks after the crisis, a few pieces of evidence show that the system performs below its conventional counterpart.

Besides the descriptive analysis meant to offer us an overview of the aspects that influence the consumer level of confidence regarding the information on the food label, the authors have proposed to observe the level of association and test some hypotheses, which are linked to the importance of some elements (sex, age, education, family income, buying food for children under 5 and over 6 years old, smokers, athletes, the perception of the correctness of information on the label, food poisoning, country of origin and the benefits of technology in food sector). The results indicate a decrease in the level of confidence of Romanian consumers in the information on the food label, while the age, the number of years spent on formal study, increased revenue and shopping of products for children under the age of 5 influence the frequency of label reading. On the other side, women grant a higher importance to the information that is mandatory, by law, to be included on the label, than men. This study shows the importance of improving the trust of consumers in the food labelling system by increasing the frequency of reading.

However, the large majority of research on the economic impact of inflows of migrant workers on host economies focuses exclusively on developed countries. In this paper, we address this gap in the literature by examining migrant-induced productivity effects in the emerging economy of Malaysia. Importantly, the Malaysian case is typical for many Asian economies where, next to high skilled foreign workers, large numbers of migrants consist of low skilled workers that are employed in host economies on a temporary basis. Using detailed industry level data for the period 2005 to 2009, we find that both high skilled and low skilled foreign workers generate positive productivity effects in Malaysian manufacturing industries. Furthermore, our results identify a strong presence of industry heterogeneity, as the effects of foreign workers, in general, and low skilled foreign workers, in particular, are pronounced in labor and assembly intensive modern industries with a strong export focus. This indicates the importance of foreign workers for the contemporary international competitiveness of the Malaysian manufacturing sector. As such, our findings provide important new input to the debate on the role of low skilled foreign workers in processes of development of the Malaysian economy.","[Jordaan, Jacob A.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Jordaan, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Adam Smith Hall,Int Campus Utrecht, NL-3584 EC Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.a.jordaan@uu.nl,"Jordaan, Jacob/AFM-9545-2022","Jordaan, Jacob/0000-0002-6981-0584",,,,,62,9,11,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The long-term earnings were measured over the 1990-2008 period. The sample contains 4,642 twin pairs, of which 53% are females. In contrast to previous studies, this paper uses the within-twin dimension of the data to control for shared family background and confounding genetic factors. The results suggest that unobserved genetic differences may introduce omitted variable bias in standard ordinary least square results. After controlling for shared environment and genetic background, the authors find that a facet of extraversion (activity) is related to higher (beta = 0.046), and neuroticism is related to lower (beta = -0.060) permanent earnings in the labor market. The lower earnings of more neurotic individuals are likely explained by the weaker attachment in the labor market. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we study the effectiveness of a recent form of government support, called participative loan, in improving recipient SMEs' access to external financial debt. Relying on the literature about the certification effect, we develop hypotheses on the conditions under which the improvement is stronger. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of 488 Spanish SMEs that received participative loans from a Spanish government agency and a control group of 719 matched twins. We show that the former register a significantly higher external financial debt (+31.5%). The effect is stronger for smaller firms, or for those operating in high-technology sectors, which suffer more acutely from information asymmetries, and negligible for firms that already received a support from another government-supported institution. After ruling out alternative explanations, we interpret this result as a positive evidence of government certification of SMEs towards banks.","[Marti, Jose] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Quas, Anita] Emlyon Business Sch, Ecully, France",Complutense University of Madrid; emlyon business school,"Martí, J (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",jmartipe@ccee.ucm.es,"Quas, Anita/Q-1549-2016; Marti, Jose/L-5289-2014","Quas, Anita/0000-0002-6121-1931; Marti, Jose/0000-0003-0251-8287",Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2014-55674-R],Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We thank Joern Block, Massimo Colombo and Silvio Vismara, and the two anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

One objective of the paper was to discover how often consumers access and use specific food label information. Another objective was to explore stakeholders' preferences for several public policy options relevant for food safety. In this respect, a survey on a sample of 312 Romanian consumers and the evaluation of several public policy options by four stakeholder groups (food producers and sellers, doctors, fitness trainers, and consumers) were carried out. The results revealed that the most frequently read types of information on the label were expiration date and price, closely followed by quantity and brand. Among tested public policies, those related to the traffic light labels and to the social interest messages with health claims were rewarded with high scores by investigated stakeholders. Although nutrition has a decisive impact on health state, nutrition information was not frequently read by people, thus justifying the implementation of a public policy meant to enhance consumers' interest in and reading frequency of nutrition information on food label.","[Petrescu, Dacinia Crina; Petrescu-Mag, Ruxandra Malina] Babes Bolyai Univ, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Bran, Florina; Radulescu, Carmen Valentina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Petrescu, DC (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",crina.petrescu@tbs.ubbcluj.ro,"Bran, Florina/HKW-6836-2023; Petrescu, Crina/AAB-9500-2022; Petrescu-Mag, Ruxandra Malina/Z-1391-2018; Radulescu, Carmen Valentina/P-6654-2015; Petrescu, Dacinia Crina/A-6540-2017","Bran, Florina/0000-0002-4233-0628; Petrescu-Mag, Ruxandra Malina/0000-0001-7048-4598; Radulescu, Carmen Valentina/0000-0002-9971-9618; Petrescu, Dacinia Crina/0000-0002-5716-9793",,,,,49,6,7,1,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2018,20.0,47,,,,,99,115,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ8BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427829800007,0

Animal breeds (at least for cattle and sheep) have a status of common ownership. The way these common resources are managed, and the genetic progress is generated, controlled and distributed, is based in different national and historical contexts on breeding regimes, made up of rules and political, scientific, informational, technical and organizational devices. Bundles of property rights analytical framework proposed by Schlager and Ostrom [1992) is implemented to distinguish these regimes, considering first the one that is structured in the 1960s in France with the support of the national policy of modernization of agriculture, then the one which today results of recent developments in scientific and technical knowledge, in the context of liberalization of agricultural policies. Each of these regimes got institutionalized in the context of technological breakthroughs: artificial insemination for the first one and genomic selection for the second one. In this article, we analyse the complexity of common resources systems and the evolution of the property rights applied to the case of animal genetic resources and the industry of livestock selection in agriculture. In our analysis of bundle of rights, we add a right of contribution, taking into account the definition of collective breeding objectives aiming at changing the breed's orientation (leading to an alteration of the breed). While only one breeding organism used to have the monopoly of this right for each breed, it is now threatened by the more competitive emerging regime. The economic stakes are different at each of the two periods.","[Allaire, Gilles] INRA, ODR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Labatut, Julie; Tesniere, Germain] Univ Toulouse, INRA, AGIR, INPT ENSAT, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Labatut, Julie; Tesniere, Germain] MINES ParisTech, CGS I3, Paris, France",INRAE; INRAE; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Labatut, J (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, INRA, AGIR, INPT ENSAT, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.;Labatut, J (通讯作者)，MINES ParisTech, CGS I3, Paris, France.",gilles.allaire@inra.fr; julie.labatut@inra.fr; germain.tesniere.eu@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,4,4,1,4,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Design/methodology/approach - The Johansen Maximum Likelihood approach is employed in the estimation of different models of symmetric and asymmetric ERPT. Specifically asymmetric ERPT models with respect to the direction and size of exchange rate changes are estimated. Findings - Results reveal that even though a depreciation in the nominal effective exchange rate will lead to an increase of consumer prices in the long-run, it is not statistically significant. Evidence also suggests a significant asymmetry with respect to direction and size of exchange rate changes. This indicates that the right ERPT model is an asymmetric model. Specifically ERPT is found to be incomplete but relatively higher in periods of depreciation than in periods of appreciation; that is 53 percent against 3 percent. ERPT is also higher during episodes of large changes (about 51 percent). Research limitations/implications - It would have been interesting to analyze the impact on consumer prices through changes in import prices. That approach was not adopted due to lack of consistent data on import prices in Ghana. Practical implications - It is imperative that the monetary authorities critically monitor exchange rate movements in order to be able to take swift policy action so as to counteract any inflationary pressures from the external sector. In particular, much attention should be paid to events and arrangements that could result in large depreciation of the exchange rate. Originality/value - While previous studies have assumed a symmetric ERPT model for Ghana, this paper is unique in that it investigates the most appropriate model for examining ERPT in Ghana whether symmetric or an asymmetric.","[Amoah, Lordina; Aziakpono, Meshach Jesse] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Business, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Cape Town, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Amoah, L (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Business, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Cape Town, South Africa.",lodina20@yahoo.co.uk,"Amoah, Lordina/P-6135-2014","Aziakpono, Meshach/0000-0002-5290-3311",,,,,54,16,17,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Suggestive evidence of a positive association between improved market accessibility and local GDP growth beyond the impact of cropland expansion could reflect the stimulation of non-agricultural activities.","[Berg, Claudia N.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Blankespoor, Brian] World Bank, Dev Data Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Selod, Harris] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",International Monetary Fund; The World Bank; The World Bank,"Selod, H (通讯作者)，1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",hselod@worldbank.org,,"Blankespoor, Brian/0000-0003-1806-8129; Selod, Harris/0000-0002-0886-1265",Department for International Development (DFID) under the World Bank's Strategic Research Program 'Transport Policies for Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction',Department for International Development (DFID) under the World Bank's Strategic Research Program 'Transport Policies for Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction',This work was supported by the Department for International Development (DFID) under the World Bank's Strategic Research Program 'Transport Policies for Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction'.,,35,30,30,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Loan activity typically decreases when investment returns of entrepreneurs decline, and we study which type of policy could invigorate an economy in a trough. The authors find that an active monetary policy increases loan volume even when the economy is in good shape, while the introduction of an active capital requirement policy is also effective if it implies tightening of regulation in bad times. This is performed with a heterogeneous agent economy with occupational choice, financial intermediation, and aggregate shocks to the distribution of entrepreneurial returns.","[Berka, Martin] Massey Univ, Ctr Macroecon, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Berka, Martin] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Zimmermann, Christian] Fed Reserve Bank, Res Informat Serv, St Louis, MO USA; [Zimmermann, Christian] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO USA; [Berka, Martin; Zimmermann, Christian] Bank Canada, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Massey University; Massey University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System - USA; Bank of Canada,"Berka, M (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Ctr Macroecon, Palmerston North, New Zealand.;Berka, M (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",,"Berka, Martin/I-8521-2015","Berka, Martin/0000-0002-8450-8738",,,,,26,1,2,0,2,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

We consider a panel of 98 countries over the period 1990-2010. Our findings show that remittances increase after a disaster, thus contributing ex post to the reconstruction process. At the same time, we find that remittances play a key role in terms of ex ante risk preparedness for those countries that experienced more disruptive events in the past. Finally, when taking into account the interaction with the level of development of the local financial sector, remittances seem to substitute for less efficient financial systems both in terms of ex post response to disasters and in terms of ex ante risk management strategy.","[Bettin, Giulia; Zazzaro, Alberto] Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy; [Bettin, Giulia; Zazzaro, Alberto] Mo Fi R, Ancona, Italy; [Zazzaro, Alberto] Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Zazzaro, Alberto] CSEF, Naples, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; University of Naples Federico II,"Bettin, G (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Ple Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",g.bettin@univpm.it,"BETTIN, GIULIA/AAF-4345-2021","BETTIN, GIULIA/0000-0001-6711-0253",,,,,65,21,24,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.
