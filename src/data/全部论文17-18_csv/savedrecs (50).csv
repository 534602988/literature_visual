We propose a new family of cost sharing methods that are easy to compute, as they closely relate to the network-building algorithm. These methods are called minimum incoming cost rules for arborescences (MICRAs). They include as a particular case the extension of the folk solution introduced by Dutta and Mishra [Games Econ Behav 74(1):120-143, 2012], providing a simple procedure for its computation. We also provide new axiomatizations of (a) the set of stable and symmetric MICRAs and (b) the Dutta-Mishra solution. Finally, we closely examine two MICRAs that (unlike the Dutta-Mishra rule) compensate agents who help others connect at a lower cost. The first of these two rules relates to the cycle-complete solution for mcst problems introduced by Trudeau [Games Econ Behav 75(1):402-412, 2012].","[Bahel, Eric] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Trudeau, Christian] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON, Canada",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Windsor,"Trudeau, C (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON, Canada.",erbahel@vt.edu; trudeauc@uwindsor.ca,,"Trudeau, Christian/0000-0003-4195-4153",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2014-0140],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors wish to thank Gustavo Bergantinos, Bhaskar Dutta, Leticia Lorenzo Picado, Debasis Mishra, Herve Moulin and Yves Sprumont for their useful comments.

The imbalance between different transport modes suggests a need to promote alternative modalities to strengthen the competitiveness and provide a more sustainable economic development. The goal of this paper is to identify logistics managers' preferences for freight transport service attributes for the case of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, and discuss which transport policies could encourage multimodality and more sustainable uses of available transport infrastructure. In this paper we used the stated preference (SP) technique for collecting data on respondents' choices among hypothetical options. The experimental design was structured using an Efficient design. Discrete choice models were used to identify the preferences of respondents and discuss some possible sustainable policies that could increase the competitiveness of the region. The model structures studied were: multinomial logit; mixed logit as a special case of random coefficients; mixed logit error components-considering panel effect and mixed logit error components - including possible correlations between attributes of intermodal alternatives. Parameters estimated from the models were used to compute subjective value of time savings, which was Euro/t.h 0.34 (R$/t. h 1.088) for the selected model. The direct and cross elasticity values of the probability of choosing a transport mode for the different attributes studied show that the shippers significantly value the fulfilment of delivery time and cost, suggesting that those attributes are the most important ones in the choice of transport mode in this State of Brazil. Simulation results suggest investments for increasing the reliability of intermodal alternatives are more effective to encourage intermodality than cost reductions. Policies and investments to encourage multimodality should prioritize the increase of intermodal alternatives reliability and combined policies of cost reduction and reliability.

The workforce development system could assist the latter by supporting credit-bearing education as training. Its ability to address this need depends on the controlled devolved structure established by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, which allows states and local workforce investment areas to set priorities and make a range of choices bounded by federal constraints. Analyzing interview data with frontline staff, case managers, and leadership in workforce systems in four states, the authors identify obstacles and opportunities for supporting degree completion. Three federal Workforce Investment Act mandates are particularly influential: individual training accounts, eligible training provider lists, and emphasis on demand occupations. The authors also model factors such as local partnerships and staff knowledge that can mediate how policy and practice shape local workforce investment area support for college.","[Nisbet, Elizabeth] CUNY, John Jay Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [McKay, Heather A.; Haviland, Sara] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Management & Labor Relat, Educ & Employment Res Ctr, Piscataway, NJ USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Nisbet, E (通讯作者)，CUNY John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, Dept Publ Management, 524 West 59th St,Room 3516 North Hall, New York, NY 10019 USA.",enisbet@jjay.cuny.edu,,"Haviland, Sara/0000-0001-5774-3647",Lumina Foundation for Education,Lumina Foundation for Education,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work and the Adult College Completion Initiative were supported by the Lumina Foundation for Education.",,33,2,6,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This study uses a 2014 national survey to analyze the relationship between local environment and social equity motivations and the kinds of economic development strategies local governments pursue (business incentives or community economic development policies). Municipalities that pay more attention to environmental sustainability and social equity use higher levels of community economic development tools and lower levels of business incentives. These places are also more likely to have written economic development plans and involve more participants in the economic development process. In contrast, communities that use higher levels of business incentives have lower income and are more dependent on manufacturing employment. Other capacity measures do not differentiate types of economic development strategies used. This suggests that sustainable economic development strategies can be pursued by a broad array of communities, especially if the motivations driving their economic development policy include environment and equity goals.","[Zhang, Xue] Cornell Univ, Reg Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Warner, Mildred E.] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ithaca, NY USA; [Homsy, George C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Publ Adm, Binghamton, NY USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Warner, ME (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, City & Reg Planning, W Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mew15@cornell.edu,"Homsy, George/AFL-1386-2022","Homsy, George/0000-0002-4470-1437; Warner, Mildred/0000-0002-0109-338X","USDA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, Foundational Agricultural Economics and Rural Development Grant [2014-68006-21834]; NIFA [687765, 2014-68006-21834] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","USDA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, Foundational Agricultural Economics and Rural Development Grant; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported in part by the USDA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, Foundational Agricultural Economics and Rural Development Grant (No. 2014-68006-21834).",,58,25,28,15,98,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The imperialism of the era encouraged globalisation while binding companies to host nations' strategic imperatives and coordinated policy frameworks.

An alternative conceptualization of the attitude-behavior relationship in travel behavior modeling,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Travel behavior; Attitudes; Causality; Theory of Cognitive Dissonance; Cross-lagged panel model; Latent transition model,HYBRID CHOICE MODELS; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; TRANSPORTATION; PERCEPTIONS,"Attitudes are thought to play an important role in determining people's travel behavior, although researchers have acknowledged the possibility of a reverse relationship. Given the importance of knowledge about the direction of causation as a basis for policies and programs designed to effect behavioral change, the scarcity of in-depth research on this subject is surprising and problematic. The aim of the present paper is twofold: first to assess the bidirectional relationships between attitudes and behavior (in a transport context) and second to present a new framework to study attitude-behavior (in)consistency over time. To achieve these aims, we use data from a two-wave mobility panel to estimate cross-lagged panel models and latent transition models. Results indicate that use of a mode and the attitude towards using that mode mutually influence each other over time. As expected, we find that people who have dissonant (i.e., non-aligned) attitude-behavior patterns are less stable than those who have consonant patterns. Contrary to conventional wisdom and commonly used model structures, however, the effects of behaviors on attitudes are much larger than vice versa. That is, dissonant travelers are more inclined to adjust their attitudes to align those with their behavior than vice versa. Based on these results, we outline several implications for research and policy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We collect data from publicly traded companies in Japan in the late 1920s and early 1930s regarding their directors and presence of members of the House of Representatives, stock prices, and financial performance. We find that almost 20% of these publicly traded companies had political connections through politician directors. In particular, firms in regulated industries, including the electrical utility and railroad industries, were more likely to have political connections. Regression analyses reveal that the stock returns of firms with newly-obtained political connections improved from the pre-election to post-election periods. Furthermore, this positive effect accrued to non-regulated industries, while it did not to regulated industries.","[Okazaki, Tetsuji] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Sawada, Michiru] Nihon Univ, Coll Econ, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; Nihon University,"Sawada, M (通讯作者)，Nihon Univ, Coll Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",okazaki@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp; sawada.michiru@nihon-u.ac.jp,,,"Cannon Institute for Global studies; [26285053]; [26380324]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H02009, 26285053, 17H02518] Funding Source: KAKEN","Cannon Institute for Global studies; ; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank the editor, Kris Mitchener and two anonymous reviewers of this journal, Fumio Akiyoshi, Booseung Chang, Mathias Hoffmann, Takeo Hoshi, Masami Imai, Kanetaka Maki, Takashi Misumi, Daisuke Miyakawa, Satoshi Koibuchi, Kenji Kushida, Shuichiro Nishioka, Koji Sakai, Hirofumi Uchida and other participants at Japan Lunch Seminar (Stanford University) and Japan Society of Monetary Economics (Kansai University) for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Transportation accounts for 30% of the total energy consumption, and a reduction in the energy used for mobility is necessary. The 2000-watt society is an environmental concept that fixes a sustainable limit to the energy consumption in different sectors, including mobility. This paper evaluates the energy consumption in several mobility scenarios, and it assesses whether the goal suggested by the 2000-watt society is achievable. We investigate the social characteristics and travel habits of the population living in a case study area. Then, we calculate the modal shift induced by transportation policies such as car-sharing, car-pooling and car-free district. We evaluate the resulting energy consumption, and we compare it with the 2000-watt society limit. We conclude that only a set of measures combining car usage reduction, increase in walking and cycling, and reduction in the total travel distance can achieve the needed energy reduction.

So far, most of the interest in the adoption of fully automated, driverless vehicles has focussed on private vehicles alone, yet full automation could be beneficial for commercial vehicles too. This paper identifies the vehicle sectors that will likely be the earliest adopters of full automation. Total cost of ownership analysis is used to compare the costs (and benefits) of vehicle automation for private vehicles among different income groups and commercial vehicles in the taxi and freight sectors in the UK. Commercial operations clearly benefit more from automation because the driver costs can be reduced substantially through automation. Among private users, households with the highest income will benefit more from automation because of their higher driving distances and higher perceived value of time, which can be used more productively through full automation.

However, the effectiveness of these interventions remains understudied, especially in developing countries. Using self reported physical activity data from pre- and post-intervention periods, this study examines the impact of bus rapid transit (BRT) and Complete Street implementation on walking and cycling levels of catchment area residents in Mexico City. Propensity score matching is applied to control for sociodemographics when evaluating intervention effects on walking for transport, walking for recreation, and cycling for transport. On average, individuals living in post-intervention conditions tend to achieve 29 min more of walking for transport per week. However, the intervention effect on cycling for transport is insignificant. Using clustering techniques, intervention effects are evaluated across different sociodemographic groups. Women with low education experience the greatest increases in walking for transport. Sociodemographic clusters characterized by higher education experience improvements in recreational walking. Overall, BRT implementation and streetscape improvements enhance physical activity, specifically walking; and the impact of these interventions vary across different sociodemographic subgroups.

It applies a version of the Gordon dividend discount model for long-run fundamentals and uses Mean Group and Pooled Mean Group estimation to estimate long-run and short-run determinants of house prices. We find great similarity across cities in that the long-run house prices are largely explained by the same fundamentals; the long-run rent to price ratio is approximately 5% plus 0.75 times the real interest rate (which is on the order of 2%). However, adjustments to deviations from the fundamentals are slow, in the long-run, closing the gap at a rate of around 10% per year. We find sharp differences in short-run adjustments (momentum) away from the fundamentals across cities, and the differences are correlated with local supply elasticities (more momentum with lower elasticity). Analysis of residuals suggests strong cyclical deviations, which are mean-reverting.","[Lai, Rose Neng] Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China; [Van Order, Robert] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA",University of Macau; George Washington University,"Lai, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China.",RoseLai@umac.mo; rvo@gwu.edu,"Lai, Rose Neng/AAM-6930-2020","Lai, Rose Neng/0000-0003-3686-2596",,,,,36,26,27,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2017,45.0,2,,,,,259,300,,10.1111/1540-6229.12127,0.0,,,42,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,ES6MO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399662500002,0

In particular, it uses the Asdrubali et al. (1996) approach to quantify and decompose the strength of consumption smoothing. The system of horizontal transfers between member countries has no borrowing capacity and, hence, needs to be balanced in every period in time. The transfers increase the fiscal space of national governments in (relatively) adverse situations, i.e. when the budget balance deteriorates (falling tax revenue, higher expenditure) and debt issuance is costly or constrained. The simulation results illustrate the smoothing capacity of horizontal transfers, but also suggest a significant degree of crowding-out of alternative risk sharing channels. Consequently, net stabilisation gains in the normal times scenario are small. Net gains increase when financial constraints in the recipient country tighten at the national level.","[Roeger, Werner; Vogel, Lukas] European Commiss, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, CHAR 14-233, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium",,"Vogel, L (通讯作者)，European Commiss, DG Econ & Financial Affairs, CHAR 14-233, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",werner.roeger@ec.europa.eu; lukas.vogel@ec.europa.eu,,"Vogel, Lukas/0000-0002-8106-2750",,,,,22,0,0,0,0,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

It has been argued that adult height is a marker of strength which is rewarded in the labor market; a proxy for cognitive performance or other dimensions of human capital such as school quality; a proxy for health status; and a proxy for family background and genetic characteristics. As a result, the argument goes, height is rewarded in the labor market because it is an informative signal of worker quality to an employer. It has also been argued that the height premium is driven by occupational and sectoral choice. This paper evaluates the relative importance of these potential mechanisms underlying the link between adult stature and labor market productivity in a specific low income setting, rural Central Java, Indonesia. Drawing on twelve waves of longitudinal survey data, we establish that height predicts hourly earnings after controlling education, multiple indicators of cognitive performance and physical health status, measures of family background, sectoral and occupational choice, as well as local area market characteristics. The height premium is large and significant in both the wage and self-employed sectors indicating height is not only a signal of worker quality to employers. Since adult stature is largely determined in the first few years of life, we conclude that exposures during this critical period have an enduring impact on labor market productivity.

In order to do so, the real wage is deflated by a specially constructed regional retail price index (RPI). Results show that although regional differences in the cost of living exist, they do not affect significantly the wage difference between workers with a graduate education and workers with a high school degree, and the change of this differential over time, while they affect regional differences in real wage growth. The regional RPI reveals that the national RPI underestimates the cost-of-living of workers in London, and the South East and overestimates the cost-of-living for the majority of the other regions.","[Rienzo, Cinzia] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, 2 Dean Trench St,Smith Sq, London SW1P 3HE, England",,"Rienzo, C (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, 2 Dean Trench St,Smith Sq, London SW1P 3HE, England.",c.rienzo@niesr.ac.uk,"Rienzo, Cinzia/AAJ-1971-2021","Rienzo, Cinzia/0000-0002-5931-8270",,,,,35,3,3,2,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper shows that the lowest equilibrium payoffs may increase in pure strategies when the players become more patient and this may cause the set of equilibrium paths to be non-monotonic. A numerical example is constructed such that a path is no longer equilibrium when the players' discount factors increase. This property can be more easily seen when the players have different time preferences, since in these games the punishment strategies may rely on the differences between the players' discount factors. A sufficient condition for the monotonicity of equilibrium paths is that the lowest equilibrium payoffs do not increase, i.e., the punishments should not become milder.","[Berg, Kimmo] Aalto Univ, Dept Math & Syst Anal, Sch Sci, POB 11100, Aalto 00076, Finland",Aalto University,"Berg, K (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Dept Math & Syst Anal, Sch Sci, POB 11100, Aalto 00076, Finland.",kimmo.berg@aalto.fi,"Berg, Kimmo/K-1545-2016","Berg, Kimmo/0000-0002-7054-5095",Emil Aaltosen Saatio,Emil Aaltosen Saatio,"The author thanks the reviewers for the valuable suggestions for improving the paper, and acknowledges funding from Emil Aaltosen Saatio through Post doc -pooli.",,30,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Precisely, how important these factors are depends on the sector in question.","[Christen, Elisabeth] Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria; [Francois, Joseph] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland; [Francois, Joseph] CEPR, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Christen, E (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria.",,"Francois, Joseph/B-6108-2017","Francois, Joseph/0000-0002-4686-7780; Christen, Elisabeth/0000-0002-4538-0671",,,,,20,6,7,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2017,40.0,3,,,SI,,517,531,,10.1111/twec.12330,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EP6OZ,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397500100003,0

Confined to areas near water, livestock damaged vegetation locally, but introduced rabbits, not reliant on drinking water, spread well beyond pastoral settlement. Thus, rabbits caused almost universal desertification and were an equal factor in disrupting the former food web that sustained Aboriginal people. Within 30 years of the rabbits' arrival, important totemic animals like rabbit bandicoots had disappeared, leaving the people not only short of traditional game but also culturally bereft. A comparative economic approach to Aboriginal totemism explores changes in both ecological and cultural contexts.","[Cooke, Brian] Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Canberra,"Cooke, B (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,57,3,3,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

While serving the principle of state equality, this arrangement seems to violate the principle of citizen equality. In this article, I consider whether a deviation from the equal representation of citizens can be justified in the context of a supranational political community. The main thesis is that the conflict between citizen and state equality can be dissolved if we understand the European Union as based on a pouvoir constituant mixte. Today, each European finds herself in a dual role as an EU citizen and a state citizen. While the member state peoples strive for supranational democracy, they have an interest in preserving their domestic structures of self-government. Thus, the rules of representation in the EP can be reconstructed as an expression of the legitimate will of a dual constituent subject.","[Habermas, Juesrgen] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Habermas, J (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Philosophy, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,11,45,45,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

An analysis of the terms of trade and purchasing power parity reveals that the growth pattern of Singapore's entrepot trade changed after 1850 from growth fuelled by transit trade of industrial products to balanced growth between regional imports and exports. This change resulted from the operation of the international monetary system, which enhanced market integration between Britain and Southeast Asia via Singapore.","[Kobayashi, Atsushi] Osaka Sangyo Univ, Daito, Osaka, Japan",,"Kobayashi, A (通讯作者)，Osaka Sangyo Univ, Daito, Osaka, Japan.",greysh-black.zg14@hotmail.co.jp,,"Kobayashi, Atsushi/0000-0002-6448-1814",[269047],,"This research was supported by Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows 269047.

We find that such information disclosure significantly increases the tendency of players to play the payoff-dominant strategy and reduces the occurrence of coordination failure.

Such estimation is straightforward in univariate models, and results covering the case of quadrant probability marginal effects in bivariate probit models for jointly distributed outcomes y have previously been described in the literature. This paper's goals are to extend Greene's results to encompass the general multivariate probit context for arbitrary orthant probabilities and to extended these results to models that condition on subvectors of y and to multivariate ordered probit data structures.

Such schemes constitute part of a much broader commercialization of citizenship, which has intensified during the crisis. They have been particularly controversial in the EU because they rely for their attractiveness in part on the reality of EU citizenship and the rights of mobility and residence that it entails. The European Commission, among others, has presented them as threat to national citizenship and yet the EU at once champions a 'post- national' citizenship and is arguably culpable in the very commercialization of citizenship of which investor schemes are a stark manifestation. This paper unpacks the tensions in the theory and politics of investor migration in the recent EU context, arguing that they reveal what is termed a 'quadrilemma' at the heart of a multi- level citizenship.","[Parker, Owen] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Parker, O (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",o.parker@sheffield.ac.uk,,,Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"The author would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Leverhulme Trust for work conducted in this area.

This article investigates the influence of advertising on market share instability using Taiwanese international tourist hotel operation data. Telser argues that advertising reduces a leading firm's market share instability by creating market power and entry barriers. This study provides empirical evidence for the theoretical inverse relationship between advertising intensity and market share instability among leading firms in the hotel industry. It identifies advertising as an important factor influencing the market share instability of hotels. Moreover, advertising tends to increase the market share instability of leading firms for different quantiles of the market share instability.

The question matters for understanding determinants of wage differences that have attracted so much attention among economists in the past decade. Evidence indicates that markers for early testosterone exposure are correlated with traits like risk-taking and aggressiveness. But it is not at all clear how such findings might map into labor market success. We combine unique data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey with measured markers (2D:4D ratios) for testosterone exposure and find that lower digit ratios (higher T) correlate with higher wages for women and for men, when controlling for age, education and occupation. There is also some evidence of a potential non-linear, inverse U-effect of digit ratios on wages but this is sensitive to choice of specification. These findings are consistent with earlier work on prenatal T and success in careers (Coates et al., 2009) but inconsistent with the work of Gielen et al.

Estimates based on historical archives indicate that this annual rate ranged between 0.35 and 1.47 per 100,000 inhabitants during the 1661-1898 period, a low level unmatched by Western Europe until the late 19th century. China's homicide rate rose steadily from 1661 to 1821 but declined gradually thereafter until the turn of the century. Although extreme, homicide represents a random sampling of the entire distribution of interpersonal violence; hence the homicide rate serves as a proxy for overall violence, and its rise implies a decline in personal security. We use national and cross-provincial panel data to show that population density, state capacity, local self-governance, interregional grain market integration, and grain price level (which captures crop failure and other survival distress) are all statistically significant drivers of the homicide rate in 18th- and 19th-century China.","[Chen, Zhiwu] Yale Univ, Univ Hong Kong, 165 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Chen, Zhiwu] Peking Univ, Yale Sch Management, Sch Econ, 165 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Peng, Kaixiang] Henan Univ, Dept Econ, Kaifeng, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Lijun] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Yale University; Yale University; Henan University; Washington University (WUSTL),"Chen, ZW (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Univ Hong Kong, 165 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.;Chen, ZW (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Yale Sch Management, Sch Econ, 165 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",zhiwu.chen@yale.edu; kaixiangp@qq.com; lijun.zhu@wustl.edu,,"Chen, Zhiwu/0000-0002-5445-8514",,,,,44,7,8,1,23,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

We argue that more attention needs to be paid exactly to the interrelations between trade and tax policies. Drawing from two case studies on Panama's trade disputes, we show how World Trade Organization (WTO) rules can be used both to resist attempts to sanction secrecy structures and to promote measures against tax flight. The theory of new constitutionalism can help to explain how trade treaties can 'lock in' tax policies. However, our case studies show that trade policy not only 'locks in' democratic policy-making, but also enables tax havens to use their commercialized sovereignty to resists anti-secrecy measures. What is being 'locked in' are the policy tools, not necessarily the policies. The changing relationship between trade and tax policies can also create new and unexpected tools for tackling tax evasion, underlining the importance of epistemic arbitrage in the context of new constitutionalism. In principle, political actors with sufficient technical and juridical knowledge can shape global tax governance to various directions regardless of their formal position in the world political hierarchies. This should be taken into account when trade treaties are being negotiated or revised.","[Eskelinen, Teppo] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Social Sci & Philosophy, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Ylonen, Matti] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland; [Ylonen, Matti] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Helsinki, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla; University of Helsinki; Aalto University,"Ylönen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland.;Ylönen, M (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Helsinki, Finland.",matti.v.ylonen@gmail.com,"YlÃ¶nen, Matti/Y-4401-2019; Ylonen, Matti/E-3855-2018","Ylonen, Matti/0000-0003-0024-0867; Eskelinen, Teppo/0000-0001-5899-6996",Academy of Finland [267976]; Finnish Employees' Foundation; Fulbright-Schuman program,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Finnish Employees' Foundation; Fulbright-Schuman program,"We wish to acknowledge the comments received in the conference organized by the International Studies Association (Baltimore, MA).

We analyze whether the DM led to localized reduction in three transportation source pollutants. Looking at the period 2004-2006, one of the larger rail extensions of the DM led to a 34 percent reduction in localized CO at a major traffic intersection in the city. Results for NO2 are also suggestive of a decline, while those for PM2.5 are inconclusive due to missing data. These impacts of pollutant reductions are for the short run.

The authors developed the model of effective public management of socio-economic processes at the city level, in which main tools of management of socio-economic processes of a city are tax policy at the city level, anti-monopoly policy, fighting against inflation at the city level, fighting against unemployment at the city level, investment policy, stimulation of entrepreneurship, and development of the system of electronic provision of state services. Approbation of the developed methodology of determination of the level and current state of effectiveness and efficiency of public management of socio-economic processes at the city level by the example of Volgograd allowed proving its practical application. As a result, the authors came to the conclusion that perspectives of increase of effectiveness of public management of socio-economic processes at the level of Volgograd are related to increase of anti-inflation measures, change of approach to accounting of the unemployed, active support for population employment, and increase of effectiveness of anti-monopoly and social policy.","[Kayl, Iakov I.; Bakhracheva, Yulia S.; Velikanov, Vasilyi V.] Volgograd State Sociopedag Univ, Chair HR Management, 27 Lenina Ave, Volgograd, Russia; [Epinina, Veronika S.; Korobova, Svetlana I.] Volgograd State Univ, Chair Management, 100 Univ Sky Ave, Volgograd, Russia",Volgograd State Pedagogical University; Volgograd State University (VOLSU),"Kayl, II (通讯作者)，Volgograd State Sociopedag Univ, Chair HR Management, 27 Lenina Ave, Volgograd, Russia.",kailjakow@mail.ru; econmanag@volsu.ru,"Kail, Iakow/AAQ-8094-2021; Epinina, Veronika/AFN-5350-2022","Epinina, Veronika/0000-0002-8771-3198; Yulia, Bakhracheva/0000-0002-0558-5736",RFBR [16-12-34014]; Volgograd region [16-12-34014],RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Volgograd region,The study was performed with financial support of RFBR and the Volgograd region within the framework of the scientific project No16-12-34014 Mechanisms of enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency public management of social and economic processes in the city in the comfort and energy performance life of the population.,,16,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-60696-5; 978-3-319-60695-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,185,190,,10.1007/978-3-319-60696-5_22,0.0,,,6,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ5OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426114200022,0

In this article, we examined data from 1,902 men's and 1,400 women's fights at the eight most prestigious judo tournaments during the period 2010-2013. Using a single fight as the unit of observation, we found that the probability for the favorite to win against the underdog in the men's half-lightweight category is significantly lower than in most other categories. Moreover, in fights in which only European and/or Asian judokas participate, we found that the men's half-lightweight category is significantly more balanced than all other men's categories. For women, there is no consistent evidence that any one weight category is more balanced than any of the others. Our results indicate that in choosing the members of a national team, it is to some extent reasonable for national coaches to select a lower ranked judoka in the men's halflightweight category over a higher ranked judoka in several other weight categories. We also found that the home advantage increases the probability of winning a single fight for both genders. This result implies that it might be worthwhile for national judo associations to bid to host international tournaments in order to improve the world rankings of their domestic judokas.","[Krumer, Alex] Ariel Univ, Dept Econ & Business Adm, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel",Ariel University,"Krumer, A (通讯作者)，Ariel Univ, Dept Econ & Business Adm, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel.",krumer.alex@gmail.com,"Krumer, Alex/AAP-9910-2020","Krumer, Alex/0000-0002-3274-8078",,,,,21,21,21,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The lack of employee engagement is the top issue currently facing HR and business leaders worldwide, and many empirical studies indicate that improving engagement correlates with improving performance. The paper gives a thorough insight in to the current methodologies of measuring employee engagement and its key theoretical assumptions. Managers often underestimate the role of engagement because they are not aware of the significant hidden costs of employee turnover, absenteeism, sabotage, shrinkage and negative effects on other employees. To properly address the problem of employee engagement the managers should understand the determinants of engagement, i.e. the drivers of engagement and the barriers to engagement. Managing employee engagement is a challenging work and requires an all-organizational approach, as well as engaging managers at all organizational levels, motivated and good equipped to co-create and implement engagement strategies. The paper uses a comparative approach in presenting the current measurement methodologies and issues, and gives a critical analysis of current business practice of managing/improving employee engagement. The author concludes by giving a set of recommendations to business practitioners, government and academics that are in search for best models and practices in measuring and managing employee engagement. The working environment and the work itself should be designed to enable the highest employee engagement levels, and through that the high performance. The implemented engagement policies and programs should be in that process constantly revised to enable long-term success.","[Lacmanovic, Sabina] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Lacmanovic, S (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",sgrgor@unipu.hr,"Lacmanović, Sabina/AAV-3747-2021",,Croatian Science Foundation [9481],Croatian Science Foundation,"This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number 9481 Modelling Economic Growth - Advanced Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm.

The strong as well as the problematic situations of the criteria of the MBNQA model were registered and analyzed. Furthermore, the reasons of the low performance and obstacles of the learning process were discussed and ways contributing to Continuous Improvement, that requires constant awareness and focus, were proposed. These points support the MBNQA model as an operational framework for Total Quality Management and also strengthen the results obtained in previous studies for the EFQM Model suggesting that quality award models actually provide a suitable framework for quality management.","[Sofia, Anastasiadou] Univ Western Macedonia, Kozani, Greece; [George, Iakovidis] ASPETE, Athens, Greece",University of Western Macedonia; ASPETE - School of Pedagogical & Technological Education,"Sofia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Macedonia, Kozani, Greece.",,,,,,,,16,4,6,0,4,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,436,455,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.912,0.0,,,20,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200035,0

This initiative was initially motivated by the need to reduce the inconvenience associated with the use of coins, to save the cost of minting coins and to help the smooth change-over in the event of a possible redenomination of the Korean Won (KRW). But as Korea is well equipped with cashless payments such as credit cards and FinTech payments, this initiative was further expanded to test the possibility of a cashless society before ultimately shifting to it. Eliminating coins from circulation means that the BoK is developing an alternative payment instrument to coins for the giving and receiving of small change in commercial transactions. This study evaluates the merits of different possible electronic payment methods and services such as credits cards, public transportation cards, electronic cash receipts and digital wallets, and shows that Korea has a high potential to realise not only a coinless society but also a cashless society. If realised, a coinless society will mark a new era that will herald the end of the age of commodity money and eventually paper money.","[Moon, Woosik] Seoul Natl Univ, Econ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Moon, W (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Econ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",mwoosik@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,6,2,3,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0921-8580,2197-1889,978-3-319-59846-8; 978-3-319-59845-1,FINAN MON P,,,2017,44.0,,,,,,101,115,,10.1007/978-3-319-59846-8_7,0.0,,,15,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL1NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447914500007,0

The purpose of the paper is to present the results of empirical studies on the usefulness of the random subspaces and random forests methods for forecasting the bankruptcy of companies in Poland. Both of the aforementioned methods belong to the multi model approach to data analysis. The random subspaces method relies on the random selection of variables, while the random forests methods uses both the random selection of variables, as well as the random selection of observations. The analysis was performed for balanced sets of companies. The usefulness of the random subspaces and random forests methods for forecasting the bankruptcy of companies was assessed based on the values of the classification accuracy measures for companies from the test part of the input set of objects. The basis for building the set of objects was a set of companies active in the industrial processing sector in Poland in the years 2013-2014.

It takes up the classical studies on inequality, to understand the marked influence of the economic dimension in subsequent studies on the subject. Then, it points out the main trends in the treatment of inequality, considering works that incorporate the multidimensional perspective of inequality-inspired in the human capacity expansion approachand, already in the nineties, those that introduce the territorial approach in the framework of the debate on new rurality. The text also presents more recent studies that address new dimensions and theoretical perspectives, such as horizontal inequalities, and others that highlight the importance of gender and ethnicity to understand the persistence of inequality, particularly in areas such as education and political participation. Lastly, it considers the studies that, in the last decade, analyze the interdependence of inequalities in the context of globalization, based on a multiscalar approach, linking it, for example, with issues such as access and control of natural resources. The studies of the last two decades suggest that inequality is part of a larger set of relationships, among which social exclusion and discrimination are fundamental. However, there are clear absences. Among them, the discussion about land and peasantry, as well as the power relations between new actors that converge in rural spaces. Finally, the text proposes that the current dynamics of rurality requires debating about new inequalities, as well as analyzing who are the new excluded, within the framework of global processes that overlap and adopt local nuances.","[Luisa Burneo, Maria] Inst Estudios Peruanos IEP, Lima, Peru",,"Burneo, ML (通讯作者)，Inst Estudios Peruanos IEP, Lima, Peru.",mburneo@iep.org.pe,,,,,,,134,0,0,0,0,SEMINARIO PERMANENTE INVESTIGACION AGRARIA-SEPIA,LIMA,"JR MARIA PARADO BELLIDO 150, URB SAN FELIPE MAGDALENA MAR, LIMA, 17, PERU",,,978-612-45829-8-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,331,429,,,,,,99,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,BQ9WB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000627112600007,0

Our research analyzes the very controversial oil palm chain from a critique of the global value chain approach. Our goal is to understand how power relationships and local historic processes shape value chains, which in turn facilitates product and value grabbing. From a case study in Tocache (San Martin), we discuss with ethnographic data the interplay between different actors, questioning power relationships and agency through the detailed discussion of a small-farmer association considered successful in the value chains model. Our findings suggest that oil palm expansion doesn't necessarily depend on dispossession and coercion, and that while agribusinesses control the production process and commodities within the value chain, small-scale farmers contest and dispute these relationships through reactions from below that go beyond the concept of resistance. Dependent on different processes of incorporation, small-scale farmers are able to contest and take over the process of value production through industrialization, as well as producing narratives based upon the symbolic value of small-scale production which will help take on a more advantageous status within the value chain.","[Palacios, Diego] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Lima, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,,alejandra.huaman@pucp.edu.pe; d.palacios@pucp.edu.pe,,,,,,,77,0,0,0,1,SEMINARIO PERMANENTE INVESTIGACION AGRARIA-SEPIA,LIMA,"JR MARIA PARADO BELLIDO 150, URB SAN FELIPE MAGDALENA MAR, LIMA, 17, PERU",,,978-612-45829-8-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,185,244,,,,,,60,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,BQ9WB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000627112600004,0

In this process, discourses and narratives emerge to define who has the legitimate right to water, which interest shall prevail, and in what direction water must flow to. This research explores the role of these discourses and narratives in the (re)configuration of hydro-social territories, through the case study of the project of San Jose de los Molinos infiltration galleries in Ica, Peru. This project's objective was to guarantee the access of drinkable water to the main urban center of the province, by extracting groundwater from the agrarian district of San Jose de los Molinos. This led to a conflict between the molinenses (neighbors, farmers and authorities) and the main promotors of the project: the regional authorities. I argue that in this case study, dominant actors used a series of discursive strategies supported by technical knowledge with the aim to reconfigure water flows in their own benefit. Far from being passively assimilated, these discourses were contested through narratives that emerged from local and contextual knowledge to resist the transformation of waterflow in the watershed. Nevertheless, this discourses and narratives are not static, they change and reconfigure with great dynamism in relation to the interests and possibilities of those who enunciated them.","[Gonzales, Isabel E.] Programa Posgrad Desarrollo Sostenible & Desigua, Lima, Peru",,"Gonzales, IE (通讯作者)，Programa Posgrad Desarrollo Sostenible & Desigua, Lima, Peru.",iegonzales@pucp.pe,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,1,SEMINARIO PERMANENTE INVESTIGACION AGRARIA-SEPIA,LIMA,"JR MARIA PARADO BELLIDO 150, URB SAN FELIPE MAGDALENA MAR, LIMA, 17, PERU",,,978-612-45829-8-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,713,759,,,,,,47,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,BQ9WB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000627112600013,0

To do this, we took the case of the Santa Elena town, located in the province Viru, La Libertad and we examined the process at three levels: access to resources, distribution of income, and class trajectories. Regarding the first level, we analyze the expansion of the rental market as a constitutive phenomenon of a new dynamic of access to land. Secondly, at the distributive level, we examine the logic of functioning of the land and labor market as the main mechanisms for distributing the monetary wealth produced by agriculture. Finally, we explore the formation of new social strata and their socio-economic transitions in their relation to land and agricultural activity. We conclude that the new dynamic of internal differentiation that is taking place in Santa Elena is the product of the sudden capitalization of the value of land and has constituted an inequitable but not exclusionary logic of distribution of income that has allowed the formation of new social strata and important ascent movements of families without access to land ownership.","[Lucia Araujo, Ana] Unidad Coordinac Reg Amer Latina & Caribe Int Lan, Adm Monitoreo & Evaluac & Gobernanza, Santiago, Chile",,"Araujo, AL (通讯作者)，Unidad Coordinac Reg Amer Latina & Caribe Int Lan, Adm Monitoreo & Evaluac & Gobernanza, Santiago, Chile.",a20094316@pucp.pe,"Araujo, Aurelio L/D-4872-2013",,,,,,40,0,0,1,1,SEMINARIO PERMANENTE INVESTIGACION AGRARIA-SEPIA,LIMA,"JR MARIA PARADO BELLIDO 150, URB SAN FELIPE MAGDALENA MAR, LIMA, 17, PERU",,,978-612-45829-8-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,543,590,,,,,,48,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,BQ9WB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000627112600010,0

In order to make sense of transformations I acknowledge the complex set of relationships that shape landscapes themselves and the interactions among people, groups and institutions in given landscapes. In this balance, I look into three elements while addressing landscapes' transformation: functionality, management and planning. The multiple dimensions of landscapes' transformation are captured by addressing the functions-real or perceived- that shape the perspectives and actions over landscapes, while the processes linked to management and planning help to analyze the relationships among people, groups and institutions amidst landscapes' transformation. In this balance, the functionality of landscapes is presented by describing landscapes for production, conservation, identity building and visualization. The cases of water landscapes and forest landscapes are used to exemplify the encounter among perspectives and actions that have characterized the transformation of rural landscapes.

Then, the inequality observed in this capacity is transferred directly to the allocation of funds under competitive fund schemes-such as FONIE and FONIPREL- that aim to reduce infrastructure gaps through funds. Therefore, this study shows that a part of the inequality in access to infrastructure in rural areas can be explained by a difference in the capacities of local governments, rather than by financing problems. One implication of this result is that this type of financing schemes could incorporate an accompanying component for the formulation of the demand for infrastructure, before the contest for the funds, or grouping the municipalities that apply to these funds in a different way to get more equitable conditions of participation.","[Diaz, Ramon] Minist Desarrollo & Inclus Social, Diseno Focalizac, Lima, Peru",,"Díaz, R (通讯作者)，Minist Desarrollo & Inclus Social, Diseno Focalizac, Lima, Peru.",ramon.diaz.vasquez@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,0,SEMINARIO PERMANENTE INVESTIGACION AGRARIA-SEPIA,LIMA,"JR MARIA PARADO BELLIDO 150, URB SAN FELIPE MAGDALENA MAR, LIMA, 17, PERU",,,978-612-45829-8-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,495,542,,,,,,48,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,BQ9WB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000627112600009,0

The experience of the Peruvian agroexport boom is eloquent in terms of the complexity of these processes. The unprecedented growth of agricultural exports since the late 1990s was based on a policy commitment aimed at the entry and consolidation of large-scale private actors, in parallel to a residual articulation - in the margins of the 'boom' - of some small producers. The balance of this interesting experience, however, has not been addressed with the necessary attention from academia or policy design. The present study seeks to respond to this absence, exploring the structural and political factors that allowed the agroexport 'boom', discussing the orientation of public policies in the agricultural sector in recent decades, and making a balance of 7 experiences of articulation to CVAs to extract lessons related to the entry conditions of small farmers, the existing articulation structures, the associated economic impacts, and the public-private role for the promotion of inclusive CVAs. Our findings focus on 5 main points: (1) the central role of the private sector in identifying the potential of CVAs, typically from the transition of conventional varieties to the attention of specialized market segments, (2) a differentiated trajectory of CVAs depending on the incentives and conditions that facilitated the entry of producers and companies, (3) economic impacts on small producers boosted by the alliance between companies and organizations, (4) the importance of having a public-private articulation platform for identification of market opportunities and the link with small producers; and (5) the need to frame the political will to promote CVAs within a broader rural development strategy.","[Paredes, Hector; Fort, Ricardo] Grp Anal Desarrollo GRADE, Lima, Peru",,"Paredes, H (通讯作者)，Grp Anal Desarrollo GRADE, Lima, Peru.",hparedes@grade.org.pe; rfort@grade.org.pe,,,,,,,86,0,0,0,1,SEMINARIO PERMANENTE INVESTIGACION AGRARIA-SEPIA,LIMA,"JR MARIA PARADO BELLIDO 150, URB SAN FELIPE MAGDALENA MAR, LIMA, 17, PERU",,,978-612-45829-8-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,35,130,,,,,,96,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,BQ9WB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000627112600002,0

Based on the work of Azzam (1992), the research distinguishes three key components in the production and marketing of potatoes: farmer (producer), wholesaler and retailer. The study acknowledges that the structure of the market in which these agents operate may or may not be competitive. The study empirically assesses to what extent the intermediary (wholesaler) can exercise power market both in purchase and sale of the potatoes and how this markets power has change after the relocation of the wholesale market to Santa Anita took place.

However, due to its large scale, traditional analysis methods often become inadequate. In this paper, we propose a sequential sampling enhanced composite likelihood approach for efficient estimation of social intercorrelations in large-scale networks using the spatial model. Given a known population network, the proposed approach sequentially takes small samples from the network, and adaptively improves model parameter estimates through learnings obtained from previous samples. In comparison to population-based maximum likelihood estimation that is computationally prohibitive when the network size is large, the proposed approach makes it computationally feasible to analyze large networks and provide efficient estimation of social intercorrelations among members in large networks. In comparison to sample-based estimation that relies on information purely from the sample and produces underestimation bias in social intercorrelation estimates, the proposed approach effectively uses information from the population without compromising computation efficiency. Through simulation studies based on simulated networks and real networks, we demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed approach over benchmark estimation methods and discuss managerial implications. We also discuss extension of the proposed approach in the context of an unknown population network structure, as well as in an alternative form of the spatial model.","[Chen, Yan; Qi, Youran; Chien, Peter] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Liu, Qing] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Mkt, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Liu, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Mkt, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",qliu@bus.wisc.edu,"Li, Wang/M-1612-2019",,University of Wisconsin-Madison; NSF [1564376]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1564376] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,University of Wisconsin-Madison; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),This research was supported in part by the Vilas Life Cycle Professorship Grant from University of Wisconsin-Madison and NSF Grant 1564376.,,58,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

To achieve this, a dynamic bioeconomic model and model-based scenarios are considered, in which the stock's growth function depends on the sea surface temperature. The model is empirically calibrated for the French Guiana shrimp fishery using time series collected over the period 1993-2009. Three fishing effort strategies are then compared under two contrasted IPCC climate scenarios (RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6). A first harvesting strategy maintains the Status Quo in terms of fishing effort. A more ecologically-oriented strategy based on the closure of the fishery is also considered. A third strategy, which relates to Maximum Economic Yield (MEY), is based on the optimisation of the net present value derived from fishing. The results first show that 'Status Quo' fishing intensity combined with global warming leads to the collapse of the fishery in the long run. Secondly, it turns out that the Closure strategy preserves stock viability especially under the optimistic climate scenario. Thirdly, the MEY strategy makes it possible to satisfy bioeconomic performances requirements with positive stock and profit, once again, especially under the optimistic warming scenario. Consequently, MEY emerges as a relevant bioeconomic strategy in terms of adaptation to climate change but only in connection with climate change mitigation.","[Diop, Bassirou] CNRS French Natl Ctr Sci Res, LEEISA, UMRS 3456, BP 477, Cayenne 9733, French Guiana; [Sanz, Nicolas] Univ French Guiana, UMRS 3456, LEEISA, Campus Troubiran,BP 20792, Cayenne 97337, French Guiana; [Junior Duplan, Yves Jamont] Univ French Guiana, Campus Troubiran,BP 20792, Cayenne 97337, French Guiana; [Guene, El Hadji Mama] IPR, Rennes, France; [Blanchard, Fabian] Ifremer French Res Inst Exploitat Sea, LEEISA, UMRS 3456, BP 477, Cayenne 97331, French Guiana; [Pereau, Jean-Christophe; Doyen, Luc] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA CNRS French Natl Ctr Sci Res, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France",Ifremer; Ifremer; Universite de Rennes; Ifremer; Universite de Bordeaux,"Diop, B (通讯作者)，CNRS French Natl Ctr Sci Res, LEEISA, UMRS 3456, BP 477, Cayenne 9733, French Guiana.",diop.bassirou@gmail.com,"Diop, Bassirou Masseck/AAI-2760-2020; Doyen, Luc/GXH-3424-2022","Diop, Bassirou Masseck/0000-0001-5361-7336; Doyen, Luc/0000-0001-8272-6187; pereau, jean christophe/0000-0003-0761-6994; Blanchard, Fabian/0000-0001-8496-877X",Belmont Forum [ANR-14-JPF1-0003]; VOGUE; ECOPE (PIG CNRS); OYAMAR (FEDER); ACROSS [ANR-14-CE03-0001]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-14-JPF1-0003] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Belmont Forum; VOGUE; ECOPE (PIG CNRS); OYAMAR (FEDER); ACROSS; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work was carried out with financial support from the Belmont Forum through its funding of the SEAVIEW network (ANR-14-JPF1-0003), as well as from the VOGUE, ECOPE (PIG CNRS), OYAMAR (FEDER), and ACROSS (ANR-14-CE03-0001) research projects.",,55,15,15,0,41,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

They refer to situations in which efficiency improvements are reduced or even reversed by changes in behavior. In many cases these effects stem from small behavior changes rooted in cultural values or from the interconnectedness of everyday practices. Practice theory has established itself in many social science disciplines, including ecological economics, and its focus on routinized activities in everyday life promises to provide beneficial insights to debates on rebound. Since this has not been done to date, this article aims to fill the gap by offering suggestions as to how practice theory can complement and enhance existing explanations of rebound effects. Drawing on existing practice theory research on energy consumption, we identify and discuss a number of starting points for practice theory-inspired research on rebound effects. These include the pivotal role of distributed agency between humans and non-humans (e.g. technical devices), the co-dependence of practices, the co-evolution of practices with systems of provision, as well as a general trend towards the acceleration of everyday life.","[Sonnberger, Marco] Univ Stuttgart, ZIRIUS Stuttgart Res Ctr Interdisciplinary Risk &, Seidenstr 36, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany; [Gross, Matthias] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Gross, Matthias] Univ Jena, Inst Sociol, D-07743 Jena, Germany",University of Stuttgart; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Sonnberger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Stuttgart, ZIRIUS Stuttgart Res Ctr Interdisciplinary Risk &, Seidenstr 36, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany.",marco.sonnberger@zirius.uni-stuttgart.de; matthias.gross@ufz.de,"Sonnberger, Marco/AAB-1716-2020; Gross, Matthias/A-4634-2012","Sonnberger, Marco/0000-0002-9403-0053; Gross, Matthias/0000-0002-3716-7512",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01UU1605A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [grant number 01UU1605A].,,104,22,22,2,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Governments split up all land in unprotected and protected land, and there are internationally traded consumption goods that use either protected or unprotected land as an input in production. Global biodiversity is increasing in aggregate protected land. The willingness-to-pay for biodiversity (conservation) is larger in the 'rich' North than in the 'poor' South. There is an international market on which governments and possibly a coalition of northern countries may demand and/or offer unprotected land for conversion into protected land. If a coalition exists, it turns out to be the only demander on that market, and its demand is increasing in coalition size. We investigate the formation of self-enforcing coalitions when governments and the coalition either take prices as given or exert market power. We find that there are no such coalitions, when external biodiversity benefits are large, but there may be self-enforcing coalitions, even large ones, if these benefits are sufficiently small. Furthermore, it is possible that the South suffers a welfare loss when a self-enforcing coalition of northern countries pays for biodiversity conservation in the South.","[Eichner, Thomas] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany; [Pethig, Ruediger] Univ Siegen, Dept Econ, Unteres Schloss 3, D-57072 Siegen, Germany",Fern University Hagen; Universitat Siegen,"Eichner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany.",thomas.eichner@fernuni-hagen.de; pethig@vwl.wiwi.uni-siegen.de,,,,,,,32,3,3,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The need for probabilistic approaches to sustainability measurement is on the rise. Existing approaches to measuring strong sustainability, which emphasize the non-substitutability of resources, overwhelmingly focus on the national- or regional-levels. Few strong sustainability models explicitly address performance at the company level. The model proposed in this paper is also unique in that it addresses situations where the variables used to measure performance are dependent on one another. Existing approaches focus on independent variables. The model is provided in a generalized form and offers a straightforward approach to assessing the sustainability performance of corporations. Also discussed in the paper are some managerial and academic implications of the model.","[Ahi, Payman] Ryerson Univ, Dept Global Management Studies, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Searcy, Cory; Jaber, Mohamad Y.] Ryerson Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Ahi, P (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Global Management Studies, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.",payman.ahi@ryerson.ca,,"Jaber, Mohamad Y./0000-0001-7490-5396",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),The authors would like to thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) for their support.,,103,26,27,2,42,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Increased agricultural production could reduce fallow period length with implications for manioc flour (farinha) production. We hypothesize that payments for environmental services (PES) programs may exacerbate reduction of fallow periods, thereby reducing per stem farinha productivity. To understand the household scale economic impacts of avoided deforestation under PES programs, we conducted interviews in 158 households from 32 communities in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Using regression models, we assessed which variables most influenced farinha production, and calculated production costs and total revenues, with and without a PES program. Manioc yield increased by 22.83 kg per household per year for each additional year that the forest was left to recover before being cleared. Although production costs were higher for land cleared from older secondary forests, net profits on land cleared from primary forests were still higher. Total income from PES programs, when added to the secondary forest manioc profit, were higher than the foregone production in primary forest areas. However, when we considered only direct cash payments, we identified potential trade-offs. We conclude that PES programmes should consider possible long-term effects of payments on the livelihoods of participants.","[Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery; Peres, Carlos A.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery] Int Inst Sustainabil, Estr Dona Castorina 124, BR-22460320 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Pos Grad Ecol, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Hawes, Joseph E.] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Biol, Appl Ecol Res Grp, East Rd, Cambridge CB1 1PT, England; [Newton, Peter] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Sustainabil Energy & Environm Community, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Feltran-Barbieri, Rafael] World Resources Inst WRI Brasil, Rua Claudio Soares 72, BR-05422030 Sao Paulo, Brazil",University of East Anglia; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Anglia Ruskin University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Alves-Pinto, HN (通讯作者)，Int Inst Sustainabil, Estr Dona Castorina 124, BR-22460320 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",h.alves-pinto@iis-rio.org,"Peres, Carlos Augusto/N-8275-2019; Peres, Carlos A./ABE-8361-2020","Peres, Carlos A./0000-0002-1588-8765; Hawes, Joseph/0000-0003-0053-2018; Newton, Peter/0000-0002-3992-0483",DEFRA Darwin Initiative (UK) [16-001]; Anglia Ruskin University; Secretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente of Amazonas; Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renovaveis (IBAMA),DEFRA Darwin Initiative (UK); Anglia Ruskin University; Secretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente of Amazonas; Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renovaveis (IBAMA),"This study was funded by a DEFRA Darwin Initiative (UK) grant (Ref. 16-001) to CAP, and supported by internal funding from Anglia Ruskin University to JEH.

Using household survey data from western Kenya, we investigate the contribution of maize residues to smallholders' agricultural production and estimate their shadow value to be 5.94 Kenyan shillings (US$0.07) per kilogram.

With ecosystem health and fire resilience as a decision variable, two ecosystem states are delineated; the ecosystem can be within or outside its range of variability. The Southwest ponderosa pine ecosystem is used to illustrate the effects of fuels or restoration treatments on the decision variable input H within the probabilistic production function for wildfire losses. To estimate the health and fire resilience of the ecosystem, a short-term metric of ecosystem health (trees per acre for Southwest ponderosa pine) is used. Analysis of how the state of the ecosystem affects the optimization of the probabilistic production function for wildfire loss is carried out on the two ecosystem states. Results indicate that if the ecosystem is outside its range of variability, optimization of the objective function cannot be achieved. However, if the ecosystem is within its range of variability or if the ecosystem is transitioned within its range of variability through fuels or restoration treatments, the objective function can be optimized with respect to the decision input variables.","[Fitch, Ryan A.] No Arizona Univ, Alliance Bank Econ Policy Inst, POB 15066, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Kim, Yeon Su] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, 200 East Pine Knoll Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University,"Fitch, RA (通讯作者)，No Arizona Univ, Alliance Bank Econ Policy Inst, POB 15066, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",Ryan.Fitch@nau.edu; Yeon-Su.Kim@nau.edu,"Kim, Yeon-Su/I-3137-2014","Kim, Yeon-Su/0000-0001-7936-9641",,,,,25,8,8,3,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

I present claims about the type of entities that are studied by technosphere science and their causal relationships, and introduce central organizing concepts, such as 'information' and 'function'. Agency is no longer seen as a property exclusive to humans, but as being distributed in networks of ontologically diverse entities. Technosphere science draws on various uses of the concept of 'networks' across disciplines, such as scaling laws and builds on a universal evolutionary framework that generalizes over biological evolution. In this perspective, the economy is the medium by which human action becomes functional relative to the reproduction and growth of the technosphere. I conclude with showing how human autonomy and ethical commitments remain possible.","[Herrmann-Pillath, Carsten] Erfurt Univ, Max Weber Ctr Adv Cultural & Social Studies, Erfurt, Germany",University of Erfurt,"Herrmann-Pillath, C (通讯作者)，Erfurt Univ, Max Weber Ctr Adv Cultural & Social Studies, Erfurt, Germany.",carsten.herrmann-pillath@uni-erfurt.de,,"Herrmann-Pillath, Carsten/0000-0001-6078-0078",,,,,171,15,16,0,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Climate change mitigation initiatives by non-state stakeholders can play an important role in governing global climate change. The article addresses the relationship between intergovernmental and transnational governance processes in global climate governance. Particularly, the article aims to complement existing research on the role of orchestration by and through the UNFCCC process by focusing on how successful transnational initiatives can resonate within the intergovernmental negotiation process in order to inspire more ambitious climate action also on the part of national governments. This issue is addressed by systematically analysing interdependencies between transnational and international governance. Building on a structurational regime model, the article develops a theory of change of how and through which structuration channels non-state initiatives can contribute to changing the politics of international climate policy, traces existing UNFCCC processes and the Paris Agreement with a view to identifying inroads for a more direct feedback from non-state initiatives and derives recommendations on how and under which agenda items positive experiences can resonate within the UNFCCC negotiation process.","[Hermwille, Lukas] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doppersberg 19, D-42103 Wuppertal, Germany; [Hermwille, Lukas] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Hermwille, L (通讯作者)，Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doppersberg 19, D-42103 Wuppertal, Germany.;Hermwille, L (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",lukas.hermwille@wupperinst.org,,"Hermwille, Lukas/0000-0002-9811-2769",,,,,91,24,25,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A significant effect on preferences after a management intervention targeting recreation was observed. A mixed logit model with status quo as a random parameter showed that in 2014, the status quo had a negative effect, suggesting visitors were not satisfied by the status quo. However by 2015, after investments on a nature reserve, the status quo variable is highly significant and positive. The average benefits, measured in willingness to pay, generated by a refurbished visitor centre and other improvements is equal to (sic)9.18 per visit per person. The study also found that key management attributes for future MPAs that will generate increased economic benefits from recreational activity are those that promote the diversity of wildlife and the provision of educational information. As expected the donation and the restriction attributes decrease the benefits, but on average their effects are smaller than wildlife improvements. From a policy and management perspective, especially in the context of public funding pressures, these results are particularly important as they provide evidence on management strategies that support conservation objectives and maximise economic benefits.","[Paltriguera, L.; Luisetti, T.] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci Cefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Ferrini, S.; Turner, R.

We estimated NPK nutrient flows and partial balance based on historical data for biomass production and fertilizer use, from 1961 to 2015, to better understand intensity and temporal variability of nutrient dynamics in Argentina. Estimated NPK output accumulated 113.6 Mt. (78.4 Mt. N, 10.8 Mt. P, 24.4 Mt. K), or an annual average of 67 kg N, 9 kg P and 21 kg K per harvested hectare. Cumulate NPK supplied in fertilizers explained 15% N, 44% P and 4% K total extraction. Nutrient balance shows 53% (60 Mt) of total NPK outputs came from sources other than fertilizer, fixation or deposition, implying soil depletion. Nutrient deficits cumulate - 30 Mt. N, - 6 Mt. P and - 24 Mt. K, equal to - 26 kg N, - 5 kg P and - 20 kg K per harvested hectare each year. Soybean was the most extractive crop, with 54% of accumulated NPK removed.

Many argue that the experience of early British industrialization supports the thesis that economic advances depend on specialized scientific training, the acquisition of costly human capital, and the role of elites. This paper examines the contributions of different types of knowledge to industrialization, by assessing the backgrounds, education and inventive activity of major contributors to technological advances in Britain during the crucial period between 1750 and 1930. The results indicate that scientists, engineers or technicians were not well-represented among the cadre of important British inventors, and their contributions remained unspecialized until very late in the nineteenth century. The informal institution of apprenticeship and learning on the job provided effective means to enable productivity and innovation. For developing countries today, the implications are that costly investments in specialized human capital resources might be less important than incentives for creativity, flexibility, and the ability to make incremental adjustments that can transform existing technologies into inventions and innovations that are appropriate for prevailing domestic conditions.","[Khan, B.

Additionally, an indirect method is proposed which relies on a combination of information about nominal GDP with an assumption regarding the evolution of velocity in time, and which can be used to calculate coin supply and M2. Both methods rely on benchmark values known for certain years, but no particular benchmark is determinant for the results.

The natural insurance value of soil biodiversity mostly depends on farmed risk preferences as well as on the frequency of drought events to be insured against. We show that when the probability of drought increases, soil biodiversity conservation can be an optimal ecosystem-based adaptation strategy. However, this is only likely to be the case up to a given drought probability threshold.

This study provides an economic valuation of whale conservation using stated-preference choice experiment data collected from anti-whaling populations in Australia and Japan. Using a mixed logit model, we find higher economic valuation for a ban on whaling than for conventional protection actions in Australia. Despite the popularity of whale watching, limiting protections for species that are observed during whale-watching tours do not necessarily increase valuation. In contrast, we do not find a policy favored among the anti-whaling Japanese, who are in the minority and are significantly different from the general population in socio-demographic terms. Nonetheless, protection focusing on endangered whales is utility increasing for both countries. Overall, the results show a significant difference even among the anti-whaling populations of the two countries, suggesting a high bar for reaching international consensus over whaling. Lastly, the results from a latent class model also suggest that the level of demand for whale conservation in Japan could match the Australian level by proclaiming the importance of conserving endangered species and providing information on whales.","[Wakamatsu, Mihoko; Shin, Kong Joo; Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Urban Inst, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190385, Japan; [Wakamatsu, Mihoko; Shin, Kong Joo; Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190385, Japan; [Wilson, Clevo] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, 2 George St,GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Wakamatsu, M (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Urban Inst, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190385, Japan.",wakamatsu@doc.kyushu-u.ac.jp; kjshin@doc.kyushu-u.ac.jp; clevo.wilson@qut.edu.au; managi@doc.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427; Wakamatsu, Mihoko/0000-0002-1340-8801; Wilson, Clevo/0000-0002-3885-0495",JSPS [26000001]; JSPS; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Japanese Ministry of the Environment [S-15]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26000001] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Japanese Ministry of the Environment; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank Koichi Kuriyama for his comments on an earlier draft of this paper and the two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

Also, the conception of preferences is what individuals reveal as contributing to their wellbeing. However, as CBA ignores the empirically testable facts of how preferences are constituted, practical question arises about the legitimacy of the values themselves in contributing to welfare maximization. This paper seeks to uncover the meaning of wellbeing from lessons drawn from an extensive field study conducted with a group of indigenous people in Malaysia between 2008 and 2011. It concludes that despite decades of conceptual and analytical refinement, the price-based CBA is still limited in the practical world of evaluation because of the real difficulties it encountered in assessing the non-use and indirect use components of environmental assets that are non-subjectively distinguishable or are not traded in the market. Also, in ignoring individuals' value judgment and the various meanings of wellbeing from different socio-cultural backgrounds, CBA tends to lead to welfare distortions. To address these theoretical and practical deficiencies, it is necessary to embrace the heterodox school of Ecological Economics focusing on the social, cultural, and biophysical aspects of valuation processes.","[Choy, Yee Keong] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Choy, YK (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",cyk@keio.jp,,,"MEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities, (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan) [MKS1401]; University Institute Corporation, National Institutes for the Humanity, Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN), Kyoto, Japan [D-04]","MEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities, (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan); University Institute Corporation, National Institutes for the Humanity, Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN), Kyoto, Japan","This work was supported in part by the MEXT*-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities, 2014-2018 (*Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MKS1401), Japan).

At the same time, however, it demonstrates that the impact and sustainability of these innovations depended on the underlying political equilibrium. Gediksentitlements to usufruct rights over the factors of production used in urban commercial and industrial activitygradually transformed into liquid assets during the late eighteenth century. This transformation was enabled by the coercive power of Janissary-infiltrated guilds in response to the financial needs of small- and medium-scale actors operating within the confines of the domestic economy. The entry barriers, which enabled gedik markets to exist in the first place, also limited their use for growth-promoting purposes and thus set them apart from similar financial instruments that emerged in the West. Gedik markets disappeared as the Janissary-guild coalition declined and better financial instruments emerged during the mid-nineteenth century.","[Agir, Seven] Middle East Tech Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Agir, S (通讯作者)，Middle East Tech Univ, Ankara, Turkey.",,"Agir, Seven/ABA-3497-2020","Agir, Seven/0000-0002-8106-1504",Economic History Program at Yale University; Middle East Technical University [BAP-08-11-2013-026]; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [111K274],Economic History Program at Yale University; Middle East Technical University(Middle East Technical University); Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"I gratefully acknowledge the research assistance of Hakan Engin and Guldane Colak, and the financial support of the Economic History Program at Yale University, the Middle East Technical University (BAP-08-11-2013-026), and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK 111K274).

Several potential explanations exist, including low technological and demand complementarities; low productivity; and high natural and policy barriers to trade. Focusing on the latter explanations, policy makers have long advocated a South American/Southern Cone Free Trade Areaproposed as early as 1889. Would reductions in trade costs have been sufficient to raise trade significantly, or was trade low for other reasons? We study bilateral trade between 1910 and 1950, when large external shocks altered global supply and demand. These shocks help us show that intra-regional trade could have been boosted by reductions in trade costs. Trade among Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Peru could have benefited from more benign trade policies or better infrastructure. Regional trade in textiles, which took off from the 1930s, supports our argument that trade improved when trade costs fell.","[Badia-Miro, Marc; Carreras-Marin, Anna] Univ Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Antoni Capmany Econ & Hist Eco, Barcelona Econ Anal Team, Barcelona, Spain; [Meissner, Christopher M.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Meissner, Christopher M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Barcelona; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Badia-Miró, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Antoni Capmany Econ & Hist Eco, Barcelona Econ Anal Team, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Badia-Miró, Marc/D-8431-2011","Badia-Miró, Marc/0000-0001-5326-1819","Spanish Government; FEDER (Fondo Europeo para el Desarrollo Regional) [ECO2015-65049-C2-2-P, ECO2012-39169-C03-03]; Catalan Government [2014SGR1345]",Spanish Government(Spanish Government); FEDER (Fondo Europeo para el Desarrollo Regional); Catalan Government,"The authors appreciate comments received from the editor and three anonymous referees.

This article shows, using four separate tests, that farm output growth must have been much more limited. The tests are, first, whether in 1300 there was enough work at harvest to employ all the labour force; second, whether the value of output per worker in agriculture was greater than the annual earnings of workers; third, whether the implied relative outputs per acre of arable versus pasture were reasonable; and fourth, whether a much shorter medieval work year was possible. An alternative index of farm output consistent with the labour supply, wages, and farm rents is derived. This shows much less growth during the period 1270-1800. Overall economic growth in England during these years must consequently have been far less than Broadberry etal. estimate.","[Clark, Gregory] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Clark, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",gclark@ucdavis.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES 02-41376, SES 91-22191]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The data underlying this article were collected under National Science Foundation Grants SES 02-41376, 2003-2006, and SES 91-22191, 1992-4.",,39,11,12,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

That few such schemes exist is evidence of a classic market failure resulting from incentives to free-ride on the payments of other purchasers. In the context of an experimental investigation, this paper explores the role of negotiation and binding pre-commitments to payments in solving that collective action problem. Our novel experimental setup involves two purchasers seeking a level of payment acceptable to a single provider while also agreeing their own individual contributions to that payment. Contrasting treatments are used to explore complexities of the conditions under which negotiations might take place including asymmetries between the purchasers, treatments with incomplete information and treatments with uncertainty over the levels of benefit. We find that those complexities change the ease with which a negotiated agreement is achieved as well as the relative size of the payoffs enjoyed by the different parties to the negotiations Our findings are generally positive, showing that under many circumstances parties to a multiple-purchaser PES can successfully negotiate a mutually agreeable schedule of payments and contributions.

Findings Findings show that leftover foods take on both positive and negative attributes and benefits, as shown in four themestasty foods, dangerous foods, images of spoiling and used or second-handleading to consequences, identified as creating time, Time to binning and repurposing. Additionally, how individuals in a household speak of themselves based on their higher-order values, termed as states of being, can determine whether such foods are repurposed or consigned to the bin.

It also investigates the sensory perception and purchase intent for a Brazilian-made olive oil. Design/methodology/approach The sample, consisting of 115 surveyed consumers, is described demographically. The aspects related to sensory analysis and purchase intent associated with the key attributes indicated by the consumers are then discussed. Finally, consumer segmentation is carried out to characterize the consumers in more detail, in terms of both demographic and predictive variables for olive oil consumption. Findings Consumers displayed a sensory perception that is coherent with olive oil characteristics, thus being able to distinguish three different olive oils from a compound oil sample. Regarding purchase intent and preference, consumers showed mixed behaviors, which was not entirely convergent with the identified sensory aspects. Therefore, it was possible to segment them into three distinct groups: utilitarian, naive, and expert consumers.

This is especially important for any destination that wants to value its resources through tourist traffic. In this sense, user satisfaction with the quality of certain services provided by bus terminals is a key factor not only for the successful operation of the system itself but also for the tourism promotion of individual tourist regions, starting from the assumption that the first impression of a guest about a place is formed upon arrival at a bus terminal. The results of previous research have shown the sustainability of the claims. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate customer satisfaction with the quality of certain services of the main bus terminal of the city of Rijeka. For the purpose of this research, a new survey questionnaire was created and it collected data from a total of 156 users of Zabica bus terminal in Rijeka. The collected data were analysed by a method of descriptive statistical analysis, t-test, analysis of variance and Turkey post hoc test. By analysing the collected results, it was determined that the level of dissatisfaction was the highest in relation to the appearance of the waiting room, the functionality of platforms and the quality of facilities and services, thus confirming the need for modernization of the infrastructure of Zabica bus terminal, as one of the most important facilities in the town of Rijeka. The results also indicated that the users of the services were mostly satisfied with the staff's conduct, simplicity and availability of the ticket sales service and the speed of selling tickets. In relation to gender, the difference in user satisfaction with services was not confirmed, however, there was a statistically significant difference in user satisfaction with services in relation to age, user status, length of time spent at the bus terminal, length of purchase or booking of bus tickets, and length and frequency of use of services. The research results obtained can be used by practitioners that aim to develop passenger traffic as an essential element of tourist recognition of a certain region, as well as by theoreticians in analysing behaviour of users of certain services in order to increase the quality and satisfaction of customers and clients to consequently increase profits and bring the entire tourist service of all Croatian regions to a higher level.","[Babic, Tamara] Polytech Rijeka, Traff Dept, Vukovarska 58, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Golob, Marino; Babic, Snjezana] Polytech Rijeka, Business Dept, Vukovarska 58, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",Polytechnic Rijeka; Polytechnic Rijeka,"Babic, T (通讯作者)，Polytech Rijeka, Traff Dept, Vukovarska 58, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",tbabic1@veleri.hr; golob.marino@gmail.com; sbabic@veleri.hr,,,,,,,9,1,1,1,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,691,699,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900071,0

If efficiency is to achieve maximum effects with minimal effort, effectiveness is the quantification of the extent to which the objectives are met. The new economic configuration of commercial transactions, characterized by change and unpredictability, leads to a shift from a reactive approach, based on previous planning and subsequent control, to a dynamic, proactive, characterized by the quantification-action-reaction. The quantification of the performance of the economic entity is carried out with the help of the indicators. The indicator thus becoming a decision support tool that verifies whether the actions taken are registered in the direction approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders and the Board of Directors. Therefore, quantification of performance involves identifying a methodology in which the following components appear as the main directions of action: customers, shareholders, business partners, own staff, various interested audiences, widening the company's responsibility to groups other than shareholders, managers, employees and trade unions, internal processes, quality system, information system. In this paper I propose to analyze the correlation between corporate governance and the performance of economic entities, known to be the fact that economic agents with poor corporate governance have low economic performance (low yield of assets, equity and investments, etc), expose themselves more often the risks (eg stock price volatility of BSE listed companies, low interest rate, etc.). I believe that it is necessary to create a new global governance model that takes into account the organizational and evolving dimension of the entity, but also other partners whose actions can maximize the efficiency, performance or value of the brand, and which puts particular emphasis on creating value or wealth for stakeholders. We need a new policy to maximize shareholders' wealth.","[Cretu, Raluca Florentina] Univ Econ Studies, Fac Accounting & Management Informat Syst, Dept Financial & Econ Anal, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Cretu, RF (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Studies, Fac Accounting & Management Informat Syst, Dept Financial & Econ Anal, Bucharest, Romania.",cretu_raluca@yahoo.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,394,403,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700044,0

This article analyses which groups of employees want to reduce their working time, and for which reasons. A novel working-time policy in Austria, the leisure option, provides a unique possibility to examine this question. This policy enables employees to choose between a wage increase and more leisure time. We use a mixed-methods approach to analyse employees' preferences and the decision to reduce working time with two empirical parts run in parallel. A binary logit regression based on Austrian Microcensus 2012 data investigates factors associated with a preference for reduced working time. Qualitative interviews are conducted among employees at a firm in the electronics industry that offers the leisure option. Our results suggest that working-time preferences are to a large extent shaped by social norms, such as the full-time working norm and gender roles. We also find that the desire to work less is strongly moulded by personal values placed either on leisure and family time, or on financial security. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A quantitative approach was applied during the research. The work uses a descriptive method in the theoretical part and statistical methods in the empirical part. In the light of the statistical analyses carried out in the research process, there has been no indication of a higher potential of rural-urban communes in comparison to rural units. The potential of social smart is strongly dispersed. A positive impact of larger urban centres in the region on the rural potential cannot be identified. However, certain concentrations can be distinguished in the framework of selected Local Action Groups (LAGs) that operate in Lublin Province. Since the peripheral regions are in particular sparsely populated by the creative class, and it is difficult to attract the creative class of people, it should be noted that investing in and promoting smart people becomes necessary catalysts for the implementation of smart villages concept. It is therefore essential to strengthen the connection between the regional and sub-regional scientific centres and commune self-governments. Fostering the activity of LAGs operating in the Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) approach in the framework of LEADER programme seems to be the desired direction of the support for endogenous potential of rural territorial units enabling the smart villages concept implementation.","[Guzal-Dec, Danuta; Zwolinska-Ligaj, Magdalena] Pope John Paul II State Sch Higher Educ Biala Pod, Fac Econ & Tech Sci, Biala Podlaska, Poland",Pope John Paul II State School of Higher Education in Biala Podlaska,"Guzal-Dec, D; Zwolinska-Ligaj, M (通讯作者)，Pope John Paul II State Sch Higher Educ Biala Pod, Fac Econ & Tech Sci, Biala Podlaska, Poland.",danuta_guzal-dec@wp.pl; m.zwolinska-ligaj@dydaktyka.pswbp.pl,"Zwolińska-Ligaj, Magdalena Anna/AAJ-3271-2021; Guzal-Dec, Danuta/X-5746-2018","Zwolińska-Ligaj, Magdalena Anna/0000-0001-6770-7092;","Pope John Paul II State School of Higher Education in Biala Podlaska, Faculty of Economics and Technical Sciences [KEiZ / ZZ-1]","Pope John Paul II State School of Higher Education in Biala Podlaska, Faculty of Economics and Technical Sciences","The paper was prepared under project no KEiZ / ZZ-1 entitled: The concept of intelligent development of villages, settlements, cities and regions implemented as part of statutory research of Pope John Paul II State School of Higher Education in Biala Podlaska, Faculty of Economics and Technical Sciences.",,35,4,4,2,11,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,296,306,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.147,0.0,,,11,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500035,0

Three Design Build school competitions with negotiations and one limited architecture competition are examined in terms of to what degree the competitors are willing to invest in lifts. The Norwegian Building Code requires a lift in all public buildings with two or more storeys, and the lift should be easy to locate with its access close to the main entrance. However, a school building often has more main entrances, as the different age groups each tend to have their own entrances. This seems to put the competitors in a dilemma concerning the correct interpretation: Is it sufficient with simply the one lift at the official main entrance, or is it necessary with more lifts in connection with the entrances for the different age groups? The results show that despite the requirements in the Building Codes and the competition briefs, the competitors tend to prioritize lower bids in favor of optimal universally designed buildings. The results also show that any school design, with some reasonable effort, could reach a lift detour of maximum three minutes when using the calculation model applied in this research. However, from a lift user's point of view, any kind of detour may be experienced socially excluding and unacceptable.","[Houck, Leif D.] Univ Life Sci NMBU, Fac Sci & Technol, As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Houck, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci NMBU, Fac Sci & Technol, As, Norway.",leifho@nmbu.no,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,679,688,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-679,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371431.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100065,0

By focusing on the theme of valorization of natural capital, economic growth and sustainable development, we come to the conclusion that primacy should not belong to any of these individual themes, but rather to the optimization of their mutual relationship. Optimizing relationships means achieving equilibrium between economic goals and sustainable development of the economy and society. A new concept is required to completely redefine the economic goals for sustainable global development. In any case, the awareness of the significance of this topic ignites the spark of enthusiasm for the possibility to find a compromise between sustainable development of the economy, the society and economic growth. Economic growth in the form of GDP is desirable, provided limited exploitation of natural resources and sustainable global development are respected. In addition to the two basic factors of the production process, the third factor - the factor of land - is gaining in importance in contemporary management conditions. That third factor should be viewed in its wider meaning, as a natural resource or capital, which includes water, air, arable and non-cultivated agricultural land, forests and other natural resources. So, it is a natural system without which life in general and economic activities would not be possible. The purpose of the paper is to emphasize the importance of causality of natural capital, economic growth and sustainable development as well as the problem of valorization. In this paper, theoretical and empirical research methods have been used. The aim of the paper is to present the specific features of the economic system of eastern Croatia with special emphasis on the directions of economic growth, taking into account the possibilities for sustainable development and the capacity of natural capital. The results of the research lead us to the conclusion that economic growth, without a carefully planned strategy of sustainable growth and valorization of natural capital, leads to stagnation and decline in the long run. Finally, it should be concluded that it is necessary to carefully plan sustainable returns in order to preserve natural capital and, on the other hand, to achieve the goal of economic policy - to provide economic growth. In no way should the exploitation of natural capital exceed the limits of an environmentally sustainable level. That is why it is necessary to valorize natural assets, determine the guidelines of economic growth and pave the way for the sustainable development of the economy and society as a whole.","[Kovac, Aleksandar] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica 24000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Kovac, A (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica 24000, Serbia.",aleksandar.kovac15@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,7,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,1032,1043,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900109,0

Access to information is key for a democratic, inclusive society. However, poorly designed search user interfaces exclude certain user groups. For instance, search systems with high demands for correctly spelled queries have been reported to be challenging for people with reading and spelling difficulties, such as dyslexia. In a qualitative pre-study, four adults with dyslexia were interviewed about their search experiences in an encyclopedia with low tolerance for spelling errors. The participants regarded the encyclopedia as highly credible and preferred using this source for factual queries. Nevertheless, the users with dyslexia were highly dependent on Google due to high spelling demands in the encyclopedia search interface. Although the participants found relevant information on Google, they reported the search process as tiresome, since the result list assessment required a significant amount of reading. In contrast, searching the encyclopedia provided direct access to neutral, evaluated information, thus removing the evaluation phase. Moreover, searching was frequently associated with feelings such as fatigue, frustrations and failure. Results from this study imply that search user interface design affects the information searching behavior of people with dyslexia.","[Kvikne, Birgit; Berget, Gerd] OsloMet Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Archivist Lib & Informat Sci, Oslo, Norway",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Kvikne, B; Berget, G (通讯作者)，OsloMet Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Archivist Lib & Informat Sci, Oslo, Norway.",gerd.berget@oslomet.no,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,7,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,793,801,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-793,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371444.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100077,0

Entrepreneurial economy can be expressed through numerous economic variables such as the increase of production and employment. It is because of the important role that entrepreneurship has in the development of a country, an emphasis is made on determining ways in which its development can be stimulated. Besides the national level, the results of entrepreneurial activities can also be viewed on the regional level. Regional analysis of entrepreneurship includes defining the impact of entrepreneurship on the growth and development of regions and identifying regional factors that impact entrepreneurial activities inside the region. There is a problem of defining entrepreneurship, mainly because of its inherent multidimensionality. A large number of researchers in regional analysis use an entrepreneurial event, in other words the act of forming a firm, as an approximation of regional entrepreneurial activity. The purpose of this article is to explain the role of the regional environment in the development of entrepreneurship in the Republic of Croatia, respectively identifying the role of the region in explaining the different rates of firm formation. In defining a region NUTS 3 classification was used. Economic, institutional and social regional indicators are noticed in the literature to have an impact on entrepreneurship. In this article only economic factors were considered and a panel data analysis was conducted with a goal of identifying significant regional indicators in explaining the level of entrepreneurship. This article is an additional step in understanding Croatian entrepreneurship at the regional level because the literature on this topic is scarce and the results can be used by state bodies during the process of forming regional strategies of development in the Republic of Croatia.","[Mikic, Mihaela; Horvatinovic, Tin; Turcic, Ivan] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Mikic, M (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb, Croatia.",mmikic@efzg.hr; thorvatinovic@net.efzg.hr; iturcic@efzg.hr,"Turčić, Ivan/H-9166-2018; Mikic, Mihaela/ABD-8689-2020; Horvatinović, Tin/I-1440-2018; Turčić, Ivan/AAH-9186-2019; Turčić, Ivan/AAG-4704-2019","Mikic, Mihaela/0000-0003-3966-2530; Horvatinović, Tin/0000-0001-7447-9913; Turčić, Ivan/0000-0003-3158-4371",,,,,28,0,0,0,10,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,862,869,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900090,0

Design/methodology/approach An online cross-sectional study was carried out among 1,178 students at a premier university in the city of Kuala Lumpur. A web-based questionnaire pertaining to food safety knowledge, attitudes and practices was e-mailed to all registered students. Findings This study found that 61.7 per cent of the respondents had good food safety practices, 89.7 per cent had fair knowledge and slightly less than half of them had positive attitudes regarding food safety. There was significant association between respondents' attitudes and their food safety practices. No association was found between socio-demographic characteristics, year and field of study and their food safety practices. There was also no significant association between knowledge and food safety practices. Respondents with positive food safety attitudes had higher odds (OR=7.55, 95 per cent CI: 5.66, 10.07) for food safety practices compared to those with negative attitudes. Research limitations/implications As the study population consisted only of university students, the results may not be generalised to all youths in the country. Data collection using online self-reported questionnaires may cause misinterpretation. However, the questionnaire was validated and pilot tested prior to data collection. The results can be used in creating greater awareness of food safety practices, especially on positive attitudes among Malaysian youths. Originality/value This study describes self-reported food safety practices and their relationship with socio-demographic factors, knowledge, and attitudes of Malaysian university students.","[Moy, Foong Ming] Univ Malaya, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Julius Ctr Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Alias, Abd Aziz; Jani, Rohana] Univ Malaya, Dept Appl Stat, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Halim, Hishamuddin Abdul; Low, Wah Yun] Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya,"Moy, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Julius Ctr Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",moyfm@ummc.edu.my; aliasbinabdaziz@gmail.com; rohanaj@um.edu.my; hishamuddin@um.edu.my; lowwy@um.edu.my,"Low, Wah-Yun/B-1775-2009; Moy, Foong Ming/B-7899-2010; Halim, Hishamuddin Abdul/R-5252-2019; JANI, ROHANA/B-9587-2010","Moy, Foong Ming/0000-0002-0306-4419; Halim, Hishamuddin Abdul/0000-0002-1261-4937;",University of Malaya - University Malaya Research Grant (UMRG) [RP003B-13BIO],University of Malaya - University Malaya Research Grant (UMRG),No conflict of interests declared.

There are four elements that are incorporated into this term which includes: physical environment, lack of assistive technology, attitudes of others and the lack of or restrictive services, systems and policies [1]. These barriers to accessibility are present for 13% of the Irish population. Many initiatives have been developed and implemented for people with physical disabilities; however, people with intellectual disabilities (ID) remain invisible. This invisible population accounts for 9.7% of our population or 75% of the population of people with disabilities [2]. Thus, it is imperative that we commence to implement Universal Design (UD) approaches that increase accessibility and empower the invisible to become visible. One such invisible group that holds substantial potential to bring immense value to companies is that of people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) [3]. ASD currently impacts 1 in 68 people worldwide with this figure growing annually at a rate of 10-17% [4]. 80% of people with ASD are either unemployed or underemployed; this can be attributed to barriers to accessibility [5]. Two of the most common barriers to accessibility experienced by those with ASD are environmental and attitudes of others [6,7]. These barriers have the potential to be overcome through the use of Virtual Reality (VR) technology to provide training and education to managers. VR technology is being used to empower managers to reduce these barriers, increase accessibility and develop inclusive environments and cultures. VR technology can be used to empower managers to recognise and reduce the barriers facing those with ASD. VR is a catalyst for managers to be able to identify the environmental barriers facing people with ASD within a work environment. This solution also provides them with the skills necessary to commence making adaptations to the environment to reduce or eliminate these barriers. The use of this technology and paradigm shift brings many benefits for the individual and the company. A mixed method approach has been used for the purposes of data collection. The tools that were utilised were interviews with HR managers and people with ASD; and surveys were circulated to HR managers, senior managers, Chief Executive Officers and people with ASD. The results of these were positive and clearly verified that there is a need to empower managers to increase accessibility within their organisations.","[O'Sullivan, Miriam; Kearney, Gearoid] MyAccesshub, Tom Crean Business Ctr, Tralee, Kerry, Ireland",,"O'Sullivan, M (通讯作者)，MyAccesshub, Tom Crean Business Ctr, Tralee, Kerry, Ireland.",info@myaccesshub.io,,,,,,,33,1,2,0,30,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,253,261,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-253,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371482.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100024,0

Other cultivars (Jersey Supreme, Jersey Knight, Grande, Apollo, UC 157, NJ 953, UC 115, JWC 1) gave an increase in marketable yield of 35-79 % due to drip irrigation. Economic results of drip irrigation, depending on the increase in produce value and assumed drip irrigation costs were positive in case of 10 cultivars. The drip irrigation of Jersey Deluxe and Jersey Giant turned out most cost-effective. Irrigation was also very cost-effective in the case of cultivars UC115, NJ953, Jersey Knight, Jersey Supreme, UC157, Grande, Apollo and JWC 1. Drip irrigation was unprofitable in case of the following cultivars: Purple Passion, Jersey King and Atlas.","[Rolbiecki, Roman; Rolbiecki, Stanislaw; Michalcewicz-Kaniowska, Malgorzata] UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Rolbiecka, Magdalena; Zajdel, Malgorzata] Univ Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland; [Jagosz, Barbara] Agr Univ Krakow, Krakow, Poland",Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology; Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; Agricultural University Krakow,"Rolbiecki, R (通讯作者)，UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Bydgoszcz, Poland.",,"Michalcewicz-Kaniowska, Małgorzata/AAS-5564-2021; Zajdel, Małgorzata/AAS-5566-2021","Michalcewicz-Kaniowska, Małgorzata/0000-0003-2154-5838; Zajdel, Małgorzata/0000-0003-4535-2897; Rolbiecki, Roman/0000-0001-6230-4227",,,,,25,1,1,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,71,76,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.120,0.0,,,6,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500008,0

Moreover, the study tends to identify the best clustering techniques, between latent class cluster analysis (LCCA) and traditional cluster analysis (CA), for precise segmentation. Design/methodology/approach Best-worst scaling (BWS) method was applied to measure the level of relative importance of organic rice attributes. Then, LCCA and CA techniques were applied to recognize market segmentation. Finally, homogeneity and heterogeneity of the resulting clusters were determined to compare performance of the two clustering techniques. Findings The LCCA technique was identified better than the CA in classification of consumers. According to LCCA solution, the organic rice market in Bangkok (Thailand) consisted of six distinct clusters, which can be grouped into three categories based on consumers' profile. Organic rice consumer categories were identified as Art of eating and Superior quality seeker clusters focusing on special features and quality of the organic rice; consumer category Basic concern cluster heavily relied on organic certification logo and manufacturing information; and other consumer categories were Price driven, Eyes on price and Thorough explorer clusters.

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was performed in order to understand the main variables affecting the behaviour and to identify pathways to move to an anti-waste behaviour. In the end, 84 articles were selected for the final analysis. Findings Drivers and barriers to reduce food waste were categorised in societal factors, personal factors and behavioural factors. Variables can increase the amount of waste (+) or reduce it (-). From them, efforts to move to an anti-wastage behaviour are classified in macro-environmental change, retailers' engagement, raise awareness of the issue and creating anti-wastage social norms. Research limitations/implications The systematic review did not capture all variables that can influence consumer food waste and it is necessary different approaches to study the issue. Practical implications From the drivers for food waste reduction it is possible to design efforts to help consumers change their pattern of behaviour. Social implications Reducing food waste has effects in changing economic inequality, relative poverty and environmental damages. Originality/value The great majority of studies that analyse consumer food waste focus on behaviours that increase food waste. This special paper identifies how to stimulate and proactively work with behaviours that help to food waste reduction.","[Stangherlin, Isadora do Carmo; de Barcellos, Marcia Dutra] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Postgrad Programme Management, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Stangherlin, ID (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Postgrad Programme Management, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",isadoradocarmostangherlin@gmail.com,"Dutra de Barcellos, Marcia/F-4508-2011","Dutra de Barcellos, Marcia/0000-0002-4311-2921; Stangherlin, Isadora/0000-0003-0811-5198",,,,,107,104,107,19,138,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

It also recognises Chinese consumer segments based on their perceptions towards lobster. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected through an online survey (n=882, in two Chinese cities: Shanghai and Qingdao). The surveys explored consumer's perceptions and general image of lobster. Descriptive analysis, partial least squares regression and cluster analysis were conducted for data analyses. Findings Findings show that the most important perceptions regarding lobster by Chinese consumers are umami, delicious, high in protein, expensive, nutritious, upscale, red colour and bring back appetite. Chinese consumers' general image of lobster is positively linked to perception items, such as delicious, western flavour, umami, nutritious, high in protein, enjoy, upscale and appetite; and is negatively linked to perception items: spicy/hot, Chinese flavour and risk in illness. Three consumer segments are identified: western-flavour-lovers (35.4 per cent), Chinese-flavour-lovers (32.8 per cent) and negative-believers (31.8 per cent). Significant differences were recognised in the socio-demographic distribution among these three segments including, city, income, marital status, educational level, occupation and age. Originality/value This is the first study to present information regarding consumers' perceptions, general image and segments towards luxury seafood in the world's largest East-Asian country - China. The findings from this study can help global seafood marketers and exporters to better understand Chinese consumers which should assist them in developing effective marketing strategies for their luxury seafood products in this major market.","[Wang, Ou; Somogyi, Simon] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Business & Social Sci, Truro, NS, Canada; [Ablett, Richard] Perennia Innovat Ctr, Truro, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Wang, O (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Business & Social Sci, Truro, NS, Canada.",ou.wang@dal.ca; Simon.Somogyi@dal.ca; rablett@perennia.ca,"Wang, Ou/H-6346-2014","Wang, Ou/0000-0002-7976-3232; Somogyi, Simon/0000-0001-8558-1630",Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture,Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture,This study was funded by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture.,,54,15,15,1,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Every farmer has to cope with various kinds of natural, technological, personnel- and market-related risks. The most important strategies in risk management in farming include diversification of production and income, entering into contracts, vertical integration and insurance. Production insurance allows for transfer of risk outside individual farms, allowing them to stabilize their income. Since 2006, insurance is obligatory in Poland for crops and is partially subsidized by the state. Popularization of insurance is still lower than assumed in the programmes devised to provide support for agriculture. The aim of this study is to assess the functioning of compulsory crop insurance subsidized by the state budget in Poland and the reasons limiting its development. The analysed period included years 2006-2016, and for quantitative data - years 2009-2015. The author used statistical data from Central Statistical Office and governmental institutions. It was found that compulsory crop insurance developed dynamically in the early years after introduction of the concept. Each year, about PLN 200 million was paid by the state budget to subsidize crop insurance (ca. EUR 50 million). After year 2010, the area of crops insured reached 3 million hectares and it stopped to increase despite the incentives. Farmers were most eager to secure those crops, which are susceptible to natural risks, as well as those with high shares in the sowing structure. Rapeseed production was insured almost entirely, production of sugar beets and corn - in about 30 %, and cereals - in 20 %. The most significant barriers preventing popularization of crop insurance in Poland included: fragmentation of farms and low workforce productivity, low income in farming, high diversification of production and income of farms, high significance of direct subsidies in agricultural income, as well as high policy prices and low compensation amounts. In addition, for insurance companies, crop insurance was not profitable. The planned increase in the level of insurance subsidies to PLN 1.4 billion, increase in the level of subsidies to 65 % and the maximum level of subsidized premium to 9 % should contribute to elimination of the barriers observed and achievement of the planned level of crop insurance of 70 % of the area by year 2025.","[Wicka, Aleksandra] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Wicka, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",aleksandra_wicka@sggw.pl,,"Wicka, Aleksandra/0000-0001-7713-4953",,,,,35,3,3,0,8,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,178,186,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.134,0.0,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500022,0

This approach is based on the concepts of transparency and citizen participation. This paper presents a new methodology for the application of sensitivity analysis to environmental assessment projects. The general idea behind this method involves making the results of natural resource planning processes available to an extended peer community. This community, also known as a stakeholder community, is allowed to evaluate the quality of planning processes and give their opinion on the results. A Decision Support System based on institutional analysis, multi-criteria analysis and focus group sessions is used to implement this approach in a case study involving sustainable land-based transport policies in Tenerife, Canary Islands. In this exercise, stakeholders are involved in framing transport governance issues appropriately and then in defining and assessing plausible policy alternatives: The results obtained highlight that social sensitivity analysis is a viable approach that guarantees robustness in environmental governance. In addition, methodological suggestions are made that might be of use to the sustainability assessment community. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, it may be too simple since most people experience more than one stand when visiting a forest. This study aims at evaluating the effects of variation both within and between stands on recreational values. A choice experiment (CE) was applied to elicit people's preferences for forest types on their next recreational visit. Each alternative is presented with drawings of three forest stands which differ with respect to tree species, height (age) and distance to the site, the latter representing the cost factor - willingness-to-travel. Respondents also compose their ideal recreational forest by selecting three types of stands from the catalogue of drawings. We find that mixed tree species are preferred compared to monocultures. Stands with trees of varying height (uneven-aged stands) are preferred over stands consisting of trees of the same height (even-aged ones). Variation between stands is found to contribute positively to recreational value, and in some instances, this may outweigh contribution of variation within a stand. Comparing respondents' composition of their ideal forest with elicited preferences from the CE, confirm these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

At this stage, the availability of research and development (R&D) funding plays a critical role in the success or failure of renewable energy schemes. However, information about public interest in developing marine renewable energy technology, including tidal energy technology, in WA and the U.S. has been limited. Responses to a dichotomous choice referendum question on a mail survey sent to a representative sample of WA households were used to estimate residents' Willingness to Pay (WTP) for tidal energy R&D. Public preferences for policies to support tidal energy R&D were also assessed. WA households are WTP between $29M and $127M annually for tidal energy R&D, indicating public preference for an increase in government spending on tidal energy R&D over current levels. Public perceptions of potential social, environmental, and economic risks and benefits of developing tidal energy emerged as highly significant predictors of WTP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

How the majority of rural dwellers fared, however, remains largely elusive. This study develops a new approach to reconstruct rural living standards in a historical context. It builds upon a well-established real wage literature, but moves beyond it to capture rural realities, employing sub-national rural survey, census, and price data. The approach is applied to a case study of colonial and early post-colonial Uganda (1915-70). The case study yields a number of findings. While the expanding smallholder-based cash crop sector established itself as the backbone of Uganda's colonial economy, farm characteristics remained largely stagnant after the initial adoption of cash crops. Smallholders maintained living standards well above subsistence level, and while the profitability of cash crops was low, their cultivation provided a reliable source of cash income. Around the time of decolonization, unskilled wages rose rapidly while farm incomes lagged behind. As a result, an urban-rural income reversal took place. The study also reveals considerable differences within Uganda. Smallholders in Uganda's banana regions required fewer labour inputs to maintain a farm income than their grain-farming counterparts, creating opportunities for additional income generation and livelihood diversification.","[de Haas, Michiel] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Sch Social Sci, Rural & Environm Hist Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"de Haas, M (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Sch Social Sci, Rural & Environm Hist Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",,"de Haas, Michiel/ABB-4070-2020","de Haas, Michiel/0000-0002-0830-7803",European Research Council under the European Community (ERC) [313114]; European Research Council (ERC) [313114] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Community (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"I thank Jutta Bolt, Corinne Boter, Denis Cogneau, Angus Dalrymple-Smith, James Fenske, Ewout Frankema, Erik Green, Ellen Hillbom, Doreen Kembabazi, Bas van Leeuwen, Felix Meier zu Selhausen, Alexander Moradi, Elise van Nederveen Meerkerk, Kostadis Papaioannou, Jop Woltjer, Susan Zimmerman, colleagues at the Rural and Environmental History Group, Wageningen University, and three anonymous referees for valuable comments on previous drafts of this article.

This stems from a neoliberal marginalisation of international law and tendency to externalise liability resulting in accountability gaps, which pose major challenges for the climate regime. A socially efficient economic refraining of liability into a Dynamically Relative, and Comparatively Universal Liability Attribution (DRaCULA) framework is proposed. The attribution of liability for climate change damages under DRaCULA is algebraically developed into a conceptual model, the operation of the conceptual model is discussed and together with the framework found to be robust. Through its embodiment of the dynamic challenges inherent in climate change, DRaCULA strategically facilitates the climate negotiations and provides credible solutions to stumbling blocks, including the N-S divide.

(1995), xxx, Ecological Economics, ?: ???-???. The entropy change of the solar system between now and its final heat death is fixed. The time to the heat death is determined by the rate of entropy increase between now and then. If this rate of entropy increase is itself increased by economic activity, then economic activity is generating a negative externality. By internalizing this, a social planner treats the fixed amount of entropy change remaining until the heat death like the stock of an exhaustible resource. This leads to an analysis along the same lines as Hotelling's neoclassical economics of exhaustible resources, forming a partial synthesis between neoclassical economics and Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen's ecological economics work on the entropy law.

Both exports and imports (measured in tonnes) increased but exports were consistently much larger than imports. Such large Physical Trade Deficits (PTD) persisted throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Export prices of primary goods increased but by 2013, export prices had declined and the exports could no longer pay for imports. Countries started to show commercial trade deficits (in money terms). These findings hold for all the South American countries analysed and they show that the optimism generated by the improving terms of trade in South America at the beginning of the 21st century was premature. First, there were PTDs even in the boom years; second, the deterioration in the terms of trade after 2012 was accompanied by a counterproductive deficit in the monetary trade balance. It is counterproductive because, in principle, it leads to greater external debts or to outflows of currency reserves. It can also create pressure to increase physical exports. We argue that deficits in the monetary trade balances tend to be compensated by increasing the deficit in the PTB, which can lead to enhanced environmental pressures and therefore to local protests.

Using a regional panel data analysis from 1989 to 2014, we find that both hot and cold days cause an increase in all-cause and cause-specific mortality. On the other hand, days with extremely cold temperature (below -30 degrees C) may have an opposite impact and reduce mortality. Overall, our findings suggest that the economic costs of all-cause mortality due to one day with hot and cold temperatures correspond to 10.25 million USD and 7.91 million USD or 0.28% and 0.22% of daily GDP in Russia, respectively. The results also suggest that regions frequently experiencing hot and cold temperatures have adapted to these temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However there is an absence of internationally agreed accounting rules that would permit overall assessments of progress to this goal and any meaningful comparisons of performance between countries. This is true also for the quantitative Copenhagen/CancAn promise by developed nations to jointly mobilize US$100 billion by 2020. Our goal is to provoke discussion about the depth of the problems this lack of a functional definition and accounting system have created and perpetuated. We do so by describing the fragmented system of national reporting of climate finance and how the OECD's Rio Marker system is serving neither contributors nor recipients. More than a trust issue between developed and developing countries, we argue that the lack of modalities to account for climate finance also considerably impedes the effective functioning of the bottom-up approach that now prevails under the UNFCCC. The deadline to propose modalities of accounting climate finance by 2018 is a crucial window in which to address this chronic issue in international climate policy.","[Roberts, J.

Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on data and information collected by means of a web-administered survey and was performed in two steps. First, an explanatory factor analysis on the Schwartz value system and a confirmatory factor analysis on socio-economic context variables were carried out. Second, the per capita GDP at provincial level and the predicted factor scores were used in an ordered probit model to explain the expenditure level of FT products. Findings - The results provide evidence that the value system has an effect on the consumption of FT products, but the economic context, in particular the average wealth at province level, is also relevant and plays a role by either affecting FT product purchasing levels directly or interacting with personal values. Research limitations/implications - Because of the electronic submission and the specific channel used in the survey, the sample cannot be considered as representative of Italian consumers, and thus the analysis has a merely descriptive (non-inferential) function. Originality/value - While several studies investigated how personal values affect consumers' behaviour directly or indirectly, very few studies analysed the way socio-economic context interacts with the value structure and the way both aspects influence ethical consumption. The present study analyses this last aspect and provides evidence of the role economic context plays in affecting the relationship between personal values and FT products consumption.","[Coppola, Adele; Caracciolo, Francesco; Panico, Teresa] Univ Naples Federico II, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Dept Agr Sci, Portici, Italy; [Verneau, Fabio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Portici, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Coppola, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Dept Agr Sci, Portici, Italy.",coppola@unina.it,"Caracciolo, Francesco/D-6147-2013; Verneau, Fabio/AAU-1005-2021; Coppola, Adele/AAV-6741-2021","Caracciolo, Francesco/0000-0001-9430-7529; Coppola, Adele/0000-0002-9201-7859",,,,,77,16,17,7,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Business eco-system characterized by weak legal protection, low institutional development and restricted access to capital are the obstacles that affect capital structure decisions in SMEs on such markets. SMEs on underdeveloped financial markets will have more long term assets in balance sheets, but also lower level of net working capital which hinders further growth and development. The aim of this study is to identify determinants that will shape the decision about capital structure of owners/managers in SMEs and to propose conceptual framework for identification of preferred sources of capital on underdeveloped financial markets. The study has been conducted on 108 SMEs in the period from 2010-2012 on underdeveloped financial market of Republic Croatia. Results of the study showed that characteristics of the market have a big impact on capital structure decision making process and that will shape the capital structure of all companies on the market.

In order to acquire a cross-functional understanding of these thematic areas (crime and fraud) the mapping of existing research is needed. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper contributes to the process of knowledge understanding, by systematically reviewing literature to provide an analysis of the current body of business knowledge against the thematic criterion of supply chain food crime and supply chain food fraud. The analysis derives themes from the literature and maps this across the eight pillars underpinning the UK Government paper on food supply chain resilience. Findings - A distinct gap lies with the eight pillars of food supply chain resilience, business interest into supply chain criminality and academic research into the field. There are noteworthy gaps when the literature is analysed to that of the UK Government report. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of the study was its focus on business-only journals; a plethora of literature resides in the science field (e.g. testing) that has not made its way to business text. Practical implications - Drawing inference between business research and the government report, clear identification and tangible research areas can be immediately exploited to align cross-functional thinking. Social implications - The gap of consumer is not as yet addressed in this field, this research contributes originally to this gap and the need to address the same for societal benefit. Originality/value - The paper concentrates on the metrics know to contribute to food crime and food fraud and deviating views of academic vs non-academic literature. In conclusion the paper identifies thematic areas for further research and presents a conceptual framework of food supply chain resilience.","[Fassam, Liam] Univ Northampton, Fac Business & Law, Northampton, England; [Dani, Samir] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Business, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England",University of Northampton; University of Huddersfield,"Fassam, L (通讯作者)，Univ Northampton, Fac Business & Law, Northampton, England.",liam.fassam@northampton.ac.uk,,"Fassam, Liam/0000-0002-1194-7203",,,,,67,19,21,1,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Thus Organic Farming (OF) means farming according to EU guidelines, which takes into account the relationship to plants and animals, but they are not based on heritage or tradition and they do not direct natural resources in the direction of energy-saving use.

The research reports insights into Austrian marketplace for frozen and fresh foods that have been obtained from a consumer survey. Design/methodology/approach - The consumer survey methodologies indicate how preservation can change meal planning and lower food waste across frozen and fresh and ambient food purchases using freezing preservation methods. Findings - The results show food waste can be reduced by six-fold when frozen foods are compared with fresh foods. Research limitations/implications - This study highlights the requirement for a greater understanding of the probability that specific foods will be wasted with respect to the frequency of purchase. This is a limitation of the current study that has been investigated by other researchers. Practical implications - This research has enabled the identification of different food waste amounts for different food product categories. The data presented could be used to guide food product development so that less consumer waste is produced. Social implications - The research suggests a decision matrix approach can be used to can guide new product development and a model of this matrix is presented so that it may provide fit-for-purpose food preservation options for consumers.

Peaches must be processed quickly to maintain their quality because they are seasonal and their shelf life is short. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effect of freeze drying on quality parameters of stored peaches in order to increase shelf life, consumption and to decrease waste of fruit. Design/methodology/approach - Samples were ripped on maturity time, stored for 16 days and sampled out and freeze-dried at every four-day interval. Microstructure was carried out by applying scanning electron microscopy, texture and colour parameters by image analysis techniques and physicochemical parameters by conventional analysis. Findings - Statistical differences (p<0.05) were obtained of colour and texture (stored and freeze-dried rehydrated samples) and for water activity and porosity (freeze-dried samples). Results revealed that after 12 days of storage/freeze, dried peach snacks showed lower pore size with higher amounts of pore, which affected rehydration process leading to a harder sample. Colour was also affected leading to a darkener fruit. Originality/value - This research incorporates a quick approach to quality applying image analysis techniques and it will benefit to increase shelf life and consumption of fat-free snack peach and to decrease waste of fruit.","[Pieniazek, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CITEDEF, MINDEF, CINSO,UNIDEF Strateg I&D Def, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Messina, Valeria] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Natl Council Sci & Tech Res, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Messina, V (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Natl Council Sci & Tech Res, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",vmessina@citedef.gob.ar,,,,,,,35,3,3,4,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Through the processing of the results of the theoretical review it became clear that the process of organizational culture change can be directed through three alternative directions. Each direction has unique characteristics but share the common objective of transforming the old organizational culture into a new one. The first direction is based on a specific change program imposed by the management of an organization, so it is named formal/revolutionary. The second direction is not based on a specific program, but on long-term changes based on development, competition and conflict of opposing forces and it is named informal/evolutionary. The third direction is a combination of the previous two thus named hybrid.

The paper establishes an optimal construction timing mechanism based on city economic condition, social condition and regional condition. Using with-or-without high speed railway (Hereinafter referred to as HSR) as the dependent variable, construction possibility is measured accordingly. The empirical results show that, urban economic features are the primary impact factors for high speed railway construction, of which, an average increase of 1% in disposable income will lead to 0.8% increase in possibility of the provision of high speed railways. Quantitatively speaking, RMB 80,000 per capita income is the threshold for the construction of HSR nationwide.

Design/methodology/approach - The data used in this study were based on a sample of 428 customers at Starbucks in Taipei City of Taiwan. Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Findings - The findings reveal that there are four primary dimensions and 13 sub-dimensions of experiential quality in a coffee chain. In addition, the results indicate that affective quality is identified as the most primary dimension of experiential quality perceived by coffee chain customers. Experiential quality significantly influences perceived value and experiential trust, respectively. Also, experiential satisfaction is influenced by perceived value, experiential quality and experiential trust. Furthermore, experiential satisfaction and experiential trust are determinants of experiential loyalty.

There are Strategies of energy development as well as National plans of energy efficiency in Croatia and in other EU countries, which quantify and control the objectives of reducing immediate energy consumption. However, the data on energy efficiency have not been analyzed enough for the purpose of efficient management of energy consumption and cost reduction, while there is a lack of research that use machine learning methods to more precisely detect interdependence among variables, prediction of payback period and other analytics. In this paper, the methodology used in previous research as well as the choice of variables used to model energy efficiency of buildings is analyzed.

In particular, the study focuses on terrorism in Middle Eastern and North African (MENAP) countries and features terrorism incident count data for the period 1998-2012 using negative binomial regression models. In our exogenous model, we find that while youth unemployment tends to increase domestic terrorism, it does not have any significant effect on transnational terrorism. Given concerns about endogeneity of youth unemployment in these models, we use two kinds of corrections-instrumental variables and lagged variables. We control for endogeneity by using military expenditure, under-five mortality rate and foreign direct investment as instruments. We are not able to reject the null hypothesis that youth unemployment is exogenous. Using lagged variables, we find a similar result as noted in the exogenous specifications with regard to the effect of youth unemployment on domestic and transnational terrorism. We also find evidence that domestic terrorism tends to have a positive relationship with press freedom, religious and linguistic fractionalization, and area of the country. Transnational terrorism has a positive association with the quality of democracy and a negative association with political stability and regulatory quality. The amount of natural resources tends to be negatively associated with domestic terrorism and positively associated with transnational terrorism.","[Bagchi, Aniruddha; Paul, Jomon A.] Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Quantitat Anal, 560 Parliament Garden Way, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Paul, JA (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Quantitat Anal, 560 Parliament Garden Way, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",abagchi@kennesaw.edu; jpaul17@kennesaw.edu,"; Bagchi, Aniruddha/A-8641-2009","Paul, Jomon/0000-0002-2853-2151; Bagchi, Aniruddha/0000-0002-7553-4053",,,,,55,26,29,2,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0038-0121,,,SOCIO-ECON PLAN SCI,Socio-Econ.

Using data envelopment analysis, I investigate whether the uptake of clean technology accelerated during this period. I also explore a few other related strategies firms used to reduce emissions. I find that during the scheme firms accelerated the adoption of cleaner technology. Much of this acceleration came from firms lagging in technology catching up with the frontier. Reallocation of operation towards cleaner facilities and opting for more efficient scale sizes also helped the pace of emissions reduction. The pattern shows some variation from industry to industry.

In our model, buyers (sellers) can induce sellers (buyers) to exert more effort by behaving well themselves. We demonstrate that this joint increased effort can improve the utility of both parties and influence the market equilibrium. We also show that bilateral reputation systems, which allow both buyers and sellers to review each other, are more responsive to reciprocity than unilateral reputation systems. By rewarding reciprocal behavior, bilateral reputation systems generate trust among strangers and informally regulate their behavior. We test the predictions of our model using data from Airbnb, a popular peer-to-peer accommodation platform. We show that Airbnb hosts that are more reciprocal receive higher ratings and that higher rated hosts can increase their prices. Therefore, reciprocity affects equilibrium prices on Airbnb through its impact on ratings, as predicted by our analytical framework.","[Proserpio, Davide] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Xu, Wendy] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zervas, Georgios] Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Boston, MA 02215 USA",University of Southern California; Boston University; Boston University,"Zervas, G (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",proserpi@marshall.usc.edu; wendyx@bu.edu; zg@bu.edu,"Zervas, Georgios/GOJ-9424-2022; Proserpio, Davide/P-2684-2019",,,,,,27,48,51,1,76,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

This paper introduces a new analytic tool based on 3-D Sustainability to restructure complex question bundles from policy practice to ease and support practical legal solution prioritization. This approach is applied to the enviro-socio-economic context of forests and their multifunctional use in Japan. First it is shown how the initial problem formulations from practice listed in a table are addressed by the different categories of 3-D Sustainability. Then it is presented how the order of the initial problem formulation was in the table reshaped based on this approach and also which problems were combined for a common search of solutions. In conclusion, the new analytic tool proofed to be applicable also in practice and provided already appropriate support to gain first ideas of solutions including legal ones and their preliminary prioritization, although the work is further in progress. The tool represents a rather simple but effective methodological option to structure complex question bundles and prioritizing solutions also for further legal measures, not only limited to issues of forests or geographically restricted to Japan, and appears to be widely applicable and definitely replicable.","[Mauerhofer, Volker] Meiji Univ, Grad Sch Law, Environm Law Ctr Org Strateg Coordinat Environm R, Chiyoda Ku, B730,14 Gokan,1-1 Kanda Surugadai, Tokyo 1018301, Japan",Meiji University,"Mauerhofer, V (通讯作者)，Meiji Univ, Grad Sch Law, Environm Law Ctr Org Strateg Coordinat Environm R, Chiyoda Ku, B730,14 Gokan,1-1 Kanda Surugadai, Tokyo 1018301, Japan.",volker.mauerhofer@gmx.at,,"Mauerhofer, Volker/0000-0002-5444-2619",PRIMAFF,PRIMAFF,"The authors thank Mr. Takashi Hayashi PhD from PRIMAFF for his great input and for the excellent cooperation with this organization.

For comparison purposes, the static counterpart of the dynamic model is also estimated. The results indicate that, in the dynamic case as well as in the static one, public subsidies are negatively associated with farm technical efficiency. Nevertheless, these linkages are found to be weak, and they are much weaker when dynamic aspects are taken into account.","[Minviel, Jean Joseph] INRA, SMART, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Minviel, Jean Joseph] Univ Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, IHAP, Toulouse, France; [Sipilainen, Timo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland",Universite de Rennes; INRAE; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Ecole Nationale Veterinaire de Toulouse; University of Helsinki,"Sipiläinen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland.",timo.sipilainen@helsinki.fi,,"Sipilainen, Timo/0000-0001-9332-6541",,,,,86,27,27,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

To investigate prioritisation invasive species control, we conducted cost-effectiveness analysis of donkey control on Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands. Successful prioritisation must take account of ecological, economic and social aspects of conservation. Further improvements are possible where impacts are measured across ecosystem boundaries, and management is tied to funding. We modelled the expected ecological impacts of control options, estimated costs, and connected this to the willingness of beneficiaries to fund such projects. Finally we surveyed experts to understand the social acceptability of donkey control. Of the control options, eradication is predicted to have the highest ecological impacts across two ecosystems, and to be cost-effective over the long term. Costs of all control options were within user willingness to pay. Social acceptability was highest for fencing, and lowest for lethal control. Though eradication offers the highest ecological benefits, we suggest that lower initial costs and higher social acceptability make fencing the better choice for Bonaire in the immediate future. In this way we illustrate the importance of considering economic and social impacts alongside the ecological in environmental conservation, and present an integrated application for prioritising conservation choices.","[Roberts, Michaela] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Cresswell, Will] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Hanley, Nick] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",James Hutton Institute; University of St Andrews; University of Glasgow,"Roberts, M (通讯作者)，James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen, Scotland.",Michaela.Roberts@hutton.ac.uk; wrlc@st-andrews.ac.uk; Nicholas.Hanley@gla.ac.uk,"Cresswell, Will/B-1472-2013; Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012","Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499; Cresswell, Will/0000-0002-4684-7624; Roberts, Michaela/0000-0003-1029-8886","University of St Andrews, School of Geography and Geosciences; Van Eeden Foundation [201505]; Sophie Danforth Conservation Biology Fund; Rural & Environment Science &Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government","University of St Andrews, School of Geography and Geosciences; Van Eeden Foundation; Sophie Danforth Conservation Biology Fund; Rural & Environment Science &Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government","This paper was funded by University of St Andrews, School of Geography and Geosciences; Van Eeden Foundation [Project number: 201505]; the Sophie Danforth Conservation Biology Fund; and the Rural & Environment Science &Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government.

If fishers perceive that monitoring schemes do not fulfill their needs, they will resist participating in monitoring. However, fisheries managers worldwide have been making blanket assumptions about the way fishers respond to a monitoring scheme. Although this has been proven to be a common mistake, the literature has remained almost silent about heterogeneity of fisher preferences for monitoring scheme, and how it affects their participation. This study contributes to this knowledge gap by carrying out a choice experiment with artisanal fishers in Vietnam to elicit preferences and value key design elements of monitoring schemes. This is the first study to investigate fishers' preference heterogeneity using an advanced technique - the Scale-adjusted Latent Class model - that accounts for variance in both preferences and scale. We identified five distinct preference classes. Remarkably for a poor community, monetary compensation was found not to be the prime driver of fishers' choices. A one-size-fits-all monitoring scheme is ill-suited to all fishers. The design of flexible schemes can be an effective way to enhance the likelihood of fisher participation and the effectiveness of regulation enforcement.","[Chi Nguyen Thi Quynh; Schilizzi, Steven; Hailu, Atakelty; Iftekhar, Sayed] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Chi Nguyen Thi Quynh] Hue Univ, Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Dev, 99 Ho Dac Di St, Hue City, Vietnam",University of Western Australia; Hue University,"Quynh, CNT (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",thi.q.nguyen@research.uwa.edu.au,"Hailu, Atakelty/AAB-7606-2020; Iftekhar, Sayed/J-5298-2013","Hailu, Atakelty/0000-0002-1024-7520; Nguyen, Chi/0000-0002-7289-4686; Iftekhar, Md Sayed/0000-0002-2827-2943; Schilizzi, Steven/0000-0002-4063-074X",Australian Government; ARC Center of Excellence in Environmental Decisions,Australian Government(Australian Government); ARC Center of Excellence in Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council),"The Australian Government and ARC Center of Excellence in Environmental Decisions are acknowledged for their funding and support.

Therefore, reducing pesticide use requires updating farmers' beliefs about the environmental and health consequences of their actions. Drawing on the theory of positional objectivism developed by Sen, this study seeks to determine the influence of various positional characteristics (gender, education level, socio-cultural factors, etc.) on individual beliefs. In so doing, it uses a recursive bivariate probit model. The model was tested using data collected from a sample of 389 farmers. The results from this model showed that the more farmers' had beliefs about the degradation of water quality, the less they were inclined to use pesticides. These beliefs were based on personal lived experiences and were also formed through interactions with other farmers. Moreover, government agencies and NGOs in regular contact with the farmers played a crucial role in shifting the farmers' observational positions.","[Diendere, Achille] Univ Ouagadougou, 03 BP 7021, Ouagadougou 03, Burkina Faso; [Diendere, Achille] ENSFEA, UMR MA LEREPS 119, Manufacture Tabacs, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31042 Toulouse, France; [Nguyen, Genevieve] Univ Fed Toulouse Midi Pyrenees, UMR AGIR INRA INP ENSAT 1248, BP 32607, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Del Corso, Jean-Pierre; Kephaliacos, Charilaos] Univ Fed Toulouse Midi Pyrenees, UMR MA LEREPS 119, ENSFEA, Manufacture Tabacs, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31042 Toulouse, France",INRAE,"Nguyen, G (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Toulouse Midi Pyrenees, UMR AGIR INRA INP ENSAT 1248, BP 32607, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",genevieve.nguyen@ensat.fr; jean-pierre.del-corso@educagri.fr; charilaos.kephaliacos@educagri.fr,,"DIENDERE, Achille Augustin/0000-0002-5477-0567",,,,,72,14,16,2,34,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We use nationwide cross-sectional household income and expenditure survey 2012/2013 data compiled by the department of census and statistics of Sri Lanka. Employing propensity score matching method to account for selectivity bias, we find that chronic NCD affected households appear to spend significantly higher out-of-pocket health care expenditures and encounter grater economic burden than matched control group despite having universal public health care policy in Sri Lanka. The results also suggest that out-of-pocket expenses on medicines and other pharmaceutical products as well as expenses on medical laboratory tests and other ancillary services are particularly higher for households with chronic NCD patients.

We integrated APSIM-Wheat simulations with economic modelling to evaluate economic benefits of virtual genotypes with different levels of frost tolerance for the Australian wheatbelt. Results highlighted substantial potential national economic benefits, with estimated industry profit increasing by (i) more than 55% for virtual genotypes with improved frost tolerance in silico, by (ii) 115% when sowing date was optimised for virtual frost-tolerant genotypes, and by (iii) an extra 35% (i.e. 150% in total) when using optimal nitrogen application. The total benefit potential was estimated at AUD 1890 million per annum if all these improvements could be combined. Regional benefits varied. In the West, the main benefits arose from improved frost tolerance reducing losses due to direct frost damage and applying additional nitrogen. In the East, earlier sowing allowed by tolerant genotypes resulted in large economic benefit. Overall, the analysis suggests significant economic benefits to the Australian wheat industry, should a source of frost tolerance be found.","[An-Vo, Duc-Anh] Univ Southern Queensland, Computat Engn & Sci Res Ctr, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [An-Vo, Duc-Anh; Mushtaq, Shahbaz] Univ Southern Queensland, Int Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Zheng, Bangyou; Chapman, Scott C.] CSIRO Agr & Food, Queensland Biosci Precinct, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Christopher, Jack T.] Univ Queensland, QAAFI, Queensland Govt Leslie Res Facil, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Chenu, Karine] Univ Queensland, QAAFI, 203 Tor St, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia",University of Southern Queensland; University of Southern Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"An-Vo, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Queensland, Computat Engn & Sci Res Ctr, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",duc-anh.an-vo@usq.edu.au,"Zheng, Bangyou/D-6832-2011; An-Vo, Duc-Anh/JGD-1094-2023; Christopher, John/AAC-6505-2020; Chapman, Scott C/B-9673-2008; Chenu, Karine/A-8967-2009","An-Vo, Duc-Anh/0000-0001-7528-7139; Christopher, John/0000-0001-8873-1059; Chapman, Scott C/0000-0003-4732-8452; Zheng, Bangyou/0000-0003-1551-0970; Chenu, Karine/0000-0001-7273-2057",Grain Research and Development Corporation of Australia (GRDC Projects) [UQ00071]; University of Southern Queensland; University of Queensland; CSIRO,Grain Research and Development Corporation of Australia (GRDC Projects); University of Southern Queensland; University of Queensland(University of Queensland); CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"We would like to acknowledge Mr. Peter Davis and Mr. Thong Nguyen-Huy for their assistance with ArcGIS, Dr. Louis Kouadio for creation of Fig. 2, Professor Roger Stone, Dr. Mandy Christopher and Dr. Troy Frederiks for useful discussion and suggestion.

The improvements include further disaggregation of input-output tables; improvement of life cycle inventory data; hybridization of selected product groups; revaluation of imports at domestic prices; and adding additional information on recycling ratios for metal imports and the energy mix of electricity imports. It is shown that those improvements have a significant impact on RME of imports and exports (a decrease by 48% and 38%, respectively). The article further compares results for RME of imports and exports from the improved Czech RME model and the Eurostat RME country tool. These results differ by 24% and 16%, respectively, on an aggregated level, but the difference is much larger for particular material categories.

In this paper, we examine the entry deterrence/accommodation strategy of an incumbent firm facing a potential entrant that may behave less strategically than the incumbent in the way of conjecturing competitors' actions and beliefs. We adapt the Cognitive Hierarchy model to capture this heterogeneity among the managers of the entrant firm and the incumbent firm. Surprisingly, we show that the incumbent can deter entry by investing in expanding the market size and the competition may increase the incumbent's incentive to invest in market expansion. If entry does occur, the market expansion in our model also benefits entrant comparing to the case without market expansion. This feature of our result sets it apart from the standard result in the entry deterrence literature, which tends to suggest that incumbent has to either over-invest in actions harmful to entrant if entry occurs. In our model investing in expanding the market size makes the entrant to update its belief about the incumbent's strategic thinking capability downward and thus, decreases the entrant's expected profitability, which in turn deters entry. Our research has important implications especially for emerging markets given that the lack of management talent is a particularly severe problem among local firms in emerging markets and multinational companies pioneer in the emerging markets with great market expansion opportunities have to face the potential entry of local companies.","[Chen, Yuxin] New York Univ Shanghai, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Turut, Ozge] Sabanci Univ, Sch Management, Istanbul, Turkey",NYU Shanghai; Sabanci University,"Turut, O (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Sch Management, Istanbul, Turkey.",yc18@nyu.edu; ozget@sabanciuniv.edu,,,,,,,71,2,3,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Four frames were identified: inadequate infrastructure; information deficits; limited planning capacity; and insecure access. In all frames, there was internal coherence among: the problems identified; the form solutions are expected to take; and who should be included and in what roles. All projects claimed to be addressing the needs of farmers vulnerable to climate change. The infrastructure, information, and capacity frames are apolitical and privilege expert knowledge, whereas the access frame places rights and justice issues centrally, and thus holds more potential for addressing the root causes of vulnerabilities and supporting more just distribution of resources and power. Framing can interact with how projects are governed, for example, through assigning roles to actors based on types of solutions prescribed. The extent and direction of frame elaboration also depend on how a project is governed. Meeting local needs and objectives, for example, is constrained when external actors have too much influence in project governing structures, and initial project plans written from afar are followed too narrowly. This study shows that frames are an important part of the governance of adaptation projects.","[Lebel, Louis; Lebel, Phimphakan] Chiang Mai Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Lebel, Louis; Lebel, Phimphakan] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kakonen, Mira] Univ Turku, Turku, Finland; [Dany, Va; Thuon, Try] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Voladet, Saykham] Natl Econ Res Inst, Vang Vieng, Laos",Chiang Mai University; University of Melbourne; University of Turku,"Lebel, L (通讯作者)，Chiang Mai Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Unit Social & Environm Res, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.;Lebel, L (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",llebel@loxinfo.co.th,"Käkönen, Mira/EWC-6958-2022; Lebel, Louis/D-4130-2014","Käkönen, Mira/0000-0002-2350-4020; Lebel, Louis/0000-0001-6187-6418",,,,,57,16,17,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The results show some common patterns and sectorial specificities-CSR engagement in general raises firms' total stock returns and reduces financial risks, but this depends on the area of CSR in which the firms invest.

According to its policy of assimilating colonies, the Japanese government intended to remove the tariffs between Japan and Korea, an aim which had almost been realized by 1923. The removal of the tariff barrier was supposed to improve market access between Japan and Korea. This article explores the implications of this event, focusing on the spatial distribution of economic activity in Japan. The regression results suggest that the integration of the Korean market increased population growth rates more in the regions close to the former border between Japan and Korea than in the other regions. Furthermore, after integration, the regions close to Korea that specialized in the fabric industry, whose products were the primary goods exported from Japan to Korea, experienced more population growth than other regions close to Korea did. These results suggest that market accessibility was indeed a determinant of the spatial distribution of economic activity. Our findings also indicate that the economic effect of colonization on the mainland was spatially heterogeneous and that a spatial viewpoint of the history of imperialism is important.","[Nakajima, Kentaro] Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan; [Okazaki, Tetsuji] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; University of Tokyo,"Nakajima, K (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25380275, 25220502, 26245037, 26285051, 15H03344, 16H02018]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H02009, 15H03344, 26285051, 26245037, 26285053, 16H02018] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Yutaka Arimoto, Asuka Imaizumi, Kaori Ito, Nak Nyeon Kim, Changmin Lee, Tomohiro Machikita, Toshihiro Okubo, Keijiro Otsuka, Masayuki Tanimoto, Eiichi Tomiura, and participants in the Japanese Economic Association meeting at Nagoya University for their helpful comments and discussions.

The vector optimisation, ratio and weighted addition of indicators are the three most prevalent techniques for addressing this need. The vector optimisation evaluates the original indicators independently in a dominance check. No real integration is performed, as the method seeks the optimisation of both indicators at once. This technique reveals win-win situations and can also identify, but not solve, the trade-off situations involved in economy versus ecology. The ratio method establishes a relation among the original indicators. This concept is suitable when one dimension has to be optimised against the other. A number of conceptual problems in the definition of the sense of direction of the ratio method make its interpretation ambiguous. The weighted-addition provides a fair evaluation of the integrated performance of a system, with regard to the decision-maker's preference for ecology and economy. This is crucial to reconcile trade-offs between conflicting criteria. Special attention must be paid to the selection and definition of weighting factors, being a source of potential inconsistencies.","[Ferran, Pau Huguet; Heijungs, Reinout] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci, POB 9518, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Ferran, Pau Huguet] Ecomatters BV, Museumlaan 2, NL-3581 HK Utrecht, Netherlands; [Heijungs, Reinout] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Vogtlander, Joost G.] Delft Univ Technol, Design Sustainabil, Landbergstr 15, NL-2628 CA Delft, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Delft University of Technology,"Ferran, PH (通讯作者)，Ecomatters BV, Museumlaan 2, NL-3581 HK Utrecht, Netherlands.",pau.huguet@ecomatters.es; r.heijungs@vu.nl; joost@vogtlander.nl,"Heijungs, Reinout/K-7855-2013","Heijungs, Reinout/0000-0002-0724-5962",,,,,65,13,13,4,43,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Mechanized restoration treatments can improve forest health and reduce the likelihood of severe wildfire. These treatments produce some timber, and substantial amounts of forest residues that can be used to generate renewable energy and displace fossil fuels. Using the choice modeling method, this study investigates social preferences for generation of energy with woody biomass produced by restoration treatments on public forests in the Mountain West. Both multinomial logit and latent class logit (LCL) models are fit to the data and used to estimate marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for increased amounts of woody biomass energy generation and important associated co-benefits and costs. Positive and statistically significant MWTP is found for the number of homes powered with wood, the extent of healthy forests, avoiding increases in the number of large wildfires, and local air quality.

Obtaining causal and actionable estimates in this context is challenging: Brick and mortar store sales vary widely on a weekly basis; offline media dominate the marketing budget; search advertising and demand are contemporaneously correlated; and estimates have to be credible to overcome agency issues between the online and offline marketing groups. We report on a meta-analysis of a population of 15 independent field experiments, in which 13 well-known U.S. multi-channel retailers spent over $4 Million in incremental search advertising. In test markets category keywords were maintained in positions 1-3 for 76 product categories with no search advertising on these keywords in the control markets. Outcomes measured include sales in the advertised categories, total store sales and Return on Ad Spending. We estimate the average effect of each outcome for this population of experiments using a Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model. The estimates from the HB model provide causal evidence that increasing search engine advertising on broad keywords on Google.com had a positive effect on sales in brick and mortar stores for the advertised categories for this population of retailers. There also was a positive effect on total store sales. Hence the increase in sales in the advertised categories was incremental to the retailer net of any sales borrowed from non-advertised categories. The total store sales increase was a meaningful improvement compared to the baseline sales growth rates. The average Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) is positive, but does not breakeven on average although several retailers achieved or exceeded break-even based only on brick and mortar sales. We examine the robustness of our findings to alternative assumptions about the data specific to this set of experiments. Our estimates suggest online and offline are linked markets, that media planners should account for the offline effects in the planning and execution of search advertising campaigns, and that these effects should be adjusted by category and retailer. Extensive replication and a unique research protocol ensure that our results are general and credible.","[Kalyanam, Kirthi] Santa Clara Univ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [McAteer, John] Google Inc, Menlo Pk, CA 94043 USA; [Marek, Jonathan] Appl Predict Technol, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Hodges, James; Lin, Lifeng] Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Santa Clara University; Google Incorporated; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Kalyanam, K (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",kkalyanam@scu.edu,"Lin, Lifeng/B-6385-2018","Lin, Lifeng/0000-0002-3562-9816",,,,,41,18,18,2,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Beneficiaries receive vouchers for specific foods and brands, selected for their nutritional value. While the program is designed to improve nutrition, it may also induce changes in consumption behavior that persist beyond participation in the program. In this paper, we study how participation in WIC impacts the consumption patterns and preferences during and after the program. Our analysis focuses on the cereal category, in which the subsidized brands must meet certain nutritional guidelines. As expected, during the program households increase cereal consumption volume and shift their choices towards the WIC-approved brands. More interesting is that once households exit the program, the higher category consumption rate and elevated share of WIC brands persist. To understand the behavioral mechanism underlying these consumption patterns, we estimate a choice model and find an increased preference for WIC brands after controlling for state dependence. The evidence suggests that this targeted food subsidy program is effective in creating behavior change that persists even after the incentive is withdrawn.","[Khan, Romana] Grad Sch Business, Mkt, Chicago, IL USA; [Zhu, Ting] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Mkt, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Dhar, Sanjay] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Mkt, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Chicago,"Zhu, T (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Mkt, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",helloromana@gmail.com; zhu640@purdue.edu; sanjay.dhar@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,38,1,2,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The mainstream Sustainable Development discourse, however, insists in upholding the myth of compatibility of current growth-based trajectories with biophysical planetary boundaries. This article explores potentially fertile complementarities among trendy discourses challenging conventional notions of (un)sustainable development-Human Development, Degrowth, and Boon Vivir - and outlines pathways for their realization. Human Development presents relative transformative strengths in political terms, while Degrowth holds keys to unlocking unsustainable material-structural entrenchments of contemporary socio-economic arrangements, and Buen Vivir offers a space of cultural alterity and critique of the Euro-Atlantic cultural constellation. The weaknesses or blind spots ('Achilles heels') of each discourse can be compensated through the strengths of the other ones, creating a dialogical virtuous circle that would open pathways towards a global new Great Transformation. As one of the main existing platforms for pluralist and strong-sustainability discussions, Ecological Economics is in a privileged position to deliberately foster such strategic discursive dialogue. A pathway towards such dialogue is illuminated through a model identifying and articulating key discursive docking points.","[Beling, Adrian E.] FLACSO Argentina, Global Studies Programme, Tucuman 1966,C1050AAC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Vanhulst, Julien] Univ Catolica Maule, Sociol Sch, CEUT, FACSE, Campus San Miguel,Ave San Miguel 3605,Casilla 617, Talca, Chile; [Demaria, Federico] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Res & Degrowth, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Campus UAB, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Rabi, Violeta] Espacio Publ Fdn, Sta Lucia 188, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Carballo, Ana E.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, 420 John Medley Bldg, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Pelenc, Jerome] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IGEAT GEDD, Fonds Rech Sci FRS FNRS, Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universidad Catolica del Maule; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Melbourne; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Beling, AE (通讯作者)，FLACSO Argentina, Global Studies Programme, Tucuman 1966,C1050AAC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Vanhulst, J (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Maule, Sociol Sch, CEUT, FACSE, Campus San Miguel,Ave San Miguel 3605,Casilla 617, Talca, Chile.",abeling@flacso.org.ar; julien@ucm.cl,"Beling, Adrian/GXG-1926-2022; Demaria, Federico/W-8441-2019","Demaria, Federico/0000-0003-4939-8243; Vanhulst, Julien/0000-0001-9644-4543; Rabi Blondel, Violeta/0000-0003-4444-9603; Beling, Adrian E./0000-0002-6658-6310",Paul + Maria Kremer Foundation; FONDECYT [1160186]; European Research Council [GA 695446]; Spanish government [CSO2014-54513-R],Paul + Maria Kremer Foundation; FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Spanish government(Spanish Government),Adrian E.

The analysis is undertaken using a cost-minimisation model for the entire BS region, the BALTCOST model. In the present research, the model has been extended to include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions effects, enabling us to analyse the trade-offs between cost-effective GHG and nutrient load reductions. We run the model for four different scenarios in order to compare the environmental and economic consequences of contrasting strategies: single environmental objective management versus joint implementation strategy. The results show that implementing land-based measures with a sole focus on water quality (to meet the HELCOM's 2013 Baltic Sea Action Plan nutrient abatement targets) can produce climate change mitigation co-benefits equivalent to 2.3% of the 2005 emission level (from agriculture and waste water combined) for the entirety of the BS region. More interestingly, a joint implementation strategy can deliver further climate change mitigation benefit (i.e. up to 5.4%) at a marginal cost that is comparable to mitigation costs reported by other studies for efficient technologies. All in all the results demonstrate that a joint strategy to improve water quality and to reduce climate change is economically beneficial. Our findings show that the cost and the outcome of the implementation vary between countries. This illustrates the need to develop a joint regional policy for water and climate regulation that fully considers the asymmetry in both the expected effects and cost distribution across the countries in the region.","[Nainggolan, Doan; Hasler, Berit; Gyldenkaerne, Steen; Termansen, Mette] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Andersen, Hans E.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci Catchment Sci & Environm Management, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Nainggolan, D (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",dna@envs.au.dk,"Nainggolan, Doan/AAD-7693-2022; Hasler, Berit/F-8309-2015","Nainggolan, Doan/0000-0002-3197-7792; Andersen, Hans Estrup/0000-0003-2465-583X; Termansen, Mette/0000-0003-4875-2810; Hasler, Berit/0000-0003-0433-4086",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) through ECOFINDERS project [264465]; Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change' through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR); BONUS [Art 185]; EU; Danish Innovation Fund,European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) through ECOFINDERS project(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions); Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change' through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR); BONUS; EU(European Union (EU)); Danish Innovation Fund,"The preparation of this paper has been supported by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) through ECOFINDERS project (Grant Agreement No: 264465) and by the Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change' through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR).

Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire based on the Food Choice Questionnaire was applied to 310 consumers: 154 directly to mezcal consumers in three mezcalerias (mezcal bars) and 156 through five social networking communities of mezcal consumers. The data obtained were analysed using multivariate statistics, factor and cluster analysis. Findings The results show that the search for tradition is the determining buying motivation, whereas quality seals do not exert a significant influence. Four profiles of mezcal consumers can be identified according to their consumption patterns: consumer linked to the territory, traditional consumer, consumer in transition and social consumer. The predominant demographic characteristics in the four consumer groups described a male, between 20 and 39 years old, single, childless, with professional education and employed. The overall results reveal a consumer who shares the quality criteria established by mescal-producing communities and is strongly interested in traditionally processed drinks. Originality/value In Mexico, there are two important distilled drinks, tequila and mezcal. There is ample research on the first one, but there is less research on mezcal, despite it has an annual increase of 45 per cent in consumption. Most of the research work has been focused on aspects of diversity, sustainability and productivity, but there are not studies on the factors that affect mezcal consumption. Thus, this paper aims to characterize the consumers of mezcal, based on their motivations.","[Andrea Lopez-Rosas, Carolina; Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Inst Ciencias Agr & Rurales, Toluca, Mexico",,"Espinoza-Ortega, A (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Inst Ciencias Agr & Rurales, Toluca, Mexico.",angelica.cihuatl@gmail.com,"Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica/D-7453-2016","Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica/0000-0002-5968-0587",Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT) [220531CB-2013],Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),This work was undertaken thanks to funding by the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT) through Grant No. 220531CB-2013; and provided a postgraduate studies grant to Carolina Andrea Lopez-Rosas.,,73,7,7,4,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Fiscal consolidation or fiscal adjustment is a term which represents the process of harmonization of public revenues and public expenditures by reducing expenditures and / or increasing revenues. The objective of fiscal consolidation is to reduce the budget deficit and to balance the state budget in each fiscal year. Fiscal adjustment is closely related to austerity policy-reducing the expenditure side of the state budget. The theoretical and empirical literature does not offer a consensus on the impact of these measures. Empirical research offers a rationale for both contractionary and expansionary effect of austerity measures on economic activity. Studies that examine the macroeconomic and fiscal effects of consolidation in developed countries are not frequent either have a long history, while the same effects in the Republic of Croatia are completely uninvestigated. This paper tries to shed some light on this relationship. Additional contribution of this paper relates to the usage of the narrative approach introduced by Romer and Romer (2010). Narrative approach suggests that previous empirical literature has been contaminated by using the indicators for fiscal consolidation which may be subject to serious miss measurements errors leading to a strong bias towards finding an expansionary fiscal consolidation. The research results do not support the expansionary fiscal consolidation hypothesis. Therefore, study suggests that fiscal consolidation, ie. austerity measures in the Republic of Croatia during recent crises was not successful in achieving proclaimed macroeconomic goals such as economic growth.","[Burnac, Pasko; Pecaric, Mario] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Split, Croatia; [Burnac, Pasko; Pecaric, Mario] Cvite Fiskov 5, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Burnac, P (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Split, Croatia.;Burnac, P (通讯作者)，Cvite Fiskov 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",pburnac@efst.hr; mpecaric@efst.hr,"Pecaric, Mario/G-5345-2017",,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,952,959,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900100,0

The aim of this paper is to verify the impact of the municipal secessions on the public expenditures and its association with economies of scale. Based on a Differences-in-Differences methodology, the obtained set of evidence indicates that those municipalities that underwent a secession process increased their per capita capital expenditures by 14.7 percent. In addition, we show evidence that strongly suggests that this increase in expenses can be explained by a reduction in economies of scale and rent-seeking behavior.","[de Andrade Lima, Ricardo Carvalho; Silveira Neto, Raul da Mota] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Econ, Ave Prof Morais Rego,1235 Cidade Univ, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Neto, RDS (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Econ, Ave Prof Morais Rego,1235 Cidade Univ, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil.",rau.silveira@uol.com.br,"de Andrade Lima, Ricardo Carvalho/AAC-4294-2019; Lima, Ricardo/P-7423-2018","de Andrade Lima, Ricardo Carvalho/0000-0003-3239-2371; Silveira Neto, Raul/0000-0003-0328-4806","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, Bolsa de Produtividade); Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia de Pernambuco (FACEPE)","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, Bolsa de Produtividade)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia de Pernambuco (FACEPE)","We would like to thank the two referees, Breno Sampaio, Diego Firmino, Gisleia Benini, and anonymous participants of the XIII Meeting of Brazilian Regional and Urban Studies Association (Brazilian section of RSAI) for their comments on previous draft.

In this environment, the weakened individuals find themselves in search of security references, identity, well-being, dream, emotion and re-enchantment, and consequently they want to return to the past and their memories, yearning for a sense of security and stability. They become nostalgic, seeking values of authenticity. On this basis, enterprises develop a strategy of nostalgic brands that appeal to the emotions, experiences and memories of the consumers. As a result, the basis of relations between the consumer and the brand is nostalgia, which is a positive attitude towards brands that are directly or indirectly related to the consumer's past. The aim of this article is to evaluate the possibilities of implementation of the strategy of nostalgic brand. The results of own empirical research conducted in 2018 on a group of 16 international experts are presented. Both French and Polish experts positively evaluated the potential of nostalgic brands. Some differences in the opinions of the French and Polish experts are visible. The proposition of model of the nostalgic brands positioning is also presented. According to the experts, the basic principle for positioning of the nostalgic brand is having a strong brand history. Nostalgic brands are recommended for the following sectors: fashion, food, cosmetic (especially perfumes), luxury products, automotive, high-tech (music), entertainment and decorative. The results can serve as a guide for managers in implementing the strategy of nostalgic brand and can help identify the crucial elements needed for positioning of the brand based on the nostalgic feelings.","[Grebosz-Krawczyk, Magdalena] Lodz Univ Technol, Lodz, Poland; [Pointet, Jean Marc] Univ Paris Est, ESIEE Paris, Champs Sur Marne, France; [Pointet, Jean Marc] Inst Rech Gest, Paris, France",Lodz University of Technology; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; ESIEE Paris; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Grebosz-Krawczyk, M (通讯作者)，Lodz Univ Technol, Lodz, Poland.",magdalena.grebosz@p.lodz.pl; jm.pointet@esiee.fr,"Grębosz-Krawczyk, Magdalena/M-2012-2018","Grębosz-Krawczyk, Magdalena/0000-0001-8339-2270",,,,,20,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,135,142,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700016,0

Civil War was created by the Educational Games Company of Lebanon and is set during the 1975-1990 Lebanese civil war. The game functions both as a pedagogical instrument, in that players learn about the situation in Lebanon while playing the game, but also as a form of critique, in that its makers are clearly using it as a means of articulating their lived experiences and challenging the dominant narratives around the conflict. We suggest that the game is a rare example of one that is counter ideological in nature, as rather than perpetuating stereotyped views of Middle East conflicts that are constructed and imposed from outside, it instead directly presents the experience of those who are inside. A case study of using the game in the context of a class on postcolonialism is presented and responses by students are analysed. We argue that the active experience of playing a board game is an effective way of engaging students with a topic, and in this case in particular, an effective way of connecting them with the lived experiences of others.","[McCabe, Hugh] Inst Technol Blanchardstown, Dublin, Ireland",Technological University Dublin,"McCabe, H (通讯作者)，Inst Technol Blanchardstown, Dublin, Ireland.",hugh.mccabe@itb.ie,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,2,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,643,651,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-643,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371426.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100062,0

On the distribution of food consumption,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Switzerland; Romania; Consumption distribution; Democratisation; Individualisation,TRANSMISSION; ALCOHOL,"Purpose While economists are increasingly acknowledging the importance of distributional issues, the distribution of the consumption of food items has largely been neglected. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that important insights can be obtained by analysing the distribution of consumption of food products within society. Design/methodology/approach This study was conducted by analysing food consumption in two very different countries: Romania, a middle-income country and Switzerland, one of the most prosperous countries in the world. In order to test the formulated hypotheses, consumption per capita was calculated, as a base for the calculation of the Gini coefficient of consumption for each product. A mixed effect model was applied for total food and for meat, computing the predictors for the variable consumption distribution. Findings Using the Gini coefficients of food and drink item consumption by Romanian and Swiss households, the authors tested the hypothesis that in prosperous middle-income countries the homogeneity of food consumption is growing over time as a sign of consumption democratisation, whereas in high-income countries a growing degree of individualisation is leading to decreasing homogeneity. For meat, the bifurcation of consumption patterns between vegetarians and hedonists leads to a growing Gini coefficient over time for both countries.

Other than the central level, benefits are also provided at the local and regionallevel: by counties, cities and municipalities. According to Sucur et al. (2016), more than 0.4% of GDP is spent on social benefits provided at the local government level. Therefore, it is important to include local government benefits when assessing the overall effectiveness of social benefits. The aim of this paper is to analyse the distributional impact of five types of local social benefits in the four major Croatian cities - Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek - which is a first analysis of this kind for Croatian cities. The year of analysis is 2017 and the benefits under consideration are compensation for housing costs, old-age income supplement, grant for a newborn child, kindergarten subsidy and city transport subsidy. A comparative analysis of benefits and their generosity has been conducted; their income redistribution and poverty reduction effects have also been investigated. The research makes use of miCROmod - the Croatian tax-benefit microsimulation model - which is based on data from the Income and Living Conditions Survey, collected by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics. Hypothetical households, which differ in income levels, structure and age of members, have also been used in the analysis. Results reveal that, in all local benefit systems considered, the most significant resources are devoted to the city transport subsidy and the kindergarten subsidy. If we compare the per capita values, the most generous benefits are found in Zagreb, followed by Rijeka, Osijek and Split. Also, social protection benefits of Zagreb and Rijekaare the most redistributive, achieving the highest poverty headcount reduction.","[Pezer, Martina; Bezeredi, Slavko] Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Leventi, Chrysa] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",Institute of Public Finance; University of Essex,"Pezer, M (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",martina.pezer@ijf.hr; slavko.bezeredi@ijf.hr; cleventi@essex.ac.uk,"Pezer, Martina/ABB-4399-2020; Bezeredi, Slavko/R-6367-2016","Pezer, Martina/0000-0003-3291-220X; Bezeredi, Slavko/0000-0002-9653-0289",Croatian Science Foundation [UIP-2014-09-4096]; Croatian Science Foundation,Croatian Science Foundation; Croatian Science Foundation,The authors wish to thank Ivica Urban for his instructive support during the research.

However, prior to product development, there is a need to know consumer's preferences and target audience. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of different characteristics of Cerrado fruit preserves on the intention to purchase using conjoint analysis. Design/methodology/approach Conjoint analysis evaluated three factors with three levels each, defined by focus group technique. The attributes and levels evaluated were: flavor (marolo, marolo and soursoup, marolo, soursoup and sweet passion fruit), nutritional information (light, diet and absent) and health claims (aids reduction of cardiovascular disease risk; aids reduction of blood cholesterol; aids activation and regulation of the gastrointestinal system). Findings The results of conjoint analysis led to three consumers' groups. Group 1 (majority) were more influenced by flavor (IR=26.5 percent) and nutritional information (IR=59.3 percent). Groups 2 and 3 were greatly influenced by flavor and nutritional information, respectively. Health claims influenced weakly on the intention to purchase regardless the groups. Thus, the concept of Cerrado fruit preserves for each group was different. Originality/value This research contributes to future studies, supporting the development of products based on Cerrado fruits and the variety of products on the market. There are few research works using conjoint analysis to evaluate consumer preferences in the early stages of new product development, which makes this paper even more relevant.","[Rodrigues, Daniela Maria; Rodrigues, Jessica Ferreira; de Souza, Vanessa Rios; Souza Carneiro, Joao de Deus; Borges, Soraia Vilela] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Food Sci, Lavras, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras,"Rodrigues, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Food Sci, Lavras, Brazil.",danielamrodrigues1@gmail.com; danielamrodrigues1@gmail.com; vanessardsouza@gmail.com; joaodedeus@dca.ufla.br; sborges@dca.ufla.br,"Borges, Soraia/AAG-7480-2019","Borges, Soraia/0000-0002-1612-1363",,,,,47,8,9,0,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach Quantitative descriptive analysis by a trained panel (n=8) was performed to obtain the sensory evaluation of the samples. A group of 127 consumers evaluated the samples to indicate their hedonic ratings (nine-point hedonic scale) and emotions (EsSense Profile (R)). Findings The sensory profiles for the three chocolate types showed clear differences. EsSense Profile (R) methodology revealed that each type of chocolate had a distinct emotional profile. The premium brand was associated with the highest number of positive emotions, whereas the traditional brand was associated with most of the negative emotions (bored, disgusted and worried). The drivers of liking were mainly positive and unclassified emotions. Also, gender differences in emotional profiling were found. Practical implications This study illustrates that sensory and emotional measurements can contribute to a better understanding of consumers' hedonic liking. Moreover, gender differences found in emotional profiling should raise awareness that gender may lead to different emotional profiling. These gender differences are of interest to food companies, for instance, for food product development or marketing purposes. Originality/value This study further contributes to the growing literature on emotions. By combining sensory evaluation by a trained panel and emotional profiling by consumers, this paper explores how combining these measurements can contribute to a better understanding of the drivers of liking for milk chocolate.","[Schouteten, Joachim J.; De Pelsmaeker, Sara; Juvinal, Joel; Lagast, Sofie] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium; [Juvinal, Joel] Cent Luzon State Univ, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Palayan, Philippines; [Dewettinck, Koen] Univ Ghent, Dept Food Safety & Food Qual, Ghent, Belgium; [Gellynck, Xavier] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University,"Schouteten, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Ghent, Belgium.",joachim.schouteten@ugent.be,"Juvinal, Joel/JSL-3348-2023; Dewettinck, Koen/AAE-7086-2019; Schouteten, Joachim Jietse/L-2892-2015","Dewettinck, Koen/0000-0002-5984-932X; Schouteten, Joachim Jietse/0000-0002-2030-5608; Juvinal, Joel/0000-0001-7187-781X",,,,,48,15,17,4,65,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

These orthodoxies will aid the reframing of neurodiverse inclusive museum focused interactions and co-creation at the Wellcome Collection Hub. The project, has been undertaken in partnership with the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, Royal College of Art and the Wellcome Collection. Museums are re-considering the future of their offerings in its current format, reach and relevance to today's and tomorrow's society where it has become a shifting landscape moving towards multiple modes and alternative interactions with museum based artefacts and content. With an inclusive design approach which centres non-typical visitors, their experiences and requirements, a positive impact can be better obtained and extended engagement fostered, facilitated and enabled to flourish. This study aims to outline some of the approaches undertaken during the study with insights from relevant experts in the field and target group particularly in respect of non-typical reasons for differentiation, requirements and the rainbow of intelligences [27]. The aim will be to additionally demystify and explain how inclusive engagement approaches centre on non-typical visitors and their experiences, which in turn can have a positive impact on The Wellcome Collection Hub community and relevant stakeholders. This approach helps to further the progress of integrating the neurodiversity paradigm and barriers approach when scaffolding engagement and offerings for non-typical and neurodivergent individuals and groups, through encouraging organisational change and a demystifying of neurodivergent centred engagement and co-creation methods; resulting in a reframing of perspectives around integrated offerings, triangulating approaches in neurodiverse spaces for broader audiences. This may include the shifting of outputs and offerings from those of well-intentioned cautious 'accessibility' to one of ambition, inclusivity and achievability. A central goal of Design and The Mind (DTM) is to demystify the invisible barriers and issues surrounding cognitive, physical, digital access and engagement with the Hub and its resources; this approach formed an integral and positive part of the design process, through spotlighting opportunities for innovation. This paper highlights the most salient observations of a live research project. With a duration of 1 year, commencing in October 2017 and concluding in October 2018 is this project will run parallel to the Wellcome Collection Hub's work but will also be a distinct and separate body of research.","[Trotman, Natasha] Helen Hamlyn Ctr Design, London, England; [Mcginley, Chris] Wellcome Collect, London, England",,"Trotman, N (通讯作者)，Helen Hamlyn Ctr Design, London, England.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,12,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,223,235,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-223,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371478.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100022,0

It is impossible to uniquely define the term cryptocurrency. The English language dictionary Meriam Webster defines it as any form of currency that only exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulating authority but instead uses a decentralized system to record transactions and manage the issuance of new units, and that relies on cryptography to prevent counterfeiting and fraudulent transactions(1). This definition also corresponds to the proclaimed intention of the creators of this new technology. Although there have been earlier, less successful attempts, it is generally accepted that the chronologically first commercially available cryptocurrencybitcoin, was released on the market in early 2009(2). Its mysterious author, Satoshi Nakamoto (for which many believe is the pseudonym behind the entire team of software engineers(3)) published in 2008, a paper laying out the basics of future technology of crypto currencies and their purpose(4). The paper explains that bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution such as bank. The problem of transaction recording and the prevention of multiple use of the same assets is solved by the introduction of block chain technology, a kind of digital accounting chain in which each transaction and each issue is entered cryptographically. It is decentralized and set up so that the processor work (a series of complex mathematical operations performed by different types of microprocessors) required for a digital coin to be forged is inevitably equal to the work required for issuance of each new coin. In this way, the crypto currency becomes essentially resistant to forgery in the form of a false issuance, and the dynamics of its issuance is determined by the complexity of the mathematical problems that are being solved. The chain is also definitely limited, since the number of issued coins is halved every four years, so the total number of issuable bitcoins is mathematically limited to 21 000 0005, which gives the cryptocurrency a self-defined deflationary(6)(or anti-inflationary(7)) framework. It is estimated that the last bit of the coin will be broadcast in 2140(8). The advantages of the cryptocurrencies are numerous. From the privacy and security of transactions, to general global availability, which is of particular importance in a world where about 30% of the population has no access to financial services(9), while Internet access (as the only technical requirement for the use of crypto currencies) is considerably more widespread. Advantages are inevitably accompanied by disadvantages, and in the case of cryptocurrencies, they are not few in number. They relate primarily to the possibility of misuse of a wide range of criminal activities, from money laundering to the pursuit of illegal transactions, arms, narcotics(10), and human trafficking(11). Lately, there has also been a risk of investment fraud related to the opening of crypto funds, to which, among other things, warns the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(12). All this leads to the need to formulate a regulatory framework for digital cash, ie, cryptocurrencies. It is a challenge that is closely followed and interwoven with the problem of their substantive definition, because all the cryptocurrencies are partly, and as we see many entirely, go out of the reduced framework of the digital global substitute of national currencies.","[Zelic, Dragan] Avocat Barreau Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland; [Baros, Nenad] Univ Banja Luka, Fac Econ, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Banja Luka (UNIBL),"Zelic, D (通讯作者)，Avocat Barreau Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland.",dragan.zeljic@zegal.ch; nenad.baros@ef.unibl.org,,,,,,,1,2,2,0,12,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,168,176,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700020,0

The domestic securities on both exchanges showed little sustained integration, even when controlling for the different characteristics of stocks, which implies that the pricing of securities in the US and UK was still being driven by local factors. These results place a limit on the view that the pre-FirstWorldWar period was the first era of globalization in terms of capital markets. However, there was considerable integration between New York and those listings on London that operated internationally. This suggests that the listing of foreign securities may be one of the primary mechanisms driving asset market integration.","[Campbell, Gareth; Rogers, Meeghan] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Campbell, G (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",,,,,,,,110,5,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The methodology is demonstrated through reference to the empirical case of a proposed rail link between Peru and Brazil, which would cut across the Sierra del Divisor of western Amazonia, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and further opening up the Amazon commodity frontier. In order to analyze the potential impacts of the rail-link, four flow-fund representations of economic process (two at the regional and two at the local level) are developed in order to juxtapose two alternative political economy contexts that might govern the rail-link's impacts in the region: one where conservation is prioritized over cash income and one where it is not. Our results suggest that completion of the rail-link under the current political economy context, which prioritizes cash income over conservation, is likely to have substantial negative consequences for forest conservation in both Peru and Brazil and for local livelihoods throughout the region.

We ex-ante elicit individual preferences for deep thermal energy-saving measures in residential buildings by means of a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) among 3161 owner-occupiers and tenants in Germany. Besides room temperature, we include air quality, level of control over the system, noise reduction, and aesthetics of the dwelling as proxies for indoor comfort. Our model also accounts for monthly payments related to the implementation of the measure - and customized based on tenancy status, building type, and size of the dwelling - as well as technical energy cost savings. Econometric estimation provides significant results for most of the parameter coefficients. Findings show that thermal comfort preferences are heterogeneous: 33% of the respondents attach positive values to an increase in indoor temperature that would result from the deep retrofit, providing evidence in favor of a technical rebound effect. While environmental concern explains heterogeneity in most of the attributes, its interaction with thermal comfort is not significant. Thermal comfort turns out to be, however, the least important attribute in the analysis while air quality is the most important one. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In Spain, the most arid country in Europe, studies about water footprint typically just consider domestic, agricultural and industrial water uses, but water requirements for the electricity sector are omitted despite our dependence on thermal power. It has been demonstrated that for each available cooling technology, nuclear needs and consumption of water tend to be larger per MWh generated. We calculate a first approximation to the Spanish nuclear water footprint from 1969 to 2014. Our results show that while water consumed by Spanish nuclear power plants are around 3 m(3) per capita/year, water withdrawals per capita/year are around 70 m(3). Moreover, our analysis allows extracting conclusions focusing on a River Basins approach. What is the water impact of our nuclear power plants? Will water limit our energy future? These are some of the issues at stake. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Among the various threats fisheries in the southwest coastal region will face because of climate change, adverse impacts from increased aquatic salinity caused by sea level rise will be one of the greatest challenges. This paper investigates possible impacts of climate change on aquatic salinity, fish species habitats, and poor communities using the salinity tolerance ranges of 83 fish species consumed in the region and aquatic salinity in 27 alternative scenarios of climate change in 2050. The results provide striking evidence that projected aquatic salinization may have an especially negative impact on poor households in the region. The estimates indicate that areas with poor populations that lose species are about six times more prevalent than areas gaining species.

In this article I assess the differences in the state intervention in wine markets in two major wine-producing countries, France and Spain, and try to explain the reasons for them. To do so, I examine the specific features of their markets and productive systems, the winegrowers' collective action, and the political framework in each country. I argue that the differences are related to (a) the strength and cohesion of the winegrowers' lobby, (b) the winegrowers' relationship with political parties and (c) the state's ability to respond to their demands.","[Planas, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Hist Econ, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Planas, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Hist Econ, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",j.planas@ub.edu,"Planas, Jordi/V-8867-2017","Planas, Jordi/0000-0002-9155-0870",Spanish government [HAR2015-69620-C2-1-P]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014-SGR-1345],Spanish government(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya),The author is grateful for all the comments that he received from participants at these workshops.

Members report their birding excursions both their destinations and the numbers and types of birds they observe on each trip. Based on home address information, we calculate travel costs for each birder for trips to alternative birding hotspots. We focus on the Pacific Northwest U.S. (Washington and Oregon states). Many birders are listers who seek to maximize the cumulative number of species they have been able to see, and each hotspot is characterized by the number of bird species expected to be present. In a random utility model of destination site choice, we allow for seasonal as well as random heterogeneity in the marginal utility per bird species. For this population of birders, marginal WTP for an additional bird species is highest in June when birds are in their mating-season plumage (at more than $3 per species per trip). Total WTP for a birding outing also depends on other site attributes (including ecological management regime, the possible presence of endangered bird species, urban/rural location, ecological region and relative congestion/popularity). Evidence of variety-seeking can also be discerned in birders' destination choices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This is after controlling for state-specific heterogeneity, and a range of environmental and natural amenities, including the presence of state parks, proximity to national parks, and outdoor recreation resources in the county, all of which have the expected negative correlation with BMI.

This study argues that Halal food certificate implementation positively influences business performance. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 210 Halal certified food manufacturing companies in Malaysia participated in the study. Data were gathered through a structured questionnaire and were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling technique. Findings - The study proved that HFC has a positive relationship with operational performance. Additionally, operational performance mediates the relationship between HFC and financial performance. Altogether, this signifies that Halal food certificate implementation positively influences business performance. Practical implications - By linking HFC and business performance, managers may be aware of the significant role of HFC in influencing operational and financial performance. It would entice more food companies to become Halal certified that opens up an opportunity to a lucrative Halal food industry. It also empirically justifies that a religion-based food certification has the ability to influence business performance, consistent with other established food standards such as ISO 22000 or HACCP. Originality/value - Although numerous studies have concentrated on well-established food certifications, the expanding Muslim population, rising demand for Halal food, and lucrative Halal food market have raised the attention on HFC research among academicians and practitioners. This research is able to highlight the importance of implementing HFC among food companies as it could potentially lead to superior business outcomes.","[Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan; Chin, Thoo Ai] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Fischer, Johan] Roskilde Univ, Roskilde, Denmark",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Roskilde University,"Ab Talib, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Johor Baharu, Malaysia.",msyazwan79@live.utm.my,"Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan/U-8627-2018; Fischer, Johan/Y-4327-2018","Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan/0000-0001-8190-9096; Fischer, Johan/0000-0001-8182-3284",,,,,48,20,20,2,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The aim of this research was to predict sensory and microbiological aspects of this product based on physicochemical properties during storage at 4 and 10 degrees C. Products were analysed at sampling times chosen on the basis of five sensory visual quality (VQ) levels. Samples scoring VQ5 and VQ4 were considered acceptable (Ac), whereas the remaining scores were defined as unacceptable (UAc). Each VQ level was then characterized for physico-chemical (colour, ammonium, antioxidant activity, electrolytic leakage, phenols, chlorophyll, respiratory activity) and microbiological (total viable count, Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae, lactic acid bacteria, yeast and moulds) parameters. UAc samples also proved unsatisfactory from a microbiological point of view (total viable count >= 10(7) CFU g(-1)). Partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis allowed us to identify colour change (Delta E*) and total chlorophyll (TC) as suitable variables to predict the microbial load (TVC) associated with each sensory VQ level. The model obtained showed R-CV(2)=0.94, RMSECV=0.41 and a relative error of 5.61%. In conclusion, the use of these parameters as quality indicators could be a new strategy for discriminating green leafy vegetables into acceptable or unacceptable products.","[Cefola, M.; Pace, B.; Capotorto, I.; Di Biase, M.; Colelli, G.; Lavermicocca, P.; Valerio, F.] CNR Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Sci Food Prod, Bari, Italy; [Capotorto, I.; Amodio, M.

Namely, we consider a sample of municipalities located on either side of the historical border of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, whose legacy is considered, from Putnam onwards, to be a prime-facie cause of Southern Italy's underdevelopment. Having been part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies is associated with a negative impact of development policies, but only when the allocation of development funds through the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno suffered from low quality of governance and was driven by political considerations rather than by efficiency ones.","[d'Adda, Giovanna] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn DIG, Via Lambrischini 4b, Milan, Italy; [de Blasio, Guido] Bank Italy, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Nazl 91, Rome, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"d'Adda, G (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn DIG, Via Lambrischini 4b, Milan, Italy.",giovanna.dadda@polimi.it; guido.deblasio@bancaditalia.it,,"d'ADDA, GIOVANNA/0000-0002-2327-8481",,,,,42,11,12,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Food defence methods aim to prevent or mitigate deliberate attacks on the food supply chain but are not a legal requirement. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how proactive and reactive food defence practices can help prevent or mitigate malicious attacks on the food chain and also food fraud, food crime and food safety. The authors look at how food defence differs from food safety and how it contributes to food supply chain integrity. Design/methodology/approach - Food defence has been the focus of two different EU FP7 security projects, EDEN and SNIFFER. Food industry stakeholders participated in workshops and demonstrations on food defence and relevant technology was tested in different food production scenarios. Findings - Food industry end-users reported a lack of knowledge regarding food defence practices. They wished for further guidelines and training on risk assessment as well as access to validated test methods. Novel detection tools and methods showed promise with authentication, identification, measurement, assessment and control at multiple levels of the food supply chain prior to distribution and retail. Practical implications - The prevention of a contamination incident, prior to retail, costs less than dealing with a large foodborne disease outbreak. Food defence should therefore be integral to food supply chain integrity and not just an afterthought in the wake of an incident. Originality/value - It is argued that food defence practices have a vital role to play across the board in unintentional and intentional food contamination incidents. The application of these methods can help ensure food supply chain integrity.","[Davidson, Rebecca K.; Madslien, Elisabeth H.] Norwegian Def Res Estab FFI, Kjeller, Norway; [Antunes, Wilson] Minist Def Nacl LBDB CINAMIL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Belenguer, Jose] AINIA, Valencia, Spain; [Gerevini, Marco; Prugger, Raffaello] Tecnoalimenti TCA, Milan, Italy; [Perez, Tomas Torroba] Univ Burgos, Burgos, Spain",Norwegian Defence Research Establishment; Universidad de Burgos,"Davidson, RK (通讯作者)，Norwegian Def Res Estab FFI, Kjeller, Norway.",rebecca.davidson@ffi.no,"Belenguer, José/L-9696-2016; Madslien, Elisabeth Henie/AAY-6025-2021","Madslien, Elisabeth Henie/0000-0002-1161-1208; Antunes, Wilson/0000-0002-8050-2304","European Union (EU) Seventh Framework Programme projects (FP7) [313077, 312411]",European Union (EU) Seventh Framework Programme projects (FP7),"This work was funded by two European Union (EU) Seventh Framework Programme projects (FP7/2007-2013): EDEN: End-User Driven Demo for CBRNe, under Grant Agreement no. 313077, and SNIFFER: Sensory devices network for food supply chain security, under Grant Agreement no. 312411.

Revenues reached by different countries owing to the inflow of foreign tourists have positive effects on employment growth, income of residents and infrastructure development. Understanding the motivational factors of foreign tourists should serve as a basis for developing strategies to attract foreign tourists that would be successful. Knowledge about factors that are statistically significant for the selection of eastern Croatia as a destination for foreign tourists could greatly contribute to the understanding of their motivation. This paper explored the factors that determine foreign tourist demand from major emitting countries for tourists who visit eastern Croatia. In the paper tourist demand is approximated by the number of overnight stays of foreign tourists in five Slavonian counties. Independent variables in the model were incomes of tourists, travel costs, accommodation capacity, exchange rate, weather conditions and the level of prices in the destination. Econometric models of foreign tourist demand were estimated for the five most common emitting countries for the period from 1995 to 2014, and the results were accordingly interpreted. The analysis showed that tourist demand from Austria and Germany depends on the accommodation capacity, those from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Italy depends on their own income, and those from Slovenia depends both on their own income and accommodation capacity. The research results provide those employed in the tourism sector with additional insights into the behavior of foreign tourists, and also how and which variables should be influenced in order to attract more tourists from the countries included in the analysis. The costs of travel and weather conditions did not prove to be significant determinants of tourist demand.","[Devcic, Kristina; Prazic, Ivana Tonkovic] Polytech Nikola Tesla, Bana Ivana Karlovica 16, Gospic 53000, Croatia; [Beljo, Ivana] Polytech Sibenik, Trg Andrije Hebranga 11, Shibenik 22000, Croatia",,"Devcic, K (通讯作者)，Polytech Nikola Tesla, Bana Ivana Karlovica 16, Gospic 53000, Croatia.",kdevcic@velegs-nikolatesla.hr; ibeljo@vus.hr; itonkovic-prazic@velegs-nikolatesla.hr,"Beljo, Ivana/ISB-0592-2023",,,,,,20,0,0,1,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,146,154,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500013,0

In this evolutive process the agricultural stage was replaced by the industrial stage, whereas today the human society is transitioning towards the new information era, i.e. knowledge era. Land and livestock were primary production resources in the agricultural period, and raw materials in the industrial period of human society development. Similarly, data, information and knowledge are becoming key resources in the knowledge period. Essential characteristics of the knowledge era are provided by knowledge economy in which economic success is based on successful knowledge application. Knowledge needs to be managed on personal level, i.e. business entity level, but also on the level of a society. Eastern Croatia is geographically and in terms of human resources a society which is, according to European standards, economically underdeveloped. The application of a knowledge management concept, i.e. knowledge society, seems to be a logical solution to the problem of economic development, both for the eastern Croatia and the Croatian economy as a whole. Thus, in the focus of the conducted research was the problem of finding a general knowledge management model that would enable economic development of eastern Croatia. Before defining a model solution of the outlined problem according to the research goals, the current social transition and the role of knowledge as a developmental resource of the new era were analysed. The general descriptive structural model of knowledge management in the function of economic development of eastern Croatia is defined as a solution to the problem. The presented model is a starting point for further research where the solutions for the complete application of the presented general descriptive knowledge management model need to be found, in order to ensure successful transition of eastern Croatia from the industrial to the knowledge era.","[Dukic, Branimir; Dugandzic, Sanja] Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek, Croatia; [Dukic, Stojanka] DuxMission Doo Osijek, Dalmatinska 21, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Dukic, B (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek, Croatia.",bdukic@efos.hr; dux-mission@os.t-com.hr; dsanja@efos.hr,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,300,309,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500027,0

The aim of this study was to examine the differences between young girls with different BMI and physical self-concept in physical activity and dieting. This study also investigated the contributions of BMI, physical activity and dieting on the body dissatisfaction. Socio-cultural model of body dissatisfaction assumes that the deviation of BMI from the thin-ideal will lead to dieting, but it also assumes that internalizing the athletic-ideal will lead to increased physical activity in order to get closer to the ideal body shape. This study included 306 first and third grades female high school students in Nasice. Four groups were compared: a) lower BMI and lower physical self-concept (n=41), b) lower BMI and higher physical self-concept (n=66), c) higher BMI and lower physical self-concept (n=66) and d) higher BMI and higher physical self-concept (n=44). Four groups do not differ in physical activity (F-3,F-213 =1.34; p> 0.10), but differ in the dieting (F-3,F-213=12.01; p< 0.001). Groups with higher BMI and lower physical self-concept diet significantly more than girls from the two groups with a lower BMI. The results have shown that BMI, physical activity and dieting explain 52% of variance of body dissatisfaction. Dieting, as the most important predictor, explained 39.4%, while BMI explained 11%, and physical activity about 2% of the variance of body dissatisfaction. The results suggest internalizing the thin-ideal and dieting as a strategy to dismiss body dissatisfaction. Absence of differences in the physical activity among groups, as well as a small contribution of physical activity in explaining body dissatisfaction, indicates the need to promote the importance of physical activity as a healthy strategy to regulate BMI.","[Duvnjak, Ivana; Sincek, Daniela] Fac Humanities & Social Sci Osijek, L Jagera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Duvnjak, I (通讯作者)，Fac Humanities & Social Sci Osijek, L Jagera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",iduvnjak@ffos.hr; dsincek@ffos.hr; marinamatkovic05@gmail.com,"Šincek, Daniela/IWM-4331-2023; Šincek, Daniela/I-6145-2018; Duvnjak, Ivana/AAQ-3340-2020","Šincek, Daniela/0000-0001-8011-3280; Duvnjak, Ivana/0000-0001-8420-2125",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,310,317,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500028,0

Environment protection is becoming increasingly important and it is part of European Union policies toward better use of natural resources and better waste management. We have witnessed proposing and approving of several EU policies and regulative regarding use of plastic materials in packaging, as one of the main parts of circular economy waste management, and use of recycled materials. The paper analyses legal regulation of waste management in European Union and the Republic of Croatia.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through 105 semi-structured interviews. Findings - While food regulators and representatives of the food industry identify advantages of social media including two-way communication and speed of transmission of information, they maintain concerns about information provided via social media fearing the potential for loss of control of the information and sensationalism. There is evidence, however, that media actors use social media to identify food stories, to find sources, gauge public opinion and to provide a human interest angle. Practical implications - While there are commonalities between the three groups, concerns with social media reflect professional roles. Food regulators need to be aware of how media actors use social media and maintain a social media presence. Further, they need to monitor other sources to maintain consumer trust.

Design/methodology/approach - Cookies were prepared from blends of whole flours of wheat, oats, maize and full fat soyabean. Whole wheat and oat flours were blend in different proportions (100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60 and 20:80 and 0:100, wheat: oat, w/w) and supplemented with quality protein maize (QPM) and full fat soyabean flours, at 10 per cent (w/w) each, of the total blend. Cookies were studied for their physical attributes, proximate and nutritional compositions. A significant (p = 0.05) increase in spread ratio, crude protein, crude fat and crude fibre contents of the cookies was observed with increase in the proportion of oat flour in the blend. Findings - Cookies prepared from blend containing QPM and soyabean flours had higher antioxidant activity than control whole wheat cookies. An increase in extractable beta-glucan content and in-vitro protein digestibility was also observed with the increase in the proportion of oat flour. The highest overall acceptability was observed for cookies prepared from blends having a wheat-oat proportion of 60:40. These cookies also had a 17.5 per cent higher genistein content as compared to their raw flour blend. Higher genistein levels were observed in the composite cookies.

Design/methodology/approach - Across the two experiments conducted for this research, the authors examine the moderating effects of self-perceived health status and individuals' need for cognition on health-claim framing. Findings - The results indicate that personal differences moderate the effects of health- claim framing on consumers' food-product evaluation. Consumers with poor health status evaluate food product more favorably when the reduced-disease-risk claims are offered. However, consumers with good health status evaluate food product similarly between the two health claims. Moreover, consumers with a high need for cognition evaluate food product more favorably when the reduced-disease-risk claims are used, whereas consumers with a low need for cognition evaluate food product more favorably when the enhance function claims are used. Practical implications - This research provides that reduced-disease-risk claims may be the better communication message used to persuade consumers no matter they rate themselves as poor health status or good health status. Moreover, the results of the present research also indicate the importance of market segmentation.

Contents of these reports focus on the company's Triple Bottom Line (TBL) as a model that obtains the balance between financial, environmental and social performances of business. By achieving this balance, companies successfully respond to striving demands of sustainable development. Significant governmental and non-governmental initiatives and organizations around the world have already recognized the importance of mandatory CSR reporting, and therefore advocate its standardization process. This is a proper response to the growing demands of managers and stakeholders for prompt and transparent information's regarding the company triple bottom line. The contents and the process of creating and publishing a CSR report require development of such databases that can provide integral analysis of company financial, environmental and social impacts. Adequate reporting process can be implemented only thru continuous communication of a company with its internal and external stakeholders. In this paper, authors determine the scientific aspects of CSR communication spectrum between a company and its stakeholders. Therefore, the aim of their research is to promote CSR reporting as a relevant mean of stakeholder management and evaluation of business sustainability.","[Miljenovic, Dejan] Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia; [Gorse, Mateja] Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Opatija, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Miljenovic, D (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia.",dejan.miljenovic@efri.hr; mateja3007@gmail.com,"Miljenović, Dejan/R-8088-2018",,,,,,19,0,0,0,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,731,741,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500071,0

The usual approach often addresses the problem of employability on policy level (governments' policy and regulation) or from the point of an individual's acquisition and preservation of skills demanded by prospective employers. In this paper, we turn to the role of employers in that process and suggest a five levels scale model to evaluate the complexity and strength of employer to employee relations regarding acquiring competencies and developing personal professional career paths. Our five-level scale model also serves as indicator of firm's level of interference with directing its personnel towards certain strategic direction and shaping their competences towards future occupational needs. We identify five levels in organization's HRM policies as follows: searching for observable physical and intellectual attributes of employees and selecting employees with a priori superb characteristics; looking for inborn predispositions that are easily upgraded with additional trainings; shaping suitable social context and developing employees into it; governing continuous improvement and social engineering through organizational culture and institutional rules; and finally, managing psychological contracts between individuals and organization. We analyze survey data provided by professionals on their expectation concerning employees' skills and competencies and expected means of acquiring future skills needed to perform work activities and improve the organization. We find that firms differ in their engagement in shaping their employees' competences, depending on firm size and ownership form; however, there are nodifferencesconcerning the perceptions of skills expected from their employees.","[Mrak, Marija Kastelan; Sokolic, Danijela] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Mrak, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",marija.kastelan.mrak@efri.hr; danijela.sokolic@efri.hr,"Sokolic, Danijela/N-9229-2017; Kaštelan Mrak, Marija/AFL-7893-2022; Kaštelan Mrak, Marija/AAG-7846-2022","Sokolic, Danijela/0000-0002-6531-8082; Kaštelan Mrak, Marija/0000-0001-8247-7467; Kaštelan Mrak, Marija/0000-0001-8247-7467",,,,,10,1,1,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,335,344,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500031,0

Current literature reports a limited number of studies about consumers' preferences towards these products. In particular, it lacks of studies focussed on fresh-cut salads and based on market data. In this paper, a study on consumer preferences towards the main attributes of Italian fresh-cut salads is proposed. More specifically the investigation is focussed on attributes assessable by consumers before purchase such as assortment, tenderness, product preparation and vegetable variety together with brand, size and type of packaging, presence of organic certification, promotion and product price. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate how much Italian consumers pay for those attributes with the aim to understand how much profitable could be different strategies in the sector. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on IRI-Infoscan scanner data, consisting of 881 fresh-cut products. The impact of each attributes on pricing is measured by means of a hedonic price model. Findings - Main results show that, in Italy, fresh-cut salad price is greatly affected by tenderness, product preparation, assortment, brand, presence of organic certification, packaging attributes and vegetable variety. Practical implications - Findings offer to producers the possibility to set up products by composing the mix of attributes that gives back the highest price. In addition, they provide some insights to define manufacturer's strategies. Originality/value - This paper represents a novelty in economic literature because it can be considered an example of consumer preferences analysis towards the different attributes of fresh-cut vegetables based on real market data.","[Pilone, Vittoria; Stasi, Antonio; Baselice, Antonio] Univ Foggia, Dept Sci Agr Food & Environm SAFE, Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia,"Pilone, V (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Sci Agr Food & Environm SAFE, Foggia, Italy.",vittoria.pilone@unifg.it,"stasi, antonio/A-1243-2016","stasi, antonio/0000-0003-1617-4606; Pilone, Vittoria/0000-0001-6343-3426",,,,,76,16,16,2,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Four different sausage formulations were produced with different formulations containing 0(KA0), 2 (KA2), 4 (KA4) and 6 per cent (KA6) of KA. Findings - Results have shown that the addition of KA increased the hardness and chewiness parameters, water holding capacity, redness (a*-value) and the pH value of the MDCM sausages (p < 0.05). The adhesiveness, cohesiveness and springiness of all formulations showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). The addition of KA reduced the cooking loss of MDCM sausages (p < 0.05). However, the addition of KA made the sausages darker (lower L*-value) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the addition of KA aided in the reduction of lipid oxidation in the MDCM sausages when they were refrigerated at a temperature of 4 degrees C for 12 days. The MDCM sausages that contained KA had lower two-thiobarbituric acid test values compared to the control sample (p < 0.05) during the 12 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Originality/value - The addition of KA seaweed can potentially produce better quality MDCM sausages in terms of physicochemical properties and reduce the rate of lipid oxidation.","[Pindi, Wolyna; Mah, Hin Wai; Munsu, Elisha; Ab Wahab, Noorakmar] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Food Sci & Nutr, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Sabah,"Pindi, W (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Food Sci & Nutr, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.",woly@ums.edu.my,"Pindi, Wolyna/AAR-2976-2020","PINDI, WOLYNA/0000-0002-3313-0608; AB WAHAB, NOORAKMAR/0000-0002-0458-431X",Ministry Higher Education of Malaysia [RAG0069-STWN-2015]; Universiti Malaysia Sabah [SLB0082-STWN-2014],Ministry Higher Education of Malaysia; Universiti Malaysia Sabah,This research was supported under the projects Research Acculturation Grant Scheme (RAG0069-STWN-2015) by Ministry Higher Education of Malaysia and SLB0082-STWN-2014 by Universiti Malaysia Sabah.,,57,17,17,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the effects of company choices about palm oil on consumer demand and company performance. Design/methodology/approach - The data collection covers two years, 2013 and 2014. Financial data from the AIDA database are matched with information on palm oil certification and replacement. A panel data analysis is conducted to evaluate the impacts of certification and replacement on consumer demand and company performance. Findings - Considering consumer demand, positive significances have been found in terms of both palm oil certification and replacement. With regard to performance, there are positive significances only for palm oil replacement. Research limitations/implications - The research is a first step in the study of palm oil phenomenon. Furthermore, the study takes into consideration only one specific industry that uses palm oil as an ingredient. Practical implications - There is a consumer demand expression for these two kinds of disclosures, considered in terms of both environmental (certification) and health (replacement) issues. However, only palm oil replacement leads to improved performance. Originality/value - This study considers the market effects of the labelling programme through a new empirical application related to the palm oil issue. Starting from palm oil concerns, a new way through which an increase in the provision of information to consumers is likely to impact the behaviour of companies is pointed out.","[Riganelli, Chiara; Marchini, Andrea] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambiental, Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Riganelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambiental, Perugia, Italy.",chiara.riganelli@gmail.com,"Marchini, Andrea/D-6539-2012","Riganelli, Chiara/0000-0002-7401-673X",,,,,60,10,10,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper highlights the first stage of research study through current world literature and a critical review as inputs of research findings. The research applies a descriptive research framework within a semi-structured questionnaire survey method which was implemented within three different companies, the baked goods manufacturer, the cafe purchasing the baked foods products and the end users, hence covering the overall supply chain cycle and its entities. Findings - The research study identified that one of the major challenges facing the baked food company when adopting the lean practices was the lack of commitment from the top management, continuous training, and hence, employee engagement measures were necessary towards performance improvement of the organisation. Originality/value - The research novelty is to develop an early understanding of lean production practices within the baked goods manufacturer and its upstream and downstream stakeholders. This paper would be considered by the food manufacturer companies in order to require their key suppliers to adopt the most common lean tools identified as Just in Time, Value Steam Mapping and the 5S methods.","[Shah, Satya R.] Univ Greenwich, Dept Appl Engn & Management, Chatham, Kent, England; [Ganji, Elmira Naghi] Univ Greenwich, Fac Engn & Sci, Chatham, Kent, England",University of Greenwich; University of Greenwich,"Shah, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Dept Appl Engn & Management, Chatham, Kent, England.",s.shah@gre.ac.uk,"Shah, Satya/Q-6976-2018; Shah, Satya/M-9079-2019","Shah, Satya/0000-0001-5575-7682; Shah, Satya/0000-0001-5575-7682",,,,,61,20,21,2,67,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors use game theory to model the strategic use of social media by firms producing high-value food products. The authors test the predictions of the theoretical model by means of a survey of 722 randomly selected Italian food consumers using an online questionnaire. Findings - The model predicts that, as social media become more and more influential, consumers using the new media become more informed, and their concern about food quality attributes increases. At the same time, the consumers using mass media only receive less information and they prefer cheaper products to the high value one. As a result, the emergence of social media favours market segmentation and the hypotheses tested were: Social consumers are, on average, more informed than mass consumers and more concerned about environmental issues than mass consumers. The data support the theoretical model.

Successful micro-enterprise generates income for owners and employees, allows self-employment and employment of family members of the enterprise's owner, and thus affects the creation of favourable macroeconomic conditions that allow more simulative entrepreneurial environment. Because of this, it is essential in the modern business conditions that each micro-enterprise, with the traditional performance management methods, uses modern strategic management methods with an aim of a successful business in order to generate incomes and profits. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the level of application of relevant indicators, methods and models for the purposes of strategic performance management in micro-enterprises in the Republic of Croatia. For the implementation of empirical research, micro-enterprises in the region of Slavonia and Baranja were selected as a study population. A quantitative research was conducted on a sample of 112 micro-enterprises. For processing and analysing the collected data, appropriate mathematical and statistical methods were used. The results confirmed the initial assumption that micro-enterprises feature low level of use of appropriate indicators, methods and models for the purposes of business performance strategic management. The results represent outstanding scientific contribution because in the Republic of Croatia there is no research on business performance strategic management in micro-enterprises.

The main aim of this study was to achieve successful formation of cheese curd with fully coconut milk aroma and flavor. Design/methodology/approach - Fresh cheese made from different types of coconut milk mixed with cow's milk (50:50) were developed and compared to fresh cheese made from cow's milk (100:0). Physicochemical analysis including pH, acidity, percentage of yield, protein and fat content, texture analysis and sensory evaluation has been performed. The nine-point hedonic preference test (n = 35) and consumer testing (n = 235) were conducted. Findings - In comparison, fresh cheese made with the presence of coconut milk (50:50) had higher fat content, lower crude protein content, higher firmness, and adhesiveness than those made from cow's milk alone (0:100). The cheese with the presence of coconut milk was liked better by consumers (7.35 out of 9). Rehydrated coconut milk was mostly preferred to use among all three types of coconut milk which showed firmer texture and admired flavor. The texture of the developed product was proved to be similar to commercial cottage cheese. Using the rehydrated coconut milk in the formulation gave successful results for making fresh coconut milk cheese, which has also not been used previously in any research. Research limitations/implications - In this paper, the effect of process conditions on the quality of cheese curd formation was not yet investigated and discussed. The process parameters including heat treatment and renneting time should be further studied.

In this paper we focus on the phenomenon of transformative tourism and how it is increasingly claimed to be one of the catalysts in assisting this shift, as travellers are increasingly using their holidays to reflect upon their lives and reinvent the world in which they live (Ateljevic, Sheldon and Tomljenovic, 2016). We specifically report on one aspect of our longitudinal research project (funded by the Croatian Science Foundation, see www. transtourism. com) through which we have been investigating a group of social entrepreneurs involved in transformative tourism practices (in the UK, Germany, Hungary and Croatia). Our research has shown that these entrepreneurs who, either out of their significant individual life change and/or the heightened awareness of planetary crisis, are prompted to change their lifestyles. They are often urban professionals who consequently set up different forms of transformative and mostly rural tourism social enterprises that resonate with the principles of regenerative/restorative economics.","[Tomljenovic, Renata; Ateljevic, Irena] Inst Tourism, Vrhovec 5, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute for Tourism - Croatia,"Tomljenovic, R (通讯作者)，Inst Tourism, Vrhovec 5, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",renata.tomljenovic@iztzg.hr; irena.ateljevic@iztzg.hr,,,Croatian Science Foundation [6164],Croatian Science Foundation,"This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation, under the project no. 6164.",,19,1,1,1,10,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,577,586,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500055,0

Exactly due to affinities and preferences of modern tourism consumers, it comes to the development of the selective types of tourism, which serve as the offset to the product of mass tourism, which is usually based on the outdated touristic platform 3S (sun, sea, sand). Cultural tourism is surely one of these selective types. Cultural tourism covers a wide range of activities and contents and has a strong influence on the growth and development of tourist destinations. It should be noted that diversity of offer in the cultural tourism is a by-product of motives, desires, and needs of cultural tourists, on whom the elements of the offer in cultural tourism are usually based. Quality and quantity analysis show that the cultural product expands, and during that process the events with specific traditional character stand out as one of the propulsive appealing elements of the touristic product. Even though the cultural tourism in an academic society is a relatively new term, there are many confusing definitions that cause contradictions within the participants that are directly or indirectly involved in its development. Because of that, this paper will provide a concise analysis of this selective type of tourism by using scientific methods (e.g. analysis and synthesis, historical and descriptive methods), with the aim of assurance of relevant and more competent theoretical findings. In order to bring up the importance of the cultural tourism, i.e. of culturally-traditional events, a primary empirical research will be conducted on a representative sample using the method of the in-depth interview. The aim of the empirical part of the paper is to define the main guidelines of the touristic development of culturally-traditional event Mladost i ljepota Slavonije, with the goal of promotion of cultural tourism in the eastern part of Croatia.","[Tubic, Dejan; Skrget, Daila; Jakovic, Bozidar] Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia",,"Tubic, D (通讯作者)，Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33000, Croatia.",dejan.tubic@vsmti.hr; dalia.skrget@gmail.com; bozidar.jakovic@vsmti.hr,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,947,956,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500092,0

While there is a strand of economic research that uses proxy measures of risk and time preference that are not derived from an incentivized experiment and personality traits at the same time, and a considerably smaller one that uses experimentally elicited measures of risk and time preference only, the innovation of my work is to use experimentally elicited, incentivized preference measures and personality traits at the same time to explain a range of health behaviors. Findings presented in this paper suggest that personality traits seem to be more important determinants of health behaviors than economic preference parameters, and that Big Five personality traits, especially Agreeableness, seem to be more important determinants than the Grit score developed by Duckworth et al. (J Pers Soc Psychol 92(6):1087, 2007). When also controlling for a host of personality traits, risk preference is not related to the analyzed behaviors, but time preference is negatively related to smoking. When controlling for economic preferences and Big Five personality traits, the Grit score is unrelated to the analyzed health behaviors. Big Five openness is negatively related to the probability of engaging in physical activity, while Big Five agreeableness is negatively related to the probability of both drinking and binge drinking, but also to the probability of engaging in physical activity. Big Five neuroticism is negatively related to the probability of binge drinking.","[Bessey, Donata] Yonsei Univ, East Asia Int Coll, Yonseidae Gil 1, Wonju 220710, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Bessey, D (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, East Asia Int Coll, Yonseidae Gil 1, Wonju 220710, South Korea.",dbessey@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Fund for the Promotion of Young Scholars (FAN) of the Zurcher Universitatsverein; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),Fund for the Promotion of Young Scholars (FAN) of the Zurcher Universitatsverein; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"This study was funded by the Fund for the Promotion of Young Scholars (FAN) of the Zurcher Universitatsverein. through a generous research grant.

Importantly, I adjust other studies' estimates by taking into account the deficiencies of foreign sources and by distinguishing between exports of specie and of minerals. The estimations show that exports experienced substantial growth in the 1850s and 1860s, during the Guano Era. Exports stagnated in the 1870s and dropped during the War of the Pacific (1879-1883) before recovering in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially during World War I.","[Felipe Zegarra, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CENTRUM Catolica Grad Business Sch, Lima, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Zegarra, LF (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, CENTRUM Catolica Grad Business Sch, Lima, Peru.",lfzegarrab@pucp.pe,,"Zegarra, Luis Felipe/0000-0002-9956-8055",,,,,23,5,6,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

In these concepts, broad stakeholder involvement is intended to promote knowledge integration, consensus formation and activation of local actors to initiate and advance learning and change processes. In doing so, however, transdisciplinary processes enter societal battlegrounds and meet conflicting interest and knowledge claims. Thus, building on the discussion on transdisciplinarity in the context of sustainability-related research, the paper seeks to understand when and why which types of conflicts emerge in sustainability-related transdisciplinary research, how they affect knowledge integration, and how they can be resolved. It develops a categorization of conflicts including differing values, conflicting interests, dissimilar claims of legitimacy, and diverse knowledge claims. They are applied empirically in the analysis of a project on regional adaptation to climate change in Northwestern Germany. It studies processes and outcomes with regard to the societal impact of the project and discusses experiences of conflicts and relevant solutions. The paper finds that societally relevant transdisciplinary research processes need to be prepared for conflict resolution and overcoming resistance and blockages in cases when consensus formation and mutual agreement is not attainable.","[Siebenhuener, Bernd] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ Business Adm & Law, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-116, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Siebenhüner, B (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ Business Adm & Law, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-116, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",bernd.siebenhuener@uol.de,,"Siebenhuner, Bernd/0000-0002-0444-5889",Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [01LR0813B],Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Financial support by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) for the research project Nordwest 2050 [registration number 01LR0813B] is gratefully acknowledged.

This paper develops a spatially explicit methodology to value the benefits from improvements in biodiversity resulting from current policy initiatives to reduce nitrogen emissions. Using the UK as a case study, we quantify nitrogen impacts on plant diversity in four habitats: heathland, acid grassland, dunes and bogs, at fine spatial resolution. Focusing on non-use values for biodiversity we apply value-transfer based on household's willingness to pay to avoid changes in plant species richness, and calculate the benefit of projected emission declines of 37% for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and 6% for ammonia (NH3) over the scenario period 2007-2020. The annualised benefit resulting from these pollutant declines is 32.7 pound m (4.4 pound m to 109.7 pound m, 95% Confidence Interval), with the greatest benefit accruing from heathland and acid grassland due to their large area. We also calculate damage costs per unit of NO2 and NH3 emitted, to quantify some of the environmental impacts of air pollution for use alongside damage costs for human health in policy appraisal. The benefit is 103 pound (33 pound to 237) pound per tonne of NO2 saved, and 414 pound (139 pound to 1022) pound per tonne of NH3 saved.","[Jones, Laurence; Hall, Jane; Mills, Gina] Environm Ctr Wales, CEH, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Milne, Alice] Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Provins, Allan] Econ Environm Consultancy Eftec, 4 City Rd, London EC1Y 2AA, England; [Christie, Michael] Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystywth Business Sch, Aberystwyth SY23 3AL, Dyfed, Wales",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research; Aberystwyth University,"Jones, L (通讯作者)，Environm Ctr Wales, CEH, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",lj@ceh.ac.uk,"Christie, Michael/AAN-6021-2020; Jones, Laurence/A-3900-2011; Milne, Alice/HGE-7308-2022; Mills, Gina E/E-4540-2010","Christie, Michael/0000-0002-8346-9140; Jones, Laurence/0000-0002-4379-9006; Mills, Gina E/0000-0001-9870-2868; Milne, Alice/0000-0002-4509-0578","UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) [AQ0827]; NERC [ceh020015] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This work was funded by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) under contract AQ0827.",,54,8,9,5,61,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

While the number of farms that utilize direct-to-consumer outlets keeps growing, the value of direct-to-consumer sales has reached a plateau. At the same time, intermediated sales continue to rise. If consumers prefer to purchase local food through intermediated channels, then policies designed to support direct channels may be misguided. Using an online choice experiment, this paper investigates consumers' willingness to pay for local food differentiated by marketing channel. We find that, on average, consumers are willing to pay a premium for local food. However, they are not willing to pay premiums for local food that is sold at farmers markets, and discount it when it is purchased directly from an urban farm. Our findings can be used by farmers, marketers and policy makers to develop a better understanding of consumers' motivation for buying local through various channels.","[Printezis, Iryna; Grebitus, Carola] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, 7231 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA",Arizona State University,"Printezis, I (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, 7231 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",iiermole@asu.edu; carola.grebitus@asu.edu,,,"EASM-3: Collaborative Research: Physics-Based Predictive Modeling for Integrated Agricultural and Urban Applications, USDA-NIFA [2015-67003-23508]; NSF-MPS-DMS [1419593]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1419593] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","EASM-3: Collaborative Research: Physics-Based Predictive Modeling for Integrated Agricultural and Urban Applications, USDA-NIFA; NSF-MPS-DMS; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS))","The authors would like to thank Dr. Riccardo Scarpa for his helpful comments and suggestions to improve the experimental design of this article.

A Public Health Approach was used to design the model and this system was found to have three equilibrium states - two with no serious delinquents (non-status offenders) and one with both serious delinquents and status offenders coexisting. We employed a sensitivity analysis on the basic Reproductive number R-0, and identified the parameters that should be targeted by treatment strategies to curb the spread of juvenile delinquency.

Preservation of these soils is in conflict with their current intensive use, as preservation would require restricting drainage. Due to spatial interdependencies of organic soil areas, rewetting these soils requires cooperation among farmers. Agglomeration payments are a potential option to foster such cooperation. In order to test the effectiveness of this policy approach, we developed a dynamic and framed economic experiment to represent the decision situation of farmers operating on organic soils in Switzerland. Our sample population are farm apprentices. Unlike previous experiments on agglomeration payments, our design allows for heterogeneity and dynamic changes in farmers' opportunity costs and for side payments between players. We compared the effects of constant vs. variable agglomeration payment schemes on the adoption of sustainable use of organic soils. The variable payment mirrors the evolution of farmers' opportunity costs over time. We find that while both policy options promote sustainable land use, the constant payment option performs best in terms of environmental effectiveness. The constant payment also yields lower inequality in income and is more cost-effective than the variable option. Furthermore, risk aversion and inequality aversion appear to influence behavior and reduce cooperation among players.","[Ferre, Marie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ferre, Marie] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Engel, Stefanie] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Environm Syst Res, Alexander von Humboldt Professorship Environm Eco, Osnabruck, Germany; [Gsottbauer, Elisabeth] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Publ Finance, Innsbruck, Austria",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Leeds; University Osnabruck; University of Innsbruck,"Ferré, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",m.ferre@leeds.ac.uk,"Engel, Stefanie/B-6533-2009","Engel, Stefanie/0000-0002-3568-5500; Gsottbauer, Elisabeth/0000-0001-5849-8137","Swiss National Science Foundation as part of a National Research Program [406840-143145, NRP 68]; Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [406840_143145] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation as part of a National Research Program(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We acknowledge the support from the Swiss National Science Foundation, which funded this project (Sustainable management of organic soils in Switzerland, project number 406840-143145) as part of a National Research Program (NRP 68), and the Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation for complementary funding.

Participatory monitoring systems have been proposed to both better monitor natural resources and to engage resource users in Community Based Natural Resource Management systems, in a variety of social-ecological systems. However, studies of self-monitoring schemes in bushmeat hunting systems are scarce, and there are no empirical studies of the impact of self-monitoring on bushmeat hunting. We used a lab-in-the-field common pool resource experiment framed around a bushmeat hunting system, in which participants made individual decisions on time allocation between hunting and farming under three different conditions: without communication between group members, with communication, and with communication and a self-monitoring system. We found that self-monitoring was associated with a lower level of hunting and lower rate of resource decline. However, contrary to expectations, communication alone was not enough to lower hunting levels. We draw on behavioural economic and psychological research on environmental and social uncertainty and self-perception to explore how the act of self-monitoring could have changed behaviour by changing how participants perceived the resource, each other, and themselves. Our results support the notion that hunter self-monitoring could be a useful tool to initiate behaviour change, as well as providing estimates of resource trends.","[Marrocoli, Sergio; Gatiso, Tsegaye Tagesse; Kuehl, Hjalmar] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Marrocoli, Sergio; Gatiso, Tsegaye Tagesse; Kuehl, Hjalmar] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Morgan, David] Lester E Fisher Ctr Study & Conservat Apes, Lincoln Pk Zoo, Lincoln, NE USA; [Nielsen, Martin Reinhardt] Univ Copenhagen, Global Dev Sect, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25,Bldg B,First Floor, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",Max Planck Society; University of Copenhagen,"Marrocoli, S (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",sergio_marrocoli@eva.mpg.de,"Gatiso, Tsegaye T./AAO-8809-2020; Nielsen, Martin Reinhardt/E-1173-2015","Gatiso, Tsegaye T./0000-0002-0333-225X; Nielsen, Martin Reinhardt/0000-0002-8941-6031",Robert Bosch Foundation [32.5.8043.0016.0],Robert Bosch Foundation,This work was funded and supported by the Robert Bosch Foundation (grant number 32.5.8043.0016.0).,,65,12,14,0,35,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The study is novel in two main ways. First, it introduces the uncertainty deriving from the stochastic nature of global warming, not as a policy attribute but as an inherent feature of the valuation scenario. For this reason, the expected temperature change and its probability of occurrence were kept constant across alternatives but not across different choice tasks.

This paper analyses the effectiveness of a garbage tax, assessing its effects on multiple outcomes as well as its acceptability. We study how a Supreme Court decision, mandating the Swiss Canton of Vaud to implement a tax on garbage, affects garbage production and beliefs about the tax. We adopt a difference-in-differences approach exploiting that parts of Vaud already implemented a garbage tax before the mandate. Pricing garbage by the bag (PGB) is highly effective, reducing unsorted garbage by 40%, increasing recycling of aluminium and organic waste, without causing negative spillovers on adjacent regions. The effects of PGB seem very persistent over time. Our assessment of PGB looks very favourable. It may surprise that PGB is not implemented more often. Hence, we look at people's perceptions. We find that people are very concerned with PGB ex ante. Public opposition seems to be the main obstacle to PGB. However, implementing PGB reduces concerns with effectiveness and fairness substantially. After implementing PGB, people accept 70% higher garbage taxes compared to before PGB. We argue that environmental taxes could be much more diffused, if people had the chance to experience their functioning and correct their beliefs.","[Carattini, Stefano] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Carattini, Stefano] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Baranzini, Andrea] HES SO Univ Appl Sci & Arts Western Switzerland, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, Delemont, Switzerland; [Lalive, Rafael] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Lalive, Rafael] CEPR, London, England; [Lalive, Rafael] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Yale University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; University of Lausanne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut,"Carattini, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",stefano.carattini@yale.edu,"Carattini, Stefano/AAK-5053-2021; Baranzini, Andrea/R-6506-2019","Baranzini, Andrea/0000-0002-9438-7730; Carattini, Stefano/0000-0003-1242-2457; Lalive, Rafael/0000-0003-1938-692X",Canton of Vaud (DGE); Swiss National Science Foundation [P2SKP1_165028]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P2SKP1_165028] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Canton of Vaud (DGE); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We would like to thank Jeroen van den Bergh, Richard Blundell, Antoine Dechezlepretre, William Greene, Richard Howarth, Emilio Padilla, Jordi Roca, Frederic Vermeulen, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on earlier versions of this paper.

We tested the predictions of the Compact City Approach regarding the influence of the built environment on GHG emissions associated with commuting mobility in the Metropolitan Zone of Mexico Valley (MZMV).

Thus, agricultural water use in China may experience a rebound effect. This study defines the water rebound effect (WRE), using macro-scale indicators of water use and water productivity, establishes a simplified direct comparison method using the contribution rate of technological progress, and evaluates the magnitude of the macro scale water rebound effect in the Chinese agricultural sector using provincial panel data from 1997 to 2014. The magnitude of the agricultural WRE in China (1998-2014) is 61.49%. The northern and western regions of China experience a greater WRE than the southern and eastern regions, and the changes in the inter-annual WRE are distinct. These observations indicate that much of the expected water savings from efficiency improvement could be offset by increased water use for increased agricultural production due to technology enhancement. The control of water use growth is effective for reducing the water rebound effect. The study confirmed the existence of the agricultural WRE in China.","[Song, Jianfeng; Wu, Pute] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Song, Jianfeng; Wu, Pute] CAS & MWR, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Song, Jianfeng] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Song, Jianfeng; Wu, Pute; Sun, SHikun] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Water Saving Agr Arid Reg China, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yanan] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; Renmin University of China","Wu, PT (通讯作者)，Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Wu, PT (通讯作者)，CAS & MWR, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Wu, PT; Sun, SK (通讯作者)，Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Water Saving Agr Arid Reg China, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",s_jf@nwsuaf.edu.cn; gjzwpt@vip.sina.com; sksun@nwafu.edu.cn,"guo, yanan/AAI-9839-2021; Sun, SK/AAI-9111-2021","Sun, SK/0000-0002-9362-1556",Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education [17YJC790126]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M560815]; Postdoctoral Scientific Research in Shaanxi Province: Agricultural Water Resources Rebound Effect Research [132673]; Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China [2016JQ7001]; Social the Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China [2015R027],Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Postdoctoral Scientific Research in Shaanxi Province: Agricultural Water Resources Rebound Effect Research; Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China; Social the Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China,"This work is supported by the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education (17YJC790126), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2014M560815), the Postdoctoral Scientific Research in Shaanxi Province: Agricultural Water Resources Rebound Effect Research (132673), the Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China (2016JQ7001) and Social the Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China (2015R027).",,50,52,59,7,104,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This paper offers a network-based perspective on the issue. First, we propose a methodology to infer from technology adoption data the network of diffusion and apply it to a detailed dataset on wind energy technologies installed globally since the 1980s. We then perform a statistical analysis of the network. It highlights a relatively inefficient organization, characterized in particular by the weakness of South-South links, which leads to relatively long lags in the diffusion process. Against this background, we characterize optimal transfer/seeding strategies for an agent that aims to introduce a new technology in a developing country in view of further diffusion. Our results suggest in particular that CDM projects have been too concentrated in large emerging economies and that developed countries should put a stronger weight on the positive externalities in terms of technology transfer of cooperating with less prominent developing countries.","[Vega, Solmaria Halleck; Mandel, Antoine] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Vega, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",solmaria.halleck@univ-paris1.fr; antoine.mandel@univ-paris1.fr,,"Halleck Vega, Solmaria/0000-0001-8354-0026",H2020 project [GREEN-WIN 642018],H2020 project(Horizon 2020),"The authors would like to thank for their comments and suggestions the editor, two anonymous reviewers, Michael Grubb, Jochen Hinkel, Diana Mangalagiu, Katrin Millock, and participants of Advances in the Modelling of Innovation and Finance Workshop, the 6th FAERE Green Innovation Workshop, the European Conference on Climate Adaptation 2017.

Input-output analysis (IOA) serves well in this approach as it covers all traded products, their full supply chains and explicitly delineates final consumption. However, using IOA comes at the expense of precision due to aggregation error. There has been a recent discussion on the plausibility of IOA results of agricultural pressures. We look at the harvested area footprint of Chinese exports, open the black box of the results of IOA and provide a detailed composition of the footprint. This helps to understand whether its size is a result of the poor precision of IOA methods, or whether it is based on plausible production patterns of the exported products. We hybridize the EXIOBASE database, identify the most important exported products, apply structural path analysis in order to identify the most important production nodes in their production paths and apply a sensitivity analysis over the model. We show that the results of the hybrid MRIO method are generally robust to assumptions. Our results indicate that while the uncertainty of the sign of net trade footprint can be high, the uncertainty of national environmental footprint accounts is low.","[Weinzettel, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Environm Ctr, Jose Martiho 2, Prague, Czech Republic; [Wood, Richard] NTNU, Ind Ecol Program, Trondheim 7491, Norway",Charles University Prague; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Weinzettel, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Environm Ctr, Jose Martiho 2, Prague, Czech Republic.",weinzettel@seznam.cz; richard.wood@ntnu.no,"Weinzettel, Jan/A-3422-2010; Wood, Richard/E-4111-2015","Weinzettel, Jan/0000-0001-8977-8385; Wood, Richard/0000-0002-7906-3324","Czech Science Foundation [14-05292S, 17-07140S]; European Commission [PCIG13-GA-2013-618520]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),This work has been supported by the Czech Science Foundation under grant number: 14-05292S and 17-07140S and by the European Commission under grant number PCIG13-GA-2013-618520.,,35,31,32,6,82,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Orchestration, the alignment between 'orchestrator' (e.g., international organizations and governments) and 'intermediaries' (e.g., city networks and partnerships), could harness additional contributions by building catalytic linkages and by enabling a growing number of actions. Although most orchestration efforts have been made in the context of international climate negotiations, regional and national orchestration could be useful by contributing to the implementation of national commitments, and by inspiring greater ambition. We investigate whether and how regional and national orchestrators respond to shortfalls in international orchestration. Using insights from a comparative study, we provide an early indication of the catalytic potential of orchestration in Latin America, Europe, India, Argentina, and Sweden. We find considerable impacts of global level orchestration on the emergence of these initiatives, however orchestrators do not simply copy other efforts; they emphasize different catalytic linkages, including the engagement of underrepresented actors; implementation; and, the provision of ideational and material support. Catalytic linkages in a complex landscape with multiple orchestrators could sometimes be improved through coordination. Given the enormous scale of transformation needed, a focus on scale may seem natural. However, for socially just outcomes, orchestrators need to resist a sole focus on scale, and also aim at experimental and small-scale actions, which may not lead to immediate large-scale impacts but which may prove crucial in longer-term transformations.","[Chan, Sander] German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Chan, Sander] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ellinger, Paula] Fdn Avina, 879-3 B, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Widerberg, Oscar] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Fac Sci, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Utrecht University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Chan, S (通讯作者)，German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.;Chan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands.",sander.chan@die-gdi.de; paula.ellinger@gmail.com; oscar.widerberg@vu.nl,,"Chan, Sander/0000-0001-7852-3838; Widerberg, Oscar/0000-0002-8088-3709",,,,,30,31,31,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The research aim is to identify the effect of an underdeveloped high value-added sector on the low value-added sector in less developed countries. An analysis of empirical data supported the hypothesis that an underdeveloped high value-added tradable subsector in less developed countries does not allow reaching the labour productivity level of developed economies in the low value-added tradable subsector because of the availability of a relatively cheaper labour force that does not force businesses to raise their labour productivity levels.","[Ancans, Sandris] Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Ancans, S (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Jelgava, Latvia.",,,,,,,,3,1,1,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,85,92,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.122,0.0,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500010,0

Traditionally, user experience is measured retrospective with surveys and interviews, but this is not the most optimal approach since it does not measure user experience in the moment and it is prone for human error because of our inaccurate memory recollection. Here we propose a method that does semi-automated evaluation of user experience by utilizing electrophysiological equipment that monitors electrical activity of the brain. We describe an approach that together with brain activity monitoring will collect and quantify user experience in a non-intrusive manner. We demonstrate the method by showing how a low cost device can record brain activity during a user test, and auto-detect where the user has difficulties understand or navigating a solution. All this is done in an unsupervised manner, but an observer must still verify the feedback with the actual user to remove false positives. Our method is not limited to digital solutions and can also be used for evaluating user experience of physical installations.","[Bai, Aleksander; Fuglerud, Kristin S.] Norwegian Comp Ctr, Oslo, Norway",,"Bai, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Comp Ctr, Oslo, Norway.",aleksander.bai@nr.no,"Fuglerud, Kristin Skeide/A-2815-2011","Fuglerud, Kristin Skeide/0000-0002-5648-0264",,,,,33,0,1,0,15,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,811,820,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-811,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371446.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100079,0

Design/methodology/approach This study employs the probit model to analyse the determinants of farmer participation in value addition whereas the Tobit model is used to investigate the determinants of the extent of producer's involvement in value addition using a data set of 400 cassava farmers drawn from the Oyo State of Nigeria. Findings The findings further indicate that among other factors, human capital factors including farmer age and location variable tend to reduce farmer participation in value addition through processing whereas experience and record keeping promote farmer participation in cassava processing. Institutional variables, notably membership of farmer association, extension access and credit access, enhance farmer participation in value addition. Finally, ownership of a radio set, a television set and access to electricity strengthen the value-adding capacity of farmers. Research limitations/implications This study only considers the determinants of producers' participation in cassava processing but does not explicitly analyse the impact of value addition on their profit margin. This issue would form a basis for future research to enhance knowledge in the extant literature. Practical implications The study suggests that if the value-adding capacity of farmers is strengthened, rural economy is likely to be improved upon through the proliferation of rural food processing enterprises. Originality/value Despite the relevance of developing food value chains in Africa and integrating farmers in them, there are limited studies on promoting value addition among farmers.

However, market growth carries along associated trends not just reserved for national media. The trend of internet's development into a dominant information channel for citizens emphasizes the question of online content production that has (thus far) been free of charge; decline in revenue from sales and advertising causes journalistic staff downsizing; private local media funding through public subsidies (Fund for the Promotion of Pluralism and Diversity) poses a question on the justifiability of co-funding profit, etc. Thereby, the main purpose of the paper is to collect available facts about the condition of local media in Eastern Croatia, focusing on electronic media, as well as to reconstruct certain development trends present in previous years. Although the print media market in Eastern Croatia will be mentioned, the analysis will focus on local television and radio broadcasters due to data accessibility, as well as online news web sites, which operate as locally profiled standalone media. Based on data from the Agency for Electronic Media and partially from the Croatian Bureau of Statistics, the conducted analysis will discover possible trends in the employee structure of local media, as well as the types and forms of funding from various sources.","[Dukic, Marina; Levak, Tomislav] Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Dept Cultural Studies, Trg Sv Trojstva 3, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Dukic, M (通讯作者)，Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Dept Cultural Studies, Trg Sv Trojstva 3, Osijek, Croatia.",mdjukic@unios.hr; tomo.levak@gmail.com,"Dukic, Marina/R-1562-2019","Dukic, Marina/0000-0002-3224-9148",,,,,18,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,978,987,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900103,0

In its 2017 Transport Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia 2017 - 2030, the Republic of Croatia also emphasizes the need to solve these problems. Using bicycles as a mode of transport has multiple advantages but is insufficiently legally regulated. In the Republic of Croatia, it is necessary to encourage the more significant use of bicycles. Authors find bike sharing as one of the solutions for the integration of cycling in traffic asit has been developed in some EU countries as a significant mode of public transport. The Republic of Croatia has a potential for implementation and development of bike sharing based on franchising business model. Franchising is used as a way of starting a new venture and as a growth strategy and can be a possible solution for the spread of bike sharing both in EU and in the Republic of Croatia. The paper presents provisions of the applicable legislation relevant to the topic of this paper, noting that there are no appropriate bicycle regulations. Since the franchise business model is not regulated by a separate law, it is necessary to considercreation of anadequate business model that will contribute to the development of public transport and traffic rights in general.

Based on the analysis, an attempt will be made to determine the main reasons for certain levels of staff motivation and how they differ from standard attitudes. The primary research was conducted by surveying 68% of the respective department's sales staff. For the sample to be representative, the regional breakdown was taken into account within the analysed department as well. Alongside the primary research through surveying, a short SWOT analysis was made to identify the elements having a positive or negative impact on the department's sales results, which proved to be closely related to sales representatives' motivation. The author's twelve years of experience in this industry segment contributed to the quality of the analysis. The significance of the results is especially notable when considering the wider context. The impact of the environment in which the company operates, with a major and strong influence of the competition, forces the company to approach the market with utmost strategic consideration. In addition, the analysed market is highly profitable, but it also requires major investment. Another important fact is that we analysed the B2B segment of the sales department, which is characterised by the standard specificities of every sales department. The analysed department also has characteristics and competences that are specific to communication with businesses, such as building partnership relations with customers, the very complexity of the products and services, and the constant evolution of those products and services. The research has led to several significant findings. They are related to the reasons for increases and declines in employee motivation arising from the quality of goal setting, the way relations between other departments within the business system are defined, and timely placement of services through identification of market demand.","[Galic, Tvrtko] Fac Educ Osijek, Econ, Cara Hadrijana 10, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Galic, T (通讯作者)，Fac Educ Osijek, Econ, Cara Hadrijana 10, Osijek, Croatia.",tgalic@foozos.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,7,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,290,299,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900030,0

Hence, we introduce a stylized automotive supply chain with two suppliers and a single original equipment manufacturer (OEM). This supply chain can be disrupted by a shortage occurring at one of the suppliers due to random machine breakdowns, what consequently creates dependent requirements variations (DRV) affecting both the OEM and the other supplier. Using a System Dynamics (SD) simulation which contains the said mechanism causing schedule instability, comparative simulation scenarios were carried out to gain theoretical insights with regard to the nature of DRV. As a result, the simulation study shows that the Bullwhip Effect is not just detectable on a vertical supply chain level under demand uncertainties, but also on a horizontal supply chain level when production risks are present.","[Gruchmann, Tim] FOM Univ, Essen, Germany; [Rebs, Tobias] Univ Kassel, Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Gruchmann, T (通讯作者)，FOM Univ, Essen, Germany.",tim.gruchmann@fom.de; tobias.rebs@uni-kassel.de,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-8917,,978-3-319-74225-0; 978-3-319-74224-3,LECT NOTES LOGISTICS,,,2018,,,,,,,406,412,,10.1007/978-3-319-74225-0_55,0.0,,,7,Business; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BL3JG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449752500055,0

This paper examines characteristics of households' debt in banks within the counties in Croatia. In order to define relatively homogenous groups of counties in Croatia according to households' debtcharacteristics, the method used in the paper is multivariate statistical analysis, more precisely factor and cluster analysis. The analysis considers different types of loans and currency structure of bank loan portfolio for household sector in Croatian counties, as well as level of indebtedness of households regarding economic and demographic indicators of county development. Economic interpretation of results collected indicates interrelation of county economic development and demographic characteristics to banking households' sectorloan portfolio. Characteristics of banking loan portfolio for households based on different types of loans and currency criteria are emphasised, as well. Conclusions in a paper discusses deviations according to counties as well as analytically determined clusters of relatively homogenous counties. Results in our analysis point to importance of consumer protection, financial literacy together with theprevention of households' indebtedness.

The research provides three conclusions: First, enterprises can transform sustainability challenges into competitive advantages by developing a sustainable business model, with environmental, social, and economic values. Second, a value proposition is the soul of the sustainable business model. Enterprises need not only focus on how to do but they must pay even more attention to what to do, so it is advisable to integrate a value proposition into the enterprise strategy and business process. Finally, a sustainable value proposition consists of sustainable economic, environmental, and social values, and their individual importance varies in sustainable business models for different industries where the demand for environmental and social value is increasingly important.","[Li, Wei; Kang, Rong] Northwest Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an,"Li, W (通讯作者)，Northwest Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",xbdxlw@126.com; 1057816418@qq.com,"Kang, Rong/M-7984-2014",,MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund named Research on the Enterprises' Disruptive Growth Engine for Strategic Emerging Industries [14YJC630068],MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund named Research on the Enterprises' Disruptive Growth Engine for Strategic Emerging Industries,The authors are very grateful for financial support from the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund named Research on the Enterprises' Disruptive Growth Engine for Strategic Emerging Industries (Registration Number: 14YJC630068).,,26,3,3,2,8,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-700-8,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,1,,,,549,558,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL2ZZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443500053,0

Several children's food products look like fruit; hence potentially fruit substitutes. Packaging includes brand names, indicators, and health claims related to fruit. These packaging cues may potentially lead to misperceptions of the products. The purpose of this paper is to examine at-risk parents' substitutions of children's fruit-branded products for real fruit. At-risk parents are of particular interest as they are a vulnerable segment when it comes to nutrition. Design/methodology/approach At-risk families (n=149) completed a survey of their perceptions of children's nutritional needs, fruit product substitutions, and brand purchase behavior. Findings At-risk parents report erroneous perceptions of children's nutritional fruit intake needs. The results suggest that parents believe fruit-branded products are equivalent to real fruit. Parents' knowledge and beliefs of fruit equivalency impact purchase decisions. Research limitations/implications Limitations include potential self-reporting and convenience sampling bias. The study did not attend to the complete product nutritional profile; only on fruit content. Future research should investigate other factors affecting food purchase decisions. Practical implications Industry and policy implications include the balance between governmental regulation of food marketing, voluntary corporate responsibility, and the need for education. Originality/value This study provides insights into children's food product packaging on at-risk family perceptions of real fruit substitutes and purchase behaviors. With the market for these products increasing, there is limited research investigating the impact of these products on children's nutritional intake.","[Maher, Jill K.] Robert Morris Univ, Dept Mkt, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Crawley, Daria; Potter, Jodi] Robert Morris Univ, Dept Management, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Robert Morris University; Robert Morris University,"Maher, JK (通讯作者)，Robert Morris Univ, Dept Mkt, Pittsburgh, PA USA.",maher@rmu.edu; crawleyd@rmu.edu; potterj@rmu.edu,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach Ten formulations of beef burgers were developed, varying in the percentage reduction in NaCl (0-75 per cent) and mushroom water extracts (obtained from a 5, 12.5, or 20 per cent mushroom homogenate). Sensory characterisation was performed by time-intensity (TI) and acceptance tests. In addition, physico-chemical analyses (pH, yield, shrinkage, shear force, and colour) were conducted. Findings Extracts obtained from 5, 12.5, or 20 per cent mushroom homogenate (E1, E2, and E3, respectively) did not enhance the salty taste in formulations with a 0 or 75 per cent reduction in NaCl. In formulations with a 50 per cent reduction in NaCl, all the extracts enhanced salinity perception, with E3 being the most effective. E3 also increased acceptance of colour, aroma, texture, flavour, and overall perception, although it caused changes in some physico-chemical characteristics (pH, yield, shrinkage, shear force, and colour). Originality/value The shiitake mushroom extract is a natural ingredient with a potential to serve as a taste enhancer in meat and other food products, for the purpose of reducing sodium content without compromising sensory acceptability. Therefore, this extract will enable the development of healthier products (owing to a reduction in sodium) with preserved sensory quality and will meet consumers' requirements for the minimal use of chemical additives in food.","[Mattar, Thayana Vilela; Goncalves, Carla Saraiva; Pereira, Rafaela Correa; Faria, Michelle Aparecida; de Souza, Vanessa Rios; Souza Carneiro, Joao de Deus] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Food Sci, Lavras, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras,"Pereira, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Food Sci, Lavras, Brazil.",thayana_mattar@hotmail.com; carla_ufla@yahoo.com.br; rafacpereira@gmail.com; michellefaria@engalimentos.ufla.br; vanessardsouza@gmail.com; joaodedeus@dca.ufla.br,,"Pereira, Rafaela/0000-0001-8795-6109",,,,,57,30,34,5,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A self-administrated online survey was carried out among organic food buyers (n = 202) using the snowball sampling technique. Measurement items were mainly adapted from the prior studies. Findings - The authors analysed the heterogeneity of organic food buyers with latent class model. Four distinct latent classes (i.e. segments) of organic food buyers were identified. Those segments were named as enthusiastic social-seekers, enthusiastic moralists, hostile seldom shoppers, and hostile heavy shoppers. Originality/value - Though the study was exploratory, the identified segments of organic food buyers can enhance our knowledge about differing characteristics of organic food buyers in the context of the country where the organic food industry is in the early stages of development. The findings of this study will give organic food producers and marketers a much better framework for making product, pricing, distribution and marketing communications decision. Moreover, the identification of organic food consumer profiles will provide an insight into how policymakers should tailor their public policy and strategies to expand the size of the organic food market.","[Pestek, Almir] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Agic, Emir] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Cinjarevic, Merima] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Microecon, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo; University of Sarajevo; University of Sarajevo,"Cinjarevic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Microecon, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",merima.cinjarevic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Činjarević, Merima/H-5915-2019; Pestek, Almir/AAJ-7437-2020; Agic, Emir/AAP-7194-2020","Pestek, Almir/0000-0001-5958-4993; Cinjarevic, Merima/0000-0002-1751-8311",,,,,89,25,25,6,45,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Provided there is a sufficiently large proportion between costs of the two firm it is possible to observe nonlinear phenomena such as bifurcation of limit values of production or deterministic chaos. To prove a sensitive dependence on initial condition, that accompanies deterministic chaos, the concept of Lyapunov exponent is used.

Stressing the importance of obtaining the PPI cover which, for a certain period, provides to the credit negotiator protection in a situation when the payment of credit is impossible, the authors draw attention to the relevance of this topic while underlining the open legal issues of misselling of that financial product and its effects (financial mis-selling) and obtaining the abovementioned insurance cover for credit negotiators who have ended up with financial product which is not in their interests. While as much as 40% of consumers were unaware that they had an insurance policy, their trust in financial institutions was permanently undermined. Since PPI mis-selling practices are a key concern for consumers, an important part of financial market, an increasing number of claims against mis-selling of PPI policies (a claim to the bank, lender or broker who sold the PPI policy) highlighted the need to change the unfair terms in PPI policy and define the legal and insurance status of that financial product. To this end, the authors analyse the provisions of the judgement of the Court of Great Britain, Royal Courts of Justice in Case CO/10619/2010 from April 20, 2011 and the consequences of its implementation, i.e. the duty of banks and other financial institutions to compensate the damage caused to consumers by the financial mis-sold PPI. In addition, the authors examine the fairness of a PPI policy under EU consumer law according to the latest provisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Case C-96/14.","[Primorac, Zeljka] Univ Split, Fac Law, Split, Croatia; [Gojak, Josip] Cty Rd Adm Split, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Primorac, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Law, Split, Croatia.",zeljka.primorac@prayst.hr; josip.gojak1@gmail.com,"Primorac, Željka/F-5355-2017",,,,,,29,0,0,1,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,552,560,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600063,0

Design/methodology/approach An online survey with a representative sample of the Slovenian population of 650 consumers was conducted. Consumer preferences were estimated using choice-based conjoint analysis. Findings The findings show that price is the most powerful driver of consumer preferences for cheese and honey, whereas it is origin for ham, which proved to be the most strongly desired Slovenian food product of all items analysed. Label is the least preferable attribute for all three products considered. Cheese, ham and honey bearing the national PDO and PGI labels were more desired than products carrying the EU PDO and PGI labels. The study findings also show the main statistically significant differences in the age and gender of consumers. Research limitations/implications The biggest limitation is that the study focused on certain labels only, related to quality, and origin in particular. Practical implications This result highlights the need to extend and intensify promotional and communication activities to increase consumer preferences for the national and EU PDO- and PGI-labelled cheeses, ham and honey.

Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional, online questionnaire survey was administered to 3,925 urban respondents in Indonesia, Melbourne, Shanghai, Singapore and Vietnam. Cross-tabulation, confirmatory factor analyses and multiple regression analyses were employed. Findings Most respondents supported government communications to promote healthy eating and to a lesser extent, regulatory measures to control unhealthy food marketing. Personal values and country of residence were more strongly associated with the respondents' views than demographic variables. Overall, strongest support for nutrition promotion and for stricter regulation of food marketing was seen in Shanghai, Indonesia and Vietnam. Broadly, two groups were identified across the region: those who held equality-nature or tradition-security-conformity personal values, who disapproved of food marketing but supported government health promotion campaigns, and, those with stronger hedonist values who held opposite views. Research limitations/implications First, a wider range of personal values could be included in future studies to better represent Asian values. Second, changes in population views could be assessed in future longitudinal studies. Finally, future studies should include dietary assessments and the views of people from a variety of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Practical implications These findings suggest that health policy makers and communicators need to frame their communications to match the world views of household food providers in their countries. Originality/value The study provides confirmation of attitude-values theories within five different countries in the Asia Pacific region and demonstrates the importance of personal values and country of residence in influencing food providers' views.","[Worsley, Anthony] Deakin Univ, Inst Phys Act & Nutr, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Wang, Wei Chun] Monash Univ, Cent Clin Sch, Frankston, Australia; [Sarmugam, Rani; Quynh Pham; Ridley, Stacey] Deakin Univ, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Fac Hlth, Burwood, Australia; [Februhartanty, Judhiastuty] Univ Indonesia, Southeast Asian Ministers Educ, Reg Ctr Food & Nutr, Jakarta, Indonesia",Deakin University; Monash University; Deakin University; University of Indonesia,"Worsley, A (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Inst Phys Act & Nutr, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",anthony.worsley@deakin.edu.au; Wei.Wang@monash.edu; rs156@Uowmail.edu.au; pth.quynh@hutech.edu.vn; judhiastuty@yahoo.com; s.ridley@deakin.edu.au,"Pham, Quynh/AED-1403-2022; Februhartanty, Judhiastuty/AAH-3990-2020","Pham, Quynh/0000-0002-8919-3472; Februhartanty, Judhiastuty/0000-0003-0304-5952","School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Deakin University","School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Deakin University","The authors thank the staff of GMI for their efficient administration of the Families and Food survey.

Since its first appearance in the late 1800s, the reasons behind the rise of the Sicilian mafia have remained a puzzle. In this article, we argue that the mafia arose as a response to an exogenous shock in the demand for oranges and lemons, following Lind's discovery in the late eighteenth century that citrus fruits cured scurvy. More specifically, we claim that mafia appeared in locations where producers made high profits from citrus production for overseas export. Operating in an environment with a weak rule of law, the mafia protected citrus production from predation and acted as intermediaries between producers and exporters. Using original data from a parliamentary inquiry in 1881-1886 on Sicilian towns, the Damiani Inquiry, we show that mafia presence is strongly related to the production of oranges and lemons. The results hold when different data sources and several controls are employed.","[Dimico, Arcangelo] Queens Univ Belfast, Management Sch, Riddel Hall,Belfast bt95ee, Belfast, North Ireland; [Dimico, Arcangelo] Queens Univ Belfast, Management Sch, Riddel Hall,Belfast bt95ee, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Isopi, Alessia] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Arthur Lewis Bldg-2-015, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Isopi, Alessia] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Arthur Lewis Bldg-2-015, Manchester, England; [Olsson, Ola] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 100, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Queens University Belfast; Queens University Belfast; University of Manchester; University of Manchester; University of Gothenburg,"Dimico, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Management Sch, Riddel Hall,Belfast bt95ee, Belfast, North Ireland.;Dimico, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Management Sch, Riddel Hall,Belfast bt95ee, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",a.dimico@qub.ac.uk; alessia.isopi@manchester.ac.uk; ola.olsson@economics.gu.se,"Dimico, Arcangelo/AAI-1536-2020",,,,,,50,31,38,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

One option to reduce this gap is to use decision analysis to weigh alternative recovery actions. Using decision analysis, we evaluated tradeoffs between recovery actions to reduce extinction risk and financial cost for the imperiled Oregon spotted frog (Rana pretiosa). We simulated population supplementation via captive breeding or head-starting, and releasing offspring into the wild as larvae or young of the year. We ranked the efficacy of recovery scenarios, represented by a culmination of a series of decision points, to reduce the 10-year extinction risk below 10% while minimizing financial costs. We explored how rankings varied with respect to the extinction risk target, the endangered population size, and the reproductive output captive females. Our top-ranked pathway was to supplement with captive bred larvae, resulting in a 3% reduction in extinction risk for every $100,000 spent. In general, supplementing with captive bred larvae resulted in the biggest reduction in extinction risk per dollar invested. Additionally, we found that increasing spending does not always result in a proportional reduction in extinction risk. These results link quantitative and applied conservation by considering the biological and economic efficacy. to recover endangered species. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Revenue efficiency changes affect more overall profit efficiency than equivalent cost efficiency changes.

Linking ETSs offers economic, political, and administrative benefits. It also faces major challenges. Linking can affect overall ambition, financial flows, and the location and nature of investments, reduces regulatory autonomy, and requires harmonization of ETS design elements. This article examines three options that could help overcome challenges by restricting the flow of units among jurisdictions through quotas, exchange rates, or discount rates. We use a simple model and three criteria-abatement outcome, economic implications, and feasibility-to assess these 'restricted linking' options. Quotas can enhance cost-effectiveness relative to no linking and allow policy-makers to retain control on the extent of unit flows. Exchange rates can create abatement and economic benefits or unintended adverse implications for cost-effectiveness and total abatement, depending on how rates are set. Due to information asymmetries between the regulated entities and policy-makers setting the exchange rate, as well as uncertainties about future developments, setting exchange rates in a manner that avoids such unintended consequences could prove difficult. Discount rates, in contrast, can ensure that both cost-effectiveness and total abatement are enhanced. Overall, restricted linking options do not achieve the benefits of full linking, but also avoid some major pitfalls, as well as offering levers that can be adjusted, should linking concerns prove to be more significant than anticipated.","[Schneider, Lambert; Lazarus, Michael; Lee, Carrie] Stockholm Environm Inst, US Ctr, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA 02144 USA; [Schneider, Lambert] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Inst Environm & Climate Res, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Asselt, Harro] Stockholm Environm Inst, Oxford Ctr, Florence House,29 Grove St, Oxford OX2 7JT, England",Wageningen University & Research; University of Oxford,"Schneider, L (通讯作者)，Stockholm Environm Inst, US Ctr, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA 02144 USA.;Schneider, L (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Inst Environm & Climate Res, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",lambert.schneider@sei-us.org,"Schneider, Lambert/Q-6090-2019","Schneider, Lambert/0000-0002-5704-0965; Lazarus, Michael/0000-0002-4229-5578",,,,,27,10,12,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This article investigates the nature of staple production in Brazil and attendant changes in the racial composition of 20 modern states from its discovery by the Portuguese to the present. The Indigenous population was surpassed by that of African descent in the north-east, south-east, and north, respectively, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; not until decades after the abolition of slavery did people of European heritage come to constitute a majority. These transitions were guided by the relative productivity, natural increase, and price of Native and African slaves, contingent on the extent of natural resource wealth (mineral deposits or land suitable for growing cash crops) and supply of free labour. In those areas where slavery was most profitable, a 1 per cent increase in the relative cost of Native labour raised the proportion of people of African ancestry by up to 2 per cent, depending on the measures of slave prices and racial classifications considered. This relationship is robust to changes in output prices or the populace of European descent, and alternative scenarios of aboriginal population decline.","[Bucciferro, Justin R.] Eastern Washington Univ, Cheney, WA 99004 USA",Eastern Washington University,"Bucciferro, JR (通讯作者)，Eastern Washington Univ, Cheney, WA 99004 USA.",,,,,,,,71,1,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

However, the role of wild harvest as a conservation tool remains controversial. When unsustainable, wild harvesting leads to population decline or even extirpation of species. When sustainable, it has the potential to promote win-win solutions for conservation and development. We reviewed 87 cases of wild harvesting of vertebrates and plants in developing countries to understand the conditions influencing its sustainability. We used random forest and logistic regression to find the most important predictors among a range of biological, demographic and economic indicators, and to detail the predicted effects on sustainability of harvest. Species resilience, GDP per capita and poverty headcount ratio were the strongest predictors of sustainability. Species resilience was positively related to sustainability of harvest, whereas GDP per capita and poverty ratio were negatively related. Harvesting a species with low resilience is more likely to be unsustainable when harvested in a middle-income, high poverty ratio country than in a low-income, low poverty ratio country. This study highlights the risks of wild population harvest under the challenging economic conditions inherent in developing countries, and visualize where efforts are most needed to achieve sustainable harvest.

In this paper, we establish a theoretical model to illuminate the potential effects of the scale and agglomeration of pig production on the pollutant treatment rate and propose four theoretical hypotheses. Furthermore, we use survey data collected from Jiaxing city - the largest pig supply base in China's Yangtze River Delta region - and employ both linear and nonlinear models to empirically test the theoretical hypotheses. The results show that the rate of faeces applied to the fields as manure decreases with the scale of pig production, while the rate of other harmless modes of pollutant treatment increases with the scale of production, resulting in a U-shaped relationship between the pollutant treatment rate and the scale of pig production. In addition, the total pollutant treatment rate increases with the agglomeration of pig production.

The 2010 Nagoya Protocol regulating access to genetic resources is set to change this scenario. This treaty requires country parties to put in place enhanced ABS measures regulating access to their genetic resources and to provide for the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization. These measures include minimum access standards, mandatory prior informed consent of indigenous and local communities, compliance with the domestic laws or requirements of the provider country and monitoring the utilization of genetic resources. This is aimed at commercial research. Non-commercial public research which contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity is encouraged, particularly in developing countries, through simplified measures. There are undoubtedly practical challenges in operationalizing this provision without impeding research in the sector most potentially affected by ABS measures. This article presents the results of a survey of the practices of such researchers in one developing country, namely Malaysia. It examines the potential implications for the national implementation of the Protocol. Given country specificities, this study highlights and shows the importance of increasing knowledge about existing practices for an efficient design and implementation by developing countries of a complex legislation such as the Nagoya ABS Protocol.","[Nijar, Gurdial Singh] Univ Malaya, Fac Law, Ctr Excellence Biodivers Law CEBLAW, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Louafi, Selim] CIRAD, Ave Agropolis,TA A-96-03,Bat 3,Bur 106, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Welch, Eric W.] CSTEPS, Downtown Campus,411 North Cent Ave,Room 463, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",Universiti Malaya; CIRAD,"Nijar, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Law, Ctr Excellence Biodivers Law CEBLAW, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",gurdials@um.edu.my,"Welch, Eric W/D-5097-2015; LOUAFI, Selim/N-2179-2016","LOUAFI, SELIM/0000-0002-2805-8162",,,,,17,18,18,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The article discusses wealth distribution by location and social status, and shows how privileged groups used diplomatic, ecclesiastical, and military rank to avoid the hearth tax, while ordinary householders turned to doorstep opposition, especially in the outer and poorer suburbs, in expressing their hostility towards the heath tax. The article demonstrates that in Metropolitan London the assessment and collection of the hearth tax depended not only upon the enforcement of the parliamentary legislation, but also upon negotiation and give-and-take between tax collectors and tax payers, sometimes in consultation with the Crown. As a result the hearth tax failed to fill the king's purse, was unpopular in the capital and in the country, and created onerous work for both auditors and hearth tax collectors, which contributed to the short life of the hearth tax (1662-89).","[Wareham, Andrew] Univ Roehampton, Dept Humanities, London, England",Roehampton University,"Wareham, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roehampton, Dept Humanities, London, England.",,,,,,,,64,4,4,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

While this represents a significant achievement for those times, for that law landscape essentially has an historical and aesthetic connotation, without any explicit reference to the components of flora, fauna and geology. Today, many protection policies and initiatives are still biased by the lack of reference to the intrinsic value that biodiversity and ecosystem services have for the maintenance of traditional landscapes, as well as for the survival of the human species. The priority accorded to historical and aesthetic values can lead to a lack of attention to the complex relationship binding the natural environment, agriculture and urban processes. Hence, there is a need in Italy for an increased awareness of the functional role exerted by agriculture as a link between ecosystems and techno'' systems. The complex and polysemic concept of landscape plays a crucial role in designing new strategies for the rural territories, their economies and their cultures. Moving towards a shared and integrated strategy for multifunctional agriculture involves a substantial revision of the general objectives of growth and development, combining conservation and innovation. In this respect, the full integration of the Strategic Environmental Assessment in regional planning processes is one possible method for building a framework in which policies to promote the development, protection and enhancement of landscapes can work in an integrated way. These observations lead to some final conclusions on the network logic which should drive the integration process of planning and evaluation, along with some reflections on the Italian programme for inland areas.","[Guarino, R.] Univ Palermo, Dept STEBICEF, Via Archirafi 38, I-09123 Palermo, Italy; [Cutaia, F.; Giacopelli, A.

This discrepancy suggests that we must enlarge the spectrum of analysis to understand when it pays to be green. The way in which society takes a stance on environmental responsibility is deeply bounded to the cultural lenses through which it sets its priorities. A cultural perspective can help explain the capacity for social phenomena to shape behaviour. We consider how the contextual environment of culture, thus far neglected, might moderate the corporate environmental performance-corporate financial performance relationship and thus influence firms' capacity to offset the costs of environmental management.

The findings reveal both similarities and differences. During the industrialization era, Sweden's domestic wealth was relatively low because of low saving rates and instead foreign capital imports became important. Twentieth-century trends and levels are more similar, but in Sweden government wealth grew more important, not least through its relatively large public pension system.

Furthermore, the evolution and convergence characteristics of regional technical efficiency are examined by a dynamic regression model based on different regional divisions of China. The empirical results show that there exist significant geographical differences in the technical efficiency of Chinese iron and steel industry. On the one hand, the technical efficiency of the eastern area, the central area and the western area is unbalanced, with a lower efficiency in the west and a higher one in the east. On the other hand, technical efficiency of Central Bohai, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta economic zones is higher than that of the other economic zones. In addition, the technical efficiency has a significant improvement during the period of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. Following the convergence notation in economic growth theory, this paper also gives some convergence evidence of the technical efficiency towards the efficient frontier due to the catching-up effect. Finally, this paper explores the determinants of the technical efficiency, and discusses policy implications for Chinese iron and steel industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is based on a large onsite survey and the same survey administered online. Although such applications are rare in an urban context, applying a seasonal demand model to the case of Grunewald is possible because the distances travelled are relatively large, the majority of the respondents use motorized or public transport, and Grunewald is a large and unique urban forest site with very few substitutes. The main results are the following: (1) The demand for visits to Grunewald is less elastic if only Berlin residents are taken into account compared to when residents from the entire larger urban area of Berlin are considered. (2) Estimated consumer surpluses are therefore greater if only Berlin residents are taken into consideration. (3) In addition, demand is more elastic for the inter net sample than for the on-site sample. (4) Results suggest a lower bound overall consumer surplus of 14.95 (sic) per visit.

The literature reveals that local communities react not only to perceived environmental impacts but also to their lack of representation and participation in decisions concerning their development path, lack of monetary compensation and distrust with the mining company and the state. Several authors explore the objectives and discourses of these movements that range from compensation and market embedded demands to the articulation of post material values and the emergence of socio-ecological alternatives. Cross-scalar alliances have emerged as a crucial factor in the formation of discourses and strategies; local narratives and alternatives are being combined with global discourses on rights (to clean water, to take decisions, indigenous rights) and environmental justice. Cross scalar alliances have also allowed local groups to increase their knowledge about the projects, give them visibility, and comprehend and act against their weak position in the global commodity chain. These alliances have also contributed to the emergence or consolidation of a diverse set of resistance strategies such as legal court cases, activist-scientist collaborations and local referendums or consultas at community level to reject mining projects. This review also explores the response of the state and the mining companies to these conflicts, exploring responses such as regulatory changes or Corporate Social Responsibility programs.

This paper uses detailed industry-level data from the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Green Goods and Services survey to examine how the provision of so-called green goods and services has affected various aspects of the US economy. Our descriptive results reveal that those states and industries that were relatively green in 2010 became even greener in 2011. To investigate further we include green goods and services in a production function. The results show that between 2010 and 2011 industries that have increased their share of green employment have reduced their productivity although this negative correlation was only for the manufacture of green goods and not for the supply of green services. In further analysis we investigate skill-technology complementarities in the production of green goods and services and show that industries that increased their provision of green goods and services grew more slowly, reduced their expenditure on technology inputs and increased their demand for medium educated workers, whilst simultaneously reducing their demand for lower skilled workers.

To reduce CO2 emissions in China, it is important to determine influential factors of energy efficiency. This paper introduces a slacks-based measure window analysis approach to evaluate regional dynamic energy efficiency during 2001-2010, and then explores energy efficiency determinants by considering spatial effects, which is conducted based on spatial econometric models. The empirical results show that there exist evident spatial correlations between regional energy efficiencies in China. We find that, there exist evident disparities in cumulative effects of energy efficiency among the eastern, central and western areas. Interestingly, significant energy efficiency spatial spillovers can be clearly found between regions within the western area and across the eastern and western areas. It is found that, energy structure, energy price, railway transportation development and R&D stock are significant at national level. However, energy structure and railway transportation development are insignificant in the central and western areas, while energy price and R&D stock are insignificant in the eastern and central areas, respectively. Industrial structure and urbanization level are found to be insignificant at national level, but industrial structure is significant in the eastern and western areas, and urbanization level is significant in the central and western areas. Surprisingly, industrial structure and urbanization level are found to have positive impacts on energy efficiency in the western area. In addition to regional disparities and local conditions, policies making should take efficiency spatial spillovers into consideration. Several interesting policy implications are achieved.","[Lv, Kangjuan; Bian, Yiwen] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China; [Yu, Anyu] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; Tongji University,"Bian, YW (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China.",ywbian@shu.edu.cn,,"Bian, Yiwen/0000-0002-2345-8554",grants of Humanities and Social Sciences of National Ministry of Education of China [16YJAZH043]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71101085]; Shanghai 085 Project (Peak plateau project)-Social Development of Metropolis and Construction of Smart City [085SHDX001/ N.13-T319-16-204],"grants of Humanities and Social Sciences of National Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai 085 Project (Peak plateau project)-Social Development of Metropolis and Construction of Smart City","The authors would like to thank the editor and anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions, which helped to improve the manuscript.

Modelling efforts so far have focused on single, isolated societies, while multi-patch dynamical models representing networks of coupled socio-environmental systems have received limited attention. We propose a model of societal evolution that describes the dynamics of a population that harvests renewable resources and manufactures products that have positive effects on population growth. Collapse is driven by a critical transition that occurs when the rate of natural resource extraction passes beyond a certain point, for which we present numerical and analytical results. Applying the model to Easter Island gives a good fit to the archaeological record. Subsequently, we investigate what effects emerge from the movement of people, goods, and resources between two societies that share the characteristics of Easter Island. We analyse how diffusive coupling and wealth-driven coupling change the population levels and their distribution across the two societies compared to non-interacting societies. We find that the region of parameter space in which societies can stably survive in the long-term is significantly enlarged when coupling occurs in both social and environmental variables.

This paper applies input-output theory to explore ways to optimize carbon emission transfers between industrial sectors. First, China's inter-industrial carbon emission imports and exports were measured for years 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2010. Next, the economic effects of inter-industrial carbon emission transfers were assessed. Finally, strategies to optimize the carbon emission transfer structure were proposed, with the goal of achieving a win-win between industrial carbon emission reduction and economic development. Key study conclusions are as follows. (1) Inter-industrial carbon emission imports and exports in China are significant, and are increasing each year. Traditional energy industries have high carbon emission imports; processing and manufacturing industries have high carbon emission exports; and most light industries have relatively low levels of both carbon emission imports and exports. (2) Carbon emission transfer imports or exports can promote industrial development; combining both imports and exports leads to variable economic effects within specific industries. (3) To achieve the dual goals of carbon emission reduction and economic development, four strategies are proposed to optimize carbon emission transfer structures in different industries.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a grounded approach semi-structured interviews were held with actors with experience of food safety auditing. The aims and objectives being to obtain their viewpoints drawn from their experience. Findings - The purpose of food safety audits should be regarded as one of continuous improvement rather than a single snapshot or policing exercise. Audits in terms of cost can be excessive because of the often high number and frequency of them. Costs can be reduced and food safety standards maintained if the number and frequency of audits is determined by the level of hazard and risk that a product or a process presents. Effectiveness of audits can also be improved if they are unannounced to make businesses audit ready at all times. It is also contended that unannounced audits are not applicable in all circumstances as they can increase costs by the need to maintain a group of personnel that are always available for audits. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited by the scope and number of topics that were addressed in relation to the main subject. Originality/value - The research value points to a need to review and better manage the audit process by risk assessing the number, frequency and type of audit a food business is subject to without lowering standards.","[Bradford-Knox, Richard] RBK Consultants, Preston, Lancs, England",,"Bradford-Knox, R (通讯作者)，RBK Consultants, Preston, Lancs, England.",rbkconsultants@uwclub.net,,"Bradford-Knox, Richard/0000-0003-2271-0065",,,,,21,3,3,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, it contains high fat and sugar but lacks natural antioxidants. Several herbs in Thailand which are traditionally used as food ingredients show high antioxidant properties such as ginger and lemongrass. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop reduced sugar herbal ice cream using lemongrass and ginger extract. Design/methodology/approach - Two ice cream formulas were prepared by using the lemongrass or ginger extract at the levels of 10, 15 and 20 percent (w/w), respectively. Moreover, xylitol was added as a substituted sugar at 80, 90 and 100 percent (w/w). Sensory evaluation was conducted by nine-point hedonic scale. Moreover, the physical, chemical and microbiological properties of the final ice cream product were determined by comparing with the control formula. Findings - Based on the sensory evaluation, the two herbal ice cream formulas (15 percent lemongrass or ginger extract) with 90 percent xylitol replacement have the highest overall acceptability score of 7.28 and 7.44 (like moderately), respectively. The viscosity, overrun value and hardness of the reduced sugar herbal ice cream were not significantly different as compared to control formula (p = 0.05). The chemical composition analysis showed that the total sugar of the product decreased by 65 percent. Moreover, antioxidant activities of herbal ice creams were higher than the control formula. The number of total bacteria of reduced sugar herbal ice cream was less than 10 CFU/mL. Originality/value - The reduced sugar consumption is useful for lowering the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), especially diabetes mellitus. This paper presented the reduced sugar herbal ice cream formulas with high antioxidant activity. Therefore, these data could be the prototype in order to develop herbal and healthy ice cream product.","[Chamchan, Rungrat; Sinchaipanit, Pornrat; Disnil, Sasapin; Jittinandana, Sitima; Nitithamyong, Anadi; On-nom, Nattira] Mahidol Univ, Inst Nutr, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand",Mahidol University,"On-nom, N (通讯作者)，Mahidol Univ, Inst Nutr, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.",nattira.onn@mahidol.ac.th,,,"Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University","Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University","The researchers were grateful for the research funding from the Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University.",,45,10,10,2,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

For this, an empirical study was conducted on visitors to the event Milan Expo 2015. Particular attention was paid to any greater propensity to purchase products from socially responsible agri-food companies and whether the event might have contributed to enrich the baggage of their knowledge on the issues of sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) and to influence future buying behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - Different groups of visiting consumers were identified through cluster analysis in order to segment and divide visitors into groups based on their approach to food safety, food security and sustainability, their willingness to pay for products from companies practising CSR, and the impact of the event on their future buying behaviour. Findings - The results showed a positive attitude of respondents towards issues of food safety, food security and sustainability in general and to the purchase of sustainable food products. However, due to shortcomings in the communication strategy used by companies attending the event, the sample of visitors did not enrich their knowledge on sustainability and CSR. The impact of Expo 2015 on future buying behaviour was far from impressive. Originality/value - The findings are particularly useful for the future development of the reputation and profitability of food companies, for the enrichment of knowledge concerning CSR-oriented food companies and to increase the price of products from socially responsible agri-food companies.","[Civero, Gennaro; Scarpato, Debora] Univ Napoli Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Naples, Italy; [Rusciano, Vincenzo] Univ Napoli Parthenope, Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; Parthenope University Naples,"Civero, G (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Naples, Italy.",gennaro.civero@gmail.com,"Civero, Gennaro/ABB-9558-2020","Civero, Gennaro/0000-0001-7466-7076; Rusciano, Vincenzo/0000-0002-3975-4577",,,,,43,22,22,3,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The design of the Checklist was based on 18 procedural food skills identified by teachers and verified by analysis of skills in recipes that are typically used in food education programmes in secondary schools. The skills were divided into five skill-sets and a recipe covering the skills was selected to test the Checklist. For the test, three hypothetical situations of a person with low, some and expert skills making the recipe were demonstrated in separate videos. Teachers were invited to test the Checklist by viewing the videos, completing the Checklist for each of the three conditions and completing an evaluation. Findings - In total, 40 home economics teachers tested the Checklist and reported that they could use the tool to measure the development and progress of their students' procedural food skills. Analysis of variance analyses of the data and the non-parametric analyses suggest that the Checklist is a reliable and valid evaluation tool. Originality/value - Teachers report using various tools to measure their students' food skills acquisition but these have not been well-documented in the literature. These preliminary findings of an original and quantifiable tool showed that home economics teachers used the Checklist to measure their students' procedural skills however, as the teachers' comments suggest, further development and validation of the tool are required.","[Fordyce-Voorham, Sandra] Univ Wollongong, Fac Sci Med & Hlth, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Fordyce-Voorham, Sandra] Mentone Girls Grammar Sch, Food & Nutr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Fordyce-Voorham, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Fac Sci Med & Hlth, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.;Fordyce-Voorham, S (通讯作者)，Mentone Girls Grammar Sch, Food & Nutr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",sfordyce@mentonegirls.vic.edu.au,,,,,,,23,2,2,1,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The data used in this research come from a first time-use survey applied in Santiago in 2007 and 2008, which works with a retrospective activity journal to document the amount of time dedicated to different activities during the 24 hours of the previous day. Descriptive analysis and multinomial regressions were performed on a sample size of 2,282 cases, corresponding to those individuals over the age of 12 who responded to the daily activity prompt in full. Findings - This study shows that people in Santiago tend to eat according to the same timetables (morning, midday and evening) and that socio-demographic variables have limited influence on the synchronization of this intake between Monday and Friday. Research limitations/implications - The data did not allow for the exploration of the duration of food intake, commensality and its variation over time. Practical implications - These data reveal that, for Santiago residents, eating is far from becoming de-structured towards a mode of constant grazing throughout the day, contradicting the thesis of alimentary modernity.

Design/methodology/approach - Owing to the technical aspects of this paper, a literature review based on academic papers (history) and articles coming from the professional press, internet websites and public organizations was made. Findings - It was found that frauds have always existed. Forgers are constantly in search of new ways of counterfeiting wines. Producers have had to adapt to the various forms of counterfeiting, mainly by resorting to modern technology. As the traceability of great wines is becoming crucial, a new type of relationships between producers anxious to offer genuine estate wines and consumers anxious to drink the bottles they ordered has developed. This new constraint became a marketing opportunity for producers. Research limitations/implications - It was difficult to obtain official data (interviews or surveys) because of the sensitiveness of the topic. Practical implications - This paper, which offers an inventory of the methods used by forgers to deceive customers, makes both producers and consumers aware of the extent of the problem.

Specifically, our research focuses on students from The Department of ` Culture and Tourism Business Management' of The Technological Educational Institute (TEI) of Central Greece in Amphissa, the capital of Phokis Prefecture (near Delphi). This is a popular tourist destination with significant cultural and archeological monuments with a major cultural and historical impact worldwide and locally. We quantitatively examine the role and effect of extracurricular experience within the vicinity of students' immediate academic environment, in constructing student perception, as well as study its influence in creating a comprehensive perception of heritage at large. Our methodology is based on a pilot research in which students participated using questionnaires. Students of this particular department were chosen as they are expected to be ` semi-informed' individuals with a predetermined inclination towards tourism, heritage and heritage interpretation, relevant to their studies. The specific choice of semi-informed specimen allows for a high level of accuracy in the quantitative aspect of the research. The study also looks at how experiences can subsequently re-shape student perceptions by urging them to become more closely attached to the culture and heritage of a place, be it by way of sightseeing landmarks or adhering to local customs as culturally aware members of their community. Our findings indicate that student experience significantly influences the interpretation of heritage and, in turn, cultural perceptions, and the latent potential, prospects and options such experiences may afford students thereafter.","[Makridis, Savvas; Vrasida, Maria] Technol Educ Inst TEI Cent Greece, Dept Culture & Tourism Business Management, Amphissa, Greece; [Alexiou, Spyridon] Technol Educ Inst TEI Cent Greece, Dept Mkt & Advertising, Amphissa, Greece",,"Makridis, S (通讯作者)，Technol Educ Inst TEI Cent Greece, Dept Culture & Tourism Business Management, Amphissa, Greece.",sabbas_makridis@yahoo.gr,,,,,,,61,1,1,1,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-47732-9; 978-3-319-47731-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,467,482,,10.1007/978-3-319-47732-9_31,0.0,,,16,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI3AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410645700030,0

I analyze remittance flows with a model that estimates regional (urban and rural) budget shares of consumption and investment expenditure categories for rural and urban households. An important contribution of the paper is that it analyzes the effect of remittances in the regions where spending takes place, which is not necessarily the same as the region where the households originating this spending reside. Using the multinomial logit approach, I control for potential selectivity and endogeneity biases of remittances. The results show that remittances lead to significantly increasing marginal productive investments in urban regions at the expense of rural regions. The fundamental finding of the study is that remittances influence the flight of productive capital out of rural areas into urban regions (a pattern similar to the crowding-out effect of the Dutch Disease). The analysis carried out in this paper can be applied to other temporary income transfers and exogenous spending injected in the region that affect households' regional expenditure patterns.","[Manic, Marian] Whitman Coll, Dept Econ, 345 Boyer Ave, Walla Walla, WA 99362 USA",Whitman College,"Manic, M (通讯作者)，Whitman Coll, Dept Econ, 345 Boyer Ave, Walla Walla, WA 99362 USA.",manicm@whitman.edu,,"Manic, Marian/0000-0001-8820-1904",Darla Moore School of Business Research Grant Program; CIBER; University of South Carolina Division of Research funds; University of South Carolina Department of Economics grant,Darla Moore School of Business Research Grant Program; CIBER; University of South Carolina Division of Research funds; University of South Carolina Department of Economics grant,"I thank journal co-editor Steven Brakman and two anonymous reviewers for their pertinent inputs and observations.

However, there are technological challenges when adding functional components and substituting sugar in foods. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the influence of packaging and storage time on the sensory profile of functional diet guava preserve added with prebiotics, supporting the development of functional and sugar-free products and contributing to the product variety in the market. Design/methodology/approach - A two-factor full factorial design was conducted in triplications that evaluated transparent and opaque packaging vs storage time (six months). The products were stored in packages with different light permeability (transparent and opaque). Quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) and acceptance tests were performed. Findings - The packaging material did not affect the sensory changes of functional diet guava preserve during the six months of storage. QDA test showed that from three months of storage the original characteristics of the product were lost and a slight decrease in overall acceptance was observed after four and six months. However, during the six months the products had good acceptance; consequently, it was not possible to establish their rejection before this period. Research limitations/implications - More detailed studies regarding a longer storage period, including the physical and chemical measurements must be done to clarify other points about the influence of packaging and storage time on the sensory profile of functional diet guava preserve added with prebiotics. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications - The development of a functional and sugar-free preserve is a good alternative to provide a product that meets the actual consumer desires and adds value to the product. However, there are technological challenges when adding functional components and substituting sugar in foods. Thus, this study provides important information for the development of sugar-free and functional products, and to prolong their shelf life. Originality/value - There are few studies with respect to the sensory aspects during the storage of functional preserves. Thus, this work will aid future studies, supporting the development of functional and sugar-free products and contributing to the product variety in the market.","[Mesquita, Karina Scatolino; de Souza, Vanessa Rios; Rodrigues, Jessica Ferreira; Borges, Soraia Vilela; Souza Carneiro, Joao de Deus; Marques Pinheiro, Ana Carla] Univ Fed Lavras, Lavras, Brazil; [Menezes, Camila Carvalho] Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto,"Rodrigues, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Lavras, Lavras, Brazil.",jessikfr5@hotmail.com,"Pinheiro, Ana Carla Marques/K-9647-2015; Borges, Soraia/AAG-7480-2019","Borges, Soraia/0000-0002-1612-1363; FERREIRA RODRIGUES, JESSICA/0000-0003-0113-4898",,,,,53,2,2,1,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

It has an attractive appearance, with a golden-yellow peel colour at harvest and slight colour development during ripening. Its peel colour could possibly be used as an indicator for ripeness. Assessing the behaviour of peel colour during storage is the main objective of this research. Mangoes were kept at cool temperature (13 degrees C) for 2 weeks prior moving to ambient temperature in Thailand (28 degrees C). The data set was separated into two groups for non-destructive and destructive tests. In the non-destructive set, peel colour of 108 fruits was measured repeatedly until the quality became unacceptable. In the destructive set, 60 fruits were sampled at random to measure the peel colour and other quality attributes, each time on different fruit. Mangoes from two growing locations were compared. The results showed that peel colour (L*, a*, b* and Hue) developed gradually during cool storage, but changed drastically after relocation to higher temperatures. The L* a* and b* values and hue angle behaved according to a logistic function. a* and b* showed an increase, L* and hue a decrease. The variation is clearly high at the beginning and decreased gradually during the storage period. Fruit from both the non-destructive and destructive sets showed similar behaviour during storage. The obtained results allow prediction of the behaviour of peel colour during cool storage.","[Penchaiya, P.] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Bioresources & Technol, Div Postharvest Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Penchaiya, P.] Postharvest Technol Innovat Ctr, Commiss Higher Educ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Tijskens, M.

In order to identify student preferences, we used the Dutch Test for Conflict Handling (DUTCH), which has previously been proven as a reliable and valid measurement instrument with good psychometric qualities. The questionnaire consists of 20 items grouped in five sections pertaining to five conflict management strategies: problem solving, yielding, forcing, avoiding, and compromising. Besides detecting general student preferences regarding conflict management strategies, the goal was to examine whether there are statistically significant differences with regard to respondents' gender, study program and the degree of career ambition. Results based on the sample of 107 final year students of the Faculty of Economics University of Rijeka, Croatia showed that problem solving and compromising were the most widely used conflict management strategies, while yielding was used the least. Significant differences in implementing conflict management strategies were detected with regard to the study program. Furthermore, female students were found to have the strongest preference towards the strategies of problem solving and compromising, while male students prefer forcing as strongly as compromising and problem solving. Business schools have the obligation to prepare students for modern business environment in which many concepts have been revisited and revised. Fragmentation has been replaced by integration of capabilities, capacities and resources, and increased interdependence leading to co-sourcing, partnerships, alliances and various other short and long-term cooperation agreements. Understanding behavioral patterns among individuals studying economics is very important because they will be future managers and leaders. Considering their conflict management behavioral preferences, it can be concluded that the surveyed students exhibit the right attitude and are therefore well prepared for their future working conditions and demands.","[Rupcic, Natasa] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Svegar, Domagoj] Univ Rijeka, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Sveucilisna Ave 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Rupcic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",natasa.rupcic@efri.hr; domagoj.svegar@uniri.hr,"Rupcic, Natasa/R-4488-2018","Rupcic, Natasa/0000-0002-9915-8881",University of Rijeka [13.02.1.3.06],University of Rijeka,The authors wish to thank Edita Gaica for her invaluable help in coordinating students during the pursuit of data collection.

This paper adapts the understanding of the different stages and argues the need to develop a critical consciousness for halal integrity within the food chain to address the needs of the ever-growing Muslim consumers' market. The purpose of this paper is to propose a definition of halal integrity using farm to fork and global food supply chain models. Design/methodology/approach - The study includes a review of priori literature and media reports regarding cross-contamination of food products with haram (forbidden) components. This background will be used to conceptualise halal integrity using farm to fork and global supply chain models. Findings - Different interpretations of halal - what is permitted and what is prohibited - exist for the different schools of Islamic legal thought and within the customs of different countries. In order to ensure that food production is embracive of the religious needs of the global Muslim customer market, this paper utilises the farm to fork and global supply chain models to foster a critical awareness of halal needs. Halal integrity should be clearly presenting the details of the halal status of the product and assuring that the requirements for halal as stated are met. Halal integrity not only deals with permitted and prohibited foods, but that the halal status of the food products (i.e. from raw materials until it reaches the consumers) should not be breached (i.e. no cross-contamination with haram products/methods and no ill intents). A formal definition of halal integrity has been proposed. Research limitations/implications - The SWOT analyses serve as a guideline as the analysis done may be outdated as the environments are constantly changing. Originality/value - This research although academic is meant to have a real value in improving the integrity of the halal food supply chain, providing value to the food industry, to countries that are concerned about this supply chain and to Muslim consumers.

Design/methodology/approach - The research setting of this study is a Facebook group specifically for food buying, with population of 2,387 members who are interested in OFGB. Among 2,387 members in the case group, there were 1,286 members clicked on the questionnaire, and 254 of them participated in the survey and returned valid responses. In total, 254 valid questionnaires were collected for 19.75 percent usable response rate (254 out of 1,286). Findings - Results of this study proved that harmonious passion can improve both long-term intrinsic enjoyment and short-term positive feelings, while exert no effects on impulse buying. On the other hand, obsessive passion can significantly stimulate both impulse buying and compulsive buying, and strengthen short-term positive feelings as well. Originality/value - It is interesting to find that buying more does not make consumers feel better based on the evidence that impulse buying and compulsive buying performed no positive influences to both short-term and long-term mental status.","[Wang, Yao-Chin] Univ Arkansas, Sch Human Environm Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Tsai, Chen-Tsang Simon] Tainan Univ Technol, Dept Food & Beverage Serv, Tainan, Taiwan",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Tsai, CTS (通讯作者)，Tainan Univ Technol, Dept Food & Beverage Serv, Tainan, Taiwan.",simontsai0225@gmail.com,"Wang, Yao-Chin/T-9434-2019","Wang, Yao-Chin/0000-0001-7949-7977",,,,,52,15,15,5,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The conducted studies aim to identify types of products and determine motives that Polish adults take into consideration when buying organic food. The studies have been also conducted to indicate the most common barriers that appear when purchasing this type of products. The above-mentioned aims are carried out in the context of a level of education among consumers of organic food. Design/methodology/approach - A diagnostic survey method with authors' questionnaire was used in the studies to examine 3436 respondents from all over the Poland. The studies were conducted in 2015. After the use of construction and validation procedures, a five-point Likert scale was applied to measure the attitudes. An indicator of scale reliability was calculated where Cronbach's a was 0.85. The education was a criterion that divided respondents into study groups. Findings - The population was divided taking into account the place of residence: villages, towns up to 30 thousand inhabitants and towns over 30 thousand inhabitants. In the next stage of sample selection, respondents were proportionally divided according to their sex. Women constituted 51.3 percent, while men 48.7 percent. All respondents were of legal age. These methodological procedures allowed calculating a size of sample, where the level of confidence was set at 0.95, the estimated size fraction at 0.50 and the maximum error at 0.05. Originality/value - There is a need for increased education on the importance of organic food and its influence on human health, especially among the young generation of Polish consumers. The conducted education should be aimed at encouraging producers and in particular sellers to promote sale of organic food in their stores, and thus to label it appropriately for easier identification by consumers. The barriers and motives presented in this paper which occur when buying organic food are identical to those that occur in developed and developing countries.","[Wojciechowska-Solis, Julia] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Agritourism & Rural Dev, Lublin, Poland; [Soroka, Andrzej] Univ Nat Sci & Humanities Siedlce, Dept Tourism & Recreat, Siedlce, Poland",University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Wojciechowska-Solis, J (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Agritourism & Rural Dev, Lublin, Poland.",julia.wojciechowska@gmail.com,,"Wojciechowska-Solis, Julia/0000-0002-4634-0241; Soroka, Andrzej/0000-0002-7673-6116",,,,,33,23,23,4,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The survey results contained in this paper focus on three product categories - mango, potato chips and wine. The survey revealed that when faced with climate-adapted mango, potato chips or wine products, respondents were most likely to substitute or purchase less often rather than purchasing a more expensive 'adapted' product or a cheaper 'non-adapted' product. Across the three commodities, the level of acceptance also varied little with socio-demographic factors and the respondent's perceptions of climate change.

Widespread tree loss, therefore, would lead to degradations in environmental quality, which might have spillover effects on human health. For the first time, the infant health externalities of tree loss caused by an invasive species are investigated. We exploit a quasi-experimental setting where millions of ash trees have been destroyed in the US due to the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB). Since EAB spread is quasi-random due to flight and weather, and since ash tree loss due to EAB is extensive, our research design can eliminate many environmental confounders of concern. We use rich, mother-level natality data covering the near-universe of US births over 1999-2015. Difference-in-differences results suggest that along the intensive margin, birth weight and gestation are lower by 12.19 g and 0.024 weeks, respectively, after EAB detection in the mother's county of residence. Along the extensive margin, the probability that a mother has a low birth weight baby increases by 0.2%, equivalent to an increase of 16.2 per 100,000 live annual births. Results are robust to using the synthetic control method and the Lasso method. An internal validity test shows that findings are not due to the changing composition of mothers after EAB.","[Jones, Benjamin A.] Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Jones, BA (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, 1 UNM Dr,MSC 05 3060, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",bajones@unm.edu,,,,,,,51,7,11,1,61,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

An Analysis of the Position of Environmental Professionals in the Conceptual Debate on Payments for Ecosystem Services,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Conservation; Environmental Management; Environmental Governance; United Kingdom,MARKET-BASED INSTRUMENTS; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; COUNTRIES; AMERICA; EQUITY; ISSUES; KEY,"Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are becoming increasingly widespread as they are being promoted by government and non-governmental organisations across the globe. Alongside this, an academic debate has unfolded regarding how PES ought to be conceptualized and defined. Using the first survey of environmental professionals on this topic, we explore their position in this conceptual debate in the UK. Our study shows that all aspects of the key academic debates are reflected in the views of environmental professionals, whose range of understandings suggests no viewpoint is either dominant or uncontested. Expecting all to share a single 'perfect' definition of PES may be neither necessary nor feasible. However, at present this term invokes a very wide range of ideas that may generate frictions as PES are further implemented. This risks PES becoming a 'mess' from which few insights can be derived as to whether, when and why they are useful instruments. It essential that those debating and proposing PES concepts more closely consider the complex processes by which professionals engage with and shape its application as an abstract construct.","[Martin-Ortega, Julia] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Waylen, Kerry A.] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",University of Leeds; James Hutton Institute,"Martin-Ortega, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",j.martinortega@leeds.ac.uk,"Waylen, Kerry/B-1867-2008","Waylen, Kerry/0000-0002-6593-2795",Scottish Government Strategic Research Programme 2016-2021; 'Shut up and Write' writing club of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds,Scottish Government Strategic Research Programme 2016-2021; 'Shut up and Write' writing club of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds,"This research was co-funded by the Scottish Government Strategic Research Programme 2016-2021 and water@leeds, the interdisciplinary centre for water research of the University of Leeds.

Therefore, in this study, the semi-closed IO model is integrated with a HEM to calculate CO2 emissions arising from the social consumption pattern and income distribution, and to explore economic drivers behind CO2 variations. This method is applied to a case study of Beijing. Result demonstrate that Beijing in 2012 witnessed something different from that in 2005: (1) CO2 emissions centred in the internal linkages of a broader class of consumption terms with high economic output, mainly driven by interprovincial exports; (2) imports increasingly helped decarbonize the mixed, net forward and backward CO2 linkages of consumption items; and (3) income-driven CO2 emissions excluding demand-side parts persisted, which were more obvious on the supply side where households have more economy-wide effects. Besides, urban households played an essential role in household wide CO2 reductions.

Yet, there is little evidence for the assumed demand and applicability of valuation knowledge in real-life policy and decision-making processes, and the use of such knowledge has received little in-depth analytical attention. Motivated by these observations, we have conducted an empirical analysis of ecosystem service value knowledge use. Our analysis of policy actors' experiences and expectations regarding value knowledge in Finland's peatland policy draws on ten interviews with eleven policy actors. Focusing on the usefulness and uses of valuation knowledge, we analyze the ways in which values are framed and value knowledge is expected to influence the rights to use ecosystem services. Our analysis shows that policy actors expect a better understanding of ecosystem service values to support the consideration of benefits. Yet, what they view as crucial knowledge needs aligns with their sectoral or organizational position as well as the interests they represent. Hence, valuation does not provide a solution to distributional debates or conflicts over rights, but it can have an important function as the provider of background knowledge.","[Primmer, Eeva; Saarikoski, Heli] Finnish Environm Inst, POB 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland; [Vatn, Arild] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway",Finnish Environment Institute; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Primmer, E (通讯作者)，Finnish Environm Inst, POB 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland.",eeva.primmer@ymparisto.fi; heli.saarikoski@ymparisto.fi; arild.vatn@nmbu.no,,"Primmer, Eeva/0000-0001-8954-8205",Academy of Finland [275772]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [275772] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"This analysis has been conducted in the project 'Potential and Pitfalls of Alternative Approaches to Ecosystem Service Valuation (ValuES)' funded by the Academy of Finland (project number 275772).

We show that the well-established notion of making climate change mitigation actions an integral part of sound development plans is especially relevant for technology transfer.

Both were scientific giants, and great teachers and advocates. But even giants make mistakes, and in both cases the mistakes became more evident in the decades after they received the glittering prize. Fogel's late-career studies of health and welfare, though admirably serious examples of applied economics right to the end, were less scientifically pioneering than his work on railways or slavery. North's much more influential advocacy-and very much less his practice-of neo-institutionalism, by contrast, was probably a scientific error. Fogel realized more and more the salience of ethics in the economy, and even taught (philosophically unsophisticated) courses on business ethics. North drifted further and further from the essentially ethical underpinnings of an innovative economy, speaking of brain science rather than the mind-scanning equipment of the humanities, and led his many followers in the drift.","[McCloskey, Deirdre Nansen] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"McCloskey, DN (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",deirdre2@uic.edu,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2018,12.0,3,,,,,435,449,,10.1007/s11698-017-0168-7,0.0,,,15,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,GR4XE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442623500003,0

On the one hand, it provides what appears to be the first game-theoretic modeling of Napoleon's last campaign, which ended dramatically on June 18, 1815, at Waterloo. It is specifically concerned with the decision Napoleon made on June 17, 1815, to detach part of his army and send it against the Prussians, whom he had defeated, though not destroyed, on June 16 at Ligny. Military strategists and historians agree that this decision was crucial but disagree about whether it was rational. Hypothesizing a zero-sum game between Napoleon and Blucher, and computing its solution, we show that dividing his army could have been a cautious strategy on Napoleon's part, a conclusion which runs counter to the charges of misjudgment commonly heard since Clausewitz. On the other hand, the paper addresses some methodological issues relative to analytic narratives. Some political scientists and economists who are both formally and historically minded have proposed to explain historical events in terms of properly mathematical game-theoretic models. We liken the present study to this analytic narrative methodology, which we defend against some of objections that it has aroused. Generalizing beyond the Waterloo case, we argue that military campaigns provide an especially good opportunity for testing this new methodology.","[Mongin, Philippe] CNRS, GREGHEC, Jouy En Josas, France; [Mongin, Philippe] HEC Paris, Jouy En Josas, France; [Mongin, Philippe] Univ Pantheon Assas, LEMMA, Paris, France; [Mongin, Philippe] Labex MMEDII, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Mongin, P (通讯作者)，CNRS, GREGHEC, Jouy En Josas, France.;Mongin, P (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, Jouy En Josas, France.;Mongin, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pantheon Assas, LEMMA, Paris, France.;Mongin, P (通讯作者)，Labex MMEDII, Paris, France.",mongin@greg-hec.com,"Azevedo, Micheline/JHT-0825-2023",,,,,,55,7,8,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2018,12.0,3,,,,,451,480,,10.1007/s11698-017-0162-0,0.0,,,30,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,GR4XE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442623500004,0

Similarly, the higher the mortgage depth in the country of ancestry, the higher the present value of the monthly mortgage payments. Our results suggest that social norms regarding mortgage finance in the country of ancestry matter in determining immigrants' mortgage finance in the host country. More specifically, the effect of social norms on the decision to have a mortgage (the extensive margin) and the amount of the mortgage payments (the intensive margin) is about one third and tenth the size of the effect of having a college degree on mortgage debt, respectively. Evidence of strong persistence of culture among those with longer tenure in the host country, those who immigrated as children or young adults, and second-generation immigrants suggests that vertical transmission of beliefs (from parents to children) is a plausible channel of transmission. Perhaps most importantly, we find that cultural attitudes regarding property rights are most relevant when explaining individuals' decision to get a mortgage, but those regarding credit information matter most when explaining the amount of the mortgage debt.","[Rodriguez-Planas, Nuria] Queens Coll, Dept Econ, Powdermaker Hall,65-30 Kissena Blvd, Queens, NY 11367 USA",,"Rodríguez-Planas, N (通讯作者)，Queens Coll, Dept Econ, Powdermaker Hall,65-30 Kissena Blvd, Queens, NY 11367 USA.",nuria.rodriguezplanas@qc.cuny.edu,"Rodriguez-Planaz, Nuria/AAF-6282-2021","Rodriguez-Planas, Nuria/0000-0003-3824-7001",Mellon Diversity Enhancement Research Grant from the Andrew W.

Using the Research-Integration-Utilization (RIU) model of scientific knowledge transfer, we identify and analyze different actors' roles in the spheres of Research, Integration and Utilization across different governance levels, from the German federal states to the World Heritage Committee. In addition, the RIU model serves to normatively examine the process and determine quality criteria that were useful for a successful inscription as World Heritage. The paper highlights the opportunities of using scientific knowledge in the multi-level governance of international conventions.","[Heim, Janina] Bundesamt Nat Schutz, Konstantinstr 110, D-53179 Bonn, Germany; [Krott, Max] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Busgenweg 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Boecher, Michael] Otto von Guericke Univ, Zschokkestr 32, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany",University of Gottingen; Otto von Guericke University,"Heim, J (通讯作者)，Bundesamt Nat Schutz, Konstantinstr 110, D-53179 Bonn, Germany.",Janina.Heim@BfN.de,,,"Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) [3513810200]","Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB)","This work was supported by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) under Grant 3513810200.

Historical evidence on the incidence, costs, and determinants of financial crises (the most extreme form of financial instability), combined with narratives on some famous financial crises, suggests that financial crises have many causes, including credit-driven asset price booms, which have become more prevalent in recent decades, but in general financial crises are very heterogeneous and hard to categorize. Moreover, evidence shows that the association across the country sample between credit booms, asset price booms, and serious financial crises is quite weak.","[Bordo, Michael D.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Jersey Hall,75 Hamilton St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Bordo, MD (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Jersey Hall,75 Hamilton St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",bordo@economics.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,133,10,13,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

Such waters, and their associated ecosystem services, offer multiple benefits. Valuation and bargaining can play a key role in the sharing of these ecosystems services and their associated benefits across sovereign borders. Ecosystem services in transboundary watercourses essentially constitute a portfolio of assets. While challenging, their commodification, which creates property rights, supports trading. Such trading offers a means by which to resolve conflicts over competing uses and allows states to optimise their 'portfolios'. However, despite this potential, adoption of appropriate treaty frameworks that might facilitate a market-based approach to the discovery and allocation of water-related ecosystem services at the transboundary level remains both a challenge and a topic worthy of further study. Drawing upon concepts in law and economics, this paper therefore seeks to advance the study of how treaty frameworks might be developed in a way that supports such a market-based approach to ecosystem services and transboundary waters.","[Macatangay, Rafael Emmanuel] Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Rieu-Clarke, Alistair] Northumbria Univ, Law Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Dundee; Northumbria University,"Rieu-Clarke, A (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Law Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",r.e.a.macatangay@dundee.ac.uk; Alistair.rieu-clarke@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Rieu-Clarke, Alistair/0000-0003-1492-133X; Macatangay, Rafael Emmanuel/0000-0001-8604-9347",,,,,100,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Economic theories model growth in an exponential manner and central policy institutions regard growth rates of 2-3% to be normal, also implying growth to be exponential. In this paper we investigate empirically whether economic growth is indeed exponential by estimating autoregressive integrated moving average time series models based on gross domestic product data for 18 mature economies from 1960 to 2013. Our findings cast doubts on whether these commonly discussed economic growth paths reflect the economic reality: only two out of 18 mature countries depict exponential growth rates above these levels. Five have lower exponential growth and the development of eleven countries exhibit rather linear growth. Additionally, we show that prominent theories of economic growth assume growth to be exponential and that a more heterogeneous set of theories is needed to explain different patterns of growth across time and space.","[Lange, Steffen] Inst Ecol Econ Res, Potsdamer Str 105, D-10785 Berlin, Germany; [Puetz, Peter] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Stat, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Kopp, Thomas] Univ Goettingen, Agr Market Anal, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Kopp, T (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Agr Market Anal, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",Steffen.Lange@ioew.de; peter.puetz@uni-goettingen.de; thomas.kopp@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Kopp, Thomas/JYP-3141-2024","Kopp, Thomas/0000-0003-2181-4727; Lange, Steffen/0000-0003-2831-6835; Putz, Peter/0000-0002-2948-0189",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the project Digitalization and Sustainability [01UU1607B]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [KO 5269/1-1],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the project Digitalization and Sustainability; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Funding for this research was granted by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the project Digitalization and Sustainability (www.nachhaltige-digitalisierung.de/en/) (Grant # 01UU1607B) and by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within project KO 5269/1-1.,,61,8,8,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In this paper, we estimate the income obtained from roundwood and irapay palm (Lepidocaryum tenue Mart.) fronds by 79 households living in three Amazonian rural communities where harvest and trade of forest products is the main economic activity. These communities are found in the upper, mid-upper and mid-lower Nanay River Basin (northeastern Peru). We analyze data from a survey of these households conducted in 2009-2010. Results show that both work time and forest income are the highest in the upper Basin, the area furthest from the main urban market in the region, Iquitos. The highest forest income per hour worked, however, is found in the mid-upper Basin. The estimated incomes are equivalent to a low-to-mid level salary in Iquitos, suggesting that the economic incentive is not high enough for these rural households to move to an urban area. Our findings also indicate that the most remote community may be more vulnerable to resource access regulation changes.","[De Onate-Calvin, Ruth] Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Sch Forestry Engn & Nat Resources, Madrid, Spain; [Oviedo, Jose L.] CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies IPP, Madrid, Spain; [Salo, Matti] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Econ & Soc Unit, Turku, Finland; [Salo, Matti] Univ Turku, Biodivers Unit, Turku, Finland",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Turku,"Oviedo, JL (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Publ Goods & Policies IPP, Madrid, Spain.",jose.oviedo@csic.es,"Oviedo, Jose L./F-7641-2016; Salo, Matti/D-3292-2011","Oviedo, Jose L./0000-0003-2043-5020; Salo, Matti/0000-0002-6328-5299",Agenda Espanola de Cooperacion y Desarrollo (Grant MAEC-AECID); Kone Foundation; Finnish Cultural Foundation,Agenda Espanola de Cooperacion y Desarrollo (Grant MAEC-AECID); Kone Foundation; Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science),"Ruth De Onate-Calvin and Jose L.

Results show large discrepancies between Bolivian records and those of its main trade partners during the First World War. Whereas the gap decreased thereafter, it stayed particularly high in the case of exports. This seems to be explained by mistakes in the geographical assignment by the trade partners rather than by an overvaluation of official Bolivian figures. This suggests that landlockness may have had a significant negative effect on the accuracy of trade statistics from the, a priori, more reliable countries. The study also helps to revisit the debate concerning the effect that tin exploitation had on the rest of the Bolivian economy during the first half of the 20th century.","[Alejandro Peres-Cajias, Jose] Univ Catolica Boliviana San Pablo, La Paz, Bolivia; [Carreras-Marin, Anna] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Alejandro Peres-Cajias, Jose] Escuela Prod & Competitividad, Ave 14 Septiembre,Esq C 2,Bloque G, La Paz, Bolivia; [Carreras-Marin, Anna] Dept Hist Econ Inst Polit & Econ Mundial, Ave Diagonal 690,Edifici Principal Torre 2, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Peres-Cajías, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Boliviana San Pablo, La Paz, Bolivia.;Peres-Cajías, JA (通讯作者)，Escuela Prod & Competitividad, Ave 14 Septiembre,Esq C 2,Bloque G, La Paz, Bolivia.",jperes@mpd.ucb.edu.bo; annacarrerasmarin@ub.edu,"Peres-Cajías, José Alejandro/O-6432-2019; Carreras-Marin, Anna/D-4328-2014","Peres-Cajías, José Alejandro/0000-0002-9516-6825; Carreras-Marin, Anna/0000-0002-0235-3323","Science and Innovation Ministry of Spain (MINECO/FEDER, UE) [ECO2015-65049-C2-2-P]; Swedish Research Links/Vetenskapsradet [2016-05721]; Swedish Research Council [2016-05721] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council","Science and Innovation Ministry of Spain (MINECO/FEDER, UE); Swedish Research Links/Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council)","This research has benefited from financial support from the Science and Innovation Ministry of Spain through the project Market integration and its spatial impact: Latin American regions in the very long term (1890-2010) (ECO2015-65049-C2-2-P; MINECO/FEDER, UE).

We utilize the input oriented constant (CRS) and variable (VRS) returns to scale data efficiency analysis models to evaluate the efficiency of firms. Scale efficiency and the respective types of returns to scale have been examined by using DEA models with ratio inputs and outputs. We pay attention to the global frontier and the firm's own sector and size frontiers. We highlight the sources of inefficiency and suggestions are proposed to improve efficiencies of R&D resources allocation. The analysis is based on a representative set of (quasi-) permanent R&D active firms in Belgium. We consider R&D related inputs in the year 2009 and include firm performance in terms of turnover and net added value per employee in a four year time span. The paper highlights that on average, R&D active firms suffer from both technical inefficiency and scale size problems since the average of the CRS and the VRS efficiency are low, and also the average of scale efficiency is modest. According to firm size, small-sized firms suffer from scale and technical inefficiency. Medium-sized firms endure scale inefficiency rather than technical inefficiency. Large firms present a higher average scale efficiency and technical efficiency. According to sector of activity, firms in specialized supplier industries tend to outperform other firms in terms of average scale efficiency and average technical efficiency. Firms in science based industries are found to underperform on average in terms of VRS and scale efficiency. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies aimed at addressing non-point source pollution have primarily analyzed the effectiveness of conservation practices (CPs) as land-management strategies. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these practices have not been compared to those of possible land-use changes. We develop a spatially explicit integrated modeling approach that compares the effectiveness and economic efficiency of alternative spatially optimal land-use and-management strategies for P abatement in the Sandusky River watershed. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and data on costs and profits from crop and forest production and urban development, we evaluated joint impacts on P reduction and economic-returns for optimized land-use changes and/or implementation of CPs in the watershed. Results showed a combination of both CPs and land-use changes are likely required to meet current abatement targets for dissolved reactive phosphorus. Additionally, the combination of these approaches can generate a positive, synergistic effect on economic efficiency in meeting key policy targets. This is largely because the combined strategy will establish CPs on the most productive cropland, while achieving greater nutrient reduction through land-use change away from corn-soybean rotations on less productive lands.","[Xu, Hui; Brown, Daniel G.; Moore, Michael R.; Currie, William S.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Xu, H (通讯作者)，Argonne Natl Lab, Energy Syst Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60439 USA.",xuhui@umich.edu,"Xu, Hui/K-6803-2019; Brown, Dan/L-8089-2013","Xu, Hui/0000-0003-2994-4892; Brown, Dan/0000-0001-6023-5950","National Science Foundation [1039043]; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering [1039043] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant number 1039043].,,70,28,32,1,93,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Sophisticated modelling tools such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) are employed to capture both direct and indirect damages. However, quantitative assessments are often incomplete, dominated by environmental aspects. Land uses are a multidisciplinary matter and environmental and sustainable development policies intertwine. Yet, LCAs mostly focus on environmental impacts excluding socioeconomic implications of land occupation. This paper investigates the limitations of current LULUC modelling practices in LCA. Common LCA assumptions harbor value choices reflect a post-positivist epistemology that are often non-transparent to e.g. policymakers. They particularly influence the definition of the functional unit, the reference system and system boundaries, among other LCA methodological choices. Consequently, results informing land policies may be biased towards determined development strategies or hide indirect effects and socioeconomic damages caused by large-scale land acquisitions, such as violation of tenure rights, speculation and displacement. Quantitative assessments of LULUC impacts are certainly useful but should holistically encompass both direct and indirect impacts concerning the environmental and the social science dimension of LULUC. An epistemological shift towards a dialectic approach would facilitate the integration of multiple tools and methods and a critical interpretation of results.

The planning process is demonstrated by the development of a resilient city strategy - in this case, by the city of Pecs. The main goal of a city (in the case of Pecs: to become a sustainable city) determines policy directives and the functional areas involved, whilst the strategic goals and sub-goals of the functional areas influence projects. These projects generate impact flows, which provide the basic data for Ecological Network Analysis to measure the basic resilience of the strategy structure. It is known from ecological systems that neither totally redundant nor highly efficient systems are sufficiently resilient. ENA allows an optimisation procedure to be undertaken. As a result, a complex iterative model is devised, suitable to elaborate a resilient strategy structure. This paper shows that efforts to achieve sustainability can be used to organize resilient structures. The study applies this locally - where city strategy pursues sustainable aims - and globally, where existing global knowledge will be organized into a resilient structure.","[Kiss, Tibor; Kiss, Viktor Miklos] Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, Blue Econ Res Ctr, Pecs, Hungary",University of Pecs,"Kiss, T (通讯作者)，Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, Rakoczi U 80, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary.",kisst@ktk.pte.hu; kissv@ktk.pte.hu,,,,,,,47,15,15,6,72,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The purpose of this paper is to answer this question through a comprehensive analysis of cost variations in an intertemporal manner, by breaking them down into the economic sources that produce them, including productivity. Cost frontier estimation was grounded in a joint production technology of desirable and undesirable outputs, modeled in an input-oriented fashion.

Local gastronomy and authentic and recognizable cuisine can be excellent connectors with other parts of tourist offer that make the destination recognizable, i.e. they can present a means for market positioning and raising the competitive advantages of the destination. One of the more important challenges of the experience economy, a new economic paradigm in the sector of tourism, is finding a means of using the intangible heritage, culture of living and working where the culture of food production and the whole experience connected to food play a significant role as well as using this heritage as a ground for designing original and competitive tourist experiences. The aim of this paper is to present the possibilities of positioning Slavonia as a recognizable gourmet destination in the Croatian tourist market. The work is based on the growth of tourist's interests for gastronomy and other tourist experiences connected to it, an important impulse for visiting the Croatian tourist destination, which was also indicated by the recent TOMAS summer 2017 research. The region of Slavonia has an extremely rich tourist attraction base connected to gastronomy and other intangible heritage connected to it. It presents a strong but still insufficiently exploited means of the region's branding and its positioning as a lifestyle destination of the perennial tourism. A research among the county tourist boards in Slavonia was conducted for the purpose of this work. The goal of the research was to examine the manner of using gastronomy and other tourist experiences connected to it as a motive for branding and positioning the tourist offer. Moreover, the authors have conducted a survey among the owners and managers of ten restaurants in the mentioned area in order to examine the extent of representing the local gastronomy in their offer, to examine the extent of using parts of experience economy to create authentic experiences among their tourists, as well as to examine the connections of the mentioned restaurants to other stakeholders in the area in order to create a recognizable integral gastronomic tourist experience.","[Bakan, Rikard; Tubic, Dejan; Randelj, Juraj] Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33405, Croatia",,"Bakan, R (通讯作者)，Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, Matije Gupca 78, Virovitica 33405, Croatia.",rikard.bakan@vsmti.hr; dejan.tubic@vsmti.hr; juraj.randelj@vsmti.hr,"Bakan, Rikard/JDW-9938-2023",,,,,,29,3,4,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,700,709,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900072,0

On the other hand, there is no doubt that by constantly emphasizing the public administration reforms as a key factor for integration, the Union becomes more and more relevant in that respect. Hence, the European institutions and organizations - especially the European Council - play a major role in the establishing of the fundamental European public administration principles. SIGMA is an organization also responsible for control over the fulfillment of the European public administration principles and gives directions on how to achieve these principles. As a part of numerous international acts, declarations and resolutions, these principles' aim is to harmonize the member states' governance systems in light of the way administrative bodies enforce their competences covering also the quality of services and the overall relationship between the authorities and the citizens. This way, certain European standards which, among other things, have a mandatory character are set. All the states striving to join the European Union have to undertake all the measures that will ensure a consistent application of the principles of the European administrative space and the acquis communitaire. Consequently, as one of the states claiming to join the Union, the Republic of Macedonia is also obliged to acquire such administrative capacities that will guarantee the application of the acquis communautaire - the general Administrative Law principles. This research is therefore focused on the importance of the European principles when speaking about the public administration quality, efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and responsibility. It analyses the legal framework where the European principles are set out, as well as the mechanisms the authorities and bodies undertake in order to ensure better execution of their responsibilities (e.g. electronic communication, enhanced inter-institutional cooperation and communication, training for officials and servants, etc.).

Design/methodology/approach The study was designed to evaluate the effect of fresh and smoked fish on the storage quality parameters of fish nuggets. The products were developed by incorporating optimum level of fresh and smoked separately and were vacuum packaged in low-density polyethylene pouches and assessed for various storage quality parameters under refrigerated (21 degrees C) conditions for 27 days of storage. The products were evaluated for various chemical, microbiological and sensory parameters at regular interval of three day. Findings Nuggets from smoked fish had lower (p<0.05) moisture, higher fat and crude protein compared to fresh fish nuggets. Total volatile basic nitrogen for fresh nugget samples exceeded the limit value of 30mgN/100g fish muscle on the 24 days of storage. At the end of storage period, TBA values were 2.8mg malonaldehyde/kg for fresh nugget samples and 2.1mg malonaldehyde/kg for smoked nugget samples. Microbial counts were found to be significantly (p<0.05) higher in fresh nugget than in smoked nugget samples. Sensory quality scores of smoked nuggets were significantly higher, than fresh nugget. The shelf life of fish nugget was found to be 24 days for fresh nuggets and 27 days for smoked nugget samples according to sensory assessment results. Originality/value The paper has demonstrated that the smoked fish meat prouduce nuggets of better quality, as indicated by lower microbial counts and higher sensory attributes compared to fresh fish meat.","[Duman, Muhsine] Firat Univ, Fac Fisheries, Dept Fish Proc Technol, Elazig, Turkey; [Kuzgun, Nermin Karaton] Munzur Univ, Fac Fisheries, Tunceli, Turkey",Firat University; Munzur University,"Duman, M (通讯作者)，Firat Univ, Fac Fisheries, Dept Fish Proc Technol, Elazig, Turkey.",mduman@firat.edu.tr; nerminkaraton@munzur.edu.tr,"Duman, Muhsine/J-5447-2018","Duman, Muhsine/0000-0001-9780-7078",,,,,28,8,8,2,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Directive 96/71/EC (hereinafter: Posted Workers Directive) within the EU law aimed to provide a clear framework to guarantee fair competition and respect for the posted workers' rights so that both businesses and workers can take full advantage of the internal market opportunities. However, no society is free from injustice as we can see in example of posted workers who receive different wage for the same job as workers in European Union host country where they temporarily provide services for their employers. This shows that issue of inequality regarding labour rights is indeed a universal and permanently evolving phenomenon that could be analysed from philosophical and legal perspective. From philosophical perspective, fair equality of opportunity requires that social positions, such as jobs, be formally open to each individual. In other words, each individual should have a fair chance to attain these positions. Nevertheless, it is obvious that if every person and job were the same, wage levels other additional benefits that a worker receives for work would be uniform. However, this is not the case of Posted Workers Directive where posted workers wage differentials are result of inequality of wage. If we think of a wage as compensation for a worker, i.e., for the loss of leisure time, it would be just that same loss of leisure time should require equal compensation as well as the cost of separation from the family, staying in an unknown environment, and the inability to directly influence their situation. In the light of Rawlsian principles of justice authors will analyse the proposal for the change of the Posted Workers Directive and some aspects of controversies that have been raised between European Union Member States.","[Dumancic, Kosjenka] Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia; [Preloznjak, Barbara] Fac Law, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Dumancic, K (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",kdumancic@efzg.hr; barbara.preloznjak@pravo.hr,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,115,121,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600012,0

The study was conducted based on unpublished data of the Main Statistical Office (GUS). Variation in financial efficiency in individual branches of the food industry sector was assessed using a synthetic measure constructed using the classic TOPSIS method.

This paper describes how universal design principles formed the foundation of technical training delivered to Sri Lankan professionals, to assist them comply with accessibility regulations, and their obligations under the United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The paper is based on work funded by the Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and delivered by a delegation from the Australian Human Rights Commission. The training was based on 25 years' practitioner experience of applying universal design in the built environment. The commitment to removing barriers to the built environment for people with disabilities is evidenced by a set of robust regulations that are prescriptive and retrospective. Further, drafting and translation errors contribute to difficulty achieving these objectives and thus there is a poor level of understanding and compliance with accessibility regulations. This presented a seemingly intractable combination of difficulties. However, it was decided that providing the delegates with a robust understanding of universal design principles would allow them to navigate these difficulties by thinking about the problems differently, even if they could not achieve strict compliance. There were particular concerns about transport and the public realm. Lessons from Australia were shared including whole-of-journey transport planning and prioritisation methods such as principle pedestrian networks. Community and industry engagement were central themes to taking more strategic and universal design approach to solving complex problems.","[Galbraith, Penny] Ctr Universal Design Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Galbraith, P (通讯作者)，Ctr Universal Design Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",penny@box50.com.au,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,728,734,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-728,0.0,,,7,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371436.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100070,0

Therefore, the reform of the legislation governing hunting is being approached, and through several attempts, the so-called dominant hunting system that is related to land ownership, i.e. giving hunting grounds to a lease by the state is formed. From then on to today, of course, with the numerous reforms in Croatia, and in most other countries, such a way of managing hunting grounds is applied.

Design/methodology/approach This study first employed focus groups to explore attitudes and habits relating to rice consumption among British subjects. A sensory descriptive analysis method, flash profiling (FP), was then applied on consumer panels in the UK and Thailand to gain perceived sensory quality of unfamiliar and typical rice samples. The sensory profiles generated by British and Thai panellists were analysed by generalised procrustean analysis (GPA) and compared based on perceived attributes, dominant characteristics and repeatability. Findings Focus group results suggested that consumer familiarity with rice might influence preferred rice textural quality. The prominent textures of stickiness and bittiness of unpolished pigmented rice were negatively associated with perceived quality in the UK participants. The sensory profiles generated by GPA consisted of similarity with darkness of colour and sweet/earthy type odours that are key dominant characteristics of the Thai pigmented rice. Practical implications The research has provided sensory information of the unpolished pigmented rice as compared with milled white rice.

A brief review of the same issues in the other statutes of Slavonian cities is going to attempt to determine whether the regulationmentioned is a distinctive characteristic of this urban environment or it is, however, characterised by common elements in relation to other mentioned city statutes.","[Kasap, Jelena] Fac Law Osijek, Stjepana Rad 13, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Kasap, J (通讯作者)，Fac Law Osijek, Stjepana Rad 13, Osijek, Croatia.",jkasap@pravos.hr,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,38,47,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900002,0

Design/methodology/approach - The research encompasses 78 structured interviews with farmers' market vendors in the central coast region of California. A descriptive statistical and exploratory analysis to capture and evaluate the extent of various clustering activities currently existing in FMs is presented. Findings - Analysis suggested an existing clustering behavior in FMs with different degrees that would enhance the role of these markets in local food economy. The improved social capital and financial performance of these markets shown in this study outperformed other cluster metrics monitored. Furthermore, there were some positive relationships between knowledge sharing (as a cluster activity) and both integration and financial activities among FMs vendors, highlighting interesting dynamics generated by the temporary nature of these clusters. Research limitations/implications - The study was based on an exploratory research design, investigating a selected number of vendors in the central coast region of California. The research does not claim to provide a comprehensive survey of all FMs. Practical implications - The analysis resulted in recommendations to improve efficiency of FMs' practices at both the management level and the strategic level. These recommendations will enhance the contribution of these markets to the local food economy. The results also expand the practical knowledge bodies of regional and local food business development. Finally, the study highlights the social role of FMs through showing social capital as one of the main clustering drivers. Originality/value - This study contributes to theoretical knowledge concerning the impact of clusters on operation performance by exploring a new temporary proximity that can be added to the existing geographical and digital proximity enriching the clustering approaches debate. Furthermore, the analysis provides specific novel insights into potential operational improvements for current farmers' market management to enhance their economic and social roles.","[Kassai, Mahsa; Deif, Ahmed] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Orfalea Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Kaspar, Jacob] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Coll Sci & Math, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Smith, Heather] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Stat, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Deif, A (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Orfalea Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",adeif@calpoly.edu,,"Deif, Ahmed/0000-0003-3203-0581",,,,,40,3,3,2,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

While balance equipment is common, interactive balancing equipment for persons with poor balance is less common. Equipment exists for persons with good balance (eg. Wii), but most games and exercises are less suited for many stroke survivors. The development process has been done in close collaboration with stroke survivors. We have used both creative workshops and individual iterative testing in the development, and have currently a prototype that is being tested in the home of 12 stroke survivors. This prototype is based on a foam mat which incorporates pressure sensing, and which allows you to see the pressure distribution as you exercise, but also allows you to play music or play different games. The feedback is designed to be inclusive - designs are multimodal (visual and auditory), and the setup is flexible and can easily be adapted. Initial test results show that the overall design is promising and works well (is robust, motivating and used). Problems identified are connected to the fact that we use main stream tablets for feedback, which adds complexity for the user both with interaction and charging. We are currently working on solving these problems, and expect to end up with a balance mat well suited for a wide range of users - not only stroke survivors.","[Magnusson, Charlotte; Caltenco, Hector; Rassmus-Grohn, Kirsten; Rydeman, Bitte] Lund Univ, Dept Design Sci, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Magnusson, C (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Design Sci, Lund, Sweden.",charlotte.magnusson@certec.lth.se,"Caltenco, Hector/AAE-3763-2021; Magnusson, Charlotte/JZT-2035-2024","Rassmus-Grohn, Kirsten/0000-0002-0068-222X; Rydeman, Bitte/0000-0002-5376-2979; Magnusson, Charlotte/0000-0002-3995-4843",NordForsk; EU [689947],NordForsk(NordForsk); EU(European Union (EU)),"The reported work has been funded by NordForsk (project ActivAbles) and EU Horizon 2020 (project STARR, grant agreement 689947).

Because of its interdisciplinary, globalization becomes a multidimensional process of demography, economy, society, culture and, politics. Each of these dimensions is a dimension to itself, but also dependent on others. For example, if there is an imbalance in the economy of one country, this imbalance will first affect other dimensions of the local market itself (society, culture, politics, demography), but later on the global market. In this paper, special attention will be given to demography, or to one of its components - migration. Demography is a discipline in social sciences studying the population. It looks at the composition of the population and its movement. Demographic potentials are an integral part of total development because their changes affect the very social structure and social relationships. Depending on the degree of economic development, the population is an important factor in the field of spending on goods and services. Elements of the demographic dimension of globalization are natality, mortality, prolonged lifespan, cultural identity change, and global migration. Gender and immigration represent positive components of the total population movement (so-called demographic balance assets), while mortality and emigration represent negative components (so-called passive demographic balance). Migration has a major impact on the direct mixing of cultures. It quickly changes the dynamics of the overall movement because people have their knowledge, skills, and everything they do from their relationships to another region. They thus impoverish the region they came from. The purpose of this paper is to prove that population migration is permanent in most European countries, and not just in Croatia. The aim of the paper is to analyze the migration of the population of the Republic of Croatia and the selected member states of the European Union (Republic of Austria, Czech Republic and Republic of Bulgaria) from 2006 to 2016.","[Mirosavljevic, Anita Kulas] Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,"Mirosavljevic, AK (通讯作者)，Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia.",anita.kulas@vusb.hr,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,567,574,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900059,0

This poses particular food security challenges for densely populated and emerging countries, such as Bangladesh. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the increasing and changing cereal consumption pattern in developing countries using Bangladesh as a case. Design/methodology/approach - Using Bangladesh's Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2000, 2005a, b data, and applying a two-stage quadratic almost ideal system estimation procedure, the present study separately estimates the expenditure elasticities for rural and urban households for five food items: rice, wheat and rice and wheat products, pulses, fish and vegetables. Second, using the estimated elasticities, projected population and the per capita GDP growth rates, this study projects the consumption of the sampled food items by 2030. Findings - This study demonstrates that in 2030 both rural and urban households in Bangladesh will consume more wheat, pulses and fish, but the urban households will consume less rice compared to the current levels of consumption in 2015. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study on developing countries that examines the evolving food items consumption separately by rural and urban households. Using Bangladesh as a case, this study warns that with rapid urbanization and income growth, developing countries need to supply more wheat, fish and pulses. The provision of the maximum usage of scarce resources, such as arable land, the development and dissemination of improved varieties and the best management practices must be ensured to boost domestic food production in developing countries to cater to the future evolving food consumption.","[Mottaleb, Khondoker Abdul; Rahut, Dil Bahadur; Kruseman, Gideon; Erenstein, Olaf] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Socioecon Program, Texcoco, Mexico",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Mottaleb, KA (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr, Socioecon Program, Texcoco, Mexico.",k.mottaleb@cgiar.org,"Mottaleb, Khondoker A./I-1103-2019; Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022; Kruseman, Gideon/S-6377-2016","Mottaleb, Khondoker A./0000-0002-2666-1152; Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271; Kruseman, Gideon/0000-0002-3392-4176; Erenstein, Olaf/0000-0002-7491-5786",,,,,37,29,31,0,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Apart from this, the purpose of this paper is to develop the grey set-based scorecard model for solving the proposed AHS chain of macro-micro parameters. Design/methodology/approach - The performance of FSBs is linked with the supply of fruits towards clients under a feasible rate, which circuitously depends upon the evaluation of the economic locality of FSBs. The authors developed an advanced hierarchical structure of macro-micro parameters via a literature survey and considered these parameters based on the sampling score of FRs corresponding to select feasible FSBs/alternatives. Furthermore, the authors developed a grey set-based scorecard model for undertaking the incomplete information of FRs against the hierarchical structure. Findings - It is found that the work is well suited for FRs as they can measure the performances of defined FSBs in accordance with their own opinions under the proposed AHS of macro-micro parameters. Apart from this, the work is useful for benchmarking the vegetable supply bazaars (VSBs) on the replacement of AHS. The proposed hierarchical structure with a grey-based scorecard model is flexible in its nature and can undertake more than 1,000 macro-micro parameters and FRs to access potential decision. Originality/value - The conducted research work has a precise value for evaluating the economic FSB locality. The overall performance scores of considered FSB localities are computed as (partial derivative(1)) = 1.991, (partial derivative(2)) = 2.567 and (partial derivative(3)) = 2.855, where (partial derivative(3)) is found to be more significant than available FSBs.

Drawing inspiration from the process that Mary Morgan referred to as seeking parts, looking for wholes, the chapter explores the evolving relationship between observational practice and conceptual categories in Hill's work on West Africa and India. It is argued that fieldwork, the central element in Hill's methodological reflection, served two main functions. Firstly, it acted as the cornerstone of her views on observation and induction, framing her understanding of the relationship between parts and wholes. Secondly, Hill used fieldwork as a narrative trope to articulate her hopeful vision for an integration of economics and anthropology, and later express her feelings of distance and alienation from the ways in which these disciplines were actually practiced.","[Serra, Gerardo] Inst Etud Avancees Nantes, Nantes, France",Nantes Universite,"Serra, G (通讯作者)，Inst Etud Avancees Nantes, Nantes, France.",,"Serra, Gerardo/D-7493-2018","Serra, Gerardo/0000-0002-0412-7979",,,,,57,5,5,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0743-4154,,978-1-78756-423-7; 978-1-78756-424-4,RES HIST ECON THOUGH,,,2018,36.0,,B,,,,93,108,,10.1108/S0743-41542018000036B007,0.0,,,16,Economics; History Of Social Sciences; Philosophy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Philosophy,BQ3WW,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000588194300007,0

Design/methodology/approach A total of 512 surveys were applied to consumers in central Mexico. The survey included a free word association with TF and an example, the food choice questionnaire, and the sociodemographic characteristics of respondents. A binary logistic regression was carried out comparing regular TF consumers with non-regular TF consumers. Findings Men tend to eat TFs in more regular way than women. People with heavier consumption habits associate TF with authenticity/way of doing, origin and habit, which are reinforced both by TF examples and the FCQ variables. Foods considered traditional were classified as cooked (elaborated under specific recipes of gastronomic heritage) and uncooked. Both groups comprise central foods, basic in the Mexican diet, in which maize, chili and beans are outstanding. Research limitations/implications The study did not comprehend the whole country and not consider specific food categories.

Social implications Results may support the commercialisation of these foods, and lead to an improvement in the livelihoods of producers of TFs. Originality/value In Mexico, the study of consumers has not been addressed. Therefore, this is a pioneer study that documents the factors associated with the consumption of TFs.","[Serrano-Cruz, Marlem R.; Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica; Vizcarra-Bordi, Ivonne; Thome-Ortiz, Humberto] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Inst Ciencias Agr & Rurales, Toluca, Mexico; [Sepulveda, Wilmer S.] Univ Libre, Fac Econ Management & Accounting Sci, Bogota, Colombia",,"Espinoza-Ortega, A (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Inst Ciencias Agr & Rurales, Toluca, Mexico.",marlemserrano@yahoo.com.mx; angelica.cihuatl@gmail.com; webwilsep@gmail.com; ivizcarrab@uaemex.mx; humbertothome@hotmail.com,"Sepulveda, Wilmer S./U-2161-2017; GARCIA, SERGIO ERICK/X-9320-2018; Thome Ortiz, Humberto/B-5869-2015; Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica/D-7453-2016","Thome Ortiz, Humberto/0000-0002-6714-3490; Espinoza-Ortega, Angelica/0000-0002-5968-0587; Serrano-Cruz, Marlem R./0000-0002-1863-5683; Sepulveda, Wilmer S./0000-0001-7562-5089",Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT) [220531CB-2013],Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),The authors would like to thank the Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia - CONACYT) for funding through Grant 220531CB-2013; and the doctorate scholarship granted to Marlem Rubi Serrano Cruz.,,66,28,28,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Hence, the aim of the paper is to find optimal model for modelling of monthly prices of milk from 01/1998 to 06/2016 and predict them for 07/2016-06/2017. First, the development of milk producers' prices is modelled by Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages models. Consequently, the relations with monthly prices of maize (02/2006-06/2016) were examined using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. ARIMA model suggests prices of milk in the interval from 5.97 CZIC/I to 7.06 CZK/I that is more realistic prediction than in case of VAR model that predicts lower prices (5.86-6.38 CZK/I). There might be missing some important variables in VAR model of prices of milk that can improve the prediction capability. Therefore, the challenge for future research is to improve the models further using regression analysis with relevant determinants.","[Simpach, Ondrej] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Simpachova Pechrova, Marie] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Simpach, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",ondrej.simpach@vse.cz; simpachova.marie@uzei.cz,"Pechrová, Marie Šimpachová/X-8982-2018",,Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G097]; Institute of Agricultural Economics and Information [1277],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Institute of Agricultural Economics and Information,The research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation project no.

Causes can be missing process transparency or rather a mismanagement of agencies or inadequate communication and cooperation between the actors. Temperature sensitive goods like pharmaceutical products can serve as an example. More than 90% of pharmaceutical products used in the sub-Saharan region arrive via sea route and are further transported towards the inland or neighbouring landlocked countries (Therrien 2014, Schumann and Streit-Juotsa 2014). Additionally, more than 80% of external trade of these regions' countries is channelled through the ports (Njinkeu et al. 2008). Despite the extensive goods transactions in the ports, the freight's logistics to rural regions and the hinterland is subject to difficult conditions. This paper aims to show the significance of the ports of Douala for the development of the region but also discusses the impact of congested ports for the logistics of pharmaceutical products.

A total of 275 consumers participated in the survey. Obtained results were used for comparing white and brown varieties of A. bisporus over a period of 22 days. Mushrooms were packed in air and in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) at 4 degrees C. Samples were analyzed for their nutritional, antioxidative and microbiological characteristics. Findings Two weeks from harvest, white variety showed higher amount of essential nutrients, while during the third week, brown mushrooms were more nutritionally valuable. Brown variety had better antioxidative ability for all 22 days of storage. Aerobic plate count (APC) was as expected for the mushrooms. MAPs significantly lowered APC in both varieties. The number of Enterobacteriaceae was equal for both varieties at the beginning, but later on they developed much faster in the case of brown variety.

Design/methodology/approach An online bulletin board survey was conducted in Japan to collect responses to an open-ended question about reasons for consuming fresh leafy vegetables. A total of 897 responses were analysed using word co-occurrence network analysis. A community detection method and centrality measures were used to interpret the resulting network map. Findings Using a community detection algorithm, the authors identify six major groups of words that represent respondents' core motives for consuming leafy vegetables. While Japanese consumers view health benefits to be most important, sensory factors, such as texture, colour, and palatability, and convenience factors also influence attitudes. The authors find that centrality measures can be useful in identifying keywords that appear in various contexts of consumer responses. Originality/value This is the first paper to use a quantitative text analysis to examine consumer perceptions for fresh leafy vegetables. The analysis also provides pointers for creating visually interpretable co-occurrence network maps from textual data and discusses the role of community structure and centrality in interpreting such maps.","[Yano, Yuki; Maruyama, Atsushi] Chiba Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Matsudo, Chiba, Japan; [Blandford, David] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Nakamura, Tetsuya] Kyoei Univ, Dept Int Business Management, Kasukabe, Japan",Chiba University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Yano, Y (通讯作者)，Chiba Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Matsudo, Chiba, Japan.",y.yano@chiba-u.jp; blandford.david@yahoo.com; a.maruyama@faculty.chiba-u.jp; t-nakamura@kyoei.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [JP17K15327],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant No. JP17K15327.,,40,5,5,2,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Three interrelated aspects are examined: the wage growth record associated with periods dominated by a particular development strategy; developments in the wage share of income; and movements in skill premiums and their links with fundamentals. The key findings are: (i) the region's unskilled wage rose by 147 per cent compared to rises of 254 per cent in the average wage and 440 per cent in income per worker (including both property and labour income); (ii) the average LA-6 wage share started a secular fall in the 1950s; (iii) skill premiums tended to peak during the middle decades of the 20th century, coinciding with the acceleration of industrialisation and the timing of the demographic transition.

Since these productivity indexes are defined by unknown distance functions, it is necessary to estimate the distance functions to compute them in principle. On the other hand, the Tornqvist productivity index is an empirical index number formula that is directly computable from the prices and quantities of the inputs and outputs alone. Caves et al. (1982) imply that the Malmquist index coincides with the Tornqvist index under profit maximizing behaviour and constant returns to scale technology. The purpose of the present paper is to point out that the Hicks-Moorsteen productivity index coincides with the Tornqvist productivity index under the same condition. We emphasize that the condition of constant returns to scale is indispensable for deriving the equivalence between the two indexes. Moreover, even when this condition is relaxed to the alpha returns to scale, the equivalence between the Hicks-Moorsteen and Tornqvist productivity indexes is shown to hold true.","[Mizobuchi, Hideyuki] Ryukoku Univ, Fac Econ, Fushimi Ku, 67 Fukakusa Tsukamoto Cho, Kyoto 6128577, Japan",Ryukoku University,"Mizobuchi, H (通讯作者)，Ryukoku Univ, Fac Econ, Fushimi Ku, 67 Fukakusa Tsukamoto Cho, Kyoto 6128577, Japan.",mizobuchi@econ.ryukoku.ac.jp,"Mizobuchi, Hideyuki/KBR-3306-2024","Mizobuchi, Hideyuki/0000-0001-6893-4035","grant for overseas research (Kokugai-kenkyu) of Ryukoku University; KAKENHI [25870922]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25870922, 15K17061] Funding Source: KAKEN","grant for overseas research (Kokugai-kenkyu) of Ryukoku University; KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful for an anonymous referee, Erwin Diewert, Bert Balk, Knox Lovell, and Chris O'Donnell for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Energy systems are the main source of greenhouse gas emissions, and the services provided by energy (such as heating, power, transport and lighting) are vital to support human development. To address this challenge, we advocate for a eudaimonic need-centred understanding of human well-being, as opposed to hedonic subjective views of well-being. We also argue for a shift in the way we analyse energy demand, from energy throughput to energy services. By adopting these perspectives on either end of the wellbeing-energy spectrum, a double decoupling potential can be uncovered. We present a novel analytic framework and showcase several methodological approaches for analysing the relationship between, and decoupling of, energy services and human needs. We conclude by proposing future directions of research in this area based on the analytic framework. (C) 2017 The Authors.

A more recent literature dedicated to liberalization of trade in renewable resources finds that welfare effects depend on certain factors, such as the country's status as importer or exporter, the state of the renewable resource stocks and the size of the country on the world market (Chichilnisky, 1993; Brander and Taylor, 1997a; Emami and Johnston, 2000, Hannesson, 2000), or remain theoretically indeterminate and require empirical analysis (Nielsen, 2009). Fish trade liberalization is provided in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) concluded by the Canadian Government in 2013 with the European Union (EU). This new type of 21st century trade agreement challenges both the conventional theory of international trade and renewable resource-based sectors of economic activity such as fish and seafood by opening them up to industrial-type international competition and integration. The paper uses the theoretical framework of ecological economics (Costanza et al., 2015) to demonstrate that the declining Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) fish and seafood industry is not ready to participate gainfully in implementation of the CETA. It also uses the concept of policy space (Rodrik 2007, Pauwelyn 2008) to recommend some policy changes that can prepare the NL fish and seafood sector for competitive and beneficial participation in the CETA. Restructuring the fish and seafood sector with a focus on small scale, elimination of harmful subsidies and redirecting them to achieve lower costs of operation, better trained labor force, and more just and sustainable supply/marketing networks, will make it fit to benefit from the gains from trade and to contribute to a more equitable distribution of the-benefits of the fishery to the fishers and local communities.

Analysis of ecosystem services allows the expression of ecological benefits in economic terms. However, cultural services, such as recreation opportunities, have proved difficult to quantify. An important challenge for the analysis of cultural services is to understand the geography of service provision in relation to both human and ecological system elements. We used data on visitation rates and measures of context, content, connectivity, and location for 64 private land conservation areas (PLCAs) to better understand geographic influences on cultural service provision. Visitation to PLCAs was influenced by a combination of ecological and socio-economic drivers. Variance partitioning analysis showed that ecology explained the largest proportion of overall variation in visitation rates (26%), followed.by location (22%). In tests using generalized linear mixed models, individual factors that significantly explained visitation rates included the number of mammal species, the number of Big 5-species (ecological variables), the number of facilities provided (infrastructure) and average accommodation charges (affordability). Our analysis has important implications for the economic sustainability of PLCAs and more generally for understanding the relevance of spatial variation for analyses of cultural services.

The shift in GSC geography influences global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of an energy efficiency and low-carbon technology gap between developed and developing economies. Our simulations indicate that changing GSC geography toward China positively contributed, on average (2001-2008), 919 Mt CO2 equivalents to global GHG emissions annually. In addition, there are potentially even larger indirect effects, including import-related and transportation-related emissions that are attributable to GSC shift-related improvements in developing world consumption and infrastructure. We then investigate the emission impact of a further GSCs shift toward South Asia, Africa and Latin America. Although the direct impact of such a shift is likely negative due to a lower dependency on coal as well as lower carbon intensities in South Asia, Africa and Latin America relative to China, it is likely that the direct effects are more than offset by the indirect shift-related effects associated with improvements in consumption and infrastructure. Our results have policy implications for future climate change mitigation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses a case study of a major bitumen project, Shell Canada's Jackpine mine expansion, to examine the evidence considered by government decision-makers in the project approval process. The project was determined to be in the public interest based primarily on its economic benefits, despite significant adverse environmental and social impacts. The paper evaluates the evidence that was presented to support this decision, using three criteria, drawn from ecological economics: efficient allocation, just distribution, and sustainable macroeconomic scale. It finds that the evidence presented is, in fact, insufficient to justify the project on any of the three criteria. Furthermore, other studies of the bitumen industry cast doubt on the likelihood that the project would satisfy these criteria if further analysis were conducted. It concludes by recommending several measures that could help to improve decision-making on bitumen projects in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The contribution of African countries to global climate negotiations determines how compatible the negotiated rules could be with the existing socioeconomic and policy circumstances of African countries. The aim of this paper is to explore the agency of Africa (African States) in the global climate change negotiations and discuss possible implications for implementing these rules using REDD+ as a case study. Drawing on document analysis and semi-structured expert interviews, our findings suggest that although African countries are extensively involved in the implementation of REDD+ interventions, the continent has a weak agency on the design of the global REDD+ architecture. This weak agency results from a number of factors including the inability of African countries to send large and diverse delegations to the negotiations as well lack of capacity to generate and transmit research evidence to the global platform. African countries also perceive themselves as victims of climate change who should be eligible for support rather than sources of technological solutions. Again, Africa's position is fragmented across negotiation coalitions which weakens the continent's collective influence on the REDD+ agenda. This paper discusses a number of implementation deficits which could result from this weak agency. These include concerns about implementation capacity and a potential lack of coherence between REDD+ rules and existing policies in African countries. These findings call for a rethink of pathways to enhancing Africa's strategies in engaging in multilateral climate change negotiations, especially if climate change regimes specifically targeted at developing countries are to be effective.","[Atela, Joanes Odiwuor; Mbeva, Kennedy Liti] African Ctr Technol Studies, POB 45917-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Quinn, Claire Hellen] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Arhin, Albert A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Duguma, Lalisa] World Agroforestry Ctr, ASB Partnership Trop Forest Margins, UN Ave,POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Leeds; University of Cambridge; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Atela, JO (通讯作者)，African Ctr Technol Studies, POB 45917-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",j.atela@acts-net.org; c.h.quinn@leeds.ac.uk; albert.ab.arhin@gmail.com; l.duguma@cgiar.orglalisa.duguma,"Quinn, Claire/AAU-8184-2020","ARHIN, ALBERT/0000-0002-7156-831X; Quinn, Claire/0000-0002-2085-0446",International Research Scholarship of the University of Leeds; STEPS Centre at the University of Sussex; African Centre for Technology Studies; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,International Research Scholarship of the University of Leeds; STEPS Centre at the University of Sussex; African Centre for Technology Studies; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This study was supported by the International Research Scholarship of the University of Leeds, the STEPS Centre at the University of Sussex and the African Centre for Technology Studies.",,66,8,8,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Suppliers sometimes also offer PMGs to consumers in their direct channels. However, the extant literature on PMGs focuses on retailers and is silent on the role of upper stream chain members. We contribute to the literature by identifying the implications of PMGs in a dual distribution channel in which a supplier reaches consumers via a direct channel in addition to the retail channel. We show that the presence of PMGs in a dual channel hinges on supplier's strategic ability, or lack thereof, to adjust its wholesale price in relation to the guarantee. Specifically, a PMG fails to prevail at equilibrium when the supplier is capable of strategically adjusting its wholesale price - but may prevail at equilibrium otherwise. The main reason is that the supplier can manage the competition between the retail channel and the direct channel through its wholesale price decision, and offering a PMG limits this ability. On the other hand, offering a PMG can be a beneficial strategy for the supplier when the supplier cannot adjust its wholesale price; for instance in a retail dominant chain where the retailer dictates the transfer price. In a retail dominant chain, if the direct and retail channels are perceived to be similar in quality and service offerings, then both channel members benefit from offering a PMG because it softens the intensity of price competition. On the other hand, when the two channels are sufficiently differentiated in quality and service offerings, then retail managers should be cautious and avoid offering the guarantee if their channel is in a superior position in terms of perceived quality.","[Nalca, Arcan] Queens Univ, Smith Sch Business, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Nalca, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Smith Sch Business, Kingston, ON, Canada.",arcan.nalca@queensu.ca,,,,,,,52,6,7,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

This paper focuses on the water-agriculture-environment nexus in the Murrumbidgee River Basin, Australia, and attempts to explain how reduced water allocation to agriculture aimed at protecting the environment in turn impacted the wider economy and the community. Predictably reduced water allocation saw declines in agriculture production and employment Despite this, paradoxically, the basin unemployment rate declined and basin median household income increased. To understand and interpret this, we first analyze available labour, economic and hydrology data, and then develop a simple dynamic model to interpret the observed pattern of basin employment and unemployment Data analysis revealed the likely causes behind the paradox as (a) out-migration of people from the basin, and (b) absorption of the labour force in the fast growing non-agricultural sectors of the diversified basin economy. The model simulations reinforced this interpretation. Further model simulations under alternative realities of out-migration and sectoral transformation indicated that basins embedded in faster growing national economies, and are more diversified to begin with, are likely to be more conducive to agriculture sector reform (e.g., reduced water allocation) and environmental regeneration. This is a sobering message for other regions experiencing environmental degradation due to extensive agricultural development (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have modelled single catchments or been limited by their realism when investigating multiple catchments. We investigate whether the cost-effectiveness ranking of policy instruments to control agricultural nonpoint nitrate pollution (NP) is consistent across two relatively similar catchments. Transferability may interest regulators seeking to identify policies implementable in relatively similar catchments, rather than setting high transaction cost catchment specific policies. Detailed nonlinear stochastic biophysical economic optimisation models of two catchments are constructed. We estimate the distribution of daily river pollution for 10 years in each catchment without assuming an underlying pollutant distribution that is likely to distort policy ranking. We report consistency of policy rankings and outperformance in distinct regulatory target ranges in both catchments as well as pollution swapping. The transferability evidence may not be as robust as policymakers would like. Mixed instruments are cost-effective at higher regulatory targets and display characteristics suited to uniform application across catchments. Our study would benefit from improved modelling of farming heterogeneity, groundwater hydrology and policy transaction costs. Further research is required to identify catchment characteristics that determine transferability across a broader set of catchments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We measure productivity change using an index that satisfies a set of basic axioms from index theory (e.g., identity, proportionality, transitivity). We show how indices of this type can be exhaustively decomposed into various measures of environmental change, technical change and efficiency change. We are particularly interested in the relationship between productivity and technical efficiency. In theory, if firms have access to multiple technologies, then measures of technical efficiency can be decomposed into metatechnology ratios (measures of how well firm managers choose technologies) and measures of residual technical efficiency (measures of how well chosen technologies are used). We explain how data envelopment analysis (DEA) can be used to estimate these components.

In CBA, the agents' contributions to radiative forcing (RF) must be consistently priced (Le. the social cost of RF, occurring at a specific time, must be the same regardless of the agent causing it). We present a concept that enables doing so. The Social Cost of Forcing (SCF) is the monetary value of the social damage caused by marginal RF at a given instant (Wm(-2)). Any forcing agent whose temporal decay profile and radiative efficiency are known can be priced based on it. Prices obtained for distinct agents are consistent in CBA, as long as the same SCF and discounting assumptions are applied. Hence, the SCF is a concise way to communicate social cost information: mutually consistent prices for any set of forcing agents can be obtained based on a single Integrated Assessment Model output, the SCF. We explain the theoretical foundations of the concept and illustrate its practical applications with two examples: (1) we derive SCF-based prices for CO2 and CH4, and (2) we estimate the social cost of albedo changes in a boreal forest stand.

This article explores the extent to which China's complex logographic writing system explains these different outcomes. Using an economic analysis, I show how China's preference for block printing technology over movable type can be justified as the rational choice of commercial producers. In addition to this, model simulations also predict that movable type would be used in China under some specific circumstances which closely match the historical record. On the other hand, the use of block printing would not have led to larger printing costs in China, and as such should not be regarded as the reason behind China's modest level of book production when compared to Europe's.","[Angeles, Luis] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Angeles, L (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",,,"Angeles, Luis/0000-0002-9254-4608",,,,,33,3,3,3,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Given the increasing attention to organic farming (OF), we conducted this study to investigate the main opportunities and challenges of the food production system of small-scale farmers in developing countries with an emphasis on their livelihoods. The study showed that the most significant advantages of OF are environmental protection and a higher resilience to environmental changes, increasing farmers' income and reducing external input cost, enhancing social capacity and increasing employment opportunities. A s well as enhancing food security primarily by increasing the food purchasing power of local people. However, the main challenges of this food production system include lower yields in comparison to conventional systems, difficulties with soil nutrient management, certification and market barriers, and the educational and research needs of small-holders. The paper concludes that even though OF might present some significant challenges to small-scale farmers, it could/should still be considered as a part of the solution and means of improving their livelihoods.

We use a slacks based measure (SBM) and Luenberger Productivity Index, accounting for undesirable outputs, to evaluate the industrial green productivity growth rates of China's 30 provinces. The estimates imply an unsustainable development model in China with significant regional differences. By employing a panel threshold model and a province-level panel dataset during 2000-2012, empirical results show that both command-and-control and market-based regulation have a non-linear relationship with and can be positively related to green productivity but with different constrains on regulation stringency: there are double thresholds with the command-and control and exists an optimal range of stringency for productivity improvement; while a single threshold has been found with the market-based regulation and its current stringency is reasonable for most of provinces. Moreover, based on China's reality, the productivity effect driven by market-based regulation is much stronger than that of the command-and-control. The mechanism of informal regulation is much more complicated. Consequently, we find evidence to support the strong Porter Hypothesis that reasonable stringency of environmental regulations may enhance rather than lower industrial competitiveness.

The stated costs are certainly and quality costs, which represent the totality of the amounts to be invested in the business process to ensure a quality product and quality service delivery. If we explore the cost of quality in the lifetime of a particular product, the most important aspect of the observation of the activities and processes that the product causes at all stages of their life cycle. There are many contradictions on how to estimate the cost of quality. Regardless of their structure, in today's business environment cannot be ignored orientation to customers, so the quality costs are estimated based on investments in satisfying the desires of customers. Model for strategic cost management that integrates a method of target costs, ABC method and analysis method value is applied at the earliest stages of production, or already in the planning phase and product development, with the aim of adapting products to the needs and desires of customers. The aim of this article is to present a model of measuring the cost of quality in the context of an integrated management system costs. The hypothesis of this paper is that the integration model of the target cost model costing based on activities and analysis model values can, but in the process of developing a new product, a significant impact on reducing the cost of quality. The impact of the application of the integrated management system costs to the cost of quality will be investigated by the method of modeling and simulation. The study will include the calculation of cost of quality by applying individual methods of cost management and calculation using the integrated model. Data on the amount of quality costs, obtained by applying individual methods of cost management, will collate data on costs of quality simulated integrated model of cost management.

The product can be stored for up to 28 days and is indistinguishable from fresh material by the human eye. However, due to the prior storage period, the shelf-life potential is limited, and this leads to losses in distribution and a lower quality for the consumer. This work aims to develop a rapid and non-destructive methodology using visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) reflectance spectroscopy to quantify the postharvest age. Vis/NIR reflectance spectra were linked to the time in storage by partial least-squares regression (PLS). Two variable selection techniques, genetic algorithms PLS and Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination PLS, were combined to improve the accuracy and robustness of the prediction model while decreasing the number of wavelengths used. The final model used only 10% of the original wavelength variables, while the root mean squared error of cross validation decreased from 6.0 to 3.6 days. The final model was tested using two external test sets and had a maximum root mean squared error of prediction of 3.7 days. Therefore, it was concluded that Vis/NIR reflectance spectroscopy can be a valid, rapid and non-destructive method for identifying and quantifying the postharvest age of lamb's lettuce.","[Jacobs, B.

They consume milk mainly because it is not expensive and it is possible to easily buy it in the supermarket. They consume special milk mainly because of food allergies or intolerances. They would like to buy special milk at large-scale retail trade outlets; they underline difficulties in finding and purchasing it. They think that the price of special milk is very high. Originality/value - The results showed that those who occasionally consume special milk choose it because it is more nourishing or for health reasons; there is also a significant association between the judgment on prices of special milk and the frequency of purchase. The estimation of a generalized linear model allowed to highlight that only age and the presence of health problems/intolerances are significant predictors of special milk consumption.,"[Lanfranchi, Maurizio; Zirilli, Agata; Alibrandi, Angela; Giannetto, Carlo] Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Messina, Italy; [Passantino, Annamaria] Univ Messina, Dept Vet Sci, Messina, Italy",University of Messina; University of Messina,"Lanfranchi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Messina, Italy.",mlanfranchi@unime.it,,"GIANNETTO, Carlo/0000-0002-6348-3164",,,,,40,23,23,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The variability in fruit quality at harvest contributes to a wide range in fruit storage potential. The development of soft fruit (flesh firmness <9.81 N) during storage and the difficulty in identifying and segregating them prior to distribution cause the industry financial loss. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of applying visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy after cool storage, to segregate kiwifruit on their flesh firmness values so as to reduce the proportion of soft fruit for subsequent distribution in the supply chain. 'Hayward' kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) from 51 growers were sourced from commercial orchards in New Zealand and stored in trays at 0 degrees C. At the end of storage (after 75, 100 or 125 days), fruit were scanned non-destructively using an NIR spectroradiometer in the reflectance mode before flesh firmness assessment. A global calibration model for all storage times was developed based on the spectral data using a support vector machine to categorise the fruit into two groups; 'Soft' (<9.81 N) or 'Good' (>= 9.81 N). The validation model was able to accurately classify approximately 48% of soft fruit and 80% of good fruit irrespective of storage time. Applying the developed model for segregation before distribution would reduce the proportion of soft fruit from 25.4% in the original population to 17.9% in the remaining population after removal of 27% of the population (predicted as soft fruit). Sorting fruit by NIR after storage may enable reduction of the effort and cost to segregate poor fruit from good fruit throughout the supply chain.","[Li, M.; Pranamornkith, T.; East, A.

In Croatia, seeking employment represents one of their main challenges. Job creation, competitiveness increase and the production of sophisticated and innovative goods and services are the things that encourage and enhance economic growth and development, and increase profits. Motivating and supporting young people to get self-employed and become entrepreneurs help them enter the labour market. At the same time, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of a proactive search for job openings. In Croatia, certain employment policies are currently being implemented at national level, including counselling, professional guidance and training. Timely information has a very important role in all stages of the entrepreneurial process. Providing relevant information at the right time can forge decisions that affect the outcome of an entrepreneurial venture. The purpose of this paper is to stress the information needs and behaviour of young self-employed people in the Osijek-Baranya County during various stages of the entrepreneurial process. The study involves young people who became self-employed in the period from 2014 to 2017. The applied methodology encompassed a survey and an interview. Due to a low response rate, the analysis of the results is based only on a qualitative approach. The results indicate what kind of information is needed to for becoming an entrepreneur, which sources of information young people use and what obstacles they encounter when searching for information on self-employment and entrepreneurship. The study makes a contribution to the understanding of the information seeking behaviour associated with a job search. Also, the results of this study can serve as a basis for tailoring or improving the guidelines for providing counselling and encouragement when actively seeking employment as well as a framework for possible cooperation with public service and information providers with the ultimate goal to ensure the most adequate responsiveness to the needs of young people.","[Martinovic, Ivana; Badurina, Boris; Gilman, Mirna] Filozofski Fak Osijeku, Lorenza Jagera 9, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Martinovic, I (通讯作者)，Filozofski Fak Osijeku, Lorenza Jagera 9, Osijek, Croatia.",imartinovic@ffos.hr; badurina@ffos.hr; mgilman@ffos.hr,"Badurina, Boris/ADH-5362-2022; Ranogajec, Mirna Gilman/AAC-6073-2020","Badurina, Boris/0000-0003-4111-6811;",,,,,9,0,0,1,7,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,361,369,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500034,0

In active areas, environmental regulations tend to be limited. We apply established instruments to empirically estimated environmental impact abatement cost curves for the development of 56 sites in Pennsylvania, USA. We compare the cost to industry of setting a cap on environmental impacts from land-clearing and building of surface infrastructure under two regulations: cap and trade versus a uniform, inflexible regulation. Greatest differences in cost are achieved when firm-level permits are allocated to reduce market-wide potential impacts by 36%. Cap and trade achieved this cap at a cost of 0.05% of not developing and allowed all development to proceed. The uniform, inflexible regulation cost 32% of not developing for a similar outcome and prevented 18% of firms from developing. Cap and trade's performance depended on the regulator's ability to accurately allocate firm-level permits that reflect developers' options. In extreme cases, inaccurate allocations made cap and trade perform worse than other the approach. We conclude that, where developers differ in their ability and cost of minimizing impacts, cap and trade should be explored as an inexpensive alternative to traditional approaches.

Design/methodology/approach - After identifying consumer requirements or needs regarding different attributes of olive-oil quality, through a survey of 439 olive-oil consumers, the authors determine the olive-growing practices that optimally satisfy consumer needs through expert opinions. Finally, the use of expert knowledge to construct the House of Quality or the first matrix of quality function deployment allow the authors to define the relative contribution of the various olive-farming practices to the satisfaction of consumer requirements. Findings - The findings have shown that the olive-oil quality attributes most requested by consumers incorporate organoleptic (e.g. acidity, flavour, colour), sociocultural (e.g. creating employment in rural areas, maintenance of the rural population) and environmental ones (environmental externalities). The separation of olives collected from ground and trees (separation), timing of harvesting (according to a fruit-ripeness index), the method of the ground harvest (no picking from the ground), and the method of tree harvest (handpicking) were some of the most commonly identified olive-farming practices that contribute the most to meeting consumers' needs with regard to olive-oil quality. Research limitations/implications - The study suggests detailed analyses of the relationships between customer requirements and other agents practices involved in the olive sector (processing industries: mills, distribution, and marketing management, etc.) to more fully investigate the impact of all these practices on consumers' perceived olive-oil quality attributes. This is the most reliable way to guarantee that the most sought-after quality characteristics are taken into account, not only in the farming stage but also in the various different stages of the olive agri-food chain. Practical implications - Findings represent an opportunity in the market value chain to develop a quality olive oil which is more oriented towards the consumer and able to face future segmentations in the market. This is one of the main innovative features of this study, as it offers good practice guidelines to agents of the olive-oil sector from the consumer perspective. Social implications - This study provides positive implications to consumers, providing them important tools to make an informed choice, and producers and marketers helping the design of production strategies to optimally satisfy the consumer preference with regard to olive-oil quality, and attain a competitive advantage by adding value to the product. Originality/value - This paper is regarded as the pioneer in the literature translating the consumer voice regarding olive-oil quality into specific olive-growing practices good-practices guidelines. Thus, the relevant required quality olive-oil attributes should be clearly described on the label, to enable consumers to identify the quality features and make an informed choice. Furthermore, to meet consumers' needs, the olive-oil sector should focus on the olive-growing practices that optimally satisfy consumer requirements concerning olive-oil quality attributes. This would help to improve legitimacy and boost public support for the Common Agricultural Policy subsidies for the agricultural sector in general, and the olive sector in particular. The findings are particularly valuable in helping policy makers to design marketing strategies to improve the sustainability and competitiveness of Spanish olive oil.","[Sayadi, Samir] Inst Agr Res & Training IFAPA, Agr Econ & Rural Studies, Granada, Spain; [Erraach, Yamna] Inst Natl Agron Tunisia, Dept Agr & Agri Food Econ & Management, Tunis, Tunisia; [Parra-Lopez, Carlos] Inst Agr Res & Training IFAPA, Agr Econ & Sociol, Granada, Spain",Universite de Carthage,"Sayadi, S (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Res & Training IFAPA, Agr Econ & Rural Studies, Granada, Spain.",samir.sayadi@juntadeandalucia.es,"Parra-López, Carlos/A-7730-2008","Parra-López, Carlos/0000-0003-4923-4169","Andalusian Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise through the project [SEJ-03121]; Ministry of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment through the project [AGR-7431]","Andalusian Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise through the project; Ministry of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment through the project","The authors appreciate the financial support for this research from the Andalusian Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise through the project SEJ-03121 (MULTIOLI) and the Ministry of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment through the project AGR-7431.",,106,22,24,2,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This study uses multi-directional efficiency analysis to measure the technical inefficiency scores on a sample of 200 farm observations and single-bootstrap truncated regression model to define factors affecting technical inefficiency. Findings - Managerial and program inefficiency scores are presented for intensive and semi-intensive production systems. The results reveal marked differences in the inefficiency scores across inputs and between production systems. Practical implications - Intensive systems generally have lowest managerial and program inefficiency scores in the Malaysian dairy farming sector. Policy makers could use this information to advise dairy farmers to convert their farming system to the intensive system. Social implications - The results suggest that the Malaysian Government should redefine its policy for providing farm finance and should target young farmers when designing training and extension programs in order to improve the performance of the dairy sector. Originality/value - The existing literature on Southeast Asian dairy farming has neither focused on investigating input-specific efficiency nor on comparing managerial and program efficiency.

Traditional intermediaries, like travel agents, tour operators or even the Global Distribution Systems are progressively disappearing. Consumers undertake their entire tourism product search and booking on-line and therefore a wide range of new tourism e-Mediaries emerge, like single supplier provisions, web-based travel agencies, portals and hotel booking websites. Twitter allow hotel e-Mediaries to spread information and deals, to listen to customers, increase customer engagement, enhance customer satisfaction and obtain deeper insight into the customers' experiences. Up to now, no research has been devoted at investigating the use of Twitter by hotel e-Mediaries. The paper fills this gap and records major hotel e-Mediaries websites and their Twitter accounts. Twitter performance indexes are used to describe the activity and performance of these accounts. Statistical analysis investigates if significant differentiations among hotel booking websites exists, regarding Twitter performance. It is investigated whether Twitter performance is in accordance with hotel booking websites' web traffic data and analytics.","[Vrana, Vasiliki] Technol Educ Inst Cent Macedonia, Serres, Greece; [Zafiropoulos, Kostas; Antoniadis, Konstantinos; Theocharidis, Anastasios-Ioannis] Univ Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Zafiropoulos, K (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece.",kz@uom.gr,"Zafiropoulos, Kostas/GRR-2196-2022; Vrana, Vasiliki/O-7940-2019; Zafiropoulos, Kostas/AAD-3864-2019",,,,,,39,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-47732-9; 978-3-319-47731-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,121,131,,10.1007/978-3-319-47732-9_8,0.0,,,11,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI3AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410645700008,0

However, the mechanisms by which these institutions emerge have not been established. We speculate that economic institutions which support resource conservation, such as property regimes and systems of production, may emerge via a process of cultural group selection amongst social-ecological systems. To explore this proposition, we develop a multilevel selection model of resource management institutions with endogenous group dynamics. The endogenous design permits us to determine whether a given social adaptation is due to individual or group-level evolution. We demonstrate how resource conservation and supporting economic institutions coevolve, and reveal when cultural group selection is involved. In the model, sustainable societies emerge in only a minority of cases. Simulations reveal that property norms facilitate sustainable outcomes most followed by social group marking, and production norms. We describe the institutional transitions which occur along the evolutionary trajectory most likely to achieve sustainability. Analysis of the model reveals that when groups compete indirectly for survival in a harsh environment cultural group selection favors institutions that support resource conservation. However, when groups compete for abundant resources institutions emerge to support overconsumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abnormal trading volume in stock markets is not found on expiration-day, and the increase of transaction costs has no significant effect on volume effect. The expiration of CSI 300 stock index futures is associated with an increase in the volatility, but it is greatly weakened after the futures are restricted. This may be because the size of futures market decreases dramatically. No evidence suggests that price distortions occurred and the spot price moves along the original direction on the following trading day. This trend is strengthened after futures policy adjustment.

Overall, if smaller schools are associated with higher students' achievement in primary level, this conclusion cannot be clearly stated for the secondary schools. Empirical evidences highlight that the effect is often mixed: some studies have found higher achievement among students enrolled in smaller schools, while others have detected higher achievement in very large schools, still others have suggested a non linear relationship. In this paper, analyzing OECD-PISA 2012 data, the effect of school size is investigated considering Italian students' achievement, in order to answer the question if there is an optimal school size in Italy.

The model is the usual composed error specification of the stochastic frontier model, but we allow for managerial selectivity (endogeneity) that works through the worker-level inefficiency term. The new specification captures both worker-level inefficiency and the manager's ability to efficiently select teams to produce output. As the correlation between the manager's selection equation and worker inefficiency goes to zero, our parametric model reduces to the normal-exponential stochastic frontier model of Aigner et al.

Appropriation of these services can drive trade-offs, where the provision of one service may result in the diminution of another. Trade-offs are evident in regions of dynamic land-use change, like agricultural-forest systems, where conflicting goals of agricultural expansion and environmental conservation are present. The objectives of this study were to analyse ecosystem service relationships in the Province of Guarayos (Bolivia), explore the role of decision making in these relationships, and examine how policy scenarios might affect them. Application of multi-objective goal programming, maximising net farm income and net farm carbon sequestration across representative farms, outlined the presence of trade-offs. Farm carbon sequestration ranged from -2196 to 100% of goal values, whilst farm incomes ranged from 38 to 100% of its goal. Decision-making was explicitly behind these ranges, with extreme goal preferences driving the greatest trade-offs. Intermediate solutions, which may represent compromise management options to limit trade-offs, were identified. Application of policy scenarios only dampened, rather than eliminated trade-offs. These results reinforce the complex situation of contemporary decision-makers, balancing multiple, often conflicting goals. Development of models with greater input from decision-makers should be encouraged to assist in formulating viable management solutions and reduce tradeoffs.","[Manners, Rhys] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ Stat & Business Management, Ave Puerta Hierro 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; Res Ctr Management Agr & Environm Risks CEIGRAM, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Manners, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Agr Econ Stat & Business Management, Ave Puerta Hierro 2, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",rhys.manners@upm.es,,", Rhys/0000-0003-0213-5462","European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [283093]; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid [AL13-PID-18, AL14-PID-12]",European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,The research leading to these results has received partial funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [grant number 283093 - The Role Of Biodiversity In climate change MitigatioN (ROBIN) (http://robinproject.info/home)]; the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid [grant numbers AL13-PID-18 Biodiversidad y bienestar humano ante el cambio global en areas tropicales protegidas de America Latina and AL14-PID-12 Biodiversidad y cambio climatic en la Amazonia: Perspectivas socio-economicas y ambientales].,,80,7,8,6,96,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The aim of the policy is to increase efforts to mitigate risks from invasive forest pests and diseases. Such control actions yield spill-over benefits to other landowners and to wider society, meaning that the level of privately-optimal disease control is likely to be less than the socially-optimal level. The policy designer may wish to encourage spatial coordination in the uptake of such PES-type contracts, as spatial coordination delivers an increase in the effectiveness of control measures on disease risks. We conducted a choice experiment with private forest owners in Finland in October 2016. The study elicited the preferences of woodland owners with respect to the design of forest disease control contracts, and gauged their willingness to cooperate with neighbouring forest owners within the framework of such programs.","[Sheremet, Oleg] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Math & Stat, 26 Richmond St, Glasgow G1 1XH, Lanark, Scotland; [Ruokamo, Enni; Juutinen, Artti; Svento, Rauli] Univ Oulu, Econ Dept, POB 8000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Juutinen, Artti] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Paavo Havaksentie 3, Oulu 90570, Finland; [Hanley, Nick] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde; University of Oulu; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Glasgow,"Hanley, N (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Nicholas.Hanley@glasgow.ac.uk,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012","Ruokamo, Enni/0000-0002-2896-4800; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499; Juutinen, Artti/0000-0003-4300-5365",UK Research Councils under the Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity initiative; Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council project BC-DC [AKA292854],UK Research Councils under the Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity initiative; Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council project BC-DC,OS and NH acknowledge funding from the UK Research Councils under the Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity initiative under the project Foremod.

In particular, the social psychological literature within the environmental field suggests that there are two main orientations of people towards wildlife: mutualism and domination. This body of literature has shown how wildlife value orientations can serve as predictors of attitudes and behaviours towards wildlife and form the foundation of human-wildlife conflicts. A common approach in the non-market valuation literature is to include information on attitudes and values in the deterministic part of the utility function, leading to problems of endogeneity bias. To avoid this, analysts have recently shifted their attention to approaches based on latent variables. This paper presents an application of a latent variable and latent class model, to understand how latent orientations influence choices, in a case study in the Italian Alps. The intuition is that different underlying individual value orientation affects preferences and the level of willingness to pay and should be therefore considered in choice models.

The gold standard brought with it the increase in real wages until 1932. In February 1932, the Ecuadorian Government decided to abolish the gold standard which, together with a heavy public expenditure, produced a significant increase in money supply causing high levels of inflation. The evolution of real wages in Ecuador is similar to the evolution registered in Latin America in two important aspects: in both cases an upward trend in real wages can be observed once the international crisis began; after the increase in the purchasing power of wages, there is a decline. This study is the first research trying to understand the impact of the Great Depression in Ecuador through the evolution of real wages.","[Naranjo Navas, Cristian Paul] Univ Nacl Chimborazo, Fac Ciencias Polit & Adm, Campus Norte Edison Riera R, Riobamba, Ecuador",,"Navas, CPN (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Chimborazo, Fac Ciencias Polit & Adm, Campus Norte Edison Riera R, Riobamba, Ecuador.",cnaranjo@unach.edu.ec,"Naranjo Navas, Christian Paúl/GQP-1348-2022","Naranjo Navas, Christian Paúl/0000-0003-1532-203X",,,,,25,0,0,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

As for quasi-rational locators, whose rationality is limited in finding the best location especially in the short run, their houses and jobs tend to agglomerate, yielding congestion especially in growing localities. In the long run, when more information and time to adapt to such an externality become available, however, jobs-housing (J-H) balance may be improved after short-run imbalance. Graphically, the J-H balance to be expressible in the J-H ratio (X) and commuting efficiency (Y) tend to be linearly traded off at a regional level in the long run, but this trade-off can be U-shaped at a local level especially in the short run. This study discusses long-run stabilisation after short-run dynamic adaptation (periods) to such a U-shaped 'trade-off' in and outside the greenbelt of Seoul. Its spatial transitions between 2000, 2005, and 2010 were analysed regarding the quasi-rational commuters' local amelioration of the trade-off. It is shown that commuting time decreased and J-H balance overall improved in the long run. This trend is more apparent in the new towns built between 1989 and 1995 than the nine new towns built after the mid 2000s. Mean commuting time decreased sharply in such most job-rich or formerly housing-rich areas as ones with J-H ratios >2.08 or <1.18. This suggests a quasi-rational-commuter-led transition to improved balance in the long run, despite the greenbelt's commuting-delaying effect. Considering this J-H range, this transition needs to be managed more scientifically, minimising the greenbelt's negative effect with any positive effect untainted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We use original data collected from winegrowers who participated in an AES targeting non-point source pollution from herbicides in 2011 and 2012 in the South region of France. Using the variation in the implementation of the scheme across time and space and a matching approach, we show that the quantity of herbicides used by participants in the scheme in 2011 ranges from 38 to 53% below what they would have used without the scheme and this percentage is between 42 and 50% in 2012. Further, our results suggest that least demanding AES options are effective in avoiding pollution peaks when weed pressure is high, whereas more demanding AES options guarantee an overall reduction in herbicide use, even during relatively easy fanning years in which less weed pressure is experienced.","[Kuhfuss, Laure] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Kuhfuss, Laure] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Dundee, Scotland; [Subervie, Julie] French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, Montpellier, France; [Subervie, Julie] CEE M, Montpellier, France",University of St Andrews; James Hutton Institute; INRAE; Universite de Montpellier,"Kuhfuss, L (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",lk38@st-andrews.ac.uk; subervie@supagro.inra.fr,"Kuhfuss, Laure/ABB-7781-2020; Kuhfuss, Laure/JVZ-1576-2024","Kuhfuss, Laure/0000-0001-5029-1895; Kuhfuss, Laure/0000-0001-5029-1895","French Agency for Water and Aquatic Environments, call for projects 'Changer les pratiques agricoles pour preserver les services ecosystemiques' [1073/2012]; Rural & Environment Science & Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government","French Agency for Water and Aquatic Environments, call for projects 'Changer les pratiques agricoles pour preserver les services ecosystemiques'; Rural & Environment Science & Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government","Funding for this research was provided by the French Agency for Water and Aquatic Environments (1073/2012) (ONEMA) as part of the 2011 call for projects 'Changer les pratiques agricoles pour preserver les services ecosystemiques' supporting the implementation of the French National Action plan Ecophyto 2018.

We extend the single-country setting of that research to a transnational perspective and explore whether a relationship exists between green self-image (GSI) and life satisfaction (LS), both European-wide and at the national level. In order to explain differences in the GSI-LS relationship across nations and time, we study the role of pro-environmental values as a shared social norm. We find a significantly positive GSI-LS relationship in a pool of 35 European countries and in the majority of individual countries. In addition, we show that the wellbeing benefit of holding a green self-image is greater in societies that display more unanimity with respect to pro-environmental attitudes. Invoking the notion of social norms as shared agreements about what is appropriate and inappropriate, we take the latter finding to indicate that part of the well-being benefit from holding pro environmental values derives from conformity to a social norm.","[Welsch, Heinz; Kuehling, Jan] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Welsch, H (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",welsch@uni-oldenburg.de,,"Kuhling, Jan/0000-0001-7252-1807",Stiftung Mercator,Stiftung Mercator,We are grateful to three anonymous reviewers for insightful comments.

There are still few papers that analyze when human capital sorting occurs and whom it involves. Using data on 16 cohorts of university graduates in Sweden, we demonstrate significant sorting to urban regions on high school grades and education levels of parents, i.e., two attributes typically associated with latent abilities that are valued in the labor market. A large part of this sorting has already occurred in deciding where to study, because the top universities in Sweden are predominantly located in urban regions. The largest part of directed sorting on ability indicators occurs in the decision of where to study. Even after controlling for sorting prior to labor market entry, the best and brightest are still more likely to start working in urban regions. However, this effect appears to be driven by Sweden's main metropolitan region, Stockholm. We find no influence of our ability indicators on the probability of starting to work in urban regions after graduation when Stockholm is excluded. Studies of human capital sorting need to account for selection processes to and from universities, because neglecting mobility prior to labor market entry is likely to lead to an underestimation of the extent of the sorting to urban regions.","[Ahlin, Lina; Andersson, Martin] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden; [Ahlin, Lina; Andersson, Martin] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] Blekinge Inst Technol BTH, Dept Ind Econ, SE-37179 Karlskrona, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin; Thulin, Per] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Stockholm, Sweden; [Thulin, Per] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Blekinge Institute Technology; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Royal Institute of Technology,"Andersson, M (通讯作者)，Blekinge Inst Technol BTH, Dept Ind Econ, SE-37179 Karlskrona, Sweden.",martin.andersson@bth.se,"Andersson, Martin/AAB-5164-2021","Andersson, Martin/0000-0002-0302-6244",Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2011-80]; Swedish Research Council (Linnaeus Grant) [349200680]; Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems [2010-07370],Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council (Linnaeus Grant)(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems(Vinnova),"This work has been supported by financial grants from the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (Dnr 2011-80), as well as the Swedish Research Council (Linnaeus Grant No. 349200680) and the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (Grant agreement 2010-07370).",,62,22,23,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

It rests on the assumption that, as a global public good, the provision of biodiversity conservation is independent of geographical and political jurisdictions. However, from a welfare economic perspective this assumption requires testing and justification. Indeed, distance may matter, as may the country of provision. This study applies a choice experiment to estimate individuals' marginal willingness to pay for comparable biodiversity conservation measures and outcomes across country borders, and with different distances from their place of residence to conservation locations in Denmark and in Southern Sweden. The case is designed to distinguish the effect of distance from the effect of country of residence versus country of provision. We find a clear and distinguishable effect of both location and country of provision. We find distance-related attributes to reflect bridge tolls and per-kilometre transport costs, and Swedes and Danes to prefer provision in their own country, over provision in the neighbouring country. The results of this study may be useful in discussing cooperation on regional and even global biodiversity conservation efforts.","[Bakhtiari, Fatemeh; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark; Lundhede, Thomas Hedemark; Strange, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen C, Denmark; [Boman, Mattias] Univ West Indies, Fac Food & Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Bakhtiari, Fatemeh] Tech Univ Denmark, UNEP DTU Partnership, Marmorvej 51, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Lundhede, Thomas Hedemark] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy Africa, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Copenhagen; University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine; Technical University of Denmark; University of Pretoria,"Bakhtiari, F (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, UNEP DTU Partnership, Marmorvej 51, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",fatebak@dtu.dk,"Nummer2, CMEC/HKE-1900-2023; Strange, Niels/AAB-5155-2020; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/K-8770-2014; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/C-9354-2015","Strange, Niels/0000-0002-8842-8022; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/0000-0002-3305-8343; Bakhtiari, Fatemeh/0000-0002-9123-4173; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/0000-0002-1313-6228","Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission under Erasmus Mundus Action 1 through Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctoral Program Forests and Nature for Society (FONASO); Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF96]","Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission under Erasmus Mundus Action 1 through Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctoral Program Forests and Nature for Society (FONASO); Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond)","The first author was funded by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission under Erasmus Mundus Action 1, through an individual Doctoral fellowship that was part of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctoral Program Forests and Nature for Society (FONASO).

However, the limits of IWRM also need to be recognised, especially the demands on water planners seeking to balance multiple objectives across multiple sites. This paper scrutinises the need for superordinate integrated decisions when property rights are already well-defined and tradeable. By using simplified examples derived from the Australian milieu, we also consider cases where the property rights are less well defined and trade is not an easy option. The examples demonstrate that efficient decisions can arise without a superordinate water utility making integrated plans but the scale of decisions does matter, as does the measurement of the attributes of water in question. The paper also shows the necessity for understanding and linking institutional scope, hydrological influences and ecological responses whenever IWRM is purportedly seeking to simultaneously bring about ecological gains.

It focuses on the impacts of German-speaking immigrants on education through three channels: their share of the population in the nineteenth century, their on-the-job skills, and the schools they founded. Using a new dataset based on almanacs from 1873 and 1888, these effects are evaluated for the nineteenth, early twentieth, and early twenty-first centuries. The article shows that the institutionalized demand for education of these immigrants, reflected by the establishment of schools, was their main contribution to the accumulation of human capital. The effect of German schools on educational levels required a period to mature and dissipated over time. Nevertheless, its influence was substantial at the beginning of the twentieth century, affecting enrolment levels in private and state schools, a result that suggests the existence of spillover and contagion effects. Moreover, current indicators for stocks and flows of human capital in SAo Paulo are strongly associated with their historical levels. At the same time, this path dependence is conditional on the type of school: while a positive persistence is found for the private system throughout the twentieth century, convergence occurred in state schools.","[de Souza, Bruno Gabriel Witzel] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"de Souza, BGW (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.",,,,German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The author wishes to thank Stephan Klasen, Simon Lange, Renato Colistete, Philip Keefer, Leonardo Gardenal, and Lea Strub for their valuable support.

A survey of the existing evidence nonetheless reveals that this price discount lies anywhere between - 75.5% to a + 61.0% price premium. In this paper we summarise and explore the wide variation in the results to obtain 'best' estimates with which to guide policy. Results from our meta-analysis comprising 37 published works and 364 point estimates indicate marked differences between studies according to when and where they were conducted. For coastal regions the results show that properties located in the floodplain command higher prices; this finding is however likely to be caused by a high correlation between omitted coastal amenities and flood risk. There is moreover, evidence that publication bias affects the coastal flooding literature. Results from meta-regression analyses intended to uncover sources of heterogeneity confirm that controlling for time elapsed since the most recent flood is especially important. For inland flooding the price discount associated with location in the 100-year floodplain is -4.6%. Although other estimates are defensible, we suggest this figure be used as a rule of thumb to determine the benefits of flood relief projects to households.","[Beltran, Allan] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Maddison, David; Elliott, Robert J.

While there is considerable debate among economists whether technology can mitigate scarcities through development of substitutes, there is little actual research on the mechanisms and limitations of this substitution process. In this study, I seek to build a bridge between scarcity and innovation literatures to study when technologists decide to develop technological substitutes. My starting point is the theory of technology as a recombination of existing mental and physical components. Combining this theory with modern scarcity literature that differentiates between absolute, relative, and quasi-scarcities yields a more nuanced framework for understanding both different types of scarcities, and how technologists decide whether or not to develop or adopt technological substitutes. This improves our understanding of the possibilities and limitations of scarcity-induced innovation. I then illustrate the use of this framework with two brief historical case studies about constraint-induced innovation. I conclude that the mainstream economic practice of assuming that substitution will occur automatically, even in cases of absolute scarcity, may hide extremely important phenomena from discussion and debate behind a veil of circular reasoning.","[Korhonen, Janne M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland; [Korhonen, Janne M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management Studies Int Business, POB 21210, FI-00076 Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University; Aalto University,"Korhonen, JM (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland.;Korhonen, JM (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management Studies Int Business, POB 21210, FI-00076 Helsinki, Finland.",janne.m.korhonen@aalto.fi,,"Korhonen, Janne/0000-0003-3407-6188",Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation,Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation,This study has been funded by a grant from Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation.,,77,7,8,2,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Sweden has developed long series of comprehensive 'green' national accounts for this entire period and is, therefore, interesting as a testing ground for the hypotheses linking green accounting and sustainability. We find support for the weakest of the hypotheses in the theoretical literature on weak sustainability and genuine savings, namely that genuine savings are correlated with future economic well-being. However, the stronger hypotheses in this literature are not supported: there is no one-to-one relationship between genuine savings and prosperity, there is no indication that the relationship becomes stronger for longer time horizons, or with more comprehensive savings measures. The findings suggest that genuine savings, at least as currently measured in national accounts and satellite accounts, may not be a good forward-looking indicator of future prosperity.","[Lindmark, Magnus] Umed Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Lindmark, Magnus] CERE, Umea, Sweden; [Huong Nguyen Thu; Stage, Jesper] Luled Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Technol & Social Sci, S-97187 Luled, Sweden; [Huong Nguyen Thu] Stockholm Univ, Dept Math, Div Math Stat, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Lulea University of Technology; Stockholm University,"Stage, J (通讯作者)，Luled Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Technol & Social Sci, S-97187 Luled, Sweden.",Jesper.Stage@ltu.se,"Stage, Jesper/B-6718-2009; Thu, Huong Nguyen/AAE-3180-2019","Thu, Huong Nguyen/0000-0002-9832-7866; Nguyen, Huong/0000-0003-0579-9803; Stage, Jesper/0000-0001-7206-6568",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [P2017-0059:1],Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"Financial support from the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation (P2017-0059:1) is gratefully acknowledged.

To address these problems, alternative distribution formats aimed at reducing food waste - and generating a positive social impact - are emerging, particularly food banks and social supermarkets. Recently, opportunities created by digital technology and the phenomenon of the sharing economy have boosted the increasing number of web platforms and food sharing apps that are being developed by existing organizations or by new entities that work exclusively online. The main aim of this research is to highlight - following an overview of existing food sharing models - how alternative distribution systems change in response to digitalization, and how the value propositions they claim change in the online context. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on a sample of 52 food sharing cases was carried out. Three categories of models have emerged: - the sharing for money model, which is primarily a B2C for-profit model to reduce waste and, at the same time, generate revenue; - the sharing for charity model in which food is collected and given to non-profit organizations; the sharing for the community model which is a P2P model where food is shared amongst consumers. By way of conclusion we suggest that food bank seems to be replicated online in the same way in the online context (the sharing for charity model). However the model of the social supermarket does not seems to be replicated in the same way in the digital context, but changes towards a more profit oriented approach (the sharing for money model). Additionally, in the digital scenario, a new model emerges: the sharing for the community. Finally, the study highlights some preliminary evidences on the effects of the new forms of sharing on social inequality.","[Michelini, Laura; Iasevoli, Gennaro] LUMSA Univ, Rome, Italy; [Principato, Ludovica] Roma Tre Univ, Rome, Italy",Universita LUMSA; Roma Tre University,"Michelini, L (通讯作者)，LUMSA Univ, Rome, Italy.",l.michelini@lumsa.it; ludovica.principato@uniroma3.it; iasevoli@lumsa.it,"An, Hongda/GNH-4090-2022","Michelini, Laura/0000-0002-3015-0566; Principato, Ludovica/0000-0003-0046-828X",,,,,72,128,132,4,136,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

To understand this, household surveys were conducted in 2007 and 2014 in Wanzai, Jiangxi Province China, where organic farming started in 2000. The results show that organic farming did contribute to higher farm incomes for small-scale farmers ( < 1 ha land) compared to those practicing conventional agriculture, regardless of whether the profitability is measured on a per land unit or per household basis. The annual farmers household net income increased from 2007 to 2014, however, the farm income of small-scale farmers only makes up a minor part of total household income and its percentage becomes less and less over time. For medium-scale organic farmers ( > 1 ha land), the proportion of income from farming was higher (56% in 2007 and 77% in 2014), leading to average farm incomes of USD16,108 in 2014. Among organic farmers, cooperatives members performed better economically than those not in cooperatives.

We find that understandings of equity in such vanguard visions are narrowly conceived as epistemic challenges, answerable by (more) scientific analysis. Major concerns about equity are treated as empirical matters, requiring scientific assessment of feasibility, risks, or win-win distributive outcomes and optimizations, with concurrent calls to delimit risk or reduce scientific uncertainties. We argue that such epistemic framings sidestep, inter alia, the inequality in resources available to diverse non-experts-including the vulnerable evoked in expert visions-to project their own equity perspectives onto imagined technological pathways of the future. These may include concerns relating to moral or historical responsibility and/or lack of agency in shaping the directions of innovation. We conclude that the performative power and political implications of specific expert visions of equity, evoked as a rationale to undertake solar geoengineering research, require continued scrutiny.","[Flegal, Jane A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gupta, Aarti] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Wageningen University & Research,"Gupta, A (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",jflegal@berkeley.edu; aarti.gupta@wur.nl,,"Gupta, Aarti/0000-0003-4908-7453",,,,,85,50,52,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

These interactions include the potential for gain for the continent in the form of new trade opportunities and climate finance. In this paper we quantify the costs and benefits of climate policy in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using an Integrated Assessment Model, we consider key characteristics of the continent, including the favorable conditions for renewable energy. A newly designed scenario analysis allows identifying the main drivers of the results. We show that Sub-Saharan Africa could implement climate policy in line with the 2 degrees C target at roughly net zero costs if the international community follows up on its commitment towards supporting developing countries as declared in the Paris Agreement. Sub-Saharan Africa could become an important supplier of energy from biomass and could thus even benefit from more ambitious climate policy due to higher demand for this source of energy. The absence of a painful trade-off between short-term development and long-term climate stabilization could provide policy-makers with a much richer policy option space than previously considered. One such option is to link climate policy with poverty reduction through, for example, the provision of clean electricity.","[Leimbach, Marian; Roming, Niklas; Schultes, Anselm; Schwerhoff, Gregor] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Roming, Niklas; Schultes, Anselm] Tech Univ Berlin, Secretariat EB 4-1,Str 17,Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Roming, Niklas] Climate Analyt gGmbH, Ritterstr 3, D-10969 Berlin, Germany; [Schwerhoff, Gregor] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Leimbach, M (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",leimbach@pik-potsdam.de; niklas.roming@climateanalytics.org; schultes@pik-potsdam.de; schwerhoff@mcc-berlin.net,"Schwerhoff, Gregor/L-2365-2019","Schwerhoff, Gregor/0000-0003-3644-3447",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within Economics of Climate Change (CliPoN) [01LA1105A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within Economics of Climate Change (CliPoN)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the call Economics of Climate Change (funding code 01LA1105A, CliPoN) is gratefully acknowledged.",,49,19,20,2,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This paper developed a game-theory model in the context of rural China, which describes the endogenous formation of land rights as a bargaining process between ordinary villagers and village leaders. This model gave rise to theoretical predictions pertaining to the implications of two PES schemes in China for land tenure, namely the Sloping Land Conversion Programme (SLCP) and the Ecological Public-Benefit Forest Compensation Programme (EPBFCP). The theoretical predictions were tested using primary data collected through large-scale field surveys. These data were analysed using the Propensity Score Matching method and panel data models. Both the theoretical analysis and the empirical results find that the SLCP has likely enhanced land tenure security by increasing the bargaining costs of village leaders' attempts to reallocate SLCP lands to other households. On the other hand, villagers tend to have less motivation to de-collectivise those forest lands enrolled in the EPBFCP, which somewhat stands in the way of the country's agenda to further de-collectivise communal forests and allocate them to individual households.","[Liu, Zhaoyang] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Gong, Yazhen] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Kontoleon, Andreas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",Peking University; Renmin University of China; University of Cambridge,"Gong, YZ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",ygong.2010@ruc.edu.cn,"LIU, Z/AAD-2255-2020","LIU, Z/0000-0003-0124-0113",Renmin University [11XNC002]; British Academy [SG121920]; Cambridge Humanities Research Grants Scheme; Economy and Environment Program for Southeast Asia [PCO13-0308-009],Renmin University; British Academy; Cambridge Humanities Research Grants Scheme; Economy and Environment Program for Southeast Asia,"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Renmin University for the Research on Land Market Development in the Forest Tenure Reform (Project No. 11XNC002), the British Academy (Reference: SG121920), the Cambridge Humanities Research Grants Scheme and the Economy and Environment Program for Southeast Asia (Reference: PCO13-0308-009).",,82,7,8,3,88,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

There is a multitude of empirical studies examining this relationship using various measures of governance and study designs, coming to diverse conclusions. In order to identify the source of variation across studies, this article conducts a meta-analysis of 32 empirical cross-country studies in the field of economics, containing 227 estimates of the impact of different governance measures on deforestation. Using an ordered probit model, we find that the choice of the governance measure is the main factor in explaining variations in the outcomes of the studies. In particular, studies using environmental policy, ownership rights, presence of environmental NGOs, and rule of law as measures of governance, are more likely to find that better governance reduces deforestation. In contrast, studies using democracy and rights as a measure of governance are more likely to find that deforestation increases, when governance is improved. The finding that not all aspects of governance improvements are equally supportive of forest conservation suggests that more nuanced analyses of specific aspects of environmental governance are required to guide evidence based policy making.","[Wehkamp, Johanna; Koch, Nicolas; Luebbers, Sebastian; Fuss, Sabine] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Wehkamp, Johanna] Tech Univ Berlin, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Wehkamp, J (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.;Wehkamp, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",wehkamp@mcc-berlin.net,"Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019","Koch, Nicolas/0000-0002-7775-034X","Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation project Market and Risk Reduction Tools for REDD +; Delivering Incentives to End Deforestation: Global Ambition, Private/Public Finance and Zero-Deforestation Supply Chains","Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation project Market and Risk Reduction Tools for REDD +; Delivering Incentives to End Deforestation: Global Ambition, Private/Public Finance and Zero-Deforestation Supply Chains","We would like to thank three anonymous reviewers for useful comments and feedback.

Marketing plays an increasingly important role in society, which is closely linked to increasing competition and can influence positively or negatively the local, national and global economy. Due to increased competition on the products and services market, customer income and access to information, it is imperative to present methods that will facilitate knowledge, understanding of their importance and their application by companies. The most influential marketing people explore the frontiers of the most effective communication between companies and customers, paying special attention to telecommunication methods, to online ones, trying to create experiences and new consumer habits to satisfy, in a higher level, the consumption needs of customers. Correctly understood by some countries, the marketing manager allowed tremendous development of the respective companies, a development that was not anticipated by a majority of the world's population a hundred years ago. Company managers need to know client querries, recognize changes in demand, to know what competition is doing, and provide the best value of money for their products or services. By applying these methods, we will know exactly how many products or services we can sell to the targeted target audience, which is the best selling price in relation to customer income and cost of production, what is the degree of customer acceptance and satisfaction, and also the most effective ways to attract and persuade customers to test, taste and buy our products or services once, at least.","[Alecu, Ioan Iulian] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Alecu, II (通讯作者)，Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest, Romania.",iulian_alecu_2000@yahoo.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,224,229,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700026,0

The arguments advanced in that context include the ideas that digital natives no longer can be taught effectively by digital immigrants, that instructors must meet students where they live, and that changes to pedagogy go hand in glove with an understanding of the putative characteristics of today's young learners. I argue that such claims are at best inconsistent with the evidence, that major structural issues have been ignored thereby framing debates far too narrowly, and that the political and economic consequences of neoliberalism must be taken seriously if education is to be of any value, going forward. The paper offers a third, medium way which highlights what we know about literacy, what technology can and cannot reasonably offer, and how analog ways can contribute to the intellectual and social development of post-secondary students.

However, adoption of insects in western culture, including New Zealand (NZ) is slow. The purpose of this paper is to explore consumer attitudes, drivers and barriers towards entomophagy and uncover consumer expectations surrounding what their ideal insect product attributes are. Design/methodology/approach In total, 32 participants took part in three product design workshops. This involved two sections. First, focus groups discussion took place surrounding consumer acceptance. Second, following adapted consumer idealised design, groups of three or four designed their ideal liquid and solid product incorporating extracted insect protein. Designs included the ideal product, place, price and promotional attributes. Findings Participants were both disgusted and intrigued about entomophagy, with common barriers including; culture, food neophobia, disgust sensitivity, lack of necessity and knowledge. Motivational drivers were novelty, health, sustainability and/or nutrition. Most of the liquid and solid food products were designed as a premium priced sweet snack, drink or breakfast option, as opposed to a meat substitute. The convenience, health and sustainability benefits of certain products were promoted towards health and fitness oriented consumers. Whereas, other designs promoted the novelty of insects to kids or the general population, in order to introduce the idea of entomophagy to consumers.

Design/methodology/approach This survey covered 74 different farms, slaughterhouses, meat processors, and retailers and 500 consumers, using two methods. From the farm to retail, analysis covered customer - supplier viewpoints in different stages of the supply chain. From the consumers to the farms, the quality function deployment method was used. Five houses of quality have been developed using the Delphi method to synthesize the opinions of experts. Findings Farm-slaughter comparison shows that final weight at farm gate and animal welfare are the most important quality attributes. The quality aspect important for slaughterhouses and meat processors is the cold chain. Retailers and meat processors highlight the portfolio of various chicken meat products as their most important quality attribute. At the points of sale, shelf illumination and product placement are prevailing. Research limitations/implications The results suggest that there are different views on quality by all actors in the supply chain, from quality of chicken meat, food safety and quality of service in retail to profitability and animal welfare. Practical implications The paper enhances simplicity in analyzing quality aspects of different types of meat supply chains. This methodology enables a synergy of value chain promotion with other quality development approaches. It also creates possibilities for policy makers to improve competitiveness strategies.

A pilot study on Italian households,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Questionnaires; Self-assessment; Household food waste; Quantification; Diary,FINNISH HOUSEHOLDS; ATTITUDES; IMPACT,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the reliability of questionnaires as a method of quantifying household food waste (FW), thus providing context regarding the validity of existing Italian estimates. Design/methodology/approach A total of 30 households were involved in a diary study that was conducted for one week. The participating households were first asked about their FW quantities in a questionnaire. Half of the households who filled their diaries properly were then audited through waste sorting analysis performed on their garbage. Non-parametric tests were used to test for differences in FW estimates between audited and non-audited households, as well as differences among estimates obtained through different quantification methodologies. Findings Edible FW was estimated to be 489 grams per week based on questionnaires, and 1,035 grams per week based on diaries. In the audited sub-sample of households, FW estimates were 334 grams per week based on questionnaires, 818 grams per week based on diaries and 1,058 grams per week based on waste sorting analysis. Research limitations/implications Given the small sample size in the present study, future studies can utilize larger samples to assess whether the differences identified in estimates can be replicated. Future studies can also inquire into the behavioral biases that led consumers to underestimate their FW. Practical implications Results of the present study point against the use of questionnaires to quantify household FW, hence raising some doubt on the reliability of existent Italian estimates. Where waste sorting is unfeasible, the use of adjustment methods or diaries is suggested to better inform policies. Originality/value This study is one of the first on FW quantification that tests three different methodologies on the same sample, and is the first to do so in Italy, where estimates are still very poor.","[Giordano, Claudia; Piras, Simone; Boschini, Matteo; Falasconi, Luca] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Giordano, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Bologna, Italy.",claudia.giordano4@unibo.it; simone.piras@unibo.it; matteo.boschini@unibo.it; luca.falasconi@unibo.it,"Claudia, Giordano/ABC-3414-2020; Piras, Simone/AAY-6693-2020; falasconi, luca/AHB-0701-2022","Piras, Simone/0000-0003-0334-6800; Claudia, Giordano/0000-0003-4117-5918",,,,,31,65,65,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The study was conducted in years 2011-2016. It was found that in years 2001-2016, the pace of structural changes in regions was not high indicating a high level of concentration of food industry production and agricultural commodity production. Analysis of location quotients in food processing indicates that the highest share of production sold in total food production was recorded in Mazowieckie, Wielkopolskie and Podlaskie provinces (location quotients of 1.5 to 2.0). In terms of agricultural production, the highest levels of agricultural commodity production have been recorded in Wielkopolskie and Podlaskie provinces (location quotient values of 1.5-2.2).

This paper presents a methodology for undertaking contextual user research during healthcare design projects (in home, primary or acute care settings) by which all relevant human factors of a procedure can be recorded, documented and analyzed. An innovative method of graphically representing the results of this analysis is proposed which visualizes the interactions and inter-dependencies between all stake-holders and artefacts involved in a procedure and the environment in which it takes place. The proposed methodology is intended to assist researchers, designers, architects and healthcare professionals during the research phase of a healthcare design project to reveal user needs, identify potential risks, provide documentation for regulatory adherence and inform the development of a comprehensive and inclusive design brief. The paper presents the context and development of this systematic process, which draws on empirical and theoretical methodologies, a studio based pedagogy, and the experience of delivering real-world educational design projects in partnership with healthcare clinicians and medical device companies. It also highlights the capacity for this form of learning to align with Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. The application of the methodology has the ability to extract key environmental, user and human factors insights. Most importantly, these insights can inform the design process, positively impact on patient experience and safety through improvements in device development and care delivery, and enable the creation of more inclusive and accessible healthcare solutions.","[Healion, Donal; O'Dowd, Enda; Russell, Sam] Natl Coll Art & Design, Dublin, Ireland",National College of Art & Design,"Healion, D (通讯作者)，Natl Coll Art & Design, Prod Design Dept, 100 Thomas St, Dublin D08 K521, Ireland.",healiond@staff.ncad.ie,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,7,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,239,249,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-239,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371480.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100023,0

There have been noticeable advances in the design of cultural, physical and digital spaces, which provide wider access to a museum's physical and intellectual resources, for individuals of diverse ages and abilities. However, responses have varied in consistency, efficacy, and legacy. This year-long design research project, in partnership with the Wellcome Collection and the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, Royal College of Art, develops a working set of tools that can be used by museums to improve accessibility in a more permanent and reiterative manner, with a view towards gathering and sharing relevant data, and design responses, within a broad network of museums and cultural institutions. This paper outlines recent approaches by relevant experts in the field and outlines a new approach to incorporating inclusive design within the process of exhibition creation. It uses co-design methods to provide a set of principled guidelines that respond to all relevant stakeholders. These guidelines are predicated on the understanding that establishing empathetic links between exhibition-makers and exhibition audience members is essential, resulting in a positive collaboration, combining the skills of museum professionals with the lived experience of people with disabilities. A central goal of the research is to explore how design issues surrounding access can be framed as an essential and positive component of the design process, and, more importantly, an opportunity for innovation, not simply an obligatory requirement.

The field of agri-logistics lies at the critical intersection of the agricultural and logistics sectors and is capable of ameliorating the state of food distribution in the country. The inefficiencies inherent in the food distribution system in India lead to massive post-harvest wastage that is estimated at around 13bn dollars per annum. This paper examines the improvement drivers, enablers and resistors of agri-logistics that can significantly contribute toward the enhancement of the agricultural supply chain. Design/methodology/approach The synthesis and prioritization of drivers, enablers and resistors was based on an extensive literature review and consultation with experts. With the help of semi-structured interviews and a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process approach, the research develops a drivers-enablers-resitors framework. Findings The outcome is a hierarchy-based framework that prioritizes the drivers, enablers and resistors of agri-logistics. The research reveals the critical areas where decision makers should channelize their resources and efforts to gain maximum benefits. Originality/value The segmentation of the factors impacting agri-logistics into drivers, enablers and resistors provides a fresh perspective on the issue and helps improve understanding of the problem.

Design/methodology/approach A survey of students' self-reported sources of and trust in food safety knowledge was performed. A student response system was used for data collection, and the students were asked to answer questions presented on a PowerPoint presentation using a small wireless handheld device: a clicker. A questionnaire with 24 questions was used, and the responses were collected at 18 different schools with a total of 529 participants attending school Year 9. Findings Mothers were reported as being the most important source of food safety knowledge (38 per cent), especially among girls, and were also given high credibility (36 per cent). Boys reported trusting home and consumer studies (HCS), fathers and media to a higher extent. Girls reported cooking at home more often but, for all students, it was more common to rarely or never cook at home, which is why HCS teaching can be seen as valuable for many students. HCS teaching needs to be improved in order to raise its credibility. About half of the students (51 per cent) reported to have the highest trust for their source of knowledge. Research limitations/implications The students could only choose one source of knowledge and trust, although it is usual to learn from many different sources. Practical implications HCS teaching needs to get higher credibility among students as a counterweight against other sources. Social implications Educated consumers could influence their health.

It develops the hypothesis that resistance, on the basis of them being paternalistic, is associated with implementers experiencing ethical breaches that contribute to frustration and low acceptability. This may be leading to accusations of paternalism and non-cooperation. Design/methodology/approach - It takes a deontological perspective and uses Upshur's (2002) public health ethics framework to explore the potential that parents involved in school fundraising and private school food vendors are experiencing ethical breaches associated with implementation of school food and beverage sales policies in the Canadian context. Findings - Upshur's (2002) harm principle highlighted how some implementers feel a loss of freedom in how they choose to function, which is perceived to be resulting in lost profits. Parents involved in fundraising activities may experience feelings of coercion. Opting out of fundraising may result in their children's schools having fewer resources. Smaller private vendors are coerced through economic incentives while being bound by what products are available in the marketplace and the associated costs of items that comply with nutrition standards. Discussion around the reciprocity principle revealed implementers feel they are not adequately supported to implement. Transparency has been questioned where stakeholders report their perspectives are often not equally considered in decision making. Originality/value - This is the first paper to explore the often cited resistance to the paternalistic nature of school food and beverage environment policies as an implementation barrier. Using a deontological ethical perspective offers an original way to discuss school food policies. This work offers potential leverage points at which policy-makers and practitioners may intervene to improve acceptability and contribute to more effective, consistent implementation.","[Levay, Adrienne Vanessa] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Integrated Studies Land & Food Syst, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Chapman, Gwen E.] Univ Guelph, Coll Social & Appl Human Sci, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Seed, Barbara] Food & Nutr Policy, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Guelph,"Chapman, GE (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Social & Appl Human Sci, Guelph, ON, Canada.",gwen.chapman@uoguelph.ca,,,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Fredrick Banting and Charles Best Canada Graduate Scholarship Doctoral Award [6557]; University of British Columbia's Four Year Fellowship Award [6569, 6456]",Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Fredrick Banting and Charles Best Canada Graduate Scholarship Doctoral Award(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); University of British Columbia's Four Year Fellowship Award,"AL is supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Fredrick Banting and Charles Best Canada Graduate Scholarship Doctoral Award (UBC Award No. 6557) and the University of British Columbia's Four Year Fellowship Award (UBC Award Nos 6569, 6456).

In short, the infrastructure funding space currently looks hazy and badly in need of a relook, if all the announced policy goals have the slender chance of meeting with success in days to come.","[Mishra, Bishnu Prasad] Xavier Univ Bhubaneshwar, XIMB, Bhubaneswar 751013, Odisha, India",,"Mishra, BP (通讯作者)，Xavier Univ Bhubaneshwar, XIMB, Bhubaneswar 751013, Odisha, India.",bishnu@ximb.ac.in,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-99555-7; 978-3-319-99554-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,265,281,,10.1007/978-3-319-99555-7_16,0.0,,,17,"Business; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BL7MM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455194200017,0

However, while sustainability transition is a global challenge, diffusion and adoption of innovation tends to be uneven in space and unequal access may cause substantial heterogeneity in energy transition. This research analyzes how domestic and foreign innovation activities in the renewable energy sector influence energy transition over time. Empirical testing shows that a country's domestic innovation activity impacts renewable electricity generation capacity sooner than foreign technological innovations. I document that there are substantial barriers to substitute foreign technologies for domestic innovation efforts in the short run but also observe that foreign technologies have a stronger impact after some years. These findings have implications for cross-border coordination of governmental innovation support and complementary policy instruments that aim at increasing adoption speed across borders.","[Noseleit, Florian] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Noseleit, F (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",f.noseleit@rug.nl,"Noseleit, Florian/AAX-7933-2020","Noseleit, Florian/0000-0002-9881-9334",,,,,36,17,20,6,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Broadly, human capital encompasses for example, employee's health, which is the foundation of organization's stability, efficiency and competitiveness. Investment in human capital means expenditure on health, education and social services in general and in its narrow sense. Human capital investment increases productivity and competitive advantage of an organization, manifested through additional income and higher profitability. Besides companies, individuals and society gain return of investment in human capital. Employees benefit from higher net earnings and other non-cash benefits. Society benefits from increased size of the economically active population, tax revenue growth, savings on social transfers, greater inclusiveness of democratic processes, etc. Obesity is the greatest threat of the 21st century. The burden of obesity is immense and includes numerous life-long health, social, and economic consequences that are extended far beyond the individual level. Worldwide prevalence says that 1.9 billion or 39% of adults are overweight, and 650 million or 13% are obese. Besides excess health care expenditure, obesity leads to lost productivity and foregone economic growth due to sick leave, lower productivity at work, mortality and permanent disability. Human capital is an important factor in individual, firm and national economic growth. Therefore, investing in health is the basis for economic progress of a nation. In Croatia 38.1% of population is overweight and 20.3% are obese, with significant regional differences. The aim of the paper is to analyse the impact of high obesity rates in Eastern Croatia on human capital. A number of sectorspecific measures are proposed to facilitate more effective obesity prevention measures that will consequently result in improvements in human capital and economic growth.","[Odobasa, Rajko] Fac Law Osijek, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek, Croatia; [Banjari, Ines] Fac Food & Technol Osijek, Franje Kuhaca 20, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Odobasa, R (通讯作者)，Fac Law Osijek, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek, Croatia.",rajko.odobasa@pravos.hr; ibanjari@ptfos.hr,"Banjari, Ines/AFV-2245-2022","Banjari, Ines/0000-0002-8680-5007",,,,,19,0,0,0,5,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,360,369,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900037,0

A recent private-public partnership in Tanzania resulted in introduction of new higher yielding varieties. The purpose of this paper is to examine smallholder farmers' motivations to invest in the purchase of quality seed of new potato varieties, and if the motivational structure differs by gender. Design/methodology/approach The paper used means-end chain (MEC) theory combined with goal priming, and laddering interviews on randomly sampled participants (n=45) of an experimental auction conducted among smallholder farmers in Tanzania. The auction was designed to goal-prime respondents on benefits of quality seed. The mental constructs obtained were grouped into attributes, consequences and values, and MECAnalyst software used to generate hierarchical value maps. Findings Farmers invest in quality seed of a new variety to increase yields, hence income, and also to pursue personal life goals (values) or meet psychosocial needs. The structure of mental constructs associated with the decision to invest in quality seed of a new variety differ by gender. Research limitations/implications The study focused on only two new varieties, hence not robust to all new potato varieties. Results need to be tested under different socioeconomic contexts. Furthermore, the MEC approach does not allow for control of other variables that likely influence farmer adoption decision-making process. Future studies should be designed to tackle these limitations. Practical implications Investment in quality seed of new variety is driven by monetary goals and psychosocial factors, and some of these factors differ between male and female farmers. Originality/value This is the first study to explore drivers of farmers' decision to use quality seed of a new variety using MEC analysis, and role psychosocial factors play.","[Okello, Julius J.] Int Potato Ctr, Kampala, Uganda; [Lagerkvist, C.

The focus is on the question whether the court settlement can be concluded on issues that are not the subject of a dispute in a particular litigation, but are related, or even not related with it. It points to the attitude of the legal theory of European countries that the content of the court settlement may not be related only to the legal claim for which protection has been initiated, in order to cover all legal relations of the parties and to resolve the disputed situation.

This is also reflected in the increase in the competitiveness of the local and national economy. Transformation of existing economies into digital represents a significant opportunity for the accelerated growth of the local and national economy, whose drivers are small and medium-sized enterprises. The digital economy in the European Union is growing much faster than the rest of the economy, which will lead to the creation of more jobs and the continuation of the digital transformation of the European economy. The Republic of Croatia, to a lesser extent, recognizes the potential that lies in the development of digital technologies and their impact on business activities. The role of the state in this regard is to ensure a high quality legislative and infrastructure environment for the development of digital business, to encourage the development of digital jobs, to strengthen financial instruments intended to finance the digitization of existing business or the development of new technology-based business, and to promote the importance of digital technologies. This would affect the attractiveness of investments in the technology sector, often referred to as the sector of above-average growth potential. The impact of technology on the business is inevitable, and for enterprises it is crucial to accept the emerging market conditions and dynamic business environment or invest in the digitization of business and the integration of new technologies into their business models. Enterprises that fail to adapt adequately to the digital environment will inevitably face a decline in competitiveness, and some of them may face the very survival on the market. The aim of this paper is to examine the use of digital technologies in business and to argue the importance of using them for the growth and development of an enterprise, and to emphasize the importance of digitization for local development and the strengthening of the national economy as a whole.","[Turuk, Mladen] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Turuk, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb, Croatia.",mturuk@efzg.hr,"Turuk, Mladen/K-5409-2019","Turuk, Mladen/0000-0002-1204-3855",,,,,14,0,0,1,30,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,178,186,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900018,0

The purpose of this paper is to select the most suitable and reliable method for the rancidity evaluation in ghee. Design/methodology/approach - Ghee samples were prepared from butter by the direct cream method. They were assessed for early-stage oxidative deterioration by four Kreis tests in an accelerated storage trial at intervals of 48 h. The amount of ghee samples, amount of reagents (chloroform, 30 percent trichloroacetic acid, 1 percent phloroglucinol, and ethanol), incubation temperature and duration were different in the four tests. For each method, the ghee samples were also monitored for changes in flavor at intervals of 48 h by sensory evaluation. Relationships among the Kreis values determined by the four different Kreis tests and flavor scores were established using a correlation analysis. Findings - The correlation coefficient of the Kreis values determined by different Kreis tests was in decreasing order of: Kreis test-2 (-0.904) > Kreis test-4 (-0.792) > Kreis test-3 (-0.648) > Kreis test-1 (-0.469). Thus, among the four different Kreis tests, Kreis Test-2 reported by Pool and Prater (1945) was found to be more sensitive and more consistent, and have the highest coefficient of correlation (-0.904) with flavor score of ghee during storage at 80 +/- 2 degrees C. Practical implications - The finding of this study will be useful for the selection of an appropriate and reliable Kreis test that can be used for detecting rancidity in ghee at an incipient stage. The development of rancidity in the ghee leads to formation of off-flavor and such an oxidized product is not accepted by the consumer; this leads to economic loss to the manufacturer. Detection of traces of rancidity at an early stage provides an opportunity for industry personnel to take suitable control measures and/or make decisions regarding utilization of the product. Originality/value - The use of a reliable Kreis test that detects traces of rancidity in a ghee can be very useful for enabling suitable measures to be taken to prevent further oxidative deterioration or to dispose of the ghee as early as possible.","[Vaghela, Keyur D.; Chaudhary, Bhavesh N.; Mehta, Bhavbhuti Manojbhai; Aparnathi, K.

The project commenced in 2017. Ethics approval was gained and a mixed methods approach was employed. Methods of data collection included electronic survey and in-depth interview. Early survey findings are reported in this paper. A descriptive approach was used to analyse quantitative data. A total of 157 survey responses were received from across Australia (83%) and internationally (16.6%). Preliminary findings indicate that most survey respondents (72%) had been involved in the process of applying universal design to the design of built environments. Although evaluating the application of universal design was rated as extremely important by 85% of respondents, only 36% had such experience. Of these, 74% had used specific tools for this purpose. Non-standardised checklists and access audits were the most frequently used and preferred tools. Overall, stakeholders perceived themselves to have 'some knowledge' on universal design theory and application. This project offers insight into how universal design is understood and applied to the design of built environments. Findings suggest that evaluation is less common than application and that there is a need to strengthen existing methods of evaluation to provide greater detail on universal design processes and outcomes.","[Watchorn, Valerie; Hitch, Danielle; Frawley, Patsie; Aedy, Kathryn] Deakin Univ, Sch Hlth & Social Dev, 1 Gheringhap St, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia; [Grant, Cathryn; Gohil, Apeksha] Architecture & Access, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Tucker, Richard; Ang, Susan] Deakin Univ, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Geelong, Vic, Australia",Deakin University; Deakin University,"Watchorn, V (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Hlth & Social Dev, 1 Gheringhap St, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia.",valerie.watchorn@deakin.edu.au,"Tucker, Richard/ABA-3004-2020; Frawley, Patsie/AAG-3392-2021","Tucker, Richard/0000-0001-9989-251X; Frawley, Patsie/0000-0002-7643-4935; Hitch, Danielle/0000-0003-2798-2246; Gohil, Apeksha Ramdevsinh/0000-0002-2639-8542",,,,,10,4,4,0,10,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,689,695,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-689,0.0,,,7,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371432.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100066,0

This is true both for MRLs devised by national governments and multilaterally through the Codex. Science-based Codex MRLs are internationally harmonized to facilitate trade. Since the 1990s, an increasing number of countries have devised national MRLs and eschewed those of the Codex. These differing national standards are becoming important barriers to trade. The purpose of this paper is to explore the ramifications of these diverging MRLs for food security, investigate the reasons for the rise of national standards, and explore the role of science in regulatory processes. Design/methodology/approach The approach is an examination of the scientific basis for MRLs in the context of food safety outcomes. Findings It finds that there is no improvement in food safety from the move to national MRLs, only a loss of the benefits of trade. As all countries, along with the Codex, claim that their MRLs are based on science, suggesting that there is a need for an examination of the role of science in the making of public policy. Originality/value This study identifies a potential risk to food security for food policy makers. Given future food security challenges and that pesticides are used almost universally in conventional agriculture, trade barriers based on divergent interpretations of science need to be addressed by food policy makers.","[Yeung, May] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Kerr, William A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Lantz, Matthew] Bryant Christie Inc, Seattle, WA USA; [McConnell, Alyse] Bryant Christie Inc, Sacramento, CA USA",University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Kerr, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",may.yeung@usask.ca; william.kerr@usask.ca; blaircoomber@icloud.com; Matthew.Lantz@bryantchristie.com; Alyse.McConnell@bryantchristie.com,"Yeung, May/ABB-9483-2021","Yeung, May/0000-0003-1359-5974",,,,,50,3,3,2,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This prevented the budget deficits could be financed by sovereign debt issued on the stock exchanges, and forced the state to resort to banks (public and private). The new series of public debt banks portfolios evolution is explained by their pursuit of returns and by changes in banking regulation and financial repression, which favoured the banking status quo. The paper analyses the causes of banking regulation, derived from the public borrowing policy and also from the banking lobbying strategy.

However, numerous studies have found inconclusive evidence of the effect of public expenditure on health outcomes. Here, I revisit the debate by examining the effect of public expenditure on the use of health services, which is an important link between expenditure and outcomes. I use data from two recent waves of the National Family Health Survey of India to study the role of public expenditure on the use of healthcare services during pregnancy and childbirth. India has high state-level variations in the use of prenatal care and delivery by skilled personnel as well as levels of public expenditure. I exploit the variation in public expenditure to identify its effect on the use of healthcare services, controlling for other confounding factors. The results show a significant effect of public expenditure at the state level on the use of both prenatal and delivery care at the individual level. Also, there is no evidence of public expenditure crowding out private expenditure. Further, there is strong evidence that public expenditure reaches the desired targets. The results highlight the positive implications of raising public expenditure for healthcare use of pregnancy and childbirth services in the Indian context.","[Das, Dhiman] Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Res Inst, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Das, D (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Res Inst, Singapore, Singapore.",Dhiman.Das@outlook.com,,"Das, Dhiman/0000-0002-7153-4726",,,,,89,2,2,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

As developing countries are not well prepared to properly manage e-waste, this illegal trade has important negative externalities and creates 'environmental injustice'. The two main information problems on the e-waste market are imperfect monitoring and imperfect information on the so-called 'degree of purity' of the e-waste. In this paper, we use a simple bilateral North-South trade model and show that there exists an alternative e-waste market that is better than the standard e-waste market for developing countries. This alternative e-waste market is a joint trade in reusable and non-reusable e-waste. In both cases, we consider demand and supply sides, plus the equilibrium of the e-waste market to show that the alternative market that we propose is better for developing countries.","[Dato, Prudence] Savoie Mt Blanc Univ, IREGE, 4 Chemin Bellevue,BP 80439, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,"Dato, P (通讯作者)，Savoie Mt Blanc Univ, IREGE, 4 Chemin Bellevue,BP 80439, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France.",prudence.dato@univ-savoie.fr,,,,,,,22,5,5,3,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This study proposes the application of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for measuring the efficiencies of the ecological systems in various regions of that country. The proposed approach differs from most of the previous ecological systems models in that we view it in a two stage setting; the first stage models the ecological system itself, and from an economic perspective, while the second stage (decontamination system) models water recycling as a feedback process, and the treatment of other undesirable outputs coming from the first stage. There, we separate polluting gases and water into two parts; one part is treated, while the other is discharged. The model considers two major desirable outputs from the first stage, namely Population and Gross Region Product by expenditure (GRP), as well as undesirable variables in the form of consumed water, and certain pollutants, namely nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and soot. At the same time, these undesirable outputs from the first stage are inputs to the second decontamination stage. As well, recycled water is fed back into stage 1. Thus, intermediate variables such as consumed water and waste gas emission simultaneously play dual roles of both outputs and inputs in the ecological system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using estimation methods, including a fixed-effect model and the instrumental variable approach, we find that the informal economy and shortages reinforced each other. Results indicate that the Soviet central planning system was difficult to sustain. Substantial heterogeneities across the Soviet republics exist not only in the extent of the informal economy and shortages, but also in the associations between the two variables.","[Kim, Byung-Yeon] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Shida, Yoshisada] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Seoul National University (SNU); Hitotsubashi University,"Kim, BY (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",,,"Shida, Yoshisada/0000-0002-0433-015X",,,,,55,5,5,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We argue that location-allocation analysis can be used not only to determine the optimal spatial allocation of public services, but also as a tool to increase transparency in the allocation decisions. We illustrate by analyzing Citizen Service Centers in Brazil and Sweden. We first show how the optimal spatial allocation of such centers can be obtained with data that is largely publicly available, which allows for transparency. Based on the suggested optimum, we then introduce different public services misallocation metrics, beyond what the literature has previously discussed. We show how such misallocation metrics can be related to socioeconomic outcomes and political- and other variables, thus suggesting a method that can become a useful tool in analyses of public sector performance.

It was established in 1756 and has played an unquestionably important role in the Port wine market since then. Port wine exports to Brazil were significantly lower than exports to England over time. Generally, the oscillation of Port wine exports to Brazil has been explained by particular episodes in the Douro Wine Company's business. Employing structural break analysis and vector of error correction models to analyse data between 1756 and 1826, we concluded that Port wine exports to Brazil were robustly explained by the monetary dimensions of the world economy of the time.","[Mourao, Paulo Reis] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, NIPE, P-4700 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Mourao, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Econ, NIPE, P-4700 Braga, Portugal.",paulom@eeg.uminho.pt,"Mourao, Paulo/D-9619-2011","Mourao, Paulo/0000-0001-6046-645X","COMPETE [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006683]; FCT/MEC's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.); ERDF through the Operational Programme on Competitiveness and Internationalization - COMPETE","COMPETE; FCT/MEC's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.); ERDF through the Operational Programme on Competitiveness and Internationalization - COMPETE","This work was carried out within the funding with COMPETE reference no POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006683, with the FCT/MEC's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.) financial support through national funding and by the ERDF through the Operational Programme on Competitiveness and Internationalization - COMPETE 2020 under the PT2020 Partnership Agreement.

A recent policy proposal attempts to change this by allowing landowners to generate credits for voluntary prelisting conservation activities. We explore the proposed policy from the perspective of potential participants. We find that uncertainty present in species listing processes complicates the decision to undertake conservation activities, leading to less conservation being supplied than when a listing decision is certain, while also delaying implementation until late in the listing determination process. Incentives created by the prelisting policy may likewise push species status closer to a listing threshold and thus exacerbate uncertainty in the listing process. To counter this tendency and encourage a more efficient allocation of conservation activity, early-actor bonuses, weighted credits, or limited windows of eligibility could be used to target or place increased premiums on early conservation activity. Though these findings are most directly applicable to the specific prelisting policy considered here, they are nonetheless relevant to a wider array of conservation policies that seek to encourage voluntary early action in advance of a regulatory alternative.

While there is a growing body of literature exploring factors of citizen support, most studies tend to use climate policy support as an aggregate variable, overlooking differences in support for different climate policy types. This study examines citizen support for several market-based, regulatory, and voluntary climate policies using survey data collected from a representative sample of Canadian citizens (n = 1306). Specifically, the research objectives are to (1) assess citizen support for different types of climate policies, (2) identify the key factors associated with citizen support for different,policy types, and (3) explore heterogeneity across respondents based on policy support patterns. Results indicate that most regulatory and voluntary policies receive high levels of support (83-90% of respondents), while a carbon tax receives the highest levels of opposition (47%). Regression analysis identifies several factors associated with citizen support, including values, trust, and household features. However, only a few factors are consistently associated with support across policy types, including being concerned about climate change, having trust in scientists, and being female. Other significant factors are unique to different policy types. Cluster analysis identifies four distinct respondent clusters based on policy support. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This policy aims to geo-reference all properties and promote monitoring of, and compliance with, natural vegetation conservation requirements. Scholarly efforts and policy attention have so far concentrated on possible environmental impacts hereof, while the attention devoted to how the CAR might affect farmers' livelihoods has been limited. In this paper, we evaluate potential livelihood impacts of the CAR and programs that facilitate CAR registration. We do so by developing a conceptual framework and using evidence from semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders including farmers, governments, and funding agencies. We find that while the CAR and programs facilitating CAR do not have explicit livelihood impact goals, they nonetheless affect livelihoods, both positively and negatively, depending on the initial amount of natural vegetation on farmers' properties, farmers' access to credit and infrastructure, and changing market conditions. We argue that environmental interventions and policies need to consider potential livelihood impacts, especially if the policy intervention area has high poverty rates. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The empirical analysis employs a large representative sample of organizations in the German trade, commerce and services sector. Results from econometric analyses provide evidence for a negative effect of principal agent relationships (landlord-tenant; owner-user of energy supply equipment; parent-subsidiary) and for a positive effect of organizational attributes that contribute to absorptive capacity (energy manager in place; energy audit conducted; experience with decentralized low carbon energy). However, the significance of these effects varies by measure. For non-adopters, heterogeneity of crosscutting ancillary EEMs has little impact on the ranking of barriers to adoption. The most relevant barriers for all EEMs are rented spaces, high investment costs, and other priorities; least relevant are technical risk to production and risk to product quality. Finally, we find little evidence for differences in the factors of adoption and barriers to adoption between manufacturing and non-manufacturing organizations. These findings are robust to alternative model specifications.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Why was a competing institution created beside the extant dominant institutions in a singular international issue area? This puzzling question on the genesis of institutional fragmentation has been theoretically explored through international relation theories. However, a full-fledged answer has not come yet. This paper explains the genesis of institutional fragmentation on the theoretical grounds of constructivism's normative contestation for strategic social construction. Results show that the APP was created by a norm entrepreneur as an organizational platform to embody normative contestation and diffuse the competing normative interpretations of climate change norms.","[Oh, Chaewoon] Waseda Univ, Waseda Resilience Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Oh, Chaewoon] Green Technol Ctr, Seoul, South Korea; [Matsuoka, Shunji] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University; Green Technology Center - Korea (GTCK); Waseda University,"Oh, C (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Waseda Resilience Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan.;Oh, C (通讯作者)，Green Technol Ctr, Seoul, South Korea.",chaewoon.oh@gmail.com,"Oh, Chaewoon/JRB-3208-2023",,"Ministry of Environment of Japan; Design of International Low Carbon Institution in Asia under the Governance Design Research Project of the Asia Low Carbon Society Research Project [S-6-3(4), S-6-3, S-6]","Ministry of Environment of Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Design of International Low Carbon Institution in Asia under the Governance Design Research Project of the Asia Low Carbon Society Research Project","The authors greatly appreciate the Ministry of Environment of Japan for research support.

There are two aspects for this work: determination of which gas stations should be provided with generators (among those that do not have electric power) and determination of a delivery scheme that accounts for increased demand due to lack of public transportation and considerations such as equity. We develop a mixed integer program for this situation. Two case studies based on Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey are developed and solved in CPLEX. As expected, increasing equity increases cost and also tends to place generators to stations with large initial inventories. It is further observed that CPLEX can solve the largest instances of the problem for a 5% tolerance gap, indicating that the model is efficient. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is essential for decision makers to identify improvement opportunities of participatory schemes. We propose an original procedure to address such issue, through a bargaining model from the signaling game literature, which accounts for participation design as well as for agents' preferences, beliefs and bargaining power. The model is calibrated using qualitative data from surveys in French local communities involved in municipal solid waste management. Model simulations are used to test for assumptions on the stakeholder dialogue and explore sensitivity of game outcomes to structural parameters. We propose a set of performance indicators to identify the most effective participatory schemes in achieving convergence in stakeholder positions regarding environmental and land-use planning.

While research has started to track this aid, it has not yet examined its allocation across all donor and recipient countries. We thus do not know to what extent vulnerable countries indeed receive more support for adaptation. We address this research gap and ask: how does this commitment to prioritizing particularly vulnerable countries translate into actual adaptation aid allocation? To what extent do vulnerable countries receive more adaptation aid? We address these questions though a quantitative analysis of data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on bilateral adaptation aid from 2011 through 2014. In contrast to other studies, we find that vulnerability-or more precisely, vulnerability indicators-matter for adaptation aid allocation. Countries that are more exposed to climate change risks, such as extreme weather events or sea level rise, receive more adaptation aid, both on a per capita basis and as a percentage of all adaptation aid. These results indicate that collectively (even if not at the level of each individual donor) donors align their bilateral adaptation aid allocation with global promises.","[Betzold, Carola] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Weiler, Florian] Univ Kent, Rutherford N4-E7, Canterbury CT2 7NX, Kent, England",University of Antwerp; University of Kent,"Betzold, C (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management IOB, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",carola.betzold@uantwerpen.be; f.weiler@kent.ac.uk,"Weiler, Florian/AAS-2330-2020; Weiler, Florian/GVU-1958-2022","Weiler, Florian/0000-0003-3287-395X; Klock, Carola/0000-0003-2987-7570",Gothenburg Centre for Globalization and Development,Gothenburg Centre for Globalization and Development,"We are grateful for helpful comments and suggestions on earlier versions of this paper from participants at the Lund Climate Finance Workshop, Jakob Skovgaard, Jonathan Pickering, and three anonymous reviewers.

We propose a more general and flexible specification of the SF model, introducing dependences between the two error components and asymmetry (positive or negative) of the random error. This re-specification allows us to decompose the third moment of the composite error into three components, namely: (i) the asymmetry of the inefficiency term; (ii) the asymmetry of the random error; and (iii) the structure of dependence between the error components. This decomposition suggests that the wrong skewness anomaly is an ill-posed problem, because we cannot establish ex ante the expected sign of the asymmetry of the composite error. We report a relevant special case that allows us to estimate the three components of the asymmetry of the composite error and, consequently, to interpret the estimated sign. We present two empirical applications. In the first dataset, where the classic SF has the wrong skewness, an estimation of our model rejects the dependence hypothesis, but accepts the asymmetry of the random error, thus justifying the sign of the skewness of the composite error. More importantly, we estimate a non-zero inefficiency, thus solving the wrong skewness problem. In the second dataset, where the classic SF does not yield any anomaly, an estimation of our model provides evidence for the presence of dependence. In such situations, we show that there is a remarkable difference in the efficiency distribution between the classic SF and our class of models.","[Bonanno, Graziella] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, Rome, Italy; [De Giovanni, Domenico; Domma, Filippo] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Calabria,"Domma, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",filippo.domma@unical.it,"Bonanno, Graziella/ABC-1414-2021","Bonanno, Graziella/0000-0003-4322-332X; Domma, Filippo/0000-0002-1489-1065; De Giovanni, Domenico/0000-0002-5851-6064",,,,,43,29,28,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The present study develops a new model based on Mathematical Programming-based Multi-Agent System (MPMAS), a simulation software that allows assessing ex-ante the impact of alternative pesticide use reduction strategies, including combinations of pesticide taxes, the introduction of integrated pest management, a price premium for safe agricultural produce, and subsidies for biopesticides. The model is parameterized with farm and plot level data from northern of Thailand, where the adoption of high-value cash crops has been accompanied by a rapid increase in synthetic pesticide use. Simulation results suggest that a pesticide tax alone has little effect on synthetic pesticide use. A smart policy package combining integrated pest management, a progressive pesticide tax based on toxicity and subsidies lowering the price of biopesticides can reduce average use of hazardous pesticides by 34% over current levels without adverse effects on the average farm income.

This paper evaluates and compares the efficiency performance of the main actors. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 41 food trucks in the Northwest of Italy was identified. A survey was carried out to determine the characteristics of the food truck and evaluate the efficiency performance of an output-oriented data envelopment analysis. Findings - The two kinds of food trucks provide different levels of efficacy: the data showed that 22 per cent of the food trucks operate efficiently with an average efficiency score of 0.80. The results demonstrate that GFT are more efficient than TFT and confirm that innovation is an important key to competitive advantage in this sector. Research limitations/implications - The data collected were related only to the food truckers that operate in the Turin area and the number of variables analysed is limited to certain aspects of production and selling processes. Practical implications - The results provided some managerial indicators to improve the level of corporate efficiency, operating on technical decisions. Originality/value - This is a pioneer study that analyses how a business based on the combination of tradition and innovation can offer a competitive advantage and strengthen a strong connection to its territory, improving corporate performance.","[Alfiero, Simona; Bonadonna, Alessandro] Univ Turin, Dept Management, Turin, Italy; [Lo Giudice, Agata] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Qual & Operat Management, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Bonadonna, Alessandro] Univ Turin, Res Ctr Nat Risks Mt & Hilly Environm NatRisk, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; University of Johannesburg; University of Turin,"Alfiero, S (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Management, Turin, Italy.",salfiero@unito.it,"Alfiero, Simona/AAB-1619-2021; lo giudice, agata/HGT-9855-2022; Bonadonna, Alessandro/AAB-2653-2019","Alfiero, Simona/0000-0002-9246-6056; lo giudice, agata/0000-0001-7557-1885;",,,,,99,39,43,1,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Following the new wave of public administration - from the 1980s countries have increasingly developed the use of agencies with the aim of improving efficiency in public services by using private sector management models. Although due to historical turbulences these processes came about with a substantial delay, Croatia is no exemption in this regard. In Croatia, agencies exist in almost all areas of public interest, performing various public functions and employing a large number of public servants. The main objective of this study is to analyse the financial operations of agencies and their fiscal impact on the state budget, as well as the degree of transparency and accountability in the provision of public services from 1990 to 2016. The majority of state agencies in Croatia were established under the influence of the accession process to the EU, without a comprehensive strategy or a detailed action plan. Consequently, the status of agencies in the government financing system is not clear and the criteria for their establishment as well as results of their operations are often unknown. Many agencies do not publish annual and financial reports, and those that do often omit the most important information. According to an analysis of financial statements, statutes and annual reports it is evident that their status in the public sector significantly differs. Their financial reporting systems are also not consistent: from 44 agencies (in 2013), seven were non-profit organizations, 34 budgetary users, two agencies had company status and one was an extra-budgetary user. The analysis has revealed that agencies in Croatia as a whole generate surpluses, that they have a significant amount of assets (mainly financial) and a low level of financial liabilities - indicating a good financial position. However, the level of transparency of their operations is inappropriate.","[Bajo, Anto] Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb, Croatia; [Bajo, Anto; Martinac, Leon Kanizaj] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia; [Primorac, Marko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, CESifo Res Network, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Public Finance; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Bajo, A (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb, Croatia.;Bajo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",bajo@ijf.hr; mprimorac@efzg.hr,"Bajo, Anto/D-8423-2016","Bajo, Anto/0000-0001-8086-1473",,,,,8,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,979,989,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500095,0

Purpose of the study to discover this potential and understand consumers' approach to the use of these resources. Secondary data collection is an important part for study of condition in terms of usage of thermal waters. For better understanding of consumer perception on thermal bathes, a questionnaire is collected. By this survey, we tried to understand reasons behind few visits to thermal bathes and how the industry may be developed. Research showed that infrastructure (e.g. roads) and facilities (e.g. sport and leisure) offered by touristic centers using thermal waters need improvement for responding to consumers' needs. Strategies pursued by these businesses have to be revisited. Our research focused on thermal springs and its usage in Albania which creates geographical limitations for the work. However we tried to add global perspective by studying global experiences in the field. Generally, literature on thermal resources is lacking in Albania. Even globally, this is not an attractive topic for academicians. Especially, marketing perspective needs attention. Consumer as an important factor in this process is mainly ignored. This study is pioneering consumer research in thermal spring hotel market.","[Gambarov, Vusal] Epoka Univ, Business Adm, Tirana, Albania; [Gjinika, Hecarta] Lauder Business Sch, Business Adm, Vienna, Austria",,"Gambarov, V (通讯作者)，Epoka Univ, Business Adm, Tirana, Albania.",vgambarov@epoka.edu.al,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-47732-9; 978-3-319-47731-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,455,465,,10.1007/978-3-319-47732-9_30,0.0,,,11,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI3AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410645700029,0

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of product attributes regarding nutrition and health benefits of products, the environmental impact of production and social responsibility of producers on consumers' food and wine choices. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical analysis is based on an online survey conducted in the USA, the UK and Germany, and incorporates a discrete choice experiment with visual shelf simulations. Findings - Price and nutrition information are much more influential on consumers' food choices than information about social responsibility of producers or the ecological impact of production. Product attributes emphasizing the ecological impact of production and social responsibility of food producers are specifically valued by consumers with high levels of environmental consciousness and by those concerned about goods production. Consumers who are health conscious regarding their lifestyle and diets derive high utility values from the nutritional information of the product. Practical implications - The study contributes to an understanding of how to promote healthier food and wine choices and social and environmental responsibility of food and wine producers in various markets. Originality/value - The study offers a comparison of product attributes concerning ecological, social, nutrition and health benefits of the product; as well the investigation of congruent interrelationships between the consumers' values and related product attributes in three culturally distinct consumer groups.","[Ghvanidze, Sophie] Hsch Geisenheim Univ, Ctr Econ, Geisenheim, Germany; [Velikova, Natalia; Dodd, Tim] Texas Tech Univ, Texas Wine Mkt Res Inst, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Oldewage-Theron, Wilna] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Nutr Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Ghvanidze, S (通讯作者)，Hsch Geisenheim Univ, Ctr Econ, Geisenheim, Germany.",sopiko.ghvanidze@hs-gm.de,,"Ghvanidze, Sophie/0000-0002-3306-273X",,,,,61,52,54,7,86,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Previous research on payments programs suggests that institutions that appeal to both economic and non-material incentives should be encouraged. This program attempts such a strategy, offering in kind compensation for conservation while simultaneously attempting to engage with environmental values and traditional social norms. I take advantage of a comprehensive household survey conducted prior to the offer of the program and employ means-comparison tests and multi-level regression analysis to compare those who chose to participate with those who did not. My research examines whether motivations for participating in this program reflected purely financial calculations regarding the costs and benefits of the program, or whether non-financial motivations such as environmental or social beliefs and norms played a role as well. I find evidence that the program's effort to engage with social motivations was successful and that social factors, not financial incentives alone, affect participation in the program. Findings also suggest that environmental values did not play a very large role, and that the financial determinants of participation are related mainly to prohibitive costs or barriers to entry, rather than the size of anticipated benefits.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the causal relationship that may exist between public food safety regulations (specifically, the maximum authorised levels of chemical or microbiological contaminants), and the expected price in the spot markets (wholesale markets, for example). Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose a theoretical industrial economic model that identifies the causal link which may exist between public food safety regulations (e.g. the maximum authorised levels of chemical or microbiological contaminants), the expected price in domestic markets, and the rate of exclusion of local producers. This general model allows one to characterize the price formation process in markets subject to maximum residue level constraints by focusing on the role of the official inspection systems established by public authorities. Findings - The authors show how strengthening official controls does not systematically impact negatively on producers' participation and does not always decrease supply. Moreover, the authors show that reinforcing the maximum permitted contamination thresholds is not always sufficient for ensuring consumer health. Originality/value - The originality of the model is that it shows how all variables (economic and sanitary variables) interact in the formation of agricultural prices and determine the final size of the productive system (number of active producers). The characterisation of the market price as a function of producers' investment efforts and of the level of official control reliability allows one to determine both the total supply and the proportion of this supply that is contaminated (i.e. does not comply with the maximum threshold of contamination).","[Mohand, Nacim Nait; Radjef, Mohammed Said] Univ Bejaia, Fac Exact Sci, Res Unit, LaMOS, Bejaia, Algeria; [Hammoudi, Abdelhakim; Hamza, Oualid; Perito, Maria Angela] INRA, ALISS, Paris, France; [Perito, Maria Angela] Univ Teramo, Teramo, Italy",Universite de Bejaia; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; University of Teramo,"Hammoudi, A (通讯作者)，INRA, ALISS, Paris, France.",abdelhakim.hammoudi@inra.fr,"Radjef, Mohammed Said/IQX-1785-2023; RADJEF, Mohammed Said/N-5386-2016","NAIT MOHAND, Nacim/0000-0003-2090-6363; PERITO, Maria Angela/0000-0002-3115-1288; Hammoudi, Abdelhakim/0000-0001-6887-1003","ARIMNet2; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration [618127]","ARIMNet2; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration(European Union (EU))","This study has been conducted in the context of the SAFEMED project Food Safety regulations, market access and international competition.

EWL is a six-week community-based dietary intervention which aims to increase nutritional knowledge, cooking confidence and provide the necessary skills to support behavioural change in relation to eating a balanced diet. There have been many evaluations of community-based dietary interventions, but most focus on brief measures and changes examined at the end of each course. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed method evaluation was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire, focus groups and semi-structured telephone interviews. A follow-up evaluation was conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months with a purposive sample of EWL participants. Findings - A total of 66 participants completed both pre-and post-intervention questionnaires. A total of 22 participants took part in the qualitative follow-up evaluation. The mixed method evaluation demonstrates improvements in participants' fruit and vegetable consumption and a reduction in participants' sugar consumption. Qualitative data highlight key themes such as cooking from basic ingredients, knowledge of key healthy eating messages, changes in eating, cooking and shopping habits and wider influences on family and friends' diets.

Furthermore, ISO 22000: 2005 requires a logical approach to be carried out for the selection and categorization of the control measures according to the level of effect on identified food safety hazards. The purpose of this paper is to describe the COntrol MEasures CATegorization (COMECAT) method for the categorization of control measures in food safety management systems (FSMS) in order to assist organizations to prioritize and deploy their efforts and limited resources mainly to control significant hazards. Design/methodology/approach - A thorough clarification of the characteristics of the different control measures used in FSMS has been achieved based on the definitions and the descriptions given by the different food safety standards such as the ISO 22000, the IFS and the BRC standards. The basic approaches for the determination of control measures found in literature and web pages have been examined and the proposed methodology has been implemented in feta cheese production in order to evaluate its applicability. Findings - A decision tree model has been proposed as the most suitable approach for the categorization of control measures in FSMS. The implementation of the proposed COMECAT method in feta cheese production revealed its applicability. The method was able to identify the different risk level of food hazards and prioritize and deploy the organization's efforts and limited resources for their management accordingly. Originality/value - In the literature, there is a lack of justified methodologies for the categorization of control measures in FSMS. Most of the approaches concern attempts of private companies operating in the food industry or business consultancies and which can be found in their web pages. This paper describes a well-justified model for the categorization of control measures which is easy to implement and which results in more robust decisions.","[Politis, Yannis; Krokos, Fragoulis D.; Papadakis, Ioannis] Hellen Open Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Patras, Greece",Hellenic Open University,"Politis, Y (通讯作者)，Hellen Open Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Patras, Greece.",politisyan@gmail.com,,"Krokos, Fragoulis D./0000-0002-2958-5810",,,,,17,1,1,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

As fertile agricultural land surfaces are being reduced, the need for nourishment is increasing, as is the pressure to make use of as much land surfaces with a smaller level of fertility as possible, with an intensive treatment which at the same time endangers sustainability. An important indicator of sustainability and unsustainability is ecological footprint It shows what amount of land area is needed for the production of food, energy and other resources crucial to sustain the current, highly consumptive lifestyle. This is a quantitative measure that shows how countries, regions, cities and eve individuals create pressure thus consuming the planet and how that pressure exceeds the limits of sustainability. The aim is to determine identify possibilities of organic farming as a sustainable system. The methods that are used in the paper are: calculating the various categories of consumption of natural resources with an emphasis on non-renewable energy sources by using the calculator of the ecological footprint. A sustainable food production includes an integrated system of plant and animal ecological farming technology that will meet the long term requirement for food, improve the quality of the environment and natural resources on which the agricultural economy depends. It will also maintain the economic value of production without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Agricultural production is sustainable if it's profitable, useful for individuals, the community and if it contributes to the preservation of the environment. This implies economic, social and environmental sustainability.","[Ranogajec, Ljubica; Deze, Jadranka] Fac Agr Osijek, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Gilman, Mirna] Filozofski Fak Osijeku, Lorenza Jagera 9, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Ranogajec, L (通讯作者)，Fac Agr Osijek, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",lranogaj@pfos.hr; jdeze@pfos.hr; mgilman@ffos.hr,"Ranogajec, Mirna Gilman/AAC-6073-2020","Ranogajec, Ljubica/0000-0003-2941-1981",,,,,7,0,0,1,12,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,666,674,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500064,0

We conducted a survey among 331 inhabitants of two flood-prone areas and collected data on several topics, including individual flood mitigation, risk perception, risk experience, and sociodemographic characteristics. We estimate discrete choice models to explain either the precautionary measures taken by the household, or the intention to undertake such measures in the future. Our results confirm that the Protection Motivation Theory is a relevant framework to describe the mechanisms of private flood mitigation in France, highlighting in particular the importance of threat appraisal and previous experience of floods. Some sociodemographic features also play a significant role in explaining private flood mitigation. We also observed that respondents who had already taken precautionary measures have a lower perception of the risk of flooding than respondents who planned to implement such measures at the time of the survey. This result can be explained by the existence of a feedback effect of having taken precautionary measures on risk perception. If subsequent studies support this assumption, it would imply that intended measures, rather than implemented ones, should be examined to explore further the determinants of private flood mitigation.

A logit model analysis in Spain,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Consumer behaviour; Food safety; Food consumption; Spain; Food industry,PERCEPTION; ATTITUDES; MARKET,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore food safety attitudes among a sample of Spanish consumers and determine which variables, among those studied, most affect the probability of the consumer being attentive to food safety. Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted using a logit model. From the questionnaire 20 binary category variables were identified. Having selected the variable Are you worried about safety food as a dependent variable, the authors used binary logistic regression (Aldrich and Nelson, 1984; Borooah, 2002) to ascertain in what way the remaining 19 variables affect the likelihood of the consumer being particularly attentive to the healthiness and safety of food purchased. Findings - The probability of the consumer being particularly attentive to food healthiness and safety, for the sample in question, is higher in consumers who stated that they were familiar with organic products, those who are attentive to fat contents in foods and those who value the presence of quality certification positively. Research limitations/implications - Future research into Spanish consumers with the same methodology should target a larger sample in several Spanish cities. Originality/value - This paper investigates not only Spanish consumer attitudes to food safety, but also how other variables can influence the probability of the consumer being concerned about food safety. This approach may be very useful for food companies to determine what strategies to adopt to attract the category of consumers who lend special importance to the food safety variable in their purchases.","[Scarpato, Debora; Rotondo, Giacomo] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Naples, Italy; [Simeone, Mariarosaria] Univ Sannio, Dipartimento Diritto Econ Management & Metodi Qua, Benevento, Italy; [Gomez, Andres; Gutierrez, Pilar] Univ Valladolid, INEA, Sch Agr Engn, Valladolid, Spain",Parthenope University Naples; University of Sannio; Universidad de Valladolid,"Scarpato, D (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Naples, Italy.",debora.scarpato@uniparthenope.it,,,,,,,39,20,20,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Despite the fact that honey bees play an essential role in agriculture, there has been a decreasing trend in bee population connected with Colony Collapse Disorder which can affect food security in the European Union. Since 2007, the EU has been supporting this sector through national apiculture programmes, including technical assistance, control of varroosis, rationalisation of transhumance, laboratory analyses, restocking beehives and applied research programmes. Each member state can apply for this support, however the budget is allocated according to the number of beehives in each country. Slovak Republic is actively engaged and in 2017 the European Union is planning to allocate around 589 000 euros into the Slovak beekeeping sector. The objective of this paper was to examine the influence of national apiculture programmes on Slovak beekeeping sector. In order to obtain primary data, the questionnaire survey was conducted in 2016 on the sample of 223 Slovak beekeepers. Based on the results, the majority of beekeepers have used this support.

Design/methodology/approach - Data used in this study were primary data which were collected through personal interviews and closed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The sample consisted of 170 individual dairy farmer and several dairy cooperatives, which were located in Central Java Province (Boyolali and Semarang Districts) and West Java Province (West Bandung District). The study used partial least squares with the aid of the SmartPLS software program to analyze the hypothesis. Findings - The results of hypothesis testing indicate that collaborative communication and price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on trust for Central Java and West Java Province. Meanwhile, power dependence had a significant negative effect on trust only for West Java Province. Trust had a significant positive effect on supplier loyalty for both of the two provinces. Significant positive effect of supplier loyalty on business performance was supported in Central Java Province, whereas in West Java Province, supplier loyalty had a positive but not significant effect on business performance. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is related to the number of samples, the type of scale used to measure a business performance, and the focus that is only on the relationship between the fargmers and cooperative to improve the performance of cooperative without considering the role of management. So, the future research may replicate this study in another region or in the other contexts of agribusiness sector that usually depends on farmer as a producer of the raw material. It may also enhance the measurement of business performance of dairy cooperative by using a direct measure of financial performance and non-financial performance and broaden the scope of research into the role of management of dairy cooperative. Practical implications - It is recommended that managers of dairy cooperatives always involve the farmers when making marketing decisions especially concerning prices, products, market, and promotion. As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product. Social implications - The research confirms that individual dairy farmer's loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative. It may encourage more dairy cooperative to tap the good relationship with the individual dairy farmer at the initial stage of the economic growth of their business. Intensifying competition between dairy cooperatives would potentially bring even better quality and quantity of milk from the loyal dairy farmer. Originality/value - Although this research used the conceptual model from the previous study, this research will make some improvement. First, it used more indicators to measure each dimension of the construct, and the investigation was slightly more complex and broader since the object of the research was represented by two regions, namely, Central Java Province and West Java Province.","[Susanty, Aries; Bakhtiar, Arfan; Muthi, Mustofa] Diponegoro Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Semarang, Indonesia; [Jie, Ferry] Edith Cowan Univ, Commerce Discipline, Sch Business & Law, Joondalup, Australia",Diponegoro University; Edith Cowan University,"Susanty, A (通讯作者)，Diponegoro Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Semarang, Indonesia.",ariessusanty@gmail.com,"susanty, aries/Q-2267-2015","susanty, aries/0000-0003-0601-5206; Jie, Ferry/0000-0002-6287-8471; Bakhtiar, Arfan/0000-0002-8763-377X",,,,,71,21,22,3,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

They predominantly rely on creative and specialized labor and, assuming a strong competition for workers, are therefore increasingly dependent on the location of their (potential) employees. If these creative and highly qualified employees are attracted by consumption amenities such as bars, clubs, and restaurants, then it follows that these same amenities may determine the location of creative service firms. I investigate this hypothesis by examining whether Berlin Internet start-up firms locate in urban amenity-rich places. Identification builds on the fall of the Berlin Wall. A 1 percent increase in amenity density raises the probability of a start-up location by almost 2 percent. A comparison with other service industries suggests that amenities are significant to the location choice of creative sectors, whereas no effect can be observed for nonreative firms.","[Moeller, Kristoffer] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Int Econ, FB 1, Hsch Str 1, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany; [Moeller, Kristoffer] Berlin Univ Technol, Ctr Metropolitan Studies, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt; Technical University of Berlin,"Moeller, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Darmstadt, Int Econ, FB 1, Hsch Str 1, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany.;Moeller, K (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol, Ctr Metropolitan Studies, Berlin, Germany.",mail@kristoffer-moeller.de,,,,,,,79,10,16,4,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

We use trade-level data on average wages and employment by gender and age to examine the effects of minimum wages. Although the minimum wages were binding, we find that the effects on employment were modest, at best.

There were early calls for increased funding of independent research, risk analysis and voluntary or mandatory regulation, but currently overall regulatory efforts have not materialised. One possible explanation is that research has revealed little need to regulate environmental and health safety risks of NT. Alternatively, there is a gap between politics and governance and the evolving state of knowledge. Such a gap can be caused by various factors including change in interests, saliency and organisation. Organisational challenges related to the science-policy interface at national, international and the EU can affect how new knowledge is channelled into decision-making processes. Decrease in public saliency is another possibility. Finally, opposition to regulation among affected producers may have increased and in turn stalled regulation through lobbying. The two explanations are analysed in a multi-level governance context. Norway is chosen as an interesting case: Highly profiled as a frontrunner i.a. in regulating gene technology, but currently awaiting regulations in the EU due to the European Economic Area agreement.","[Andresen, Steinar; Rosendal, G.

Two kinds of problems can be identified with the use of the criterion. First, as income tends to affect monetary welfare changes positively, the preferences of those with higher wealth have a larger weight in societal decision-making. Second, monetary welfare changes can be thought of as changes in real income, which matter more for those with a lower initial wealth level. Both problems can be mitigated with distributional weighting. Despite their strong theoretical pedigree, distributional weights have been largely neglected in practical CBAs, one exception being analyses in climate change economics. We present the theory of distributional weighting and illustrate how weights can be applied empirically in an international environmental CBA that deals with marine water quality improvements. We show that different weighting schemes can result in different policy recommendations. We also show that taking the income distribution within countries into account can change a country's willingness to participate in the water quality improvement program and that the income elasticity of willingness to pay (WTP) is an important indication of the direction of change.","[Nurmi, Vaino] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Socioecon Impacts Res, Erik Palmenin Aukio 1,POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Nurmi, Vaino] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland; [Ahtiainen, Heini] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Bioecon & Environm, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland",Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Helsinki; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Nurmi, V (通讯作者)，Finnish Meteorol Inst, Socioecon Impacts Res, Erik Palmenin Aukio 1,POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.",vaino.nurmi@fmi.fi; heini.ahtiainen@luke.fi,,,Nessling Foundation [201600396]; Finnish Meteorological Institute,Nessling Foundation; Finnish Meteorological Institute,"This article is based on the dissertation research of the first author and funded by the Nessling Foundation (201600396).

Coalition formation is gauged through clustering analysis on multiple factors including natural, economic, and social factors, RCPs, and other aspects. Projected emission is found to be the main determinant in forming coalitions, and the USA, EU, China + India, and the rest of the world constitute the four-coalition configuration that is stable across different scenarios. Under this base configuration, the Regional Integrated Climate-Economy model for Coalition Game model is implemented to assess the sensitivity of equilibrium solutions to parameter uncertainties, sanctions on non-mitigation, and adjustments in coalition composition. The main conclusion of the game simulations is that no coalition would adopt a mitigation strategy at the Nash equilibrium if no penalty is in place. The Nash equilibrium remains stable even when the climatic and economic parameters are disturbed. As an alternative to the conventional game, an external sanction is imposed on coalitions that choose not to mitigate climate change; in this scenario, climate change mitigation propagates across coalitions according to various sanction levels. The paper also shows that a social welfare compensation between two coalitions may alter the equilibrium game strategy depending on whether the compensation outweighs the welfare loss from mitigation.","[Wu, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Thill, Jean-Claude] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Thill, JC (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",jfthill@uncc.edu,,"Thill, Jean-Claude/0000-0002-6651-8123",National Key R&D Plan Program of China [2016YFA0602702]; National Social Science Foundation of China [14CGJ025]; National Science Foundation of China [41501127],National Key R&D Plan Program of China; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by the National Key R&D Plan Program of China No. 2016YFA0602702, National Social Science Foundation of China No. 14CGJ025, and National Science Foundation of China No. 41501127.

Models based on aggregate production functions (APF) range from the neoclassical, which downplay energy due to a cost-share theorem, but typically rely on exogenous total factor productivity (TFP), to the ecological economic, which acknowledge energy's importance. The validity of the APF concept itself is questioned. Here, we apply cointegration analysis to identify APFs between output, capital, labor, and possibly energy, measured as primary energy or useful exergy. We test for TFP growth by including a time trend. We require that plausible APFs verify cointegration, non-negative output elasticities, and Granger-causality linking inputs to output. Our method recognizes cases where: a) plausible APFs do not exist (thereby addressing the APF critique); b) energy impacts growth directly; c) energy impacts growth indirectly, through capital and labor. We apply the method to Portugal (1960-2009), considering standard and quality-adjusted capital/labor measures. With a time trend or disregarding energy, plausible APFs are never found. Without a trend, plausible APFs are found only when considering capital-energy-labor combinations. Within these, with quality-adjusted capital and labor and useful exergy, results are consistent with the cost-share theorem but energy plays a central role, through a constraint on all factors of production.","[Santos, Joao; Domingos, Tiago; Sousa, Tania] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Dept Mech Engn, MARETEC Marine Environm & Technol Ctr,Environm &, Ave Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [St Aubyn, Miguel] Univ Lisbon, ISEG, Dept Econ, UECE Res Unit Complex Econ, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Lisboa,"Santos, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Dept Mech Engn, MARETEC Marine Environm & Technol Ctr,Environm &, Ave Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",joao.dos.santos@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; tdomingos@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; taniasousa@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; mstaubyn@iseg.ulisboa.pt,"Sousa, Tânia/D-8180-2013; Domingos, Tiago/D-4558-2012; St. Aubyn, Miguel/B-1362-2008","Sousa, Tânia/0000-0002-3502-3371; Domingos, Tiago/0000-0002-6194-0405; Almeida dos Santos, Joao Alexandre/0000-0001-5123-8244; St. Aubyn, Miguel/0000-0002-9358-7327",FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC) [UID/EEA/50009/2013]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [PD/BD/128054/2016]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PD/BD/128054/2016] Funding Source: FCT,FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The authors wish to thank Matthew K.

Our article advances this rapprochement by embedding the concepts of identity and aspirations. First, we argue that a further set of components should be integrated into the framework: the aspirations set. Second, we argue that a new component within this set i.e. a personal identity conversion factor, must be added to the capability approach so that an integrated analysis framework can be developed. This component derives from the personal identity capability and the aspirations window, both of which are related to cultural ecosystem services. Our analytical framework then highlights all the ambiguity associated with this conversion factor, which can either be a negative or a positive factor in environmental protection.","[Ballet, Jerome; Marchand, Lucile; Vos, Robin] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France; [Pelenc, Jerome] Univ Libre Bruxelles, CED, Ave Franklin Roosevelt, B-501050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Ballet, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",jerome.ballet@u-bordeaux.fr,,,,,,,121,14,17,3,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We used an expert survey to examine agricultural support schemes in the EU, Norway and Switzerland in terms of the shares of the payments that compensate farmers and other recipients for the costs of providing services. Furthermore, we explored to which categories of ecosystem services the funding for agri-environment measures contributed according to the experts. For the agri-environment payments in the EU we found a mean estimate of 'percent payment for services' (PPS) of 72.3%. Expert age, type of organisation and disciplinary background systematically affected the individual estimates. Controlling the individual-level variation, the estimates differed significantly by measure objectives. Particularly high PPS estimates were found for organic fanning and conservation related measures, while integrated production and more generic extensive management options were perceived to perform less well. The mean PPS estimate for the rural development programmes was 59.6% and that for single payments 16.8%. The results suggest that expert estimates of PPS may complement the evaluation of schemes at the national or regional level in cases where complex policy objectives prevent a comprehensive evaluation based on objective measures.","[Baur, Ivo; Schlapfer, Felix] Kalaidos Univ Appl Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Baur, Ivo] Indiana Univ, Ostrom Workshop, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Schläpfer, F (通讯作者)，Kalaidos Univ Appl Sci, Dept Wirtschaft, Jungholzstr 43, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",ibaur@indiana.edu; felix.schlaepfer@kalaidos-fh.ch,"Schlapfer, Felix/B-1939-2008","Schlapfer, Felix/0000-0003-2377-2807",Swiss Federal Office of Agriculture (grant ERA-NET RURAGRI),Swiss Federal Office of Agriculture (grant ERA-NET RURAGRI),"We are grateful to the experts for participating in the survey.

Ecosystem services would be those resulting from forest conservation and regeneration and sustainable and innovative production practices. The results suggest a regressive bias when some variables that capture the income effect positively affect participation in the program and acceptance of the payment offered. There is also evidence of adverse selection when acceptance of the amount offered is more sensitive to the service provision already being suited to the modes of production adopted. The results, on the other hand, indicate that farmers' decisions to join the program depend not only on their opportunity costs, but also on their perceptions about specific issues, such as their environmental knowledge or awareness, inertia to change production modes, fear of additional monitoring, and level of understanding of the program. These results are important to support the program's outreach strategies and the design of mechanisms for the selection of beneficiaries and pricing of payments.","[da Motta, Ronaldo Seroa] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, State Univ Rio de Janeiro, Av Borges de Medeiros 3709 Ap 401, BR-22470001 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Ortiz, Ramon Arigoni] Rio de Janeiro Town Hall,Rua Leite Leal, BR-22240100 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro,"da Motta, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, State Univ Rio de Janeiro, Av Borges de Medeiros 3709 Ap 401, BR-22470001 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",seroadamotta.ronaldo@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,40,47,0,63,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Basin hydrological modeling applied to wetland loss and restoration scenarios in the study area provides local estimates of the ecosystem service (ES) provision related to flood control and nutrient removal. Locally appropriate monetary values are applied to these services to gauge the cost effectiveness of wetland conservation funding at two levels: flood control capacity alone and then incorporating a suite of ES. SROI ratios for flood control alone provide ratios between 3.17 (retention) and 0.80 (full restoration) over 30 years; when other ES are included, the ratios increase, ranging from 7.70 (retention) to 2.98 (full restoration) over 30 years. Retention of existing wetlands provides the highest SROI and therefore we argue that government policy should focus on preventing further loss of wetlands as a strategic investment opportunity. Overall, these results indicate that wetland retention is an economically viable solution to limit the financial, social and environmental damages of flooding in Saskatchewan specifically and the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) generally.","[Pattison-Williams, John K.] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Pomeroy, John W.] Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada; [Badiou, Pascal; Gabor, Shane] Ducks Unlimited Canada, Box 1160, Stonewall, MB R0C 2Z0, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Saskatchewan,"Pattison-Williams, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",johnp@ualberta.ca,"Pomeroy, John W/A-8589-2013; Badiou, Pascal/H-3841-2019; Pomeroy, John W/IZE-0873-2023","Pomeroy, John W/0000-0002-4782-7457; Badiou, Pascal/0000-0001-9753-943X; Pomeroy, John W/0000-0002-4782-7457; Pattison-Williams, John/0000-0002-5799-2587",BHP Billiton; Prairie Habitat Joint Venture (PHJV); Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC); Canada Research Chairs program; Canada Excellence Research Chair in Water Security,BHP Billiton; Prairie Habitat Joint Venture (PHJV); Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC); Canada Research Chairs program(Canada Research Chairs); Canada Excellence Research Chair in Water Security,"BHP Billiton, the Prairie Habitat Joint Venture (PHJV) and Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) supported this work.

This study assesses the economic impact on farmers' profit from maize inoculation, along with the environmental impact in term of greenhouse gas emissions, in the Rhone-Alpes region of France. Yield-to-nitrogen relationships predicted by the STICS crop model were modified to simulate the effect of inoculation on maize yield, and four inoculation costs (0, 20, 40 and 60 euros/ha) were considered to assess the private economic effect of inoculation. The environmental impact was assessed using a Bouwman-type N2O emission function, modified to account for the inoculation effect on soil N2O production according to soil characteristics. Yield and N2O emission functions were then implemented in the AROPAj farm-type, supply side-oriented model. Several scenarios were considered and probability density functions were selected for the yield function parameters according to field trial results. Our results show that, mainly due to a decrease in fertilizer use rather than to an increase in yield, farming systems in the Rhone-Alpes region could benefit from maize inoculation if the inoculation cost is lower than (sic)20/ha. Regardless of inoculation cost, maize inoculation might reduce the amount of synthetic fertilizer used on farmlands. However, the private economic benefits could be lower if maize is cultivated on soils with a high carbon content, where inoculation increases N2O emission. In these types of soils, greenhouse gas emissions at the regional level could increase by 2 to 5%.","[Bounaffaa, Myriam; Jayet, Pierre-Alain] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Florio, Alessandro; Le Roux, Xavier] Univ Lyon, Univ Lyon1, CNRS, Microbial Ecol Ctr LEM,UMR1418,INRA, 43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; INRAE,"Jayet, PA (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Agronom, Rue Bretignere, F-78850 Grignon, France.",pierre-alain.jayet@inra.fr,"florio, alessandro/I-6066-2019","Florio, Alessandro/0000-0001-6814-8675; LE ROUX, Xavier/0000-0001-9695-0825",French National Research Agency (ANR) through the Azodure project [ANR-12-AGRO-0008]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-AGRO-0008] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),French National Research Agency (ANR) through the Azodure project(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This research is supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR) through the Azodure project (grant ANR-12-AGRO-0008).

We propose a dynamical systems model that accounts for the state of the land, population and workers employed in swidden and intensive agriculture and monument building. Optimisation of model output to fit empirical data fixes biometric parameters to values consistent with the literature and requires that a shift from swidden to more intensive agriculture took place at around 550 CE. The latter prediction is consistent with the dating of the beginning of the Late Classical period. Thus, our model offers an explanation of the collapse of the society of the Maya and suggests that the role of droughts may have been overestimated. Consistent with previous work, the collapse can be modelled by a critical transition (supercritical Hopf bifurcation), where the critical parameter is the harvesting rate per capita of intensive agriculture. Furthermore, an extensive sensitivity analysis indicates that the model and its predictions are robust.","[Roman, Sabin; Brede, Markus] Univ Southampton, Inst Complex Syst Simulat, Southampton, Hants, England; [Roman, Sabin; Brede, Markus] Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Agents Interact & Complex Grp, Southampton, Hants, England; [Palmer, Erika] Univ Bergen, Dept Comparat Polit, Challenges Adv Democracles CHAD Res Grp, Bergen, Norway",University of Southampton; University of Southampton; University of Bergen,"Roman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Inst Complex Syst Simulat, Southampton, Hants, England.;Roman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Agents Interact & Complex Grp, Southampton, Hants, England.",sr10g13@soton.ac.uk,,"Roman, Sabin/0000-0002-7513-3479",EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre Grant [EP/G03690X/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1371023] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre Grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by an EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre Grant (EP/G03690X/1).

While there has been a wide interest in organisational aspects of participation in protected areas, discursive questions concerning the attitudes toward participation among stakeholder have received relatively little attention. Using Q methodology we investigated attitudes of 53 respondents, representing key stakeholder groups (local communities, NGOs, scientists, protected area staff, foresters, public officials, general public), toward the involvement of local communities in managing various forms of biodiversity conservation in Poland. We found three main discourses (1) positive toward participation and recognizing the conservation and development goals of protected areas; (2) sceptical toward participation and nature-centred; (3) cautiously open to participation and developmental goals of protected areas but highlighting organisational difficulties. There were diverse attitudes toward participation within stakeholder groups signalling potential for compromise among them. All three discourses opt for a mixed model of governance balancing central and local influence, which diverges from traditional centralized practices. They differ over barriers to participation, highlighting either insufficient capacity of administration or lack of knowledge and interests of local people. These differences indicate wider socio-political tensions that should be acknowledged during participation.","[Niedzialkowski, Krzysztof; Komar, Ewa] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Bialowicza, Poland; [Niedzialkowski, Krzysztof] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy & Sociol, Warsaw, Poland; [Pietrzyk-Kaszynska, Agata; Olszanska, Agnieszka] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, Krakow, Poland; [Grodzinska-Jurczak, Malgorzata] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Mammal Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Philosophy & Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Polish Academy of Sciences; Jagiellonian University,"Niedzialkowski, K (通讯作者)，Nowy Swiat 72, PL-00330 Warsaw, Poland.",kniedzialkowski@ifispan.waw.pl,"Pietrzyk-Kaszyńska, Agata/HKM-8603-2023; Małgorzata, Grodzińska-Jurczak/AAN-9382-2021; Niedzialkowski, Krzysztof/JQJ-5410-2023","Małgorzata, Grodzińska-Jurczak/0000-0003-2084-641X; Pietrzyk-Kaszynska, Agata/0000-0002-8060-2591; Niedzialkowski, Krzysztof/0000-0002-0410-6772; Komar, Ewa/0000-0002-3994-7838; Olszanska, Agnieszka/0000-0001-7059-4164",Polish-Norwegian Research Programme [POL-NOR/196105/2/2013],Polish-Norwegian Research Programme,The research leading to these results has received funding from the Polish-Norwegian Research Programme operated by the National Centre for Research and Development under the Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2009-2014 in the frame of the LINKAGE project [project contract number POL-NOR/196105/2/2013].,,63,26,29,2,55,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

However, discussions surrounding the appropriate designs of spatial management have largely been conceptual. This paper develops a spatial econometric model of fishing location choice using non-confidential data from the Great Barrier Reef coral trout commercial fishery. Harvest location decisions are modeled as a function of spatial patterns of expected economic returns. The preferred spatially dependent econometric model is shown to outperform ordinary least squares and fixed effects models in out-of-sample forecasting. Estimates from the spatial model reveal spatial spillover effects in fleet harvest location behavior. In particular, harvest activity at any given site is equally sensitive to same-site economic returns and surrounding-site economic returns. The econometric results are illustrated using a fee-based policy simulation. Results suggest non spatial management is characterized by two inefficiencies. First, heterogeneity between sites is averaged, resulting a fee that is too high or too low across space. Second, fees that are too high or too low affect the fishing effort in nearby locations.","[Sampson, Gabriel S.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 305D Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Sampson, GS (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 305D Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",gsampson@ksu.edu,,,National Science Foundation Division of Graduate Education [0801430]; Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education [0801430] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation Division of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"Research funding was provided by National Science Foundation Division of Graduate Education #0801430, the Responding to Rapid Environmental Change (REACH) IGERT.

Intercropping shade trees with coffee shrubs can produce multiple ecosystem services. Depending on the shade cover levels, however, the joint production of these services might be complementary or competitive based on their impacts on coffee yields. We develop a computational, bioeconomic model to find the range of shade level for which a coffee farmer is better off under. a shade-grown system compared to a sun-grown system, in the presence of coffee berry borer (CBB) infestations. We model the plant level provision of shade-induced pest control services, crop growth services, and timber, and consider in the baseline case a net price premium for shade-grown coffee. Using parameters from coffee regions in Colombia, our baseline simulation results indicate that, in the presence of a CBB infestation, the expected net present values in the shade-grown system can be higher but only for shade cover levels between 11% and 34%. The optimal shading level is 25% in the baseline scenario. It increases to 27% for greater values of crop growth ecosystem services and decreases to 20% in the absence of a price premium for shade-grown coffee.","[Atallah, Shady S.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Gomez, Miguel I.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Jaramillo, Juliana] Bayer CropSci, D-6100 Monheim, Germany",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Cornell University; Bayer AG; Bayer CropScience,"Atallah, SS (通讯作者)，56 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",shadi.atallah@unh.edu; mig7@cornell.edu; juliana.jaramillo@bayer.com,"Gomez, Miguel I./AAD-3707-2019; Atallah, Shady S./AFR-7527-2022","Atallah, Shady S./0000-0002-9715-6268",Atkinson Center for Sustainable Futures at Cornell University; Institute for the Social Sciences at Cornell University,Atkinson Center for Sustainable Futures at Cornell University; Institute for the Social Sciences at Cornell University,"The authors acknowledge support from the Atkinson Center for Sustainable Futures and the Institute for the Social Sciences at Cornell University.

This implies that there should be a scope effect in contingent valuation studies. However, in previous issues of Ecological Economics, several authors criticized the contingent valuation (CV) method for the absence of such effect or its inadequacy. In this paper, we contribute to this ongoing debate by proposing to systematically apply several WTP statistical distribution assumptions to test for scope effects and check its plausibility, following Whitehead's (2016) recent recommendations. We perform this approach using data from a Swiss case study assessing the WTP for an increased surface of forest reserves. We find that both mean WTP and scope effects are sensitive to the statistical distribution assumption. Regarding plausibility, scope elasticities provide mixed result and also depend on the assumed statistical distribution of WTP. For small sample size CV studies, a non-parametric analysis, a spike model or an open-ended format can thus be better suited to reveal scope effects than the classical parametric dichotomous choice analysis. We thus recommend to systematically apply several statistical distribution assumptions of WTP to test for scope effects and their plausibility.","[Borzykowski, Nicolas; Baranzini, Andrea; Maradan, David] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland HES SO, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve HEG Ge, 17 Rue Tambourine, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland; [Borzykowski, Nicolas] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Econ Res, Rue A-L Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; University of Neuchatel,"Borzykowski, N (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland HES SO, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve HEG Ge, 17 Rue Tambourine, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland.;Borzykowski, N (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Inst Econ Res, Rue A-L Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",nicolas.borzykowski@hesge.ch,"Baranzini, Andrea/R-6506-2019","Baranzini, Andrea/0000-0002-9438-7730; Maradan, David/0000-0003-2072-5343",Swiss National Research Program Resource wood [66],Swiss National Research Program Resource wood,"The authors would like to thank the staff and students of the Laboratory of Market Studies (LEM) at the Haute Ecole de Gestion de Geneve (HEG-Geneve) for their valuable support for the survey, members of the Geneva green spaces service for their comments, Milad Zarin-Nejadan and Bengt Kristrom for their precious suggestions and four anonymous reviewers, whose suggestions considerably helped in improving the paper.

Based on a survey for statistical offices, ministries and independent experts worldwide, we provide some preliminary evidence that there is very little use of natural capital accounts for public policy decisions and, more so, in developing countries. The most relevant obstacles are the lack of political support by key people and institutional leadership unable to promote policy use by other ministries. Concerning developing countries, the factor which is considered as the most relevant in preventing the use of natural capital accounts for policy making is the stage of development of the country. In addition, respondents from statistical institutes and developing countries are firstly, concerned about institutional obstacles and secondly, about data availability and cooperation. Respondents from ministries and independent experts are particularly concerned about design obstacles. Not many accounts may be available to be used in the policy-making process due to data gaps, design challenges and the required investment, the problem being more acute in developing countries. A key result of the survey is the need to evaluate the added value of natural capital accounts with respect to statistics.","[Virto, Laura Recuero] Sci Po Paris, 27 Rue Convent, F-75015 Paris, France; [Virto, Laura Recuero] French Minist Foreign Affairs & Int Dev, 27 Rue Convent, F-75015 Paris, France; [Weber, Jean-Louis] Univ Nottingham, European Environm Agcy Sci Comm, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Jeantil, Mathilde] Ecole Normale Super, 61 Ave President Wilson, F-94230 Cachan, France",University of Nottingham; Universite Paris Saclay,"Virto, LR (通讯作者)，Sci Po Paris, 27 Rue Convent, F-75015 Paris, France.;Virto, LR (通讯作者)，French Minist Foreign Affairs & Int Dev, 27 Rue Convent, F-75015 Paris, France.",laura.recuero-virto@diplomatie.gouv.fr; mathilde.jeantil@ens-cachan.fr,,"Recuero Virto, Laura/0000-0002-6428-0916",,,,,54,26,27,1,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Design/methodology/approach Registered dietitians (RDs) (n=14) were recruited from the UK, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Mexico and Israel. Six qualitative interviews and two focus groups were conducted online using a conference calling platform. Data were recorded, transcribed and thematically analyzed. Findings Early adopters of nutrigenomics (NGx) were experienced, self-efficacious RDs who actively sought knowledge of NGx through communication with one another and the broader scientific community. They considered NGx an extension of current practice and believed RDs had the skills to deliver it. Perceived barriers to widening the application of NGx were linked to skepticism among the wider dietetics community. Proliferation of unregulated websites offering tests and diets was considered pseudoscience and detrimental to dietetics fully embracing NGx. Lack of a sustainable public health model for the delivery of NGx was also perceived to hinder progress. Results are discussed with reference to diffusion of innovation theory. Originality/value The views of RDs who practice NGx have not been previously studied. These data highlight requirements for future dietetic training provision and more inclusive service delivery models. Regulation of NGx services and formal recognition by professional bodies is needed to address the research/practice translation gap. Further research is required to inquire as to the views of the wider dietetics profession.","[Abrahams, Mariette; Bryant, Eleanor; Stewart-Knox, Barbara] Univ Bradford, Dept Psychol, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England; [Frewer, Lynn J.] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Bradford; Newcastle University - UK,"Stewart-Knox, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Dept Psychol, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England.",M.I.Abrahams@bradford.ac.uk; lynn.frewer@newcastle.ac.uk; E.J.Bryant@bradford.ac.uk; B.Stewart-Knox@bradford.ac.uk,"Abrahams PhD MBA, Mariette/GRY-3698-2022; Bryant, Eleanor Jane/C-8493-2013","Bryant, Eleanor Jane/0000-0003-0743-180X",,,,,44,11,11,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Calculating income share for various economic activities and following in the line with Dietrich for NAV and MLI, McMillan and Rodrik for within and static effects, Timmer et al. for within effect, static and dynamic effects, it estimates structural change in income for 14 major states from 1993-94 to 2011-12. There has been an increasing trend in patterns of structural change as evident by NAV and MLI across sectors to contribute to the growth process of per capita real income. Using catch up regression for absolute convergence, it finds the evidence of absolute beta divergence meaning by relatively richer states have grown faster than poorer counterparts. Including structural change in income and employment in industrial sector (high intensity) along with other control variables such as per capita investment, human capital, initial level of per capita real income in cross-sectional regressions, it finds significant contribution of structural change for economic growth across Indian states during this period. However, some of the fundamental variables are although in expected line, they are not significant which calls for re-examination of these issues within suitable framework such as dynamic panel data analysis that will sort out some of the problems encountered in cross-sectional growth regression.","[Adabar, Kshamanidhi; Sahoo, Trupti Mayee] Cent Univ Gujarat, Ctr Studies Econ & Planning, Sect 29, Gandhinagar, India",Central University of Gujarat,"Adabar, K (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Gujarat, Ctr Studies Econ & Planning, Sect 29, Gandhinagar, India.",kshama@cug.ac.in; trupticug@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-99555-7; 978-3-319-99554-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,153,170,,10.1007/978-3-319-99555-7_10,0.0,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BL7MM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455194200011,0

First of all, the question should be dealt with by the countries rich in cultural patrimony, which should carry out a role of cultural avant-garde and prepare new forms of struggle against the illicit traffic of cultural properties. The means, that can be used to reach this aim, can be various and require a change in the perspective compared to the traditional national policies in the field of the cultural property. In many cases it is a matter of solutions easily to be solved, which even if they require an organizational effort, they might not be a burden on the public finance. It is to be considered, for example, the opening of an international market of works of art, where States can give the works of art that are not essential to the national history, starting from the less important archeological finds and/or from the foundation of a compulsory state system of registration of high valued artefacts and their transactions. This market should involve not only the public bodies but also the private ones. In the first case, resources are removed from the black market and the illicit purchase becomes less convenient, since it exposes to the risk of obtaining not authentic materials and being involved into judicial inquiries. The decline in the demand would have a direct effect on the safeguard of archeological sites, while avoiding the non authorized excavation in new areas and the loss of scientific information. The revenues deriving from the archeological resources might be used to finance research projects, safeguard and promotion or to support a state system of cultural heritage registration. The certification of the cultural, public and private, property, should offer to the buyers the possibility of checking the legitimacy of the title before of carrying the transaction out, by rebuilding the good faith not on the base of criteria which are probable to suppose but through documentary certainties. The birth of national or international systems of cultural property registration offers a precious occasion to stabilize and implement the art market, while clarifying the grey zone made up of opacity and silence that often surrounds the trade of works of art.","[Aveta, Raffaele] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Caserta, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Aveta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Caserta, Italy.",raffaele.aveta@unicampania.it,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,369,375,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600042,0

The reason for this lays not only in the fact that neutrality of the conflicting Supervisory Board member is endangered, but also in the other disadvantages to the normal functioning of the Supervisory Board in general. Spectacular lawsuits involving large companies have increasingly focused public attention in Europe on the functioning and functional deficits of the supervisory bodies. Solely due to the stricter duties of care and action discussed in the wake of this, the standards that are applied to a responsible supervisory board activity have increased significantly. The Croatian Companies Act has regulated the post of member of the Supervisory Board as a secondary function and therefore assumes that the member of the Supervisory Board still has one main occupation (as a member of the Management Board of another company, member of a law firm etc.) or holds supervisory board mandate in the other Corporation. However, dual board mandates have considerable potential for conflict because the dual mandate holder is basically committed to the interests of two companies (servant of two masters). This loyalty conflict is particularly acute in the group of Companies. Dual board mandates holder always has to consider the interests of both masters: while acting in the board of the parent company he must consider only their interests and in the board of the daughter-company exclusively their interests. Because of this separation of obligations, he can't rely on the fact that a breach of the obligations of an organ in one area is justified in order to comply with the duties of the other organ. Furthermore, the norm in provision Art. 261 of Croatian Companies Act states that a member of the supervisory board cannot at the same time be a member of the executive board, authorized signatory or authorized representative of the company for the entire business. That norm provides for the possibility that the supervisory board appoints individual members of the executive board for a limited period of time to substitute missing or prevented members of the management board. These provisions are defined as the expression and the effectuation of the dualistic system and of the rule of separation of functions between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The provision deals with the fact that the executive and supervisory bodies are separated as such, but that the functions of both organs are actually carried out by the same persons, and therefore unbiased and effective supervision of the management is no longer guaranteed. This paper will cover those issues and provide for possible legal solutions.","[Brnabic, Ratko; Kuzmanic, Zvonimir] Fac Law Split, Split, Croatia",,"Brnabic, R (通讯作者)，Fac Law Split, Split, Croatia.",rbrnabic@prayst.hr; zvonimir.kuzmanic@gmail.com,"Brnabić, Ratko/H-2819-2017",,,,,,10,0,0,1,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,376,383,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600043,0

The purpose of this paper is to examine the potential beer consumer segments and to profile them regarding their consumption behaviour. Design/methodology/approach Data from a sample of 592 consumers were analysed through hierarchical cluster analysis; and the validity of the cluster solutions was then examined through a MANOVA analysis. Findings A five-cluster solution emerged, revealing different beer consumption patterns and preferences. These segments are identified as beer lovers, circumspect seniors, social drinkers, homelike women and beer to fuddle consumers. Originality/value The findings suggest that beer consumers cannot be seen as a homogenous consumer group; and managers and brewers could manage beer as five different products, instead of considering beer as a single item.","[Calvo-Porral, Cristina; Orosa-Gonzalez, Javier; Blazquez-Lozano, Felix] Univ A Coruna, Dept Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain",Universidade da Coruna,"Calvo-Porral, C (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain.",ccalvo@udc.es; jorosa@udc.es; felixbl@udc.es,"Blázquez-Lozano, Félix/R-8684-2017; PORRAL, CRISTINA CALVO/A-9179-2012","Blázquez-Lozano, Félix/0000-0003-1371-1453; PORRAL, CRISTINA CALVO/0000-0002-5470-0729; Orosa-Gonzalez, Javier/0000-0002-3549-9281",,,,,43,23,23,5,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Focal organisations by definition have considerable power in these systems. We combine insights from the innovation studies literature with the sustainable/green supply chain literature to explore how focal organisations exercise this power in pursuit of system-wide sustainability. Through a case study of the milk CPS in the UK, we illustrate different strategies of the focal organisations to stimulate incremental eco-innovation along existing trajectories. We also show how, despite focal organisation support, radical eco-innovation is inhibited by inherent path dependencies and other institutional dimensions of the CPS. By demonstrating the complementarities of positioning the case study findings within two synergistic literatures, this paper contributes theoretically by extending and elaborating eco-innovation studies. It also has a practical utility for policy makers seeking to chart a path to more sustainable CPS by relying on focal organisations. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In Australia there are no minimum housing standards; the effect is now critical. In October 2017, a regulatory impact assessment was instructed, to consider Livable Housing Australia's Silver and Gold standards, for inclusion in the National Construction Code. A substantial research project provided a knowledge and evidence base of the policy perspective; an expanded statistical context; and detailed analyses of Silver, Gold and Platinum design levels. The policy perspective included greater economic focus. The effect on productivity, directly attributable to housing, is significant. 34 specific policy 'problems' were identified that could be solved or mitigated if acceptable standards of housing were introduced. It is reassuring that universal design has permeated all levels of government policy. The statistical context explored demographics, households, dwelling types; tenure; occupants; disability and carers. Detailed analyses challenged many common assumptions and re-framed accessible housing into a mainstream problem. 73% of all dwellings are separate houses and the average home has 3.1 bedrooms. There are tremendous opportunities for universally design-led mainstream solutions. The compliance gap analyses show which design features might cost more; have potential to be designed out; or be cost neutral. Many design features are cost neutral and arguably should be included within mandated standards. As there is a minimal gap between universal design standards and current housing, there is hope that all Australians will, one day, live in a universally designed home.","[Galbraith, Penny] Ctr Universal Design Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Galbraith, P (通讯作者)，Ctr Universal Design Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",penny@box50.com.au,,,,,,,23,1,1,1,3,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,324,335,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-324,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371492.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100031,0

The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of environmentally conscious purchase behaviour (ECPB) and green scepticism on organic food consumption. Moreover, the paper examines the indirect impact of attitudinal and contextual forces on organic food consumption (through ECPB).

Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesised relationships. Findings The findings indicate that ECPB positively and green scepticism negatively affects organic food consumption. In addition, ECPB is positively influenced by personal and social norms, perceived availability and consumer sustainability orientation. Interestingly, the social norms exert the strongest indirect effect on organic food consumption.

For conceptual reasons, the process of creating and diffusing innovation in the private sector differs from the public one, particularly when observed from the position of their inherent raison d'etre. Differentiation is primarily determined by a specific cultural framework that dominates in these two 'worlds'. Besides, the implemented typology of innovation in support of strategic goals by its intensity and scope in these two sectors differs as well. Contemporary strategic positioning in the public sector has recognized the importance of creation and introduction of innovative services (or products) in providing improved quality civil service and increasing the efficiency of the public sector operations. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the theoretical background of the innovation process in the public sector with special focus on implementing conditions in the transition economy country, specifically the Republic of Croatia. For the purpose of responding the paper's leading research question, an empirical research based on a qualitative combined methodology targeting relevant public sector representatives has been created and conducted. The results are showing that the innovation intensity and scope in examined national public sector is significantly lagging behind the developed countries.

The study investigates the justification for such a decision and whether it is based on the poverty map designed by World Bank in 2016 upon the request of the Ministry of Regional Development and EU funds. The paper analyses data on contracted funds for the period between October 18, 2016 and January 19, 2018 by operational programmes (OP) and other EU sources: Competitiveness and Cohesion OP, Efficient Human Resources OP, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries OP, Rural Development Programme, European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) and by five counties participating in the Programme in order to see which of the above operational programmes and other sources sparked the interest of most users and which of the five counties has been the most successful. The paper also explores the impact of the implementation of the Slavonija, Baranja and Srijem Programme on the efficiency of using funds from European Structural and Investment Funds and other EU sources at disposal to the Republic of Croatian in the EU 2014-2020 planning and financial period. The central question this paper seeks to answer is whether the implementation of the Slavonija, Baranja and Srijem Project slows down or accelerates contracting and using EU sourced funds in Croatia, whether the existing division of Croatia into two NUTS II levels is a good solution or whether the implementation of the Slavonija, Baranja and Srijem Project, as a sign of the decentralization of the system governing the use of EU funds, may serve as a modality of and path towards more efficient use of EU funds.","[Kraljic, Tihana] Carevdar 164, Krizhevci 48260, Croatia; [Bekic, Ivana] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Doctoral Program Entrepreneurship & Innovativenes, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Kraljic, T (通讯作者)，Carevdar 164, Krizhevci 48260, Croatia.",tihana.kraljic@kc.t-com.hr; ivana.bekic@gmail.com,"KRALJIĆ, TIHANA/D-5549-2019",,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,813,822,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900084,0

They cannot compensate for bad design solutions and are thereby, like sniffing dogs, guiding designers to meet peoples' needs. We always use a combination of empathic modelling and involvement of people with reduced functions to find new solutions to the problems a product is supposed to solve. We have used this method in the teaching of Universal design at different universities for more than ten years. The students find the exercises to be a very entertaining eye-opener leading to development of empathy for human diversity all while the level of innovation in their design work increase. To constantly make design students understand barriers that can occur due to bad design solutions we utilize a toolbox simulating different kinds of functional ability. It also includes a handbook that describes workshops, evaluation methods and design processes that can be performed using the tools. The goal is to guide efficient, innovative and inclusive design processes. By simulating diversity among people, the designer can interpret the needs of different users and use that as a starting point and for evaluating design solutions during the creative process.","[Lorentzen, Lena] Mid Sweden Univ, Design Dept, Sundsvall, Sweden; [Hedvall, Per-Olof] Lund Univ, Dept Design Sci, Certec, Lund, Sweden",Mid-Sweden University; Lund University,"Lorentzen, L (通讯作者)，Mid Sweden Univ, Design Dept, Sundsvall, Sweden.",lena.lo-rentzen@miun.se,"Hedvall, Per-Olof/D-1932-2015","Hedvall, Per-Olof/0000-0002-0962-2899",,,,,12,3,3,1,10,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,128,136,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-128,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371467.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100013,0

Proper facilities within the transport infrastructure, thanks to its acceleration feature, increase the pace of social and economic development of a particular region. It is therefore for the public authorities at different levels to provide proper infrastructure. However, its development is frequently hindered due to limited financial possibilities of the public sector. In such case, solution in the form of Public Private Partnership (PPP) can be used. In particular European countries the popularity of PPP is different, inter alia due to difficulties in implementing the said formula. In Poland we can also observe the development of PPP. It refers to different sectors, including transport infrastructure and services. The process is not easy and requires a lot of effort from various stakeholders. Therefore the main purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) present the Polish experience regarding the use of PPP formula in projects related to the transport infrastructure and rendering transport services, 2) identify the obstacles in applying PPP formula in Poland and future developments of the Polish PPP market. The main objective of the article has been achieved by studying the literature and analysing legal regulations and statistical data, reports and publications of public institutions and reports of agencies and consulting companies. The article refers to: legal grounds of PPP in Poland, types and sector-based structure of projects (commenced, completed and planned) and against a background of them, the share of transport projects, types of partners in the projects, the volume (value) of projects and other issues. The article also outlines the evolution in perceiving PPP over the years, solutions contributing to the promotion of PPP in Poland and increase in the number of PPP initiatives related to transport and those referring to the sustainable development of transport. The conclusions and experience resulting from the conducted analysis may constitute examples and guidelines for other countries, in particular those who just like Poland have gone through the political and economic transformation and have yet to catch up, in particular in terms of infrastructure.","[Miklinska, Joanna] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Miklinska, J (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland.",j.miklinska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Miklinska, Joanna/R-3338-2018","Miklinska, Joanna/0000-0003-1450-9273",,,,,25,1,1,2,7,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,499,509,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900052,0

The students have different backgrounds, experiences, interests, learning styles and abilities. Also, there are more students with disabilities at Swedish universities, especially invisible disabilities. Teachers need to adapt their teaching and curricula, and can no longer wait to do this until they spot a student with diverse learning preferences. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is an approach to make a university more inclusive, by increasing the flexibility of how students can take in information, express their knowledge and be motivated in learning. Seven key persons at a Swedish university took part in focus group interviews about their views and experiences of diversity and inclusion. They represented key administrative and pedagogical functions, as well as a student organisation and learning support for students with disabilities. Qualitative content analysis of the interviews resulted in 10 themes: a) Attitudes and treatment b) Accessibility and participation c) Knowledge and competence d) Support and resources e) System and processes f) Organisation g) Teachers and education h) Students and student organisations i) Actions and solutions j) Future work. Conclusions: While the university has good support for students, more support for teachers is needed. Thus, the next step will be the development of a course module for teachers to be included in a regular pedagogical development course for teachers at the university. Furthermore, there is a need for more knowledge about inclusive student activities, taking place outside of lecture rooms.","[Rydeman, Bitte; Eftring, Hakan; Hedvall, Per-Olof] Lund Univ, Dept Design Sci, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Rydeman, B (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Design Sci, Lund, Sweden.",bitte.rydeman@certec.lth.se,"Hedvall, Per-Olof/D-1932-2015","Hedvall, Per-Olof/0000-0002-0962-2899; Rydeman, Bitte/0000-0002-5376-2979",Faculty of Engineering (LTH) at Lund University,Faculty of Engineering (LTH) at Lund University,The reported work has been funded by the Faculty of Engineering (LTH) at Lund University.

Paper is focused especially on Czech agri-food trade volume, value, unit price and competitiveness analyses. Individual analyses are specified in relation to EU28, non-EU countries, World and OECD vs. Developing countries. - In relation to all analyzed group of countries, the Czech value of Czech agrarian exports and imports recorded the significant growth. The positive figure of Czech agri-food trade activities is much faster inter -annual growth rate of exports in relation to the value of imports. Czech agri-food trade balance is stabilized and import/export covering ration is recorded the positive changes. The weakness of Czech agri-food trade activities is low unit price of Czech exports in comparison to imports unit prices. Competitiveness of Czech agri-food trade is especially pushed through the growth of exported volumes. The added value in Czech agri-food trade value growth is very limited. The number of Czech agri-food trade competitive items is increasing (but they have very limited added value).","[Smutka, Lubos; Steininger, Michal] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Smutka, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",smutka@pef.czu.cz; steininger@pef.czu.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Steininger, Michal/H-3191-2018","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Steininger, Michal/0000-0002-8121-8567","Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analyza komoditni struktury Ceskeho agramiho zahranicniho obchodu/Analysis of Czech agrarian foreign trade commodity structure [20171024]","Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analyza komoditni struktury Ceskeho agramiho zahranicniho obchodu/Analysis of Czech agrarian foreign trade commodity structure","This paper was supported by Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: Analyza komoditni struktury Ceskeho agramiho zahranicniho obchodu/Analysis of Czech agrarian foreign trade commodity structure [nr. 20171024].",,19,0,0,0,3,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-701-5,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,2,,,,285,294,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL3AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443600028,0

The level of public debt of the Republic of Croatia, and especially the dynamics of its growth, indicates a troublesome situation in the system of public finances. The instability of the financial system and the increase in government spending have been manifested in the strengthening of the state debt borrowing increase, whose sources of funding are already largely limited due to the financial crisis. With the goal of settling incoming debts and stabilizing the system, the economy is turning to borrowing either on the domestic or foreign markets. Previous and current situation in the Republic of Croatia suggests the existence of excessive macroeconomic imbalances caused largely by the existence of excessive levels of public debt and the profound financial crisis, which ultimately reflected on the system of the public finances. Therefore, there is a need for applying special policies and strategies for managing public debt that would lead to stabilization of state indebtedness using tailored measures on the financial market. This paper deals with the impact of public debt on the economy of the Republic of Croatia, as well as the possible measures of stabilization of the system. Given the former research, the emphasis is placed on the oscillating path of public debt growth and the budget deficit, as well as the consequences of such negative movements have on the economy. The conclusion that is to be drawn is that every measure of stabilization of the system has its positive and negative effect on the economy. What consequences will prevail primarily depends on a combination of measures that will apply economic policy makers.","[Sudaric, Zeljko] Coll Appl Sci Lavoslav Ruzicka Vukovar, Zupanijska 50, Vukovar, Croatia; [Glavota, Mateja] Sch Econ Osijek, Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek, Croatia",,"Sudaric, Z (通讯作者)，Coll Appl Sci Lavoslav Ruzicka Vukovar, Zupanijska 50, Vukovar, Croatia.",zsudaric@vevu.hr; mateja.glavota@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,449,459,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700049,0

The shift of the employment from manufacturing to service sector was an expected phase of the process of development. Nevertheless, the trend of deindustrialisation has also appeared in developing countries. This premature deindustrialisation has numerous negative economic and political consequences, and that is why the new EU industrial policy tries to find out the way how to reverse this process and to induce reindustrialisation. The financial sector has an important role in economic enhancing growth, so it could be expected that it has an important role for the development of the manufacturing industry as well. The aim of this research is to find out if there is any empirical evidence for the existence of discriminated financial conditions for manufacturing sector firms compared to other sector firms in CEEC countries. In this paper micro level data obtained from BEEPS survey that was conducted in 2002, 2005, 2009 and 2013 are analysed.

Since 2008, producers in the Community market have been subject to the same rules. This makes the EU vegetable market more competitive. However, the volume of their production varies regionally due to land resources, climate and technological advances. The largest producers of qualitative vegetables are the southern countries (Spain and Italy). Poland produces the most cabbages and carrots.

Specifically, the framework developed by Pine and Gilmore (2000) is adopted to look into the effect of product, service and experience qualities on intention to revisit. Design/methodology/approach The explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used to articulate the intention of consumers to revisit coffee concept shops. A preliminary study was conducted to define regular and irregular consumers. Self-administered questionnaire was first administered before using interview to elicit more insights and triangulate the findings. Findings The combination of both quantitative and qualitative findings show that the experiences of regular consumers at coffee concept shops include personal routine activities, while the experiences of irregular customers are composed of occasions with specific and collective purposes. While the intention to revisit of the former is related to the product and service quality, the intention of the latter is largely affected by its service and experience quality. Originality/value Given the rapid rise of coffee concept shops in the developing markets, the use of a mixed-methods design provides more insights into the intention to revisit of the regular and irregular consumers. It underscores the importance for the organisations to know what really matters to the diverse consumers.","[Ting, Hiram] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Inst Borneo Studies, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia; [Ting, Hiram] Sarawak Res Soc, Kuching, Malaysia; [Lau, Wee Ming] Wawasan Open Univ, Kuching, Malaysia; [Cheah, Jun-Hwa] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Azman Hashim Int Business Sch, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Yacob, Yusman] Univ Teknol MARA Sarawak, Fac Business Management, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia; [Memon, Mumtaz Ali] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Ctr Social Innovat, Perak, Malaysia; [Lau, Evan] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Econ & Business, Ctr Excellence Business Econ & Finance Forecastin, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia",University of Malaysia Sarawak; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi Petronas; University of Malaysia Sarawak,"Ting, H (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Inst Borneo Studies, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia.;Ting, H (通讯作者)，Sarawak Res Soc, Kuching, Malaysia.",hiramparousia@gmail.com; lauweeming@yahoo.com; junhwa@ibs.utm.my; yusman779@gmail.com; mumtazutp@gmail.com; lphevan@unimas.my,"Cheah, Jun-Hwa/C-6463-2019; Lau, Evan/J-4514-2019; Memon, Mumtaz Ali/Q-1479-2016; Ting, Hiram/P-3724-2015","Cheah, Jun-Hwa/0000-0001-8440-9564; Lau, Evan/0000-0001-9999-5842; Memon, Mumtaz Ali/0000-0003-4623-9693; Ting, Hiram/0000-0002-1389-976X; Yacob, Yusman/0000-0003-2211-487X",,,,,76,15,15,6,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the prevalence of E. coli with virulence genes in ready-to-eat raw mixed vegetable salads sold in collective catering in Abidjan. Design/methodology/approach A total of 436 strains of E. coli were isolated from 306 ready-to-eat raw mixed vegetables salads and then identified biochemically and molecularly based on the uidA gene responsible for beta-glucuronidase activity. The virulence genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. Findings The prevalence in vegetable salads of E. coli with virulence genes was 35.3 percent. The distribution of pathovars was 21.2 percent enterotoxigenic (ETEC), 4.9 percent enteropathogenic (EPEC), 0.7 percent Shigatoxigenic (STEC), and 7.5 percent Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). It appears from the study that vegetable salads sold in collective catering in Abidjan are at risk for contamination by E. coli pathovars.

The paper contributes to the literature by constructing TFP growth measures, in the process, both real wage growth and real user cost growth measures at the state level. The growth accounting exercise reveals that states display considerable heterogeneity in TFP growth with both real wage growth and real user cost growth equally contributing to it. While our econometric estimates reveal significant TFP growth effects associated with college education, they are considerably lower in magnitude when compared to the earlier studies. Productivity growth effects associated with high school education remain insignificant. Our empirical findings are further validated by the use of instrumental variable estimation to address the endogeneity of the schooling variables and are also robust to the inclusion of a rich set of control variables, alternative TFP growth measures as well as to the tests to draw robust inferences in the presence of weak instruments.","[Panda, Bibhudutta] Univ Minnesota Morris, Div Social Sci, 600 E 4th St, Morris, MN 56267 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Morris; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota Hospital,"Panda, B (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Morris, Div Social Sci, 600 E 4th St, Morris, MN 56267 USA.",bpanda@morris.umn.edu,"Panda, Bibhudutta/AAF-6708-2020",,,,,,66,7,9,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The literature has dealt mainly with intra-coalition or intra-community relations. However, the literature does not answer the question of how institutions could be created that could support interaction between a large number of distant communities and between merchants who did not necessarily know one another. This article presents such an institution that prevailed in the Baltic Sea region in the late middle ages, referred to here as the inter-communal conciliation mechanism. In case of a dispute, conciliation took place between town councils, rather than the merchants involved in the dispute, thus combining individual liability and communal enforcement. Exploration of the documents reveals a task-specific regularity of behaviour, which was the general practice among merchants to turn to the council of their own community when they had problems in a foreign town, instead of being obliged to solve disputes by themselves. This institution provided a permanent, centralized, and relatively impartial enforcement mechanism to respond to breaches. It was therefore well adapted to large, at least partially anonymous markets, such as the Baltic Sea region, with dozens of towns and thousands of merchants.","[Kallioinen, Mika] Univ Turku, Turku, Finland",University of Turku,"Kallioinen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Turku, Finland.",,,,,,,,83,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Bayesian networks have gained importance in ecosystem service modelling and we show how, in recent literature, this approach has attempted to address strategic behaviour issues. Using simple simulations, we illustrate that the strategic behaviour of stakeholders could be better modelled with an integration of game theory concepts in Bayesian networks. This approach may help to understand the rationale behind stakeholders' behaviour and foresee their actions. Furthermore, the comparison of environmental results with cooperative and strategic behaviours raises questions about the role of humans in the production of ecosystem services, and on the correct way to value their benefits.

We developed an-integrated analytical framework of dematerialization analysis incorporating both material flow and stock indicators. A four quadrant diagram is designed to classify different stages of dematerialization based on the elasticity of material flow/stock to economic output or well-being. We then conducted a case study on the long-term evolution of aluminum cycle in the U.S., and found that different material flow and stock indicators decoupled from gross domestic product (GDP) growth in a clear sequential pattern. Flows closer to the beginning of the aluminum cycle (e.g., primary aluminum production) decoupled from GDP earlier than flows closer to the final consumption stage (e.g., consumption of final products). In-use stock of aluminum decoupled from GDP much more slowly than any flow indicator, and had just reached the status of relative decoupling around 2000. This phenomenon is determined by the fact that different causes of dematerialization, such as import substitution and secondary material recycling, take effect at different stages of economic development. Comprehensive understanding of dematerialization depends on in-depth analysis on material-economy relationships from an integrated stock and flow perspective. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It appears that the EROI of global oil and gas productions reached their maximum values in the 1930s-40s, respectively around 50:1 and 150:1, and have declined subsequently. Furthermore, we suggest that the EROI of global coal production has not yet reached its maximum value. Based on the original work of Dale et al. (2011), we then present a new theoretical dynamic expression of the EROL Modifications of the original model were needed in order to perform calibrations on each of our price-based historical estimates of coal, oil, and gas global EROI. Theoretical models replicate the fact that maximum EROI5 of global oil and gas productions have both already been reached while this is not the case for coal. In a prospective exercise, the models show the pace of the expected EROIs decrease for oil and gas in the coming century. Regarding coal, models are helpful to estimate the value and date of the EROI peak, which will most likely occur between 2025 and 2045, around a value of 95(+/- 15):1. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Much of the analysis of energy in economics has focused on the study of the aggregate output. Here, we deviate from this approach and study the role of fuel diversification in industrial development. We build the energy space describing the space of energy technologies, which a country can use in the production of manufacturing goods. As countries grow, they diversify their industries, producing more diverse products over time. We show that the process is accompanied by diversification of fuels, which countries use in the manufacturing sector. In particular, countries move in the energy space by adopting novel fuels, while their movements can be linked to structural changes in the industry. Over time, countries build unique production capabilities, which drives divergence in fuel diversity between countries. Our results provide insight into the limits of fuel substitution in the manufacturing sector, as well as they carry important implications for the assessment of potential reductions in CO2 emissions in the future.

Reduced consumer confidence, product recalls, and litigation are limited to the responsible manufacturer only if that manufacturer can be clearly linked to the safety problem. We analyze the impact of accountability for safety problems on manufacturer entry decisions and investments to mitigate risk. Consistent with prior research, we find investment levels increase with accountability in a duopoly market, and that accountability can thus enhance market viability and improve consumer welfare. However, we also analyze the impact of accountability on entry of a competitor, after the originator's exclusivity has expired. Accountability promotes the development of a robust market by raising expected profits, particularly for an entrant with a relatively low likelihood of a safety problem. Yet entry need not improve consumer welfare, and may benefit the incumbent in our model. In contrast to the traditional entry deterrence mechanism, when accountability is sufficiently low, increased incumbent investment encourages entry. Our analysis has important implications for biologic drugs, insofar as pathways for entry by biosimilars have been established in Europe and the United States, and informs pharmacovigilance and other accountability policies for biologics.","[Romley, John] Univ Southern Calif, Univ Gateway 100N, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Shih, Tiffany] Precis Hlth Econ, 11100 Santa Monica Blvd,Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA",University of Southern California,"Shih, T (通讯作者)，Precis Hlth Econ, 11100 Santa Monica Blvd,Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA.",romley@price.usc.edu; tiffany.shih@precisionhealtheconomics.com,,,"Amgen, Inc.","Amgen, Inc.(Amgen)","We are grateful to Katalin Bognar, Amitabh Chandra, Darius Lakdawalla, Ross MacLean, Tomas Philipson, Seth Seabury, Jacqueline Vanderpuye-Orgle, and Wesley Yin for valuable comments and support.

The research related to green consumption behavior in developing nations such as India is few and far between. Considering this, researchers in the present study have attempted to understand the consumer behavior to buy green products in context of a developing nation; India. The study has used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and further extended the TPB including additional constructs namely; perceived value and willingness to pay premium (WPP) and measured its appropriateness in determining consumer green purchase intention and behavior. A total of 620 usable responses were collected with the help of a questionnaire survey using the convenience sampling approach. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate the strength of relationships among constructs. The findings reported that TPB fully supported the consumers' intention to buy green products which in turn influences their green purchase behavior. Inclusion of additional constructs was supported in the TPB as it has improved the predicted power of the TPB framework in predicting consumer green purchase intention and behavior. At the end, discussion and implications have been discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We use the global supply chain concept introduced in Timmer et al. (2014) to measure CO2 emissions in internationally fragmented production networks and embed the concept in structural decomposition analysis. Our findings suggest that rising levels of domestic consumption are related to increased carbon dioxide emissions in both advanced and emerging economies. A substantial share of CO2 emissions growth in emerging economies is accounted for by increased participation in global supply chains. However, even for countries that rapidly integrated in global production networks, such as China, rising domestic consumption accounts for the majority of territorial emissions.

The results show that China has PTT larger than 1, indicating that China emits more emissions to obtain each unit of value-added from exports than its trade partners. Over the period, China's PIT first decreased from 1995 to 2001 and then increased from 2001 to 2009. The further decompositions show that improving technology is the leading driving force to decrease PTT, while the change in global trade pattern is the leading force increasing PTT, especially after 2001. We further decomposed the temporal change of China's PTT by income group of,the trading partners. The results show that the change in the global trade pattern is the crucial driving force behind the different changes of PIT by income group. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yet research on PES is increasingly focused on debating exactly how neoliberal programmes really are, documenting complexities in PES implementation and concluding that few programmes are very market-based in practice. While we agree that ideal neoliberal implementation of PES does not and cannot exist, we argue that focusing (only) on micro-politics misunderstands the importance of analysing PES as a form of neoliberal conservation. The question is not just whether PES is innately neoliberal but how it functions within a broader neoliberal political economy. By focusing on the overarching governance and power structures that gave rise to PES in the first place, we more clearly see what we call 'the PES conceit', namely that the approach implicitly accepts neoliberal capitalism as both the problem and the solution to the ecological crisis. This strategy is not only contradictory but also commonly fails to achieve intended outcomes, falling far short of conservation objectives while also often exacerbating socioeconomic inequality. This problematic conceit, we conclude, cannot be addressed through only micro-oriented studies; it demands connecting micro- and macro political economic analyses to confront broader neoliberal power structures.

This paper contributes in filling this gap by using a Mexican data set that contains detailed information on both remittances and use of natural resources at the household level. The data set is representative of the rural population of Mexico at the national level, which allows us to move beyond case studies overcoming one of the main challenges for understanding the relationship between livelihoods and the environment. Results show that remittances have significant effects on the use of natural resources by the receiving households. We find that a) remittances decrease the likelihood that a household will participate in natural resource extraction, and b) households that receive remittances and extract natural resources have lower environmental income and lower environmental reliance than households not receiving remittances. By reducing participation in extraction as well as reliance on natural resources, remittances reduce the pressure that local populations put on the natural resource base that surrounds them. This could mean good news for the conservation of natural resources. However, it also shows the vulnerability of Mexico's natural resource to periods of low or negative economic growth in the United States inasmuch as they affect the amount of remittances that migrants send back home.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse global comparative advantage in the European Union (EU) wine industry and to test the duration and stability of trade indices. Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies the theory of comparative advantages by using the Balassa indices to European wine trade (based on the 16 biggest producers) data from the period 2000-2013. Moreover, it applies stability and duration analysis on comparative advantages calculated. Findings - Results suggest that Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain are the highest ranked European wine producers in the world market and have the largest comparative advantages. However, duration and stability tests indicate that trade advantages have weakened for the majority of these countries. The paper discusses a number of reasons for this downturn, including changes to Common Agricultural Policy wine regulation, economic crisis, and the rise of New World wine producers. Originality/value - The originality of the paper is that it applies the theory of comparative advantage to top wine exporters in the EU. The paper also makes valuable contributions to the wine literature by analysing the duration and stability of comparative advantage in the global wine trade. Moreover, the identification of industry-specific causes for changing patterns in comparative advantage in the EU might be important to the wine industry.","[Balogh, Jeremias Mate; Jambor, Attila] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Balogh, JM (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Budapest, Hungary.",jeremias.balogh@uni-corvinus.hu,"Balogh, Jeremiás Máté/S-2471-2016","Balogh, Jeremiás Máté/0000-0001-9081-0071","National Research, Development and Innovation Office [K_119669]; Project 10 years of Accession: Lessons from the agri-food sector of the New Member States [K_112394]","National Research, Development and Innovation Office(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); Project 10 years of Accession: Lessons from the agri-food sector of the New Member States","The authors gratefully acknowledge the two anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions on earlier versions of the manuscript.

In each town, a local regulator has a say in the location of the local firm. We find that local regulators may use zoning strategically. The incentive to gain consumers from the other town, or not to lose local consumers, may push regulators to approve only locations for firms close enough to the frontier. When zoning is costly an asymmetric equilibrium may emerge: only one regulator resorts to zoning. In the case of towns of different sizes, the regulator of the larger town is the only one that zones in an asymmetric equilibrium.","[Carlos Barcena-Ruiz, Juan; Javier Casado-Izaga, F.] Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, UPV EHU, Ave Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Bárcena-Ruiz, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, UPV EHU, Ave Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",juancarlos.barcena@ehu.es; franciscojavier.casado@ehu.es,"Casado-Izaga, Francisco Javier/F-8664-2016; Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/G-6104-2011","Casado-Izaga, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-1752-878X; Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-8808-2543","Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [ECO2012-32299, ECO2015-66803-P]; Basque Government [IT1124-16]; University of the Basque Country [EHU14/05]",Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); University of the Basque Country,"Financial support from Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia (ECO2012-32299, ECO2015-66803-P), Basque Government (IT1124-16) and the University of the Basque Country (EHU14/05) is gratefully acknowledged.

Models of ecosystems or food webs that make economic analysis viable should capture as much as possible of system structure and dynamics while balancing biological and ecological detail against dimensionality and model complexity. Relevant models need strong, empirical content, but data availability may inhibit modeling efforts. Models are bound to be nonlinear, and model and observational uncertainty should be included. To deal with these issues and to improve modeling of ecosystems or food webs for use in ecosystem-based fisheries management analysis, we suggest the data assimilation method ensemble Kalman filtering. To illustrate the method, we model the dynamics of the main, pelagic species in the Norwegian Sea. In order to reduce parameter dimensionality, the species are modeled to rely on a common carrying capacity. We also take further methodological steps to deal with a still high number of parameters. Our best model captures much of the observed dynamics in the fish stocks while the estimated model error is moderate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Some of the best Croatian writers built their work on the merciless criticism of the monarchy; hence, I would like to try to bring some of my views on this matter.

The index is compared to a product code-based index and applied to reassess determinants of food diversity demand. Design/methodology/approach - A group-based food diversity index is developed by adapting the US Healthy Food Diversity Index. Using Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey data on 4,341 US households, correlation coefficients, descriptive statistics and linear regressions are estimated to compare and reassess the determinants of group and product code-based food diversity demand. Findings - Results show that the group and product code indices capture different forms of food diversity. The indices are only moderately correlated and have varying means and skewness. Education, gender, age, household size, race, SNAP and food expenditures are found to significantly affect food diversity. However, the magnitude and direction of the effects vary between group and product code indices. Given these differences, it is essential that studies select a diversity index that corresponds to their objective. Results suggest that group-based indices are appropriate for informing food and nutrition policy, while product code-based indices are ideal for guiding food industry management's decision making. Originality/value - A group-based food diversity index representative of household expenditures across food subgroups is developed.","[Leschewski, Andrea M.; Weatherspoon, Dave D.] Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kuhns, Annemarie] Econ Res Serv, Food Econ Div, Food Markets Branch, Washington, DC USA",Michigan State University,"Leschewski, AM (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",leschewski.andrea@gmail.com,,"Leschewski, Andrea/0000-0003-0376-6776",,,,,19,2,3,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A web survey was used to collect the data. The survey subjects were citizens of Ningbo City in Zhejiang Province. A total of 403 subjects were obtained through the sampling service, and 337 subjects were retained after strict examination. The data were used to construct a partial least squares structural equation model. Findings - The cognition of green aquatic products significantly positively affects outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, perception of others' behavior, and socio-structural conditions. Self-efficacy and outcome expectancy significantly positively influence consumption intention. Self-efficacy, perception of others' behavior, and consumption intention significantly positively affect consumption behavior. Practical implications - The concept, connotations and benefits of green aquatic products should be widely publicized through diversified channels to increase people's knowledge of these products and to encourage people to distinguish them from regular aquatic products and to believe in their benefits. In addition, measures should be taken to guarantee that only genuine green aquatic products can enter the market because the false claims of some products have damaged consumers' belief in these products. Originality/value - To test the effect of the cognition of green aquatic products, the construct the cognition of green aquatic products was added to the model based on social cognitive theory. This paper contributes to the existing literature by further exploring how cognitive aspects affect consumption behavior with regard to green food.","[Li, Yongtao; Zhong, Changbiao] Ningbo Univ, Business Sch, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo University,"Zhong, CB (通讯作者)，Ningbo Univ, Business Sch, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",lyt_excel@hotmail.com; zhongchangbiao@nbu.edu.cn,,,K.C.

Design/methodology/approach - Parents (n = 363) on the IOI completed a questionnaire exploring confidence levels of food skills, cooking techniques executed and the identification of barriers which might impact on meal preparation. Non-probability convenience sampling was utilised. Findings - The majority of parents (75 per cent) learned their basic cooking skills from their mother with home economics classes being the second most popular source of learning. There were a number of statistically significant jurisdictional differences. For example, when preparing dinners, NI parents were less likely to enjoy cooking and more likely to use processed foods such as breaded frozen chicken and jars of sauces than ROI (x(2) = 56.167, df = 1, p < 0.001). Similarly, parents in NI were less likely to involve family members in meal preparation (x(2) = 17.939, df = 1, p < 0.001). Parents in the ROI reported higher confidence levels than NI parents when cooking from basic ingredients; following a simple recipe and preparing new foods. Over half (51 per cent) of parents identified barriers to cooking with fresh ingredients as: time, cost, busy family life and limited facilities. Originality/value - There is a lack of information pertaining to food skills and cooking confidence amongst parents on the IOI.","[McCloat, Amanda; Mooney, Elaine] St Angelas Coll, Home Econ Dept, Sligo, Ireland; [Hollywood, Lynsey Elizabeth] Univ Ulster, Dept Hospitality & Tourism Management, Coleraine, Londonderry, North Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; St Angela's College; Ulster University,"McCloat, A (通讯作者)，St Angelas Coll, Home Econ Dept, Sligo, Ireland.",amccloat@stangelas.nuigalway.ie,"Cloat, Amanda Mc/M-7101-2019","Cloat, Amanda Mc/0000-0002-7735-1090; Hollywood, Lynsey/0000-0003-3918-6255","Ursuline Merici Research Bursary Awards in St Angela's College, Sligo","Ursuline Merici Research Bursary Awards in St Angela's College, Sligo","The researchers acknowledge the financial support of the Ursuline Merici Research Bursary Awards in St Angela's College, Sligo.",,35,8,8,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Cultures were harvested from the early stationary phase and enumerated after dilution according to the Milse Misra method. Bacterial suspensions were mixed with protective agents and frozen at 80 degrees C before drying in a freeze dryer. Survival rates were determined both immediately during freeze drying and after 14 days of cold storage (at 4 degrees C). Findings - Compared to gum Arabic 5 and 10 percent (W/V) or skim milk 10 percent (W/V), Persian gum 1 percent (W/V) showed no significantly different effects on the survival of Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum PTCC 1896 (po0.05). Similarly, no significant differences (po0.05) were observed between Persian gum 6 percent (W/V), gum Arabic 6 percent (W/V), the combination of Persian gum 3 percent (W/V) and gum Arabic 3 percent (W/V), and skim milk 10 percent (W/V) in terms of their effects on the survival of Escherichia coli. Skim milk 10 percent (W/V) was, however, found to have significant (po0.05) effects on the survival of Xanthomonas axonopodis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Statistically significant (po0.05) effects were observed after 14 days of cold storage (4 degrees C) by Persian gum 6 percent (W/V) on the survival of Escherichia coli and by gum Arabic 6 percent (W/V) on the survival of Xanthomonas axonopodis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was concluded that protective agents could be replaced by Persian gum for its effect on the survival rate of Escherichia coli and by skim milk for its effects on the survival of Xanthomonas axonopodis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Persian gum 6 percent (W/V) seemed to be the best protective agent for Escherichia coli during 14 days of its storage as gum Arabic 6 percent (W/V) seemed to have the same performance for Xanthomonas axonopodis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Persian gum 1 percent (W/V) was also found an alternative protective agent for the freeze drying of Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum PTCC 1896. Originality/value - As Iranian Persian gum is cheap due to its wide availability and seems to have effects similar to those of gum Arabic and skim milk at low concentrations, it may be considered a good candidate for industrial applications.","[Mohammadi-Gouraji, Elyas; Sheikh-Zeinoddin, Mahmoud; Soleimanian-Zad, Sabihe] Isfahan Univ Technol, Esfahan, Iran",Isfahan University of Technology,"Sheikh-Zeinoddin, M (通讯作者)，Isfahan Univ Technol, Esfahan, Iran.",zeinodin@cc.iut.ac.ir,"Soleimanian-Zad, Sabihe/AFM-6825-2022","soleimanain zad, sabihe/0000-0002-6956-8468",,,,,32,5,7,2,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Among the 144 E. coli isolates recovered from 160 vegetable salads, 17 (12 percent) ceftazidime-resistant isolates were screened for ESBL production with the double disk-diffusion test. The ESBL-producing isolates were characterized for antimicrobial resistance, the presence of virulence genes and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants. The isolates were also subjected to phylogenetic group typing. The existence of plasmid AmpC genes and mutations in the regulatory region of the chromosomal AmpC gene was assessed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. All beta-lactamase isolates were further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine the genetic relatedness. Findings - Overall, 17 (12 percent) of the 144 E. coli isolates studied were ceftazidime resistant. Among the 17 isolates, 13 (77 percent) were multidrug resistant and four (23.5 percent) were ESBL producers. The bla CTX-M14 was the only gene detected. Of the 12 AmpC-producing isolates, three (18 percent) harbored plasmid-encoded AmpC and sequencing analysis of the chromosomal AmpC genes revealed mutations in the promoter/attenuator region. PMQR determinants were detected in 9 (52 percent) isolates. A was the most prevalent phylogenetic group (56 percent), followed by groups B1 (31 percent), D (6 percent), and B2 (6 percent). PCR showed that six (50 percent) ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli isolates carried one and/or two virulence genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed no epidemiological relationship between these isolates. Originality/value - This study places vegetable salads within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be vehicles for antibiotic-resistant bacteria/genes with clinical interest and these findings are worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed.","[Nayme, Kaotar; Elmdaghri, Naima] Inst Pasteur Maroc, Mol Bacteriol Lab, Casablanca, Morocco; [Barguigua, Abouddihaj] Univ Sultan Moulay Slimane, Fac Polydisciplinaire, Dept Biol Geol, Beni Mellal, Morocco; [Bouchrif, Brahim] Inst Pasteur Maroc, Food Microbiol Lab, Casablanca, Morocco; [Diawara, Idrissa] Hassan II Univ Casablanca, Fac Med & Pharm, Casablanca, Morocco; [El Otmani, Fatima] Chouaib Doukkali Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Microbiol Hlth & Environm Team Res, El Jadida, Morocco; [Zerouali, Khalid] Hassan II Univ Casablanca, Fac Med & Pharm, Lab Microbiol, Casablanca, Morocco; [Timinouni, Mohammed] Inst Pasteur Maroc, Casablanca, Morocco",Sultan Moulay Slimane University of Beni Mellal; Hassan II University of Casablanca; Chouaib Doukkali University of El Jadida; Hassan II University of Casablanca,"Timinouni, M (通讯作者)，Inst Pasteur Maroc, Casablanca, Morocco.",mohammed.timinouni@pasteur.ma,"barguigua, Abouddihaj/G-4007-2015","barguigua, Abouddihaj/0000-0003-0100-0371",,,,,42,2,2,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The prevailing trend nowadays is the urbanization; the migratory shift, the relocation of the populace from the rural areas to the cities, as well as the increased overall emphasis on the quality of healthcare. More than half of the global population currently resides in the urban areas, simultaneously experiencing a rise in growth rates. Also, a significant portion of one's life is spent at the workplace, with a severely diminished time left for leisure activities. Caring for one's health, exercise and diet also garnered significant importance. All of these influences have impacted the overall lifestyle of most people, as well as the manner in which global business is conducted, thus reflecting on both the consumer habits and the consumer behaviour. Due to these shifts, the operational strategies of retail chains have to be thoroughly revised. The population boom, coupled with the opening of new stores, has resulted in the overall growth in retail sales. However, this factor is gradually losing its' significance. The modern consumer is, on average, much more educated, experienced and informed, primarily seeking more value for the money spent. Therefore, the retail chains need to submit to the customers' preferences and habits, otherwise, they may quite easily face a losing battle and surrender their foothold to the competition. This paper examines the factors influencing retail industry strategies and formats, arising from the, previously mentioned, shifting consumer characteristics. The re-emerging popularity of convenient stores will be researched, with an emphasis on the modern store formats, the ones' most feasible for both the customers and the retailers.","[Plazibat, Ivana] Univ Dept Profess Studies, Kopilica 5, Split 21000, Croatia; [Dadic, Mario] Univ Split, Dept Profess Studies, Kopilica 5, Split 21000, Croatia; [Petricevic, Duje] Univ Split, Fac Kinesiol, Nikole Tesle 6, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split; University of Split; University of Split,"Plazibat, I (通讯作者)，Univ Dept Profess Studies, Kopilica 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",iplazibat@oss.unist.hr; mario.dadic@gmail.com; duje_petricevic@yahoo.com,"Plazibat, Ivana/D-4909-2017; Dadić, Mario/Q-8894-2018",,,,,,17,0,0,2,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,239,247,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500022,0

In the majority of applications, human behaviour is represented by the rational actor model despite growing empirical evidence of its shortcomings in NRM contexts. While the importance of accounting for the complexity of human behaviour is increasingly recognized, its integration into formal models remains a major challenge. The challenges are multiple: i) there exist many theories scattered across the social sciences, ii) most theories cover only a certain aspect of decision-making, iii) they vary in their degree of formalization, iv) causal mechanisms are often not specified. We provide a framework- MoHuB (Modelling Human Behavior) - to facilitate a broader inclusion of theories on human decision-making in formal NRM models. It serves as a tool and common language to describe, compare and communicate alternative theories. In doing so, we not only enhance understanding of commonalities and differences between theories, but take a first step towards tackling the challenges mentioned above. This approach may enable modellers to find and formalize relevant theories, and be more explicit and inclusive about theories of human decision making in the analysis of social ecological systems.

Environmental analysis is a critical part of the strategic management planning process. Good performance within a company is the result of correct interaction of business management with its internal and external environment. The recognition of internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats, takes place on the basis of a SWOT analysis. The SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) framework is proposed by many as an analytical tool which should be used to categorize significant environmental factors both internal and external to the organization. SWOT analysis has been praised for its simplicity and practicality. As a framework it has been widely adopted but, generally, its use has been accepted uncritically. It is timely to reappraise its value as a strategic management tool. SWOT should not be viewed as a static analytical tool with emphasis solely on its output. It should be used as a dynamic part of the management and business development process.

The new technologies and changes in culture can be associated with this world. Psychology of globalization (Arnett, 2002; Senejko&Los, 2016) is aimed to describe and understand people's reactions towards variety aspects of globalization. This project attempted to fill the knowledge gap about how people react upon this reality and what is their perception of it's different aspects. The main research question was: How do young Polish adults perceive technological changes and how this perspective is connected with their global view of the world and what kind of reactions people activate in that context. To investigate this question, two models were used: The model of attitudes toward globalized world (Senejko, Los, 2011, 2014, 2016) and the model of globalizational threats and defensive reactions based on function-action approach to psychological defense (Senejko, 2010). Two questionnaires and set of demographic questions were used to collect data from 305 participants: the Questionnaire I-World (Senejko, Los, 2011, 2014), elaborated by Senejko &Los and Senejko's GTDQ-Questionnaire (Globalizational Threats and Defenses) (Senejko, 2015). First questionnaire assesses 3 different attitudes toward globalized world: Accepting, Critical and Fearful. The second questionnaire assesses 4 types of threats: Technological-culture, existential - the identity threats, social and lastly systemic threats. This measure also diagnoses some types of reactions (defences) to these threats which are classified according to two dimensions: Constructive (developmental) - non-constructive (just adaptive); and psychosocial (based on interpersonal relations) - psychic (based only on psychic resources). Results indicated that technological-culture threats were the most often (in 37% of cases) chosen by participants as the most threatening for their psychological development. Also, the mean for those threats was statistically higher than other kinds of threats. Young adults with higher scores on this kind of threats had more often Critical and Fearful attitudes toward globalized world. These were more eager to use non-constructive behavior and tend to look for a support among friends (psychosocial constructive defense). The results of our research show, that even for this young group of participants, technological and cultural changes can be perceived as threats. Suggestions for future studies and proposals on how to support acculturation towards the New were presented.","[Stecko, Lukasz; Senejko, Alicja; Iwaniec, Renata] Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Stecko, L (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.",lpstecko@gmail.com; alicja.senejko@uwr.edu.pl; re.iwaniec@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,305,317,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500025,0

Instruments that measure outcomes of nutrition education programs require psychometric assessment for face validity. Survey items related to cooking experience (CE), SE, and attitude used in a school-based cooking program were assessed for face validity. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Cognitive interviews were conducted with children who had completed third to fifth grades in Northern Colorado, USA. Interviews were examined using content analysis to derive categories for children's concepts of cooking and making food and to assess survey item comprehension. Findings - In total, 24 children participated. Most were white, non-Hispanic/Latino and half had most recently completed fourth grade. Categories related to making food and cooking included foods prepared with and without a heat source, baked goods/desserts, and activities used in meal/food preparation. Most participants comprehended the survey items and provided responses that were congruent with operational definitions established from identified themes, demonstrating face validity with this sample.

This study aimed to characterize and map the horizontal and vertical variabilities of temperature and RH of air in a greenhouse with evaporative cooling. We carried out the experiment in a greenhouse with a wireless sensor network, at the College of Agricultural Engineering (FEAGRI/UNICAMP), in Sao Paulo (Brazil) (22 degrees 49'06S 47 degrees 03'40W, 635 m a.s.l.). Evaporative cooling associated with fixed shading was more effective in reducing the temperature and increasing the RH of air (-7.55 degrees C and 47%), and also featured the most heterogeneous vertical gradient (14.31 degrees C and -58%) and horizontal variability (0.84 degrees C near the fan and 1.23 degrees C and 5% close to the pad). The association of a zenithal window with evaporative cooling and mechanical ventilation affects the efficiency of the systems and, despite reducing thereby the vertical differences (2.86 degrees C and -15%), maintains the horizontal heterogeneity (1.17 degrees C and -7% near the exhauster).","[Zorzeto, T.

This paper uses choice experiments to assess farmer preferences for an eco-compensation program targeting pesticide use by rural communities in and near the Jiangsu-Yancheng Coastal Wetlands Rare Birds National Nature Reserve (JYNNR). Eco-compensation is a China-specific term encompassing many incentive-based environmental management approaches. To identify options to reconcile rural welfare improvement with conservation, data was collected from 311 rural households in and near the JYNNR assessing perceptions of the JYNNR, wetland birds, use and impact of pesticides, and preferences for contracts to mitigate pesticide impacts. Results suggest that conflict with the JYNNR is growing, and that pesticide management could be an effective entry-point for engagement. The analysis finds several options for cost-effective contracts: granting rights to leave the program without penalty and increasing share of household land enrolled significantly reduce willingness-to-accept-payment (WTA), while longer contracts and larger reductions in pesticide use increase WTA, which interact meaningfully with farmer characteristics. Providing communities with training and technical support on proper pesticide use could, under specific contract structures, be sufficient to induce 100% enrollment without subsidies.","[Bennett, Michael T.] 555 9th St,Apt 1, Brooklyn, NY 11215 USA; [Gong, Yazhen] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 59 Zhoongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane,Room 178, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Verona, Dept Business Econ, Verona, Italy",Renmin University of China; Durham University; University of Waikato; University of Verona,"Bennett, MT (通讯作者)，555 9th St,Apt 1, Brooklyn, NY 11215 USA.",bennett.michaelt@gmail.com; ygong.2010@ruc.edu.cn; riccardo.scarpa@durham.ac.uk,"Scarpa, Riccardo/C-6691-2009",,,,,,113,44,48,6,155,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

One of the main concerns related to collective arrangements is that a crowding-out effect is likely to emerge when the external intervention dominates over self-determination and self-esteem of PES participants. By contrast, when participants perceive the intervention to be supportive of existing efforts, it crowds in intrinsic motivation. We test this contested hypothesis using prefectural data from Japan's Census of Agriculture and Forestry. In order to set up a viable quasi-experimental policy evaluation, we employ a propensity score matching approach. Our empirical result suggests that financial incentives can have a positive causal effect on collective stewardship of CPRs. This means that the potential crowding-out effect, if any, is not so profound as to expunge additional extrinsic motivation provided by the government's direct payments. Another important finding is that pre-existing social cohesiveness at the community level serves as a facilitator for PES participation. It should be noted, however, that the degree of cohesiveness in rural communities is largely a byproduct of historical experience that lies outside the immediate control of the government.","[Ito, Junichi; Feuer, Hart N.; Kitano, Shinichi; Komiyama, Midori] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Div Nat Resource Econ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan",Kyoto University,"Ito, J (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Div Nat Resource Econ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",jito@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Kitano, Shinichi/0000-0002-6111-1754",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18H02284]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18H02284] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank the journal editor, Professor, Richard B.

But increased catch, which can be considered an attribute of fishery quality, may influence effort in terms of number of fishing trips. This suggests bi-directional feedback between catch and effort. In many travel cost applications little attention has been given to this endogeneity problem. In this paper we expand the application of structural equation models to address this issue by jointly estimating demand (effort) and catch functions. Using a cross-section dataset of sea bass anglers we propose two separate joint models. First, we include expected catch as an explanatory variable in the demand equation. In the second, we reverse the causality and use the expected number of fishing days as a covariate in the catch function. The two approaches produce similar model estimates, and perform better at predicting anglers' catch and effort than standard models. The findings confirm that sea bass angling is highly valued, with a consumer surplus of about (sic)282-318 per angler per day, though this is likely to be biased upwards. Furthermore higher catches result in more days fished, on average in a 2:1 ratio. Whereas on average, an additional fishing day results in 3-4 additional bass caught.","[Grilli, Gianluca; Curtis, John] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Grilli, Gianluca; Curtis, John] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Hynes, Stephen] Natl Univ Ireland, Whitaker Inst, Socioecon Marine Res Unit, Galway, Ireland; [O'Reilly, Paul] Inland Fisheries Ireland, 3044 Lake Dr,Citywest Business Campus, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Grilli, G (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.;Grilli, G (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",gianluca.grilli@esri.ie,"Grilli, Gianluca/U-7236-2019; Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018; Grilli, Gianluca/J-2553-2015","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684; Grilli, Gianluca/0000-0002-2082-4475",Inland Fisheries Ireland,Inland Fisheries Ireland,Funding from Inland Fisheries Ireland is gratefully acknowledged.

This paper analyzes the effect of enforcement decentralization from 1998 to 2011 on a range of enforcement outcomes across US states as they have been authorized to implement their own programs aligning with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In this study, we look at the association between enforcement decentralization and corresponding outcomes, namely the number of evaluations, number of detected violations, and the amount of monetary penalties. Results showed that enforcement behaviors have not changed significantly as states have assumed more enforcement responsibilities; hence, we found no evidence of a race-to-the-bottom scenario associated with RCRA decentralization.","Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Xu, Jing] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Xu, J (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",eric.sjoberg@economics.utah.edu; xuj@swufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,46,33,40,3,57,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

While there is a great deal of variation in the specific type of MPs adopted by consumers located in the same region, ANOVA results suggest that they tend to adopt a similar number of MPs as their neighbours. Using discrete choice modelling, our results suggest that this is due to the peer adoption of certain visible MPs, such as using public transport or car-pooling, encouraging agents to adopt other types of visible MPs. However, the character of this spillover is limited in that visible pro-environmental behavior does not appear to influence the adoption of non-visible MPs. We also find that social imitation patterns help individuals overcome the observed gap between their stated concern about climate change and their propensity to act on this concern, known as the climate 'value-action' gap.

Offering some form of involvement to the affected communities may reduce objections and minimise project delays. We carry out a nationally-representative survey of Irish citizens to analyse how different involvement methods affect acceptance. Ireland is a useful case study because of its high RES-E targets. Survey respondents are presented with four involvement models for the local construction of a wind farm, and two for the local development of the transmission grid. We find a preference for schemes in which people receive financial compensation without sharing in the ownership and associated risks of project development. Our econometric analyses show that socio-demographic characteristics such as age and income are significant predictors of people's acceptance under different schemes. Moreover, we find that the satisfaction with local planning procedures and the trade-off people make between environmental sustainability and economic competitiveness are consistently associated with people's attitudes. Such evidence can help policy makers better understand and design policies to minimise resistance to energy infrastructure development.","[Hyland, Marie] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland; Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Hyland, M (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland.",marie.hyland@esri.ie; valentin.bertsch@esri.ie,,"Bertsch, Valentin/0000-0001-9477-4805",Energy Policy Research Centre of the Economic and Social Research Institute,Energy Policy Research Centre of the Economic and Social Research Institute,Hyland and Bertsch acknowledge funding from the Energy Policy Research Centre of the Economic and Social Research Institute.

Water is a classic example of a resource with private and public socially-desirable benefits, which depend on its efficient allocation. Public and private institutions thus fulfil an important function by seeking to lower transaction costs in water markets. Where transaction costs are reduced, those same institutions may benefit from positive economic outcomes. However, in spite of their importance for policy performance evaluation, very few studies have investigated the impacts of transaction costs over time on the success or failure of public policy implementation and compliance. This study identifies important transaction costs and their rate of change in the world's leading water market: the southern Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. It was found that some progress towards lowering transaction costs in water markets has been achieved, particularly in respect to water allocation (temporary) transfers. However, some water entitlement (permanent) transaction costs have increased in the time-period, which may be justifiable given the inherent complexities associated with individual entitlement transfer assessments. Overall, the analysis suggests that institutional investment in water markets have improved irrigator private gains from trade.","[Loch, Adam; Wheeler, Sarah Ann; Settre, Claire] Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Loch, A (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Fac Profess, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",adam.loch@adelaide.edu.au,"Wheeler, Sarah Ann/H-4000-2017; Loch, Adam/F-4246-2013","Wheeler, Sarah Ann/0000-0002-6073-3172; Loch, Adam/0000-0002-1436-8768","Australian Research Council [DP140103946, DE150100328, FF140100773]; Australian Research Council [DE150100328] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Funding for this project is provided under Australian Research Council Discovery [DP140103946], DECRA Fellowship (DE150100328) and Future Fellowship (FF140100773) programs.

A recent study postulates that observed reductions in deforestation in three provinces of the Argentinian Dry Chaco ecoregion (namely Salta, Santiago del Estero, and Chaco) can be attributed to the effective enforcement of this law by provincial governments. Yet a more contextualized analysis of the local situation raises a number of objections to the methods used and the conclusions drawn in that study. Our analysis (and first-hand experience) shows that provincial governments were unable to enforce the Forest Law, since deforestation in protected areas continued or even increased after its approval and implementation. Our criticism can be categorized into five major challenges: (1) declining deforestation trends started before the Forest Law; (2) a province with a substantial increase in deforestation was omitted; (3) only part of one ecoregion was taken into account in the analysis; (4) deforestation percentage by conservation categories is better than hectares by province as an indicator of law enforcement; and (5) assigning zones to land units prior to land use planning processes is questionable. These challenges, and the lack of a more complete and nuanced political analysis of the situation on the ground, calls into question both the reliability of the results and the usefulness of the conclusions in the study. Ambiguous or misleading messages from the academic community can have negative political consequences and hinder local conservation efforts in the short term. We should not be so caught up in our desire to see improvements on the ground that we can't see the forest for the trees.","[Norberto Volante, Jose] INTA, Estn Expt Agr Salta, Ruta Nacl 68 Km 172, RA-4403 Cerrillos, Salta, Argentina; [Seghezzo, Lucas] Univ Nacl Salta UNSa, CONICET, Inst Invest Energia Convent INENCO, Ave Bolivia 5150,A4408FVY, Salta, Argentina",Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Seghezzo, L (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Salta UNSa, CONICET, Inst Invest Energia Convent INENCO, Ave Bolivia 5150,A4408FVY, Salta, Argentina.",volante.jose@inta.gob.ar; Lucas.Seghezzo@conicet.gov.ar,,"Seghezzo, Lucas/0000-0002-9525-5131",INTA [PNNAT 1128031]; Argentinian Agency of Scientific and Technological Promotion (ANPCyT) (Project PICTO Native Forests) [2014-0049],INTA; Argentinian Agency of Scientific and Technological Promotion (ANPCyT) (Project PICTO Native Forests),This work was supported by INTA (Project PNNAT 1128031) and the Argentinian Agency of Scientific and Technological Promotion (ANPCyT) (Project PICTO Native Forests 2014-0049).

Traditionally, averting expenditures (a revealed preference measure) have been considered a lower bound for demand relative to contingent valuation (a stated preference measure) estimates. We develop a theoretical model to show that this relationship critically depends on household perceptions. In our setting, this insight is important, because households appear to have relatively low confidence in both the reliability and quality of existing water supplies, even though water quality tests suggest that utility water is safe to drink from a microbial perspective. Averting expenditures, which reach 4% of monthly expenditures on average, include substantial purchases of non-network water sourced from water shops or tankers, as well as costs in terms of water collection time, storage and in-home treatment. In contrast, the contingent valuation responses, while correlated with coping costs, reveal low willingness to pay for increases in water reliability from the utility network. We attribute this departure from the traditional relationship between averting expenditures and contingent valuation to the lack of household confidence in the quality of utility provided water. Our study thus adds to previous evidence in the literature, which points to the importance of consumer perceptions in determining demand for environmental improvements.","[Orgill-Meyer, Jennifer] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Govt, Publ Hlth Program, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA; [Jeuland, Marc] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Albert, Jeff] Thrive Water, Austin, TX USA; [Cutler, Nathan] USAID, Washington, DC USA; [Jeuland, Marc] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Water Policy, Singapore, Singapore",Franklin & Marshall College; Duke University; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); National University of Singapore,"Orgill-Meyer, J (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Govt, Publ Hlth Program, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",jorgill@fandm.edu; marc.jeuland@duke.edu; jeff@aquaya.org,,"Meyer, Jennifer/0000-0003-2024-7935",Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC),Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC),"We would like to thank the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) for their financial support of this research.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) penalizes hospitals with higher-than-expected readmission rates. This study tracks patient-level admissions and readmissions to Florida hospitals from 2006 to 2014 to examine whether the ACA has reduced readmission effectively. We compare not only the change in readmissions in targeted conditions to that in non-targeted conditions, but also changes in sites of readmission over time and differences in outcomes based on destination of readmission. We find that the drop in readmissions is largely owing to the decline in readmissions to the original hospital where they received operations or treatments (i.e., the index hospital). Patients readmitted into a different hospital experienced longer hospital stays. The results suggest that the reduction in readmission is likely achieved via both quality improvement and strategic admission behavior.","[Chen, Min] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Chen, M (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",min.chen2@fiu.edu,,"Chen, Min/0000-0001-7490-1512",,,,,25,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

From the last century to the present, there has been a revolution in technology and its use at the workplace. Integrating technology in work tasks and the way in which a business develops, organizes and manages is not always an easy process. New organization theories and job design for solving problems with automation and workforce emphasized the need for greater engagement of the workforce in the planning of automation and the implementation of new technologies. Technological changes bring significant changes in the working conditions of employees and their daily activities. The digital revolution, the evolution from manufacturing to information technology, has influenced new tasks and workplace responsibilities. New workplace paradigms are based on constant needs for improving and accepting new knowledge in a dynamic business environment. New technologies allow these constant advancements and brings new opportunities for investment and job creation, not only in developed countries with the most sofisticated technologies, but also in many emerging and developing economies. The aim of this paper is to show through the analysis of literature how important it is to understand the impact of technological changes on job designing so that the process can be successful and properly implemented. The importance of adequately designed workplaces is multiple and contributes to performance, employee satisfaction, but also their psycho-physical condition.

We investigate levels, trends, and determinants of physical stature from the birth cohorts of the 1860s to the 1890s using data on 23,000 Filipino soldiers enlisted by the US military between 1901 and 1913. We estimate average heights and use province-level information for investigating the determinants of biological well-being. We find that at 159.3 cm (62.7 inches), the average height of soldiers born in the mid-1870s was very short even for the time. The low biological standard of living observed in late nineteenth-century Philippines was not due to the tropical disease environment alone since greater heights were recorded for the same period in other parts of Asia with a similar climate. The results also indicate a decline of more than 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) in the height of soldiers born between the early 1870s and the late 1880s. This decline occurred at a time when there was an expansion of commercial activity in cash crop production for export.

Flexibility of employment as a strategy of response based on non-standard or alternative models of employment has become an established standard in business practice. A good example of this new approach is self-employment or disguised employment. Observation of business practice suggests that companies are more and more interested in maintaining a pool of contingent workers loosely associated with traditional company structures and employed for specific tasks. In this context, the study presents an analytical evaluation of self-employment defined as a formal statement of contractual independence.

With consumers turning away from intensively produced food, developing the pasture-raised milk market could encourage farmers to continue keeping their cows on pastures. To provide insights for expanding this specialty milk market, the purpose of this paper is to, therefore, investigate the roles of personal, product-related, economic and social factors in purchasing pasture-raised milk. Design/methodology/approach - Drivers of pasture-raised milk purchases are identified and the conceptual model is tested using structural equation modelling with data from a cross-sectional study among 917 German milk consumers. Findings - Perceived price and availability barriers are the main consumption obstacles for pasture-raised milk. Besides increasing availability and reducing price premiums, processors should cater health and dietary conscious consumers by providing pasture-raised milk with unique and favourable product qualities, i.e. focussing on freshness, a rich taste or naturalness. Raising awareness for extensive husbandry systems may enhance pasture-raised milk purchases, while introducing a unified pasturing claim could help consumers to distinguish pasture-raised milk from conventional barn milk. Originality/value - This study provides dairies and marketers with valuable insight about the factors driving pasture-raised milk purchases. This information is derived from a large sample with extensive regional coverage and will thus be useful in expanding this specialty milk market and in maintaining extensive dairy production.","[Gassler, Birgit; Xiao, Qian; Kuehl, Sarah; Spiller, Achim] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Gassler, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",birgit.gassler@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"xiao, qian/IWM-0785-2023; Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022","xiao, qian/0000-0003-1463-2343;",German Research Foundation [DFG-GRK1666],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research was financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG-GRK1666).,,71,9,9,1,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Building on this framework, we analyze how merit good arguments can be helpful for discussing sustainability as justice, what challenges merit good arguments pose to future generations, and whether they can serve as a normative justification for green nudges. The analysis yields two main insights. First, a reflection on the concept of merit goods is helpful in sorting out the different justifications that sustainability interventions may rely on. In particular, it allows separating the challenges of redistribution, internalization of externalities and increasing individual consumption of particular (merit) goods such as health care or education more clearly. Second, the precise notion of merit goods by itself, however, only offers a limited contribution and does not represent a blank check to justify deviations from individual preferences.

The research analysed the legal acts regulating the implementation of support measures under the Rural Development Programme in the programming periods 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 and calculated the financial performance and competitiveness indicators (average profit margins, solvency and financial dependence) of agricultural holdings in Zemgale region, which were compared with the national averages, based on FADN statistical data. Methods of research: monographic, graphic, analysis, synthesis, statistical analysis. The analysed indicators were grouped by planning region in Latvia (the regional division of the Rural Support Service (RSS) - the Regional Agricultural Departments - was taken into account). Based on the research findings, the authors conclude that in the programming period 2014-2020 a solution is sought to retain the existing farm structure, strengthening small farms and reducing the influence of large farms on the agricultural industry. Even though public funding is focused on investment in tangible assets in the programming period 2014-2020, it is intended not only for agricultural holdings but also for forestry and food processing enterprises. The research has found that if other circumstances remain unchanged, there is no causal association between net value added and the amount of investment subsidies the reason of a decrease in both variables was the consequence of the 2008 crisis. The average financial dependence of farms in Zemgale region in the period 2007-2013 exceeded the maximum level, and the farms were considerably dependent on borrowed capital. The research developed recommendations for the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Latvia with regard to criteria for the evaluation of support project submitters, proposing excluding enterprises with high financial dependence from participation and contributing to the competitiveness of agricultural holdings and their financial independence.","[Jakusonoka, Ingrida; Lece, Elina] Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Jakusonoka, I (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Jelgava, Latvia.",Ingrida.Jakusonoka@llu.lv,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,204,211,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.137,0.0,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500025,0

In vitro test using three isolates of PSB was done to understand the synergystic character by using streak method with natrium agar medium. Subsequently, those three isolates were used for bioassay. The bioassay experiment set up as randomized factorial design, consisted of 16 treatments (control, single and consortia of three PSB isolates in two concentrations) and provided by 3 replications. The solubilized phosphate, P uptake and plant dry weight was measured at 14 days after planting The results revealed that three PSB isolates were synergistic and did not antagonistic to each other. The isolates either in single or consortia application were able to solubilize phosphate up to 23,23 ppm and increase P uptake up to 42%.

As one grows older, his/her capabilities gradually deteriorate. What need to be done to mitigate mismatch of dwelling design, and to enable age-in-place? A comparative study of design guidelines in Japan, UK and USA is conducted to find out challenges and opportunities we are faced with. In Japan, design guidelines for the ageing society were proposed in the early 1990s, and they have been used ever since in several contexts. Although they were not mandatory, policy-linked incentives have worked to some extent. In the UK, Lifetime Homes concept has been formulated, and it seems to have gained momentum with its adoption in the Approved Document M. In the USA, Fair Housing Amendment Act in 1988 [5] introduced requirements on wheelchair accessibility on rental sector, and Visitability concept, less stringent than liveability, is being adopted in some localities. Although wheelchair accessibility is not the same as design for the ageing, most of the issues are shared. What are the problems we still face with, revealed from the survey? First is the time lag between acquisition of the dwelling versus one's senior years, which sometimes extends to 40 years. Second, many of the dwellings are already built with lower standards than desirable, not as new construction. Third, home modification quite often lacks financial support through government policy. This presentation will give some proposals toward improvement over the situation.","[Kose, Satoshi] Int Assoc Univ Design, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan; [Kose, Satoshi] Shizuoka Univ Art & Culture, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan",Shizuoka University,"Kose, S (通讯作者)，2-9-4-701 Higashi Shinbashi,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1050021, Japan.",skose@gakushikai.jp,,,,,,,25,0,1,2,17,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,307,314,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-307,0.0,,,8,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371490.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100029,0

Results of the research lead to the conclusion that GRI Reporting Framework occupies a significant place in the process of social reporting both on the global scale and in activities undertaken by companies operating in Poland. This is due to the fact that it allows companies to select and disclose the most significant matters related to economic, social and environmental impacts.

A total of 47 parents were recruited to partake in a one-on-one activity which involved sorting 69 statements about weaning practices and weaning food products into a grid that was normally distributed ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Sorting was immediately followed by a short interview to understand the reasons behind the placement of particular statements. Findings Data analysis identified three statistically distinct participant attitudes towards weaning practices and foods for health that were then interpreted using the rich qualitative data from the post-sort interviews. The attitudes identified were All Homemade and Natural, Commercial Convenience and Trust and Balance and Variety. Originality/value This study identified the dominant sets of attitudes held by Malaysian parents towards weaning practices and weaning foods for health using Q-methodology. To authors' knowledge, this is the first paper focussing on weaning foods for health, specifically on functional weaning food. This new understanding of shared attitudes will allow product developers, marketers and health communicators to more effectively design their products and their marketing mix to ensure that these messages resonate well with the target audience who want to provide the best weaning foods possible for their children.","[Mohamad, Hajar] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Mirosa, Miranda; Bremer, Phil; Oey, Indrawati] Univ Otago, Dept Food Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago; University of Otago,"Mirosa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Food Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand.",miranda.mirosa@otago.ac.nz,"Bremer, Phil J/U-9140-2017; Mirosa, Miranda/L-2743-2015","Mirosa, Miranda/0000-0002-4476-3793",High-Value Nutrition New Zealand; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia,"High-Value Nutrition New Zealand; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)",The authors would like to thank High-Value Nutrition New Zealand and Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for their support in this work.,,47,0,0,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

These are predominantly in terms of unemployment, income levels and the resulting social situation and region's maturity. Migration for work could be a solution. Among other conditions, however, it primarily assumes the possibility of adequate housing. This could be ensured through rental housing. The public housing sector consists of flats and houses owned by towns and municipalities. The hired public housing sector is identical to social housing. This segment of housing is subject to a significant degree of regulation of state housing policy. Through its tools, the state regulates and corrects the construction, respectively the development of social housing and, in particular, the target population for which the type of housing is primarily intended. The negative impact of the preference of private property housing by households is low labor mobility, the risk of housing loss in case of failure to pay for the purchase of an apartment and, last but not least, the indebtedness of families and individuals over their entire decades of life. Private property housing is mainly intended for middle and higher income groups of the population. Within Slovakia, the bulk of migration for work is directed to Western Slovakia. People come from less developed regions of Slovakia especially to Braitislava and the surrounding area.

Design/methodology/approach - The approach in this paper is a systematic literature review of publications in the Web of Science, Ebsco and Pro-Quest electronic databases from 1990 (from the emergence of large-scale foreign chains in the Polish market) to 2016, as well as the results of research carried out by Polish and international research centers, food retailer groups and institutes. The paper is based on the analysis of secondary data that present the results of research carried out on the Polish food retailing market. These analyses included the development of food retailing formats operating in Poland. Findings - According to the research results analyzed, the evolution of retail formats is an embodiment of innovations introduced by retail companies and is based on the mutual permeation of elements previously associated with a specific retail format. Currently, the blurring of differences between individual retail formats can be observed in respect of two formats in particular, i.e. discount and delicatessen. The discount format occupies a special position on the Polish market, though it differs significantly from a classical discount. In discount stores so-called premium group products can be purchased, with stores more and more frequently being located in expensive places, e.g. in shopping centers or in their vicinity. At the same time, the popularity of convenience stores is increasing with a simultaneous decrease in the significance of large-format stores. Originality/value - This paper provides interesting insights into the development of food retailing formats in Poland and the influence of changes in the business environment in that process. In addition, the paper describes the specifics of the Polish market, detailing literature-based theories pertaining to the development of retailing forms. It also focuses on the perspectives and directions in the future development of retail formats.","[Rudawska, Edyta Dorota] Univ Szczecin, Inst Management & Mkt, Dept Mkt, Szczecin, Poland; [Bilinska-Reformat, Katarzyna] Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Management, Dept Mkt Management & Tourism, Katowice, Poland",University of Szczecin; University of Economics in Katowice,"Rudawska, ED (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Inst Management & Mkt, Dept Mkt, Szczecin, Poland.",edyta@rudawska.pl,"Bilińska-Reformat, Katarzyna/CAG-5454-2022","Bilińska-Reformat, Katarzyna/0000-0002-2484-9629; Rudawska, Edyta/0000-0003-4486-9456",National Science Centre in Cracow [2014/14/M/HS4/00891],National Science Centre in Cracow,"The paper is the result of an international research project grant financed by the National Science Centre in Cracow, titled: Sustainable marketing concept and its implementation in selected European markets - identification of international differences, Harmonia Funding, Registration No. 2014/14/M/HS4/00891 (Principal investigator: Prof. US Edyta Rudawska).

The assessment of technical, pure and scale efficiency of those farms during 2014-2016 was performed applying non-parametric method of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The Malmquist indices were used to measure the efficiency and productivity changes. The field crop farms based on their economic size were divided into small, medium and large. The study showed that mean technical efficiency of small farms was 83 %, medium -81 % and large - 94 %. Technical inefficiency in Lublin region occurred due to pure technical efficiency rather than scale efficiency. It means that inefficient management practices had an impact on farm performance. Therefore, in order to increase competitiveness of Polish crop field farms, it is important to improve management practices. In the studied period the share of farms operating under increasing return to scale decreases with the growth of farm size. The improvement of efficiency of those farms could be achieved by increasing their size. The result indicates that 4 % of small, 14 % of medium and 9 % of large farms were operating under a decreasing scale efficiency, which means that those farms were operating above their optimal scale and could, therefore, increase their efficiency through size reduction. In all the farms, the average annual productivity changes were below 1. The decrease was mainly due to a technological detrition of 5, 6 and 38 % respectively for large, small and medium farms.","[Syp, Alina] Inst Soil Sci & Plant Cultivat Sate Res Inst IUNG, Dept Bioecon & Syst Anal, Pulawy, Poland; [Osuch, Dariusz] Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Agr Accountancy Dept, Pulawy, Poland",Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Syp, A (通讯作者)，Inst Soil Sci & Plant Cultivat Sate Res Inst IUNG, Dept Bioecon & Syst Anal, Pulawy, Poland.",,"Syp, Alina/ABB-2243-2021","Syp, Alina/0000-0002-0190-9350; Osuch, Dariusz/0000-0002-4696-8602",National Centre for Research and Development,"National Centre for Research and Development(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland)",The studies have been supported by The National Centre for Research and Development within the project Support for low carbon agriculture - able to adapt to observed climate change in the perspective of 2030 and 2050 (acronym LCAgri).,,18,0,0,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,269,276,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.144,0.0,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500032,0

Color Vision Deficiency might have a significant impact on a users' perception of the content or the environment. There is a range of tools already available, that can be used to either aid or automate the process of readability testing for digital interfaces and content in respect to Color Vision Deficiency. Two different approaches to addressing this issue can be found. A brief review of such methodologies is provided in this paper. The first approach (user-end) attempts to solve the problem by altering mediation between the user and the content. The second (design-end) allows the designer to view an image, or color scheme altered to recreate the perceptual experience of a user affected by Color Vision Deficiency and asses the design from the perspective of a color-blind user. With an implemented proof-of-concept we investigate the potential use of Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays to employ similar methodology, to allow designers or interior decorators to experience physical environments (i.e.: classroom, library or a cafeteria) from the perspective of a color-blind person. Such tools might increase the designers' empathy towards color-blind users but also allow them to identify visual components, such as infographics or advertisement, in a physical environment that are poorly visible to color-blind users. Such tools could be developed by taking advantage of a modern Head-Mounted Displays six degrees of freedom tracking, a 360 camera and color processing filters applied during post-processing at run-time, allowing a designer to easily switch between different types of colorblindness emulation.","[Szczurowski, Krzysztof; Smith, Matt] Inst Technol Blanchardstown, Dublin, Ireland",Technological University Dublin,"Szczurowski, K (通讯作者)，Inst Technol Blanchardstown, Dept Informat, Dublin, Ireland.",krzysztof.szczurowski@student.itb.ie,,"Szczurowski, Krzysztof/0000-0002-4346-4126; Smith, Matt/0000-0002-8116-0836",ITB Post-Graduate Seed Fund,ITB Post-Graduate Seed Fund,This work was supported from ITB Post-Graduate Seed Fund,,44,1,1,1,15,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,378,389,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-378,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371498.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100036,0

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of a passive body touch experience on the perceived intensity of spiciness. Design/methodology/approach This study includes three experiments. In Experiment 1, 32 college students tasted half of one piece of spicy bean curd while sitting on either a hard wooden chair or a soft padded chair. Experiment 2 was conducted using the blindfold method to avoid the influence of visual cues on taste, keeping the other details the same as in Experiment 1. Experiment 3 was performed with two changes from Experiment 2: the participants were blindfolded immediately before entering the lab from the waiting room to completely block all visual cues for the experimental materials, and armless stools were used to eliminate the passive touch on the participants' backs. Findings All three experiments consistently found that the participants sitting on the soft padded chair or the soft armless stool perceived the spicy bean curd as significantly spicier than those sitting on the hard wooden chair or the hard armless stool. Originality/value These results preliminarily support the hypothesis that a crossmodal correspondence exists between passive body touch and sense of taste (especially spiciness, as in this study), demonstrating the importance of passive body touch and, more generally, of the touchable features in places where food is consumed, such as hotels, restaurants and bars.","[Tu, Yangjun] Hunan Univ, Sch Educ, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Ma, Chaoqun; Wu, Yueyan; Yang, Zhi] Hunan Univ, Sch Business Adm, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Hunan University,"Yang, Z (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Business Adm, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",tuyangjun@163.com; cqma1998@hnu.edu.cn; wuyueyan0204@126.com; yangmkt@126.com,,"Wu, Yueyan/0000-0002-4336-6913; tu, yangjun/0000-0001-9434-8945","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71502057]; National Natural Science Foundation of China: NSFC [71540014, 2017ZK3054]; Soft Science Key Project of Hunan Province [2017ZK3054]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China: NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Soft Science Key Project of Hunan Province,"The authors would like to acknowledge National Natural Science Foundation of China: 71502057; and National Natural Science Foundation of China: NSFC (71540014).; The funding, HNSSKP (2017ZK3054) from the Soft Science Key Project of Hunan Province, is highly related to this study and ity was also supported in part by this project.",,28,2,3,2,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate whether the presence of staff canteen in the workplace is associated with consumption of healthy food and lower systolic and diastolic BP. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional study was conducted, randomly selecting workers through a multistage sampling, stratified by company size in Brazil. Demographic, socioeconomic, and life style characteristics were evaluated, and weight, height, and BP were measured. Statistical analysis used generalized linear models, controlling for design effect and confounding factors, to assess the association between BP and staff canteen and the intake of food items. Findings In total, 4.818 workers, aged 35.410.7 years, 76.5 percent men, with 8.74.1 years of formal education were enrolled. Prevalence of hypertension was 24.7 percent (p-value <0.001) among workers from industries with staff canteen vs 30.6 percent among those with no staff canteen. Workers of industries with staff canteen consumed higher proportion of fruits, green leafy vegetables, and milk than workers of industries without canteen, and had lower systolic and diastolic BP, independently of the frequency of intake. Practical implications Workers of industries with staff canteen consumed a healthier diet, and had lower systolic and diastolic BP, and lower prevalence of hypertension than workers from workplaces without staff canteen. Originality/value This study was the first carried out among workers of industries reporting that the presence of a staff canteen in the workplace is associated with lower systolic and diastolic BP and prevalence of hypertension.","[Vinholes, Daniele B.] Fed Univ Hlth Sci Porto Alegre UFCSPA, Postgrad Studies Program Epidemiol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Machado, Carlos Alberto] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista Med, Disciplina Cardiol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Chaves, Hilton] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Clin Med, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Rossato, Sinara L.; Fuchs, Sandra C.] Fed Univ Hlth Sci Porto Alegre UFCSPA, Sch Med, Postgrad Studies Program Epidemiol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Rossato, Sinara L.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA USA; [Melo, Ione M.

The purpose of this article is to indicate what type of technology is conducive to the development of innovation and their effective use in the development of enterprise value. Empirical research was carried out using a questionnaire on a sample of 105 organisations operating in Poland that differed in terms of size, sector and ownership model. In order to examine the relationship between the nonroutine technology variable and the subjective level of innovation, regression and variation analysis was performed. All calculations were performed using SPSS packages for Windows.

A set of novel international environmental agreements (IEAs), the International Tropical Timber Agreements (ITTAs), seeks to promote both. The ITTAs encourage international trade for member nations while requiring sustainable timber practices. This paper uses the ITTAs as a case study to examine whether IEAs can lead to environmental cooperation at the same time as increasing trade. Membership in both the 1983 and 1994 ITTAs is examined for an effect on timber exports. The analysis is conducted using panel data for 165 countries between 1970 and 2011 while controlling for year fixed effects, country fixed effects and country-specific trend terms. Estimated ITTA effects vary by ITTA year, timber category and country type. Logs exports fell for both tropical and non-tropical country members, but these decreases were offset by increases in other timber category exports. Tropical country members increased plywood exports, while non-tropical country ITTA members increased exports of sawn wood and veneer sheets. Total exports of targeted timber were unaffected in non-tropical member countries, while the 1983 ITTA increased total exports for tropical countries. These results together suggest that the sustainability clauses entailed in ITTAs have not decreased total timber exports from member countries, but have shifted exports across timber categories.","[Houghton, Kendall] Univ Oregon, Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Naughton, Helen] Univ Montana, Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",University of Oregon; University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Naughton, H (通讯作者)，Univ Montana, Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",khoughto@uoregon.edu; helen.naughton@umontana.edu,,,,,,,44,4,4,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The literature has focused on three static bundling strategies under which the products are sold separately (pure components or PC) or only in a bundled form (pure bundling or PB) or both (mixed bundling or MB). In a generalization, and motivated by real world examples, this paper examines the relative effectiveness of temporal bundling. We consider a firm that sells to a market of myopic and strategic consumers, and a selling season consisting of two stages. We compare four strategies - PC-PC (i.e., pure components in each of two stages), PB-PB, PB-PC and PC-PB - relative to MB. Our results show that PB-PB maximizes profits under low marginal costs; PC-PC prevails under high marginal costs given a large proportion of myopic consumers; and PB-PC is profit maximizing under moderate marginal costs when most consumers are strategic. These temporal strategies dominate MB except when the market is comprised entirely of strategic consumers. Finally, while temporal mixed bundling - MB-MB - is weakly superior to other temporal strategies, the latter are much easier to implement, as shown by real-world uses, and suffice to capture most of the profits. Related interesting pricing implications are discussed. Three extensions to the main model are also proposed.","[Prasad, Ashutosh] Univ Texas Dallas, Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Venkatesh, R.] Univ Pittsburgh, Katz Grad Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Mahajan, Vijay] Univ Texas Austin, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Venkatesh, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Katz Grad Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",aprasad@utdallas.edu; rvenkat@katz.pitt.edu; vijay.mahajan@mccombs.utexas.edu,"Mahajan, Vijay/L-3952-2019","Prasad, Ashutosh/0000-0002-9551-085X",,,,,39,8,9,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Social democracy makes lateral transfers from producers to dependents by means of progressive taxation. Market liberalism uses financial markets to transfer financial entitlement over time. Social democracy came up against the upper limits of public expenditure in the 1970s. The 'market turn' from social democracy to market liberalism was enabled by liberalized credit in the 1980s. Much of this was absorbed into homeownership, which attracted majorities of households (and voters) in the developed world. Early movers did well, but eventually easy credit drove house prices beyond the reach of younger cohorts. Debt service diminished effective demand, which instigated financial instability. Both social democracy and market liberalism are currently in crisis.","[Offer, Avner] Univ Oxford, All Souls Coll, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Offer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, All Souls Coll, Oxford, England.",,,,,,,,0,18,20,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This study investigates how changing consumption and investment patterns affected the aforementioned increase. A series of Structural Decomposition Analyses at a global level as well as for 40 major economies is conducted. They disentangle the growth of Raw Material Consumption, which measures the extraction of materials necessary to produce a country's final demand. Data is taken from the World Input-Output Database. The results suggest that rising final demand was the predominant driver of growing Raw Material Consumption. Final demand, furthermore, shifted into countries that consume material-intensive goods, in particular due to infrastructure build-up in industrialising nations. The mix of goods in final demand slightly dematerialised. Increasing efficiency in global value chains decelerated the growth of Raw Material Consumption. The results confirm that the secular trends in structural change and technological improvements are insufficient to limit the use of materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The Empire's only major corporation reform, the 1901 law, strengthened minority shareholder rights and removed bankers from boards of directors for certain corporations. The reform offers a rare opportunity to examine the financial effects of improving corporations' principal-agent relationships through regulation, because the reform did not affect all corporations equally. Corporations affected by the reform had smaller total share capital, fewer shares, and higher par values for shares as observed in 1905. The new regulations may have increased the cost of having shareholders and hence disciplined corporations' founders to be more conservative in raising capital by issuing stock. Removing bankers from boards of directors may have removed an important source of firms' founding capital, though corporations could easily evade this provision. The results also show that, although the commercial code treated all corporations equally, there were two major groups of Russian corporations that behaved differently, and, despite the fact that corporate charters could grant individual exceptions to the commercial code, a revision in the commercial code changed corporations' behaviour.","[Gregg, Amanda G.] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Gregg, AG (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",,,,National Science Foundation; Yale MacMillan Center; Yale Program in Economic History,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Yale MacMillan Center; Yale Program in Economic History,"This research was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the Yale MacMillan Center, and the Yale Program in Economic History.

The first is failure to endogenize the labor-leisure decision when conducting benefit-cost analysis. Recognition that income generated will not remain the same pre-and-post policy results in downward bias in benefit estimation. Much more importantly, there will generally be free riding in input markets in addition to the well-known output demand revelation problem. Since even households with very high marginal values cannot individually increment public goods, too little income will be generated and too much of the income that is generated will be spent on relatively low value ordinary private goods. The ungenerated income would have all been spent on the public good, apart from general equilibrium considerations, resulting in additional and perhaps large downward bias in benefits of global climate policy. The reallocation of spending from relatively low value private goods to higher value public goods may further greatly increase willingness-to-pay for policies stabilizing global climate.

Designed and calibrated to the initial conditions of a small forest village in rural Bolivia, the model consists of: (a) an optimising agricultural household module of heterogeneous agents that make individually optimal land-use decisions based on factor endowments and market conditions; (b) an encompassing general equilibrium 'shell' module that endogenously determines wages and links the agricultural labour market and rural-urban migration rates; and (c) a novel user-controlled policy-maker module that allows the user to make 'real time' choices over a variety of public and environmental policies that in turn impact land use, welfare, and migration. Over a 20-year simulation period the results highlight trade-offs between reductions in deforestation and improvements in household welfare that can only be overcome either when international REDD payments are offered or when decentralized deforestation taxes are implemented. The sequencing of policies plays a critical role in the determination of these results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional view of the lower classes becoming increasingly vulnerable due to the loss of access to resources has been met with the revisionist view that this change was counteracted by an increase in the volume and regularity of employment due to investments and new farming practices. This article address this issue by studying the agricultural revolution in southern Sweden using aggregate data at the parish level. New micro-level data on actual harvest outcomes, supplemented by price data, make it possible to differentiate between the development of the local economy and exogenous price shocks. Our results indicate a clear mortality response to harvest fluctuations in general and to harvest failures in particular. The response differed greatly between farming regions, being strongest in the areas most dependent on grain production. The response also diminished during the agricultural revolution, indicating the increasing efficiency of the local economy. This indicates employment effects in line with the revisionist view. At the same time, vulnerability to fluctuations in prices of basic foodstuffs remained high until the second half of the nineteenth century and was also quite similar across farming regions.","[Dribe, Martin; Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick] Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, Lund, Sweden; [Dribe, Martin; Olsson, Mats; Svensson, Patrick] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Dribe, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, Lund, Sweden.;Dribe, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden.",,,"Svensson, Patrick/0000-0002-7143-416X","Linnaeus Centre for Economic Demography - Swedish Research Council; research project 'Work, production and agrarian transformation 1700-1860' - Swedish Research Council","Linnaeus Centre for Economic Demography - Swedish Research Council; research project 'Work, production and agrarian transformation 1700-1860' - Swedish Research Council","Financial support from the Linnaeus Centre for Economic Demography and the research project 'Work, production and agrarian transformation 1700-1860', both funded by the Swedish Research Council, is gratefully acknowledged.

As this arrangement relies on proper participatory conditions in order to include all relevant stakeholders, input legitimacy is crucial to achieving legitimate outcomes. However, 'stakeholding' implies that actors-recast into a specific institutional context-are sorted into new formal or informal categories. This paper scrutinizes the clean development mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol to interrogate the problematic issue of 'stakeholding'-i. e. the 'sorting' of actors-in enacting the multi-stakeholder framework. Based on an analysis of 25 CDM projects that provides insight into the widest range of participation opportunities for civil society regarding specific projects, this paper considers how certain institutional context of the Mechanism's stakeholder framework affects the involvement of civil society actors and the implications of this for balanced and fair input legitimacy. The findings suggest that, in practice, the informal corporate-induced sorting of actors into internal and external stakeholders keeps civil society actors outside the CDM's inner circle, forcing them to voice their concerns regarding specific projects via CDM insiders or through irregular channels. Furthermore, the absence of a clear definition of stakeholder in local consultations results in the inclusion of unsorted actors, destabilizing the distribution of participation opportunities. The paper concludes that recasting the deliberative principles of openness and plurality into the CDM's corporate-inspired stakeholding creates a specific institutional context that imposes more than one set of perhaps incompatible stakeholder categories while impairing input legitimacy.","[Kuchler, Magdalena] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Kuchler, M (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",magdalena.kuchler@liu.se,,"Kuchler, Magdalena/0000-0001-8110-4538",,,,,46,12,13,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We develop a state-contingent approach to the Noah's Ark problem - the problem of efficiently allocating limited funds to conserve biodiversity - and model conservation actions under uncertainty. Under the state-contingent approach, Noah will prepare for unfavorable and unexpected states of nature ex ante rather than relieving suffering ex post. Different species will be chosen for the Ark and particularly species that underpin the foundations of ecosystems. More generally, the state-contingent ranking equation justifies conservation policy that treats the cause rather than the symptom of biodiversity loss, and recommends strategies that focus on ecosystem resilience and integrity. In comparison to the standard model, the state-contingent approach leads to a more detailed and explicit allocation of resources. (JEL: Q54, Q57, Q58). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, Puerto Rico's sustainability was assessed with emergy flow dynamics from 1960 to 2013. During this period, the island shifted from an agriculture-based economy to an industrial base of manufacture and services (1960-1970). The emergy analysis indicated an exponential decline in sustainability during this period. From 1975 to 1992, the island became more industrialized and imported more goods and services. Since 1998, although more renewable production such as forest regeneration occurred, the rapid industrialization heavily relied on imported fossil fuels, goods, and services, resulting in a system that has not been self-sufficient, nor sustainable. The latest economic crisis and the most recently passed financial rescue bill represent an opportunity to redirect Puerto Rico towards a sustainable path with policies that decrease the ratio of imported y to exported emergy, and strategies that encourage efficient use of resources and local production based on the utilization of renewable sources within this U.S. territory.

The impact of sovereign defaults on real GDP growth is generally short-lived, while the impact in terms of output losses is deep and lasts long. Defaults in the period 1972-2012 show a deep and long-lasting impact compared to defaults in earlier periods. Moreover, the length of the contraction that follows a default is associated with favourable international conditions in the run-up to a default, while the depth of the contraction is associated with an expansive domestic economy in the run-up to a default. The results fit with boom-bust theories and sudden stop models.","[Menno Boonman, Tjeerd] Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Estabilidad Financiera, Direcc Anal Riesgos Macrofinancieros, Ave 5 Mayo 1 1Er Piso Col Ctr, Mexico City 06059, DF, Mexico",Bank of Mexico,"Boonman, TM (通讯作者)，Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Estabilidad Financiera, Direcc Anal Riesgos Macrofinancieros, Ave 5 Mayo 1 1Er Piso Col Ctr, Mexico City 06059, DF, Mexico.",tboonman@banxico.org.mx,"Boonman, Tjeerd/AAD-3794-2019",,,,,,44,2,2,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Sustainable scale, just distribution, and efficient allocation are its constitutive theoretical goals. This paper is a critique of the theoretical foundations of steady-state economics. It argues that steady-state economics consists in an attempt to squeeze neoclassical economics into a biophysical and ethical corset. As a result, many fundamental flaws and criticisms of neoclassical economics remain. As a consequence, steady-state economics does not lead to a radical departure from, or improvement upon, neoclassical theory but rather to fundamental internal inconsistencies between the 'old' economics paradigm and 'new' progressive ecological economic thinking. Contradictions appear at various levels ranging from ontology and methodology to theory and values. As Daly has pioneered the foundations of ecological economics with his thinking, these ambiguities are not only problematic for steady-state economics but ecological economics as a field more generally. The paper concludes that ecological economics has to let go of neoclassical foundations as they contradict its core values and ambitions. A new and consistent theory of political economy of the environment along heterodox lines is needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To this extent, we analyze a large international sample of firms in chemicals, oil, gas, and coal with respect to several environmental indicators in relation to financial performance for the period 2002-2013. We find that these firms have significantly higher scores on environmental performance efforts than other firms. We use a simultaneous equations system to identify the direction of the relationship between environmental and financial performance of the firms. We find that environmental outperformance has no impact on financial performance for chemical firms, reduces returns and risks for coal companies, has a mixed impact on returns in oil and gas, and reduces financial risks for oil and gas firms. Financial outperformance reduces environmental performance in all fossil fuel (sub)industries investigated. Our findings mainly support the opportunistic view regarding the impact of financial returns, which holds that financial performance negatively impacts social performance. Regarding financial risk, we find support for the stakeholder perspective where good environmental performance is beneficial from a finance perspective. We conclude to substantial differences in the environmental-financial performance relationship along fossil fuel firms in different subindustries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is considered evidence that biodiversity is undervalued. Biodiversity valuation is accordingly a prominent issue in the literature. Economic valuations are, however, largely criticized. Numerous alternatives have been introduced. Most of them involve participatory protocols aimed at producing high-quality results. Being time-consuming and expensive, it is difficult to implement and reproduce them at a large scale. We produce an easily reproducible, inexpensive survey methodology to measure impartial preference for biodiversity. We implement it in Switzerland through a mail-based survey. Our result is that biodiversity should be ranked after retirement schemes and public transportation, but before relations with foreign countries, order and security, and culture and leisure in the expanses of the State. Current expenses therefore substantially underestimate the value that Swiss people grant to biodiversity. Our new method is a viable alternative to standard economic valuation. Given the impartiality achieved, at least in the Swiss political context our estimate can be used by decision makers to assess the legitimacy of conservation programs or to gauge public support. At a philosophical level, our measure is relevant for public policies because it captures the stances that people take when they participate in public decisions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thereby, this paper contributes to the discussion in favour of a non-private regulation of ethical food labels (FLs). Moreover, the paper provides information about the consumer behaviour of the German buying public. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical analysis is based on homescan panel data of 13,000 representative German households, which includes actual purchase data of ground coffee, single-serve coffee, espresso, and tea for a five-year sample period from 2004 to 2008. As a methodological approach, the hedonic technique is used to model coffee and tea prices as a function of time, store, and product characteristics. Findings - Regarding the variables of interest branding a product leads to an average price premium of 22.1 per cent, while the organic FL achieves an average price premium of 34.3 per cent. The highest average price premium of 43.1 per cent is ceteris paribus paid for fairtrade labels. In the case of fairtrade labels, tea products earn the highest implicit prices with 74.0 per cent, followed by ground coffee (54.9 per cent), espresso (24.7 per cent), and single-serve coffee (18.9 per cent). Originality/value - The present analysis supplements the discussions around the willingness to pay for fairtrade certified products by the German buying public, a product differentiation between coffee products and the introduction of labelled tea. As the data set includes daily purchases, it allows analysis of consumer behaviour on a disaggregated level, given detailed information on prices, stores, origins, FLs, and so on.","[Bissinger, Katharina; Leufkens, Daniel] Justus Liebig Univ, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Bissinger, K (通讯作者)，Justus Liebig Univ, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Giessen, Germany.",Katharina.M.Bissinger@agrar.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,45,26,28,4,57,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Questionnaire survey, comparison of the results with the results of other surveys carried out by reputable companies and comparison of the current use of maturity models were used to process the paper. The organization is ideal in project management when it creates an environment in which there is a continuous flow of successfully managed projects whose success is measured in the interest of the organization as well as the project (customer - user of the project outputs). Maturity or excellence of the organization in project management cannot be achieved without a strategic planning. Achievement of particular level of project management maturity is dependent mainly on the type of the business, the interests of the entrepreneurs and many other factors. It is important that the entrepreneurships determine their own maturity level.

Design/methodology/approach - Six focus groups of six consumers each (n = 36) were used to assess four concept designs for a manuka honey cordial product. The focus groups were used to rank the design concepts and to generate specific consumer-driven recommendations to develop/improve each of the designs. A new version of each design was then developed using these recommendations. The eight designs (four original and four improved) were tested together, using a quantitative field experiment at a supermarket in the area from which the focus group sample was drawn. Findings - The results showed that the focus group rankings of the four original designs were largely predictive of the outcomes of the field trial. The improved designs also consistently outperformed their original equivalents in the field trials. Very large improvements were recorded with respect to the weaker original designs. Research limitations/implications - The research only studied a single product type. However, the results demonstrate that focus group outcomes can be extended onto larger populations if the focus group sample is large enough. Practical implications - These results support the use of consumer focus groups as a research input to package graphic design development. Originality/value - Focus groups are used regularly in research where the applicability of their results to larger populations is assumed. This is the first research to formally test that assumption.","[Hamlin, Robert P.] Univ Otago, Dept Mkt, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Gin, Michael; Nyhof, Fiona] Univ Otago, Dept Food Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Bogue, Joe] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Cork, Ireland",University of Otago; University of Otago; University College Cork,"Hamlin, RP (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Mkt, Dunedin, New Zealand.",rob.hamlin@otago.ac.nz,,"Bogue, Joe/0000-0002-2359-3377",,,,,58,2,2,2,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

It also investigates the moderating roles of attention to social comparison information (ATSCI) and the education level. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey sent to customers who are patronizing luxury restaurants in the US 317 empirical data analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling. Findings - Third-party certification facilitated patrons' positive evaluation of food and service quality. In addition, this positive evaluation fostered trust in the restaurant. Finally, ATSCI and the education level had significant moderating effects on the relationship between third-party certification and patrons' trust in the restaurant. Originality/value - This study proposes risk-reducing effect of third-party certification on the luxury-restaurant business. Third-party certification is employed as a mechanism for communicating restaurant quality in food and service to patrons. Both stakeholders and patrons in the restaurant industry can obtain benefits from the third-party certification because it minimizes uncertainties and information asymmetries in luxury restaurants' quality and service, and thus generating likelihood of WOM intentions.","[Jun, Jinhyun] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Travel Ind Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kang, Juhee] Univ Cent Florida, Rosen Coll Hospitality Management, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Hyun, Sunghyup Sean] Hanyang Univ, Sch Tourism, Seoul, South Korea",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Hanyang University,"Hyun, SS (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Sch Tourism, Seoul, South Korea.",sshyun@hanyang.ac.kr,"kang, juhee/ABA-3343-2021","kang, juhee/0000-0003-3590-7262",,,,,104,22,25,1,46,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Because of this, it is considered the traditional country of emigration. The Croatian people have been displaced over the world. Emigration began in the 15th century, and continued until the present day. The largest number of those who once left Croatia not ever come back. There are numerous examples where Croatian emigrants organized strong emigrant groups. Those groups strive to maintain Croatian identity and help their country in any way. Thanks to globalization significantly increased opportunities for mobility. Unlike the emigrant waves of the past century, today the main emigrants are highly educated young people. There are a number of reasons why people want to emigrate. Some leave in search of a better life, for a better standard of living, some for jobs, some to return to their native country to their families, some to study etc. Regardless on the type of migration is a word they directly affect human rights, national sovereignty, but also the economic development of each country. The role of the emigration has always had great importance in the economic development of their home country because a large portion of emigrant's remains connected with their home country and through engagement in different organizations or associations, but also through concrete assistance, which sending family members who remained in the country. At the time of economic crisis, the role of emigration takes on even greater importance. Then is especially noticed how large economic and financial assistance from Croatian emigrants to economy activity in Croatia is. This work focuses on the economic contribution of Croatian emigrants. The aim of this paper is to present the situation of displaced Croatian emigrants and considering that determine in which way they contribute to homeland. Special attention focuses on economic assistance and how much is its role in times of economic crisis.

Design/methodology/approach - A randomized block and factorial 3 x 3 experimental designs with three replications were used for the studies of solvent extraction, microencapsulation of natural vanilla extract and stability of microencapsulated vanilla powder. Findings - Ethanol concentration and ratio of vanilla to ethanol had positive effects on vanillin content. The extraction with 55 percent ethanol and the ratio of vanilla pods to ethanol as 1: 4 provided the highest vanillin content of 341.23 mg/100 mL of the extract. The amount of vanilla extract and kneading time gave significant (p < 0.05) effect on the microencapsulation efficiency (ME). The greatest ME found was 94.50 percent when 9 percent vanilla extract and 10 min of kneading time were used. The interaction of temperature and water activity gave significant effect on the second-order kinetic reaction of encapsulated vanilla powder (p < 0.05). The most suitable condition of storage was 35 degrees C with a(w) of 0.64, providing the kinetic constant (k) of 0.0024, and correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.92 with l(half-life) of 4.54 weeks.

The knowledge, skills and inclinations of the European workforce are a major factor in the EU's innovation, productivity and competitiveness. The debate over learning a new language is often a heated one. Language can be seen as a mechanism for integration and acculturation. In order to participate fully in the national and social life of the country, immigrants use linguistic signs and symbols. French is considered a very important socioeconomic factor in the process of socialization of migrants. Digital society implies not only a transformation of the traditional way of living and the economic, industrial, educational and labor changes but also alternation of a personal and individual way of living and the question of the new partnership in education. The aim of this study is to determine the perception of students about investing in the education of migrants in learning French as a foreign language, to explain the necessity of development of socio-economic competences of migrants, to determine which socio-economic competences migrants need to acquire in order to integrate and to enter the working world. This research could be an example to the developing economy of Eastern Croatia, particularly for strengthening the impact of the support of entrepreneurial institutions that help the development of the economy of education in order to determine the schism between the labor market needs and the creation of new professions. The study was conducted on N = 104 students of the University of Toulouse in France. The research was conducted during the winter semester in the academic year 2016/2017, from 11th of November until 17th of January. Research results show that students feel that it is necessary to invest in the education of migrants in order to prevent the destruction of (inter) national identity, as well as to facilitate the realization of the process of socialization and to reduce unemployment. Learning French as a foreign language is the key factor for Europe and especially Eastern Croatia for the development of human capital, socio-economic competences and also for the development of management of the human potential. Considering this, studying French language in Eastern Croatia could have a major role as a possible factor in preventing high unemployment and emigration from Eastern Croatia.","[Mueller, Mirela] Univ Osijek, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Pedag, Osijek, Croatia; [Vizentaner, Lea] Univ Osijek, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Hist, Dept English Language & Literature, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Müller, M (通讯作者)，Univ Osijek, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Pedag, Osijek, Croatia.",mtolic@ffos.hr; lea.vizentaner@gmail.com,"Müller, Mirela/IUQ-5334-2023",,,,,,11,0,0,1,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,393,400,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500037,0

The purpose of this paper is to describe adolescents' perceptions about different messages and their sources and to explore the trust they place in such sources. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 31 adolescents aged 15-16 years participated in role-playing with subsequent focus group interviews. A qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings - The adolescents depicted an everyday life with multiple and different messages about food and eating. In addition, they stated that these messages were conveyed by a wide range of sources at different levels, for example, by parents, teachers, sports coaches and media. The messages from different sources were conflicting and covered many different perspectives on food and eating. When negotiating food choices in the role-playing and in the focus group discussing how to handle different and conflicting messages, trust became visible. The trustworthiness of messages and trust in their sources were associated with several important aspects in regard to whether or not the messages were based on knowledge about food and nutrition, care for the person receiving the messages, and/or commercial interest. In addition, the results indicate that the situation and the social relationship to the person providing the message were of importance for trustworthiness. Originality/value - This study is novel as it uses role-playing as a research method and describes the trust adolescents place on food messages and their sources. To understand the factors that enhance such trust is important for the development and provision of education, information, and other health-promotion activities related to food in order to support and strengthen adolescents' critical reflections on food messages from different sources.","[Rendahl, Jenny; Korp, Peter; Ekstrom, Marianne Pipping; Berg, Christina] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Food & Nutr & Sport Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Rendahl, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Food & Nutr & Sport Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.",jenny.rendahl@gu.se,,,,,,,43,5,5,1,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Moench.] photosynthesize at a high rate due to a CO2 concentration mechanism (CCM) that accumulates CO2 to saturating concentrations around the carboxylation site of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Transport of CO2 inside a leaf and, therefore, the CCM, is affected by leaf microstructure. Gas transport models with a realistic leaf microstructure help to assess the significance of anatomical features of C-4 plants quantitatively for effective CCM. One-and two-dimensional gas transport models, when applied to analyze the gas diffusion in leaves, understate the three-dimensional nature. Here, we present the first 3D reaction-diffusion model for photosynthesis of a C-4 leaf. Equations of CO2 transport and bicarbonate diffusion combined with a biochemical model of C-4 photosynthesis were discretized over the 3D geometry of a maize leaf tissue. The model could describe the trends in responses of photosynthesis to light and CO2. The CO2 profile in the leaf microstructure was highly heterogeneous. The model suggests that rapid diffusion of CO2 to mesophyll cytosol is essential to achieve a high rate of photosynthesis.","[Retta, M. A.; Ho, Q. T.; Verboven, P.; Berghuijs, H. N. C.; Nicolai, B.

Design/methodology/approach - In all, 53 restaurateurs who participated in healthy restaurant initiatives in Korea responded to a survey. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to reveal the influences of perceived innovation characteristics (PICs), attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) on the intention to sustain a healthy restaurant. Findings - The results showed that PBC, attitudes toward healthy restaurants, relative advantage for restaurants, and complexity among PICs were significant influences on the intention to sustain healthy restaurant initiatives. Research limitations/implications - This research has made the first attempt to evaluate healthy restaurant initiatives using the perspectives of restaurateurs who actually participated in healthy restaurant initiatives. Also, this study extends the research model testing behavior intention using the theory of planned behavior and the innovation adoption theory to investigate the influences on restaurateur intentions to sustain healthy restaurant initiatives. Practical implications - The findings indicate that operators must have access to sufficient technical resources and a sense of self-efficacy, which encourage restaurateurs to maintain healthy restaurant initiatives. Enhancing positive attitudes and the relative advantages of the healthy restaurant initiatives also encouraged participation. Finally, voluntary and continuous participation and expansion of healthy restaurant initiatives require community and government support, a simple use of process to change, and a good understanding of the relative advantages of healthy restaurant initiatives. Originality/value - This study first illustrates the factors that best explain the intention to sustain a healthy restaurant from the perspective of restaurateurs. PICs shed light on how complexity and relative advantage for customers helps predict intentions to sustain healthy restaurant initiatives.","[Seo, Sunhee (Sunny); Lee, Hyunjeong] Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Seo, S (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",SEO@EWHA.AC.KR,,,,,,,47,8,10,1,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The Student t-test and analysis of variance and linear regression were used for statistical analysis. Findings - Although the overall percentages of mean score for knowledge (77.66 percent) and self-reported practice (70.77 percent) were good, there was a low level of awareness and self-reported practice in some subsections such as optimal heating/cooling temperature, proper thawing techniques and eating raw egg. Female and married respondents had significantly higher mean knowledge score than males (p < 0.001) and singles (p = 0.04). Residents of regional areas acted more safely than capital city residents (p = 0.01). Research limitations/implications - Despite the good knowledge of some respondents regarding food safety, their food safety practices were poor. It can thus be suggested that the future studies have better focus on investigating the perceived barriers of consumers about food safety practices. Practical implications - Although the mean knowledge and practice regarding food safety of Iranian consumers was good, yet there is the lack of knowledge and practice on some important factors related to food poisonings such as eating raw or lightly cooked egg or improper heating/thawing practices. So, it is important to develop proper food safety education programs emphasizing on these issues. According to lower food safety knowledge and practice of low-educated, single and male respondents, the educational programs should mainly focus on these groups. Originality/value - For the development of effective food safety education programs in Iran, learning about the basic knowledge and practice of consumers is essential; however, there is limited data that directly tackles this issue in Iran.","[Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Fac Management & Med Informat, Tabriz Hlth Serv, Management Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Nikniaz, Leila] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Tabriz Hlth Serv, Management Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Sadeghi-Bazargani, Homayoun] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Fac Hlth, Rd & Traff Injury Res Ctr, Dept Stat & Epidemiol, Tabriz, Iran; [Farahbakhsh, Mostafa] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Psychiat & Behav Sci, Tabriz, Iran; [Nikniaz, Zeinab] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Liver & Gastrointestinal Dis Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran",Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science,"Nikniaz, Z (通讯作者)，Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Liver & Gastrointestinal Dis Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran.",nikniazz@tbzmed.ac.ir,"Nikniaz, Leila/M-5747-2017; nikniaz, zeinab/L-5912-2017; Farahbakhsh, Mostafa/F-3748-2018; Sadeghi-Bazargani, Homayoun/M-5522-2017; Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh/L-5036-2017","Nikniaz, Leila/0000-0003-2951-936X; nikniaz, zeinab/0000-0001-6522-1048; Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh/0000-0002-1458-8672",Tabriz Health Services Management Research Center at the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences,Tabriz Health Services Management Research Center at the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences,The authors wish to thank the Tabriz Health Services Management Research Center at the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and Eastern Azerbaijan Governor General for financial support.,,22,11,11,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Disregarding the inevitable biological variation between fruit, von Bertalanffy (1938) described the growth, expressed as length, of virtually any living organism. The model is here extended to include the variation between individuals in a batch. Using this extended model, fruit size and its variation can be predicted, using measurements of a large number of fruit at a single point during early development. The diameter of 200 tomatoes was measured 15 days after full bloom (DAFB). Using the density function derived from the extended von Bertalanffy model, and applying prior knowledge of some of the model parameters, the variation in size at harvest could be predicted. Validation of the results was obtained by comparing the predicted sizes with the diameters of the same tomatoes at harvest.","[Tijskens, L. M. M.; Schouten, R.

We estimate discrete choice models to evaluate farmers' preferences for perennial attributes of pigeon pea intercropped with maize in central and southern Malawi. Pigeon pea is a nitrogen-fixing leguminous crop, which has the potential to ameliorate soil fertility problems related to continuous maize cultivation, which are common in Southern Africa. Adoption of annual pigeon pea is relatively low but perennial production of pigeon pea may be more appealing to farmers due to some of the ancillary benefits associated with perenniality. We model perennial production of pigeon pea as a function of the attributes that differ between annual and perennial production: lower labor and seed requirements resulting from a single planting with multiple harvests, enhanced soil fertility and higher levels of biomass production. The primary tradeoff associated with perennial pigeon pea intercropped with maize is competition with maize in subsequent years of production. While maize yield is approximately twice as valuable to farmers as pigeon pea yield, we find positive yet heterogeneous demand for perenniality driven by soil fertility improvements and pigeon pea grain yield.

Findings - Media richness has a significant positive effect on consumers' trust and that this effect is moderated by online review length. Meanwhile, perceived risk conveys the interaction effect of the media richness of online product presentation and online review length to trust. Practical implications - E-commerce websites should aim to promote organic food by using a variety of online product presentation formats and by presenting high quality online reviews in order to reduce consumers' perceived risk and improve their degree of trust when buying online. Originality/value - This paper provides a new insight into consumers' attitude of buying organic food online. The results of the research could provide proposals for promoting organic food sales online.","[Yue, Liuqing] Hunan Agr Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yue, Liuqing; Liu, Yongmei] Cent S Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wei, Xuhua] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Management, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China",Hunan Agricultural University; Central South University; Lanzhou University,"Liu, YM (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",liuyongmei_209@163.com,"liu, yongmei/AAE-4513-2019","Yue, Liuqing/0000-0001-8414-6127; /0000-0002-5552-4659","Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [14YJC630180]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71602080, 71771219]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [17LZUJBWZD013]",Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research was supported by the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (Grant Number 14YJC630180), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Numbers 71602080, 71771219), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (17LZUJBWZD013).",,63,24,24,14,131,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design of the relief network has a significant impact on the effective performance of disaster response operations. For considering both the uncertainty and dynamism of the decision-making environment, a comprehensive scenario-based robust approach embedded in the rolling horizon framework is proposed. The proposed mixed-integer linear programming model is inspired by a real case study of a disaster management in Iran, which aims to minimize the total cost of network management. Furthermore, restorative strategies are considered to increase the efficiency and robustness of the proposed relief network under disaster. To tackle the proposed optimization model, a heuristic solution algorithm is adopted. The results indicate that the proposed robust relief network provides an affordable access to its demand points in a sustainable manner under disaster. In addition, extensive computational results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model in dealing with the considered disaster management issues.","[Hasani, Aliakbar] Shahrood Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Shahrood, Iran; [Mokhtari, Hadi] Univ Kashan, Dept Ind Engn, Fac Engn, Kashan, Iran",Shahrood University of Technology; University Kashan,"Hasani, A (通讯作者)，Shahrood Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Shahrood, Iran.",aa.hasani@shahroodut.ac.ir; Mokhtari_ie@kashanu.ac.ir,"Mokhtari, Hadi/GXW-0946-2022","Mokhtari, Hadi/0000-0002-5297-5841",,,,,48,20,20,1,38,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0038-0121,,,SOCIO-ECON PLAN SCI,Socio-Econ.

Yet ICs tend to be located in remote areas where deforestation would be limited regardless of who manages them. Therefore, to determine whether IC management actually cuts forest carbon emissions, it is important to control for such confounding factors. To that end, we use propensity score matching and regression to analyze the effects on 2001-2013 deforestation and forest carbon emissions of IC management in the Amazon regions of Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador and Colombia. We find that IC management reduces both deforestation and forest carbon emissions in Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia. We are not able to discern a statistically significant effect in Ecuador.

This article examines this question by embedding the possibility in a historically substantiated demographic-economic model, supported by both cross-section and long time series evidence. Persistent high mortality and powerful mortality shocks in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries lowered life expectations. Subsequently increased life expectancy reduced the number of births necessary to achieve a given family size. Fewer births were achieved by a higher age at first marriage of females. Later marriage not only constrained population growth but also provided greater opportunities for female informal learning, especially through service'. In a period when the family was the principal institution for socializing future workers, such learning was a significant contributor to the intergenerational transmission and accumulation of human capital. This article shows how, over the centuries, the gradual induced rise of human capital raised productivity and eventually brought about the industrial revolution. Without the contribution of late marriage to human capital accumulation broadly interpreted, real wages in England would not have increased strongly in the early nineteenth century and would have been much lower than actually achieved for several centuries.","[Foreman-Peck, James; Zhou, Peng] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Foreman-Peck, J (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",foreman-peckj@cardiff.ac.uk; zhoup1@cardiff.ac.uk,"Zhou, Peng/ABI-2373-2020","Zhou, Peng/0000-0002-4310-9474; foreman-peck, james/0000-0001-9826-5725",,,,,103,20,20,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Subsequent research has disputed this consensus, although uncertainty remains on key details of slave diet, labour, and demography. As an alternative welfare measure, this study examines the reported heights of detained runaway slaves and ex-slaves held between 1788 and 1838 at workhouses on Jamaica, the most important British West Indian colony. Analytical challenges arise through the limited age data. Also, a disproportionate share of the detainees had an urban background. However, these problems can be overcome with help from local estate records and from eastern Caribbean anthropometric evidence. The mean stature of Jamaica-born adult detainees clearly rose during the period, and they gained a widening height advantage relative to their Africa-born counterparts. This offers a useful indicator of trends for the enslaved population at large. The workhouse material confirms old school' judgements that substantive amelioration occurred, as a course of deliberate slaveholder policy.","[Ward, J.

While in the boom years, hinterlands and rural areas experienced higher growth, urban core areas have done better during the recession years. I then test three strands of explanations for local growth differences: (i) the role of the local sectoral composition, (ii) the role of human capital, and (iii) the role of access to urban core areas.

Effective environmental management in the Eurasian Economic Union requires cooperation with the European Union using its experience in the field of environmental activities and implementing its international policies. EurAsEC needs to develop its own programs aimed at saving the environment, modernization of environmental legislation, promotion of activities aimed at environmental preservation in addition to relevant prohibitions and sanctions. Special attention should be given to utilization of industrial and consumption waste, since it jeopardizes the environment. The authors of this study summarized the information regarding environmental issues in member states of the Eurasian Economic Union, the EU experience in addressing environmental issues and the international legislation related to the environmental activities. In addition, the study provides practical recommendations, which in the case of their practical application will promote environmental restoration in the Eurasian Economic Union.

Affected counties are sorted based on disaster intensity and are carefully matched to similar counties that did not experience a disaster. A difference-in-difference estimator compares trends of affected counties' postdisaster business establishments, employment, and payroll to counterfactual trends in the matched counties. All affected counties experienced short-run drops in economic activity that was particularly noticeable in higher-intensity disasters. In the longer run, less distressed counties returned to their estimated counterfactual trends, but counties with lower predisaster socioeconomic conditions still lagged in growth, particularly in cases of lower-intensity disasters.

The public goods dimension of environmental services renders privatization and trading challenging. To illustrate the key issues involved, a series of privatization efforts and market creations are reviewed. Despite the focus on privatization, the empirical material shows that the role of the state is still very pronounced. It defines the commodities and property rights, and plays a key role in setting up and regulating the markets. In the case of payments for ecosystem services, public authorities even appear as the dominant 'trader'. Privatization and markets may reduce costs of delivering the service, while this is not universally true. Moreover, the service delivered often is transformed to make trade possible. Finally, high transaction costs may prohibit the creation of markets. The conflict between public goods delivery and private profit motive makes public control both important and difficult. Finally, several distributional issues following this neo-liberal development are highlighted.","[Vatn, Arild] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Fac Landscape & Soc Landsam, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, Noragr NMBU, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Vatn, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Fac Landscape & Soc Landsam, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragr, Noragr NMBU, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",arild.vatn@nmbu.no,,,,,,,93,56,59,3,57,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In this paper, we contend that most studies on the sustainability of these certifications take the objectives of voluntary standard-setting and certifying arrangements as the reference point, thereby implicitly accepting a problem definition that is not necessarily aligned with the needs, interests and preferences of the smallholder producers in a developing context. Based on the results of a four years research project on coffee and palm oil smallholders and certifications in Indonesia, this paper questions the transformative capacity of the standards and certifications regarding a more sustainable agricultural production. This capacity is located at the interface of the global demands, which are channeled down from the top of the value chain, and the local context where local producers take their decisions. Based on the empirical research it is argued that voluntary standards and certifications pave the way for a more sustainable agricultural production, but are not necessarily the right way forward to a more systemic change.","[Glasbergen, Pieter] Int Ctr Integrated Assessment & Sustainable Dev I, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Glasbergen, P (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Integrated Assessment & Sustainable Dev I, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",pieter.glasbergen@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,,Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences [SPIN3- JRP - 21]; Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia,Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences; Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia,"The research project on which this paper is based was made possible by a grant from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (SPIN3- JRP - 21) (KNAW) and the Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia.

The tractor was a labor-saving technology by virtue of its speed of operation, reducing labor input per acre. During the same decade, immigration policies of the USA and Canada diverged sharply. While the USA implemented immigration quotas, Canada admitted large flows of Eastern Europeans, provided their destination was the Prairie West. With the essentially homogeneous nature of the plain on either side of the international border, this divergence in policy sets up a natural experiment that allows us to test the effects of different changes in labor supply on the adoption of labor-saving agricultural technology. We show that although Canadian farmers had earlier adopted tractors at the same rate as farmers in the USA, the relatively slower rate of adoption of the tractor on the Canadian Prairies following the policy divergence can be attributed to Canada's shift to a more open immigration policy. We conclude that changes to macro-policies can have unexpected consequences as illustrated by this example of tractor diffusion.","[Lew, Byron; Cater, Bruce] Trent Univ, Dept Econ, Peterborough, ON, Canada",Trent University,"Lew, B (通讯作者)，Trent Univ, Dept Econ, Peterborough, ON, Canada.",blew@trentu.ca,,,,,,,80,4,6,1,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2018,12.0,2,,,,,181,218,,10.1007/s11698-016-0157-2,0.0,,,38,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,GD3BD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430376700001,0

In spite of its water scarcity, the state of Arizona permits as much as 73% of its water to be consumed by a single sector, crop production. Since 79% of such crop production is not consumed in Arizona, it corresponds to exporting up to 67% of the water available in the state to the rest of the country and abroad. It has certain and glooming consequences on the availability of water for a state expected to see its population grow and its climate get drier. Based on input-output techniques, we simulate three scenarios aiming at saving 19% of the water available, a figure set by the first of them based on improving the efficiency of the current irrigation system. The same savings could also be reached by a twenty-seven-fold increase in the price of water or a 19.5% reduction in crop exports. Estimates indicate that the least costly solution is a more efficient irrigation system while export reduction is the second-best choice.","[Bae, Jinwon] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Dall'erba, Sandy] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Dall'erba, Sandy] Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Arizona; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Dall'erba, S (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Dall'erba, S (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",dallerba@illinois.edu,"BAE, JINWON/AAM-6695-2020; Dall'erba, Sandy/AAR-3267-2020","Dall'erba, Sandy/0000-0002-1920-6100","USDA NIFA Hatch [1006816]; Renewable Energy Network, Water, Environmental and Energy Solutions Initiatives; NIFA [1006816, 812788] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","USDA NIFA Hatch; Renewable Energy Network, Water, Environmental and Energy Solutions Initiatives; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Financial support from USDA NIFA Hatch (grant 1006816) and from the Renewable Energy Network, Water, Environmental and Energy Solutions Initiatives is gratefully acknowledged.",,55,33,35,2,73,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

However, it is the first to possess all three of these attributes simultaneously. For this reason, the Bristol Pound has been heralded by some as marking a new era for local currency-driven localisation. To explore the Bristol Pound's impact on localisation, 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with businesses and other Bristol Pound stakeholders. Economists were also interviewed to gain insights into the barriers to localisation and the likely impact of a CLC on these barriers. Overall, our findings suggest that the Bristol Pound is not driving localisation. Many of the key barriers were found to be political/institutional in nature (e.g. support for free trade, the free movement of capital, the power of global corporations, and the expansionary logic of capitalism). Such barriers are unlikely to be influenced by a CLC. We therefore suggest that those pursuing localisation should engage in a more active agenda that aims to change government policy and institutions to support an equitable, sustainable economy.","[Marshall, Adam P.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Business Sch, Inst Pl Management, All St Campus,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [O'Neill, Daniel W.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Leeds,"Marshall, AP (通讯作者)，Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Business Sch, Inst Pl Management, All St Campus,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England.",a.marshall@mmu.ac.uk,"O'Neill, Daniel W./AGZ-3370-2022","O'Neill, Daniel W./0000-0002-0790-8295; Marshall, Adam P./0000-0002-8364-2281",,,,,42,24,25,1,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

First, the EPA disclosed toxicity information on the chemicals listed in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). Second, it grouped 17 of the TRI chemicals in the 33/50 voluntary program and challenged firms participating in this program to aggressively reduce their aggregate emissions. Firms therefore faced twin signals: focus on the most toxic chemicals, and focus on 33/50 targeted chemicals. We use a novel set of instruments to estimate the causal effects of these twin signals on chemical releases of U.S. manufacturing firms during the life of the 33/50 program (1991-1995), and after the program ended (1996-2013). We examine both raw emissions (in pounds) and weighted emissions (weighted by toxicity scores) of both 33/50-targeted and non-targeted chemicals. We find that 33/50 program participants reduced weighted emissions of 33/50-targeted chemicals only, with no effects on raw emissions or non-targeted chemicals. We also find that these reductions persisted after the program ended in 1995. These results suggest that firms are not unconditional greenwashers or environmental stewards. Rather, firms strategically invest resources to pursue environmental stewardship while taking into account multiple signals from their key stakeholders such as the EPA.","[Phi Cong Hoang] Univ Georgia, 148 Brooks Hall,310 Herty Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [McGuire, William] Univ Washington, Box 358436,1900 Commerce St, Tacoma, WA 98402 USA; [Prakash, Aseem] Univ Washington, 39 Gowen,Box 353530, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Washington; University of Washington Tacoma; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"McGuire, W (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Box 358436,1900 Commerce St, Tacoma, WA 98402 USA.",phihoang@uga.edu; wmcguire@uw.edu; aseem@uw.edu,,,,,,,64,9,10,3,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

However, there is an enormous contradiction in the country between what is discussed in scientific theory and what government measures are actually doing in practice. In this work, we discuss Brazil's conservationist aspirations under a human and social aspect, which the scientific view of natural scientists seldom explores: the historical materialist conception. From this analysis, we argue that current scientific efforts are important, but merely palliative, because at the heart of capitalist society the logic of value precedes any political decision making of the state. Therefore, the analysis of Brazilian biodiversity conservation under the premises of historical materialism elucidates with more clarity the forces that are at play in the country to inform the practice of conservation. This is a way of understanding the relatively ineffective role that science and technology has had in the permanent control of environmental destruction in Brazil.","[Frota, Augusto] Univ Estadual Maringa, Program Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentais, Av Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Frota, Matheus] Nucleo Reg Educ Maringa, Av Carneiro Leao 93, BR-87014010 Maringa, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Maringa,"Frota, A (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Maringa, Program Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentais, Av Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",frota.augusto@gmail.com,"Frota, Augusto/E-2696-2018","Frota, Augusto/0000-0002-0532-4640",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [CNPq - 133333/2016-7],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"We are deeply grateful to Grupo de Estudos de O Capital of the State University of Maringa by enormous contributions and clarifications in political economy; to M.M.R.

The diagnostic survey method was used on a poll of 100 employees. In the research sample, the structure of employment by job positions was deliberatively taken into account. The results of the survey indicate that the majority of the respondents stated that the impact of foreign capital on the Polish economy (64 %) and on company itself was positive (70 %). For the respondents, foreign capital was associated positively with enterprise development, improvement of the economic condition of the enterprise, creation of new jobs, reduction of unemployment, implementation of new technologies, rather than negatively with such issues as: corruption, dismissal of employees and liquidation of enterprises. The results indicate that, the processes of implementing changes in enterprises are an inherent element of management. In case of change of the investor, the managers should ensure proper communication of the change to the stakeholders in order to minimize the employees' anxiety due to changes related to possible dismissal from work, liquidation of the enterprise or deterioration of remuneration conditions, and, consequently, their own subjectively assessed financial situation.","[Anna, Grontkowska] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Econ & Org Enterprises, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland; [Monika, Gebska; Anna, Kosakowska] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Anna, G (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Econ & Org Enterprises, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.;Monika, G (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Warsaw, Poland.",anna_grontkowska@sggw.pl; monika_gebska@sggw.pl,"Gebska, Monika/C-1783-2017","Gebska, Monika/0000-0001-6196-5904; Grontkowska, Anna/0000-0002-7286-8496",,,,,5,0,0,0,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,241,250,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.141,0.0,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500029,0

Particular attention has been paid to the issues of underemployment (time-related and invisible underemployment) and over-employment. Time-related underemployment occurs when a person would like to work more hours for the same hourly rate, but is unable to do so. Invisible underemployment occurs when employees are over-qualified for their position. There is also overemployment which occurs when an employee works more than the employee expected. Analyzing the extent and consequences of these issues and potential ways of dealing with them are the focus of this paper. The source of the data are the results of a survey conducted among a group of over 900 respondents with higher education. Statistical methods were used. The Polish labor market seems to be very attractive for people with higher education. There is basically no problem of unemployment among highly educated people. This does not mean, however, that such people find work that meets their expectations. Over 15% work less than they would like, and twice as many would like to work less than at present. About 40% work in positions that do not need a college education, which are below their qualifications. Underemployment significantly contributes to achieving lower income than expected (especially time-related underemployment) and to less satisfaction with work. Overtime wor, in turn causes fatigue and can negatively affect family relationships, as employees spend less time at home.","[Bebel, Anna; Piotrowska, Maria; Kosny, Marek] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Bebel, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",anna.bebel@ue.wroc.pl; maria.piotrowska@ue.wroc.pl; marek.kosny@ue.wroc.pl,"Kośny, Marek/P-5292-2018",,Polish National Science Centre [2015/17/B/HS4/02713],Polish National Science Centre,We would like to acknowledge the financial support of Polish National Science Centre (Grant No. 2015/17/B/HS4/02713).,,32,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,37,46,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600004,0

This research aims at combining principles from both SBM innovation and user-driven anti-consumption and well-being habits, in order to develop more successful, comprehensive and community-centred sustainable value propositions. Design/methodology/approach - Given the research goal, an exploratory case study was prepared where multiple sources of data were employed, namely in-depth interviews, participant observation, focus groups and document analysis. Findings - In the light of the Bocken et al. (2014) framework, this paper provides evidence on the implementation of an AFN where it is possible to observe a strong sharing of knowledge regarding sustainable consumption behaviours and an effective dissemination of best practices between members. The authors developed four propositions that support the creation of a sustainable food supply chain, laying the foundation for spreading consumer behaviours and motivations so that they become more sustainable in their consumption habits. Research limitations/implications - Even though the case study is very rich in the amount of data gathered, it cannot be generalised. Further research will overcome this limitation by adding more cases within a comparative approach and through a quantitative methodology. Originality/value - It adds value to recent literature and practice by focussing on how networks of producers, consumers and other actors could act to improve food anti-consumption behaviours, by embodying alternatives to conventional food systems.","[De Bernardi, Paola] Univ Turin, Dept Management, Business Adm, Turin, Italy; [Tirabeni, Lia] Univ Turin, Dept Cultures Polit & Soc, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; University of Turin,"Tirabeni, L (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Cultures Polit & Soc, Turin, Italy.",lia.tirabeni@unito.it,"DE BERNARDI, PAOLA/I-4807-2018; Tirabeni, Lia/AAL-9636-2020","DE BERNARDI, PAOLA/0000-0002-6776-6735; Tirabeni, Lia/0000-0001-8415-9921",,,,,58,41,41,4,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Although these competences should be developed from the kindergarten, universities still have a major role in initiating, supporting and creating entrepreneurial education. However, many studies have shown the inability of universities to change and create programs that can produce skills and knowledge needed to overcome ever-increasing levels of complexity and insecurity. There is, now more than ever, a need for evaluation of available educational programs, which should result in a change in pedagogical methods and traditional roles of teachers as educators. According to the Budapest Agenda, it is important to innovate and improve teaching methods and to develop a relationship with local community for stronger linkage between teachers and the real world. Thus, two factors are equally important for the success of entrepreneurial education process and better employability of students: the new role of the teacher - the facilitator's role, and the reflective do-learn-think behaviour principle for the students. The paper aims to explore extracurricular activities as a do-learn-think principle that improves students' employability. Also, the role of teachers, which should be both mentors and educators, will be reassessed in the paper. The paper describes the case of the Faculty of Economics in Osijek at the J.J.

Potential differences in acceptance between conventional and organic consumer segments are explored. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a survey, including a choice experiment, which was distributed to a consumer panel in Denmark. Survey responses were combined with actual purchase data among the same respondents and thereby providing information about the respondents' share of organic consumption. Findings No consumer segment differentiated between pesticide-free, cisgenic bread and conventional alternatives. Conventional consumers preferred cisgenics over transgenics, while pesticide-free is not highly valued. Frequent organic consumers were having willingness-to-pay (WTP) a large premium for organic, indicating that they will continue to purchase such products even if cisgenic, pesticide-free products are introduced. Originality/value This paper provides insights on the potential reception of cisgenic food, and if there is a positive willingness to pay for a pesticide-free label if this is cisgenics. Moreover, the possibility to allow new breeding techniques in the organic requirements has been discussed, and this paper contributes with insights on the organic consumers' preferences on this matter.","[Edenbrandt, Anna Kristina] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Edenbrandt, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",anna.edenbrandt@slu.se,"Edenbrandt, Anna Kristina/E-5213-2015","Edenbrandt, Anna Kristina/0000-0002-9298-6705",,,,,42,15,15,2,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

UCD were early adopters of the mainstreaming model recognising that specialist services could not adequately support the increasing numbers of students declaring a disability and that a whole college approach was required. This paper describes the opportunistic changes to a student support structure that have consolidated mainstreaming and enhanced supports for students with disabilities in a large Irish university Giving responsibility to specific roles throughout the college and sharing information in a systematic way ensures that consideration is given to all students with disabilities and not just those who have a visible disability or have the confidence to make themselves known to faculty and other staff. Knowledge of the diversity in the classroom has encouraged faculty to consider Universal Design in the construction and delivery of their courses and pockets of good practice have led to widespread recognition that this approach is not only beneficial to students with disabilities, but the entire student population which is becoming increasingly diverse. The systems we will describe include an integrated student record and Needs Assessment, the use of class lists to share information to target groups and a sophisticated exam reporting system, all of which have led to a streamlined service with minimal administrative requirements. We will also describe the business intelligence tools used to provide a visual representation of Widening Participation data for individual programme areas which ensures that College Principles are cognisant of their progress relative to national targets and where resources should be focused.","[Fleming, Bairbre; Tonge, Julie] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Fleming, B (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",julie.tonge@ucd.ie,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,5,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,495,499,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-495,0.0,,,5,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371408.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100047,0

They are aware about needs to acquire additional knowledge and skills, especially amongst young employed in this sector. Data for research were acquired by two various workshops. The main purpose of first experiential workshop was to present to the students the importance of natural approaches for self-sufficiency, and to encourage them to think that anyone of us can become at least partially self-sufficient in everyday life. In the context of the different student activities implementation they also learned about the importance and opportunities for practical integration of sustainability into everyday life and future profession. The problems addressed by the second workshop were with educational sector. Aspects of sustainability are quite hidden in the educational system and not enough discussed about. Students in the course of education meet with the basic contents of environmental protection and sustainable development, but especially through the practical work, it appears that the students hardly transmit the theoretical knowledge into everyday practice and to their local environment.

It analyses and validates 'Question Banks', the concepts proposed by Wladyslaw Jachniak's (1915-1994), a Polish independent entrepreneur and economist from so called communist period. 'Question Banks' was created in the 1970s (the times in Poland of the centralized industry with a relative opening to the West) as a training material for economists operating in those economic realities: period of loans, growth of consumption, huge investments and WOG (Large Economic Organizations). The aim of the analysis was to determine the suitability of this training material for adaptation in the conditions of the current economy. Moreover, Wladyslaw Jachniak's 'Question Banks' was analysed as a potential tool for a coach and mentor in modern business. The article also presents the elements of the theoretical perspective on the concept of professional development, which are necessary for ' Question Banks' utility in financial education today. In order to show the financial reality during the life and work of Wladyslaw Jachniak in comparison to the present times, a comparative analysis of budget expenditures in 1974 and in 2017 was made. The research uses data from the 'Question Banks' itself, from the budget laws of 1974 and 2017 as well as reports and articles on the issues discussed. The validity of the main concepts used by the author of Question Banks was also examined by comparing the frequency of their occurrence in the current database of scientific articles. The proposals contain recommendations on how 'Question Banks' can be adapted to current managerial practice. The article shows how managers can use the experience and tools of their predecessors to today's challenges in the field of economic education, mainly for the purpose of effective mentoring and coaching duties.","[Kozlowski, Michal] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Acad Subunit Org Sociol & Business Hist, Warsaw, Poland; [Jachniak, Danuta] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England",University of Warsaw; University of Cambridge,"Kozlowski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Acad Subunit Org Sociol & Business Hist, Warsaw, Poland.",mkozlowski@wz.uw.edu.pl; dj209@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,250,259,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700029,0

Through the analysis of discourse and practices across research fields, I point out that reproducibility is not only interpreted in different ways, but also serves a variety of epistemic functions depending on the research at hand. Given such variation, I argue that the uncritical pursuit of reproducibility as an overarching epistemic value is misleading and potentially damaging to scientific advancement. Requirements for reproducibility, however they are interpreted, are one of many available means to secure reliable research outcomes. Furthermore, there are cases where the focus on enhancing reproducibility turns out not to foster high-quality research. Scientific communities and Open Science advocates should learn from inferential reasoning from irreproducible data, and promote incentives for all researchers to explicitly and publicly discuss (1) their methodological commitments, (2) the ways in which they learn from mistakes and problems in everyday practice, and (3) the strategies they use to choose which research components of any project need to be preserved in the long term, and how.","[Le Onelli, Sabina] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Le Onelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England.",,,"Leonelli, Sabina/0000-0002-7815-6609",European Research Council [335925]; Australian Research Council; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P011489/1]; European Research Council (ERC) [335925] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This chapter - like much of my work over the last 10 years - owes much to Mary Morgan's generous advice, and her ability to identify and probe the core and significance of arguments and questions.

Attempts at activating them failed to bring intended results. Therefore, the aim of this article is to design a path of development for the studied areas which would be different from the hitherto taken actions. The proposed approach is based on the polarization-diffusion model with the use of seaports as growth poles. Both primary and secondary sources of information were used in the article. To this end, the literature on the subject and numerous publications and scientific studies were reviewed. Research was conducted in the form of in-depth interviews with selected representatives of municipalities and seaports. Research results showed that the main barriers limiting the development of the peripheral areas of West Pomerania are the low quality of human capital and insufficient mobility of the workforce. The resulting high unemployment rate lowers the purchasing power of the local community. As a consequence, the studied areas are not attractive to investment capital. In the polarization-diffusion model, the main player is the key enterprise which involves local entities in the production process. The produced goods are exported to foreign markets characterized by a high purchasing power of their consumers. The development of local entrepreneurship increases the demand for workforce. Money introduced into the economic cycle stimulates other sectors of the local economy. The efficiency of the new path of development requires the involvement of public authorities in the acquisition of the key enterprise and creation of conditions for diffusion and absorption of developmental impulses. The proposed model solves the key problems of peripheral areas, which are: limited mobility of the workforce, insufficient local demand, and low quality of human capital. The polarization-diffusion model is in line with the change in the current thinking about regional development, which should be seen as a chance for its implementation.","[Nowaczyk, Piotr] West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Nowaczyk, P (通讯作者)，West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Szczecin, Poland.",piotr.nowaczyk@zut.edu.pl,"Nowaczyk, Piotr/AAG-8427-2021","Nowaczyk, Piotr/0000-0001-8625-1959",,,,,37,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,361,371,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700041,0

The public administration of the Slovak Republic is created by local self-government and regional self-government. Municipalities represent the local self-government bodies. The effective conditions of the municipalities are creating the effective setting of its financing. Until 2004 the financing of municipalities was determined annually by the state budget act and for the municipalities distributed from the state budget a share of the tax of personal income, which consisted of three taxes: tax of personal income, tax of the corporation income and road tax. In 2005 the fiscal decentralization took place in Slovakia as a part of the consolidation of public finances, resulting in a new way of financing municipalities. The basis of the new financing system of municipalities was to determine the tax of personal income as a single share tax, in particular, because the dynamics of the income of this tax was expected to grow even in the medium term. The objective of the paper is to evaluate changes and trends in the financial management of municipalities based on selected fiscal indicators within the period 1993-2015.","[Orszaghova, Dana; Hornyak Greganova, Radomira] Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra, Slovakia; [Papcunova, Viera] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra,"Országhová, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra, Slovakia.",dana.orszaghova@uniag.sk; radomira.greganova@uniag.sk; vpapcunova@ukf.sk,"Hornyak Greganova, Radomira/K-5532-2018; Hornyak Greganova, Radomira/ABA-8584-2021; Papcunová, Viera/A-6260-2019; Dana, Orszaghova/AAT-7165-2021","Hornyak Greganova, Radomira/0000-0001-7433-2014; Hornyak Greganova, Radomira/0000-0001-7433-2014; Papcunová, Viera/0000-0003-1236-0639; Dana, Orszaghova/0000-0001-7570-4887",,,,,17,0,0,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-701-5,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,2,,,,102,113,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL3AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443600010,0

The term flexicurity dates back to the 90s of the twentieth century and means employment security, not job security, in fact, it should be a worker protection institute, not a workplace protection institute. This paper will explore the possibilities and challenges of applying flexicurity within labor relations and the labor market of the Republic of Croatia. After the war, the unemployment in the Republic of Croatia was high. What is important to do in such a situation is to strengthen the economy in the country, employ workers, taking into account social standards to preserve the dignity of workers, because the crisis in the new EU member states has led to precarious labor, whose characteristics are insecurity,fixed-term employment, almost nonexistent workers' rights, preferring illegal work, seasonal work etc. Each EU member state needs to build its own path leading to employment security and to social standards appropriate to that particular country. Most experts in this field believe that current labor law institutes will have to change or adapt to labor market conditions, but that's not a quick and easy task. The Croatian labor market must also change in terms of employment protection, payroll, social unemployment measures, labor disputes. According to Professors Bodiroga and Laleta there are possibilities for this and these are: higher labor market flexibility that affects the reduction of unemployment and one-off structural reforms In this way flexicurity would reach its full potential in practice. The professors give preference to the German new model that brings out the best from the current state so that it is apparent that the application of this model results in high employment.","[Petricevic, Anton] Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Chair Labor & Social Secur Law, Stjepana Radiaa 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Petricevic, A (通讯作者)，Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Chair Labor & Social Secur Law, Stjepana Radiaa 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",apetrice@pravos.hr,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,17,24,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600002,0

Design/methodology/approach The composition of major (Ca, K, Mg, and Na) and trace (Pb, Cd, Cu and Mn) minerals was determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the mineral levels with the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) at different child development stages was carried out. Findings High Ca levels were observed in petit Suisse (3.441.66mgg(-1)), dairy dessert (3.88 +/- 0.02mgg(-1)) and RequeijAo cremoso (4.14 +/- 0.07mgg(-1)). Dairy dessert presented the highest K level (2.57 +/- 0.07mgg(-1)), while the RequeijAo cremoso presented the highest Na content (4.78 +/- 0.10mgg(-1)), and both products had the highest Mg contents (238.55 +/- 16.27 and 197.39 +/- 5.18 mu gg(-1), respectively). Trace elements (Cd, Cu, Mn and Pb) were below the limit of detection for all commercial dairy foods. Among food products analyzed, petit Suisse cheese and dairy dessert can be considered good sources of calcium, while RequeijAo cremoso is high in both calcium and sodium. Originality/value This study is the first to analyze the mineral levels of several Brazilian infant dairy foods and the daily intake contribution during important child development stages. These findings provide valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners trying to develop healthy and nutritious dairy products for infants and children.","[Pimentel, Luana S.; Moraes, Jeremias; Cruz, Adriano G.] Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Rio De Janeiro IFR, Dept Alimentos, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Luna, Aderval S.; Barros, Diego B.] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Dept Quim Analit, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Pimentel, Tatiana C.] Inst Fed Parana IFPR, Paranavai, Brazil; [Guimaraes, Jonas T.; Silva, Hugo L.

The attainment of this kind of integration entails relevant praxis and scientific challenges. In this context, this paper proposes an adaptive simulation-based optimization framework for productive resources scheduling which takes advantage of forthcoming data transparency derived from the application of digital factory concept. The proposed framework was applied in a test case based on a production line of a Brazilian automotive parts supplier.

The aim of this paper is to identify the major components and principles of library social responsibility and sustainablity that need to be implemented in order to successfully meet the above mentioned challenges. The purpose of the research is to introduce the new proactive role of academic library based upon HEI and library management with emphasis on promoting values of social responsibility and in accordance with requirements of ecologically conscious society. The suggested model of academic library social responsibility is based on modified methodology of CSR Index created by Croatian Business Council and Croatian Chamber of Commerce that is used to measure social responsibility in Croatian companies. Research results have enabled creation of social responsibility matrix model for academic libraries. The model has identified the criteria for evaluation and self-evaluation of academic libraries.","[Simic, Mirna Leko; Mihaljevic, Jasminka] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Tolusic, Marija] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Dept Cultural Studies, Trg Svetog Trojstva 3, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Simic, ML (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",lekom@efos.hr; jasminka.mihaljevic@efos.hr; mtolusic@kulturologija.unios.hr,"Mihaljevic, Jasminka/J-4992-2018",,,,,,26,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,650,659,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900067,0

Also, relationships between various indicators of human and social capital and subjective quality of life will be presented. Human capital indicators comprise various demographic data, while social capital indicators include variables such as social support, trust, and community cohesion. This research was conducted on a sample of 356 graduate students of J. J. Strossmayer University of Osijek. Results revealed statistically significant gender differences in human and social capital variables. Women tend to score higher on social capital measures in comparison to men. According to human capital indicators, the population of eastern Croatia is aging, and consequently, a negative growth rate is present for years. When it comes to education, there is a trend of more women obtaining higher education degrees, in opposition to the historical data. Furthermore, results indicate a significant connection between social capital and subjective well-being, although various social capital indicators correlate differently with subjective quality of life. Identifying aspects of social and human capital in relation to the quality of life will contribute to better understanding of the relationship between the economic, social and psychological characteristics of individuals and the whole population, which helps in the design of socio-economic strategies at the regional level.","[Vuletic, Gorka; Erdesi, Josipa] Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Lorenza Jagera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia",,"Vuletic, G (通讯作者)，Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Lorenza Jagera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",gvuletic@ffos.hr; erdesi.josipa@gmail.com,"Vuletic, Gorka/AAT-1414-2020","Vuletic, Gorka/0000-0002-6804-6860",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,424,431,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900044,0

The aim of this paper is to analyse and compare the costs of livestock depredation by carnivores in Sweden across different carnivore species and counties. To this end, we estimate the government's compensation cost function using Swedish data on the county level over the period of 2001 to 2013. Compensation costs due to depredation by three large carnivores are considered: the brown bear (Ursus arctos), the wolf (Canis lupus) and the lynx (Lynx lynx). The results show that a 1% increase in the density of the carnivores leads to a 03-0.4% increase in compensation costs, whereas a 1% increase in the density of sheep results in a 0.8 and 1.1% increase in the compensation costs for brown bears and wolves, respectively. A larger share of unfenced pastures is associated with higher compensation costs for brown bear. The marginal cost of an additional carnivore individual varies considerably between counties, ranging between 1 and 82 EUR for lynxes, 0 and 266 EUR for brown bears, and 52 and 1067 EUR for wolves.

Conceivably the income generated from emission permit allocations, as suggested in the context of international climate policy, could have a comparable impact. Effects of a climate rent curse have so far not been considered in the design of permit allocation schemes. In this study, we first determine when to expect a climate rent curse conceptually by analyzing its potential channels. We then use a numerical model to explore the extent of consequences that a climate rent curse would have on international climate agreements. We show that given the susceptibility to a curse, permit allocation schemes may fail to encourage the participation of recipient countries in an international mitigation effort. We present transfer schemes that enhance cooperation and limit adverse effects on recipients.","[Kornek, Ulrike; Steckel, Jan Christoph; Lessmann, Kai; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Kornek, Ulrike; Steckel, Jan Christoph; Lessmann, Kai; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Steckel, Jan Christoph; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Kornek, U; Steckel, JC (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.;Kornek, U; Steckel, JC (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.;Steckel, JC (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",kornek@mcc-berlin.net; steckel@mcc-berlin.net,"; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Lessmann, Kai/0000-0002-8839-343X; Steckel, Jan Christoph/0000-0002-5325-9214; Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01UV1008A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (funding code 01UV1008A, EntDekEn) is gratefully acknowledged.

This evidence is mostly based on correlational studies which cannot isolate the adverse selection effect from the moral hazard effect. Exploiting data from the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe, this study uses an instrumental variable strategy to identify the causal effect of daily smoking on perceived health care cost coverage of those at age 50 or above in 12 European countries. Daily smoking is instrumented by a variable indicating whether or not there is any other daily smoker in the household. A self-assessment of health care cost coverage is used as the outcome measure. Among those who live with a partner (72% of the sample), the result is not statistically significant which means we find no effect of smoking on perceived health care cost coverage. However, among those who live without a partner, the results show that daily smokers have lower self-assessed perceived health care cost coverage. This finding replicates the same counter-intuitive relationship between smoking and health insurance presented in previous studies, but in a language of causality. In addition to this, we contribute to previous studies by a cross-country comparison which brings in different institutional arrangements, and by using the self-assessed perceived health care cost coverage which is broader than health insurance coverage.","[Rezayatmand, Reza] Isfahan Univ Medial Sci, Hlth Management & Econ Res Ctr, Esfahan, Iran; [Rezayatmand, Reza; Groot, Wim; Pavlova, Milena] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, CAPHRI, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci,Dept Hlth Serv Res, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Groot, Wim] Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res TIER, Maastricht, Netherlands",Isfahan University Medical Science; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); Maastricht University,"Rezayatmand, R (通讯作者)，Isfahan Univ Medial Sci, Hlth Management & Econ Res Ctr, Esfahan, Iran.;Rezayatmand, R (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, CAPHRI, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci,Dept Hlth Serv Res, Maastricht, Netherlands.",mr.rezayatmand@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Rezayatmand, Reza/A-6476-2018; Pavlova, Milena/B-4778-2011","Pavlova, Milena/0000-0002-6082-8446","European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001-00360]; European Commission (Project SHARE-I3) [RII-CT-2006-062193]; European Commission (Project COMPARE) [CIT5-CT-2005-028857]; European Commission (Project SHARELIFE) [CIT4-CT-2006-028812]; European Commission (SHARE-PREP) [211909]; European Commission (SHARE-LEAP) [227822]; U.S. National Institute on Aging [U01 AG09740- 13S2, P01 AG005842, P01 AG08291, P30 AG12815, Y1-AG-4553-01, OGHA 04-064, IAG BSR06- 11, R21 AG025169]",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); European Commission (Project SHARE-I3); European Commission (Project COMPARE); European Commission (Project SHARELIFE); European Commission (SHARE-PREP); European Commission (SHARE-LEAP); U.S. National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"The authors thank two anonymous referees for their thoughtful comments.

Counterfactual methodologies assessing their labor market and economic performance provide evidence of a positive effect of EU Objective 1 funds. When in 2006 South Yorkshire lost Objective 1 eligibility, this massively reduced its share of EU funds and the region was unable to sustain the gains obtained in previous years. This suggests that while Structural Funds may be effectively improving socio-economic conditions of poorer regions, the performance of subsidized areas could be deeply affected by a reduction (or worse, an interruption) of EU aid.","[Di Cataldo, Marco] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Di Cataldo, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.di-cataldo@lse.ac.uk,"Di Cataldo, Marco/AAK-8373-2020","Di Cataldo, Marco/0000-0002-2808-1776",LSE PhD scholarship,LSE PhD scholarship,"This paper has greatly benefited from comments by JRS editor Professor Jens Suedekum and three anonymous reviewers.

Specifically, two questions are addressed: a) is WTP stable over time? And b) if it is not, are the changes just driven by socio-economic effects, or something else? In order to investigate these questions, we used data from the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) study conducted after the Prestige oil spill in Spain in 2006, and a second wave of the same survey repeated in 2009, after Spain entered a serious recession. Median WTP estimates dropped from sic60.36 in 2006 to sic26.92 in 2009 per household, a statistically significant reduction. To investigate the amount of the drop in WTP due to observables versus changes in preferences between 2006 and 2009, we use the 2006 logit WTP coefficient estimates with 2009 levels of the independent variables and we obtain a WTP of sic46.37. This estimate is statistically different from the 2009 estimate (sic26.92). In the same fashion, by using 2009 logit WTP coefficients with 2006 data, we obtain an estimate of 50.29, also different from the 2006 estimate. Implications of these findings for temporal stability of welfare measures and benefit transfer exercises are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Three types of public support encountered in various means-tested LTC schemes are examined. First, the level to be considered for means-testing only takes into account the level of wealth of the recipient without considering the cost of LTC or the possible insurance benefits. Second, the public support also considers the LTC needs of the recipient. Third, the means-test structure takes into consideration insurance benefits as well. Our results show that the optimal levels of insurance and informal care as well as their relationship are strongly influenced by the waysmeans-tested public support for LTC is structured, which have important implications in terms of public policy for the financing of LTC needs.","[Bascans, Jean-Marc; Oros, Cornel] Univ Poitiers, CRIEF, 2 Rue Jean Carbonnier, F-86022 Poitiers, France; [Courbage, Christophe] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland HES SO, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, Rue Tambourine 17, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland; [Oros, Cornel] Univ Orleans, LEO, Rue Blois, F-45067 Orleans, France",Universite de Poitiers; University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; Universite de Orleans,"Oros, C (通讯作者)，Univ Poitiers, CRIEF, 2 Rue Jean Carbonnier, F-86022 Poitiers, France.;Oros, C (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, LEO, Rue Blois, F-45067 Orleans, France.",cornel.oros@univ-poitiers.fr,,"Courbage, Christophe/0000-0002-2554-0228",,,,,25,5,5,6,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

In this paper, I estimate the impact of Chinese import competition onto the structure of employment and wages of local labor markets in France, with an emphasis on spillovers effects beyond manufacturing and the degree of local wage inequality. Local employment and total labor income in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing are negatively affected by rising exposure to imports. Import competition from China polarized the local structure of employment in the manufacturing sector. The wage distribution is uniformly negatively affected in manufacturing while the nontraded sector experiences wage polarization, i.e., a rise in upper-tail inequality and a decline in bottom-tail inequality. While overall wage inequality is on average not affected, I show that it increased in response to trade shocks in areas where the minimum wage is only weakly binding.","[Malgouyres, Clement] Banque France, Div Microecon & Struct Studies, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, Ile De France, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Malgouyres, C (通讯作者)，Banque France, Div Microecon & Struct Studies, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75001 Paris, Ile De France, France.",clement.malgouyres@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,33,53,55,4,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Existing explanations for this puzzling discrepancy have focused on four rationales: major fossil fuel exporters have not historically been members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (WTO); WTO subsidies rules are inadequate to deal with the specifics of the fossil fuel trade; nations have developed separate institutions to govern energy; and all states have fossil fuel subsidies, so a challenge to one country's subsidies will prompt a reciprocal challenge. This article makes two contributions. First, it uses a survey of existing renewable energy trade disputes to critique the existing explanations. Most importantly, the article shows that the threat of reciprocal litigation exists in the renewable energy sector, and that WTO subsidies rules are rarely used to challenge renewable energy subsidies. Hence, neither the threat of reciprocal litigation nor the relative ease of applying WTO subsidies rules explains the discrepancy in the number of disputes. Second, the article hypothesizes that the economic diversification of energy-producing countries is correlated with and may drive whether energy-producing countries face WTO challenges to their energy support policies. Most major fossil fuel producers lack significant non-fossil fuel exports that could be restricted in order to induce them to reform their fossil fuel policies, the usual mechanism for enforcing a WTO judgment. States may also be more likely to challenge new, rather than long-standing, trade restrictions. This suggests that trade challenges will arise more frequently where innovation leads to competition and a demand for new trade restrictions (as in renewable energy), as opposed to in mature sectors of the economy (i.e., the fossil fuel industry). Economic diversification, in turn, is a good predictor of innovation.","[Meyer, Timothy] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Law, 131 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Meyer, T (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Law, 131 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",Tim.Meyer@Vanderbilt.edu,"Meyer, Timothy/AAJ-4893-2021","Meyer, Timothy/0000-0003-3298-537X",,,,,54,23,23,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This paper evaluates the recycling of plastic waste with the more conventional incineration of plastic waste, using data for the Netherlands. Both options have specific revenues and costs. The main benefit from plastic recycling is the avoidance of CO2 emissions that otherwise would occur during incineration and from the production of virgin (new) plastic material. At the same time, there are significant costs involved, such as collection, separation, sorting, and recycling. The benefit from plastic waste incineration is the energy that can be recovered, which reduces emissions in the regular energy production sector by displacing production. The main cost associated with incineration is that this requires a waste -to -energy plant with the associated capital investments. Summing the costs and revenues from both plastic waste treatment options and comparing the results, leads to an implicit CO2 abatement price of 178 (sic)/t of CO2 in case of plastic recycling. In general, this implicit price is much higher than current (or historic) ETS prices, the estimated external costs of CO2 emissions, or alternatives to reduce CO2 emissions (e.g. renewable energy). A sensitivity analysis shows that this conclusion is robust. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Gradus, Raymond H. J. M.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nillesen, Paul H.

Prospective evaluations of how effectively such policies are likely to meet sustainability goals have nonetheless remained challenging. Evaluating policies against sustainability goals can be facilitated through the inclusive wealth framework, which characterizes development in terms of the value to society of its underlying capital assets, and defines development to be potentially sustainable if that value does not decline over time. The inclusive wealth approach has been developed at a theoretical level and applied to retrospective evaluations. Here, we apply inclusive wealth theory to prospective policy evaluation coupled with dynamic simulation modeling, using a case of electricity infrastructure policies in oil-exporting countries. To demonstrate the prospective evaluation, we analyze investment policies in non-fossil electricity capacity in terms of their forecast impact on several dimensions of inclusive wealth. Illustrative results show that investing in non-fossil capacity in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait can increase components of the countries' inclusive wealth, though the impacts depend on future uncertainties.

International and domestic influences on Australia's shifting stance,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate finance; Climate change; Green Climate Fund; Fragmentation; Peer group effects; Australia,GLOBAL GOVERNANCE; NORM DYNAMICS; FOREIGN-AID; POLARIZATION; POLITICS; POLICIES,"The fulfilment of wealthy countries' commitment to mobilise $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020 will hinge on maintaining domestic political support in contributor countries. Predictability in flows of climate finance is likely to enhance the overall stability of the climate finance system and the broader climate regime. However, at present it remains unclear how the 2020 target will be achieved and little is known about what drives fluctuations in support among contributor countries. This article explores domestic and international factors that may explain fluctuations in national support through a case study of Australia's climate finance from 2007 to 2015. Drawing on documentary analysis and interviews with officials and stakeholders, the paper tracks two domestic factors that may influence support for climate finance-the government's political orientation and public concern about climate change-and two international factors-commitment to multilateral agreements and international peer pressure. While some accounts view climate policy choices as being driven primarily by domestic factors, we find that the government's political orientation on domestic climate policy and aid explains some but not all variations in Australia's stance on climate finance. International peer group effects have moderated the positions of two governments that were otherwise reluctant to act on climate change. National policy reforms combined with improved multilateral oversight and more established replenishment cycles could bolster support in contributor countries and thereby strengthen the capacity of the climate finance system.","[Pickering, Jonathan] Univ Canberra, Ctr Deliberat Democracy & Global Governance, Univ Dr South, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Mitchell, Paul] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",University of Canberra; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Pickering, J (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Ctr Deliberat Democracy & Global Governance, Univ Dr South, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",jonathan.pickering@canberra.edu.au; paul.mitchell2@rmit.edu.au,"Pickering, Jonathan/Q-5744-2018","Pickering, Jonathan/0000-0002-1862-3623",Australian Research Council [FL140100154]; Australian Research Council [FL140100154] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We are grateful for helpful feedback from participants at the Lund Climate Finance Workshop, the 2015 Australian Political Studies Association Conference and the 2016 Australasian Aid Conference, where earlier versions of this paper were presented.

This article shows that the road towards devaluation began earlier and that financial linkages with Germany proved to be more important than Sweden's economic and monetary relations with Great Britain. It all started in late 1929 when the Swedish financier Ivar Kreuger gave a loan to the German government in exchange for the match monopoly, thus tying his business ventures to Germany's solvency. In addition, a part of this loan was financed by large US dollar credits from the two largest Swedish banks that, in turn, accumulated a sizeable foreign short-term deficit. When in June 1931 the German fiscal crisis began to escalate, international investors ceased to consider Sweden a safe haven because they knew about the linkages between the German government, Kreuger, and the Swedish banking system. This downgrading, in combination with the foreign short-term deficit of the banking sector, proved lethal for the reserve position of the Swedish central bank, once the international liquidity crisis in mid-July 1931 erupted. The sterling crisis only put the final nail in the coffin.","[Straumann, Tobias; Weber, Florian] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kugler, Peter] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Basel,"Straumann, T (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,55,3,3,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

One way to add nutritional value to yogurt consists of the addition of nutritional flour. However, it is necessary to optimize formulations that meet the consumers' expectations. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to aim at sensory optimization of a strawberry yogurt enriched with different flours. Design/methodology/approach - The optimal concentrations of each flour were defined using the Just-about-right-scale test. Then, an acceptance test was used to assess the samples at optimal concentrations. Findings - It was observed that the strawberry yogurt should include 1.275 percent golden flaxseed flour, 1.093 percent green banana flour, 1.075 percent eggplant flour and 3.420 percent oatmeal flour. All formulations had good acceptability and the yogurt added with the addition of golden flax flour and the traditional product received similar sensory acceptance. Thus, it is possible to add nutritional value to strawberry yogurt by maintaining its sensory quality. Research limitations/implications - More detailed studies on the shelf-life of yogurt are necessary to enable the incorporation of flours into yogurt as heat, light and oxygen can reduce the beneficial effects of flours. Therefore, researchers should test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications - Optimization of an enriched yogurt is a good alternative to provide a product that meets consumers' expectations, besides adding value to the product. However, there are technological challenges when adding functional components in foods. Thus, this study aimed at sensory optimization of a strawberry yogurt enriched with different flours. Social implications - The authors aimed to provide a healthy product to the market as well as contribute toward product variety in the market. Originality/value - There are few studies in respect to the sensory aspects of enriched yogurts. Therefore, this work will aid future studies, supporting the optimization of functional products and contributing toward product variety in the market.","[Barbosa, Bruna Teodoro; Rodrigues, Jessica Ferreira; Bastos, Sabrina Carvalho] Univ Fed Lavras, Lavras, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras,"Rodrigues, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Lavras, Lavras, Brazil.",jessikfr5@hotmail.com,,"FERREIRA RODRIGUES, JESSICA/0000-0003-0113-4898",,,,,49,7,7,0,51,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Moreover, relationship between segments of consumers and consumption frequency of differentiated food products ( traditional, functional and organic) was analysed. Design/methodology/approach - A three-stage stratified random sampling approach was employed and data were collected via 500 face-to-face interviews conducted in respondents' homes. A version of the Food Choice Questionnaire was used to examine the motives of consumers' underlying food choices. The collected data were analysed by factor analysis followed by cluster analysis. Findings - Four factors were identified: health and sensory characteristics, price and availability, body weight and digestion, and convenience. Resulting clusters were named as: healthy and tasty food lovers, convenient, concerned, and indifferent consumers. Differences were identified between the segments according to consumers' frequency of consumption of the different types of food products. Practical implications - The findings have impact implications for food producers and distributors in developing communication strategies for consumer segments with different attitudes and motives. The findings of this study not only contribute to the organic, traditional, and food with health claim literature, but also help industry, government, and consumer associations fully understand consumer perceptions of intrinsic and extrinsic foods characteristics and enhance consumers' responses to the different types of food products. Originality/value - The study represents one of the first assessments of the importance of food quality characteristics, segmentation, and consumption frequency of traditional, organic, and functional food products in Central and Eastern Europe.","[Brecic, Ruzica] Univ Zagreb, Dept Mkt, Zagreb, Croatia; [Mesic, Zeljka; Cerjak, Marija] Univ Zagreb, Dept Agr Mkt, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Mesic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Dept Agr Mkt, Zagreb, Croatia.",zmesic@agr.hr,"Brecic, Ruzica/G-1652-2018; Mesic, Zeljka/P-6663-2019; Cerjak, Marija/AFS-5955-2022; Brečić, Ružica/P-6266-2019","Brecic, Ruzica/0000-0003-3327-2187; Mesic, Zeljka/0000-0002-9349-1560; Cerjak, Marija/0000-0003-0696-4364; Brečić, Ružica/0000-0003-3327-2187",FOCUS-BALKANS Project [212579],FOCUS-BALKANS Project,"This paper is based on research done in the frame of the FOCUS-BALKANS Project (Grant Agreement No. 212579), a three-years FP7 European Research programme, and will present some of the relevant data.",,81,55,57,1,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

From 1970 to 2010, rental housing's price increased, renters' incomes decreased, but, unexpectedly, renters' real housing consumption increased. We find neither demographics nor housing supply factors account for the anomalous post-1970 increase in renters' housing consumption. We conclude that after 1970 there was a nationwide increase in renters' preferences for housing consumption. With incomes falling, renters increased housing consumption by decreasing consumption of other necessities including food, clothing, and transportation.","[DiPasquale, Denise] City Res, 40 Battery St,Suite 310, Boston, MA 02109 USA; [Murray, Michael P.] Bates Coll, Dept Econ, Pettengill Hall, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA",,"DiPasquale, D (通讯作者)，City Res, 40 Battery St,Suite 310, Boston, MA 02109 USA.",dipasquale@cityresearch.com; mmurray@bates.edu,,,MacArthur Foundation; Rockefeller Foundation; Bates College,MacArthur Foundation; Rockefeller Foundation; Bates College,"This research benefited from several years of support from the MacArthur Foundation.

The paper also considers the influence of shopper and socio-demographic characteristics on pre-store food-buying practices in a developing country. Design/methodology/approach - A self-administered questionnaire was used to survey 1 200 consumers in retail stores in low, middle and high SES areas in South Africa. A generalised linear model was employed for the statistical analysis of pre-store food-buying practices within the SES area groups in a developing country. Findings - South African consumers that reside in high SES area displayed the largest of shopping list development, while consumers who dwell in low SES areas showed the highest incidence of advertisement usage. Several shopper and socio-demographic characteristics were also found to have an influence on pre-store food-buying practices in different SES areas in South Africa. Research limitations/implications - A qualitative approach would offer a deeper understanding of consumers' pre-store food shopping predispositions as opposed to the quantitative approach, which was adopted for this study. A longitudinal design would also provide a more extensive representation of pre-store food shopping practices over a longer time frame than cross-sectional research. The survey was conducted on Saturdays, whereas consumers who shop during the week may have different shopping and socio-demographic characteristics. Practical implications - Astute food brands, marketers and grocery stores could use the findings of this study to assist with their marketing efforts that they direct at consumers in different SES areas in South Africa and other developing countries. Social implications - The findings of this study may assist consumers in developing countries, especially those who reside in low SES areas, with food-buying strategies to reduce food costs, make wiser purchase decisions and reduce shopping. Originality/value - No study (to the best of the researchers' knowledge) has considered shopping list development and use of advertisements' pre-store food-buying practices in different SES areas in a developing country.

J,"Duroy, Q",,,,"Duroy, Quentin",,,Hyper-individualism and ultrasociality in a Veblenian framework,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Degrowth; Multi-level selection; Neoliberalism; Post-nationalism; Ultrasociality; Veblen,,"In a series of articles Gowdy and Krall (2013, 2016a, 2016b) framed the process of cumulative social change as a codevelopment of hyper-individualism and ultrasociality. They argue that at the macro level the 'global economic system' behaves as a superorganism which has co-opted human beings' cooperative propensity in order to continuously expand its surplus value, appropriating an ever-larger share of natural resources. At the micro level, the neoliberal era has legitimized increased competition among individuals and has led to a hyper focus on the maximization of individual consumption. In their social context individuals appear to be largely oblivious or dismissive of the growing superorganism as is evidenced by public unwillingness to address situations of global environmental stress. In the context of Veblen's evolutionary thinking, this paper comments on Gowdy and Krall's articles by discussing two potential venues to 'tame' the superorganism: de-growth and post nationalism. It is argued that the former may be a solution only as a result of a severe (ecological) collapse scenario. Thus if the social desire to modify the superorganism exists it will have a greater chance to succeed as a post-national project that would provide a structural scaffolding to place the superorganism within human control.

Design/methodology/approach - The present study consists of 300 samples (triplicate samples for each product) of core nutrients (energy, fat, carbohydrate and protein), which have been stratified into eight categories, were analysed and the analytical values were compared with the declared values. Compliance of products were obtained through the comparison with different guidelines. Findings - About 34 per cent of analysed products did not comply with the tolerance limit according to the Food Act 1983, Malaysia (one way approach tolerance limit). Then, 73 per cent of products failed to comply with the tolerance leeway +/- 20 per cent (two-way approach) and 56 per cent of products did not comply with the tolerance limits set in the Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services. Research limitations/implications - Many researches have proved that consumers used nutrition label as a tool to improve their healthy lifestyles. The misleading of nutrition label will elicit detrimental effect to consumers especially who always rely on the nutrition label before purchasing. Hence, credibility of nutrition label is imperative. However, this research only focussed on four major core nutrients. Nutrients such as trans-fat and sodium have proved that are detrimental to human's health are not covered in the study. Practical implications - First, this research could directly reflect the credibility of nutrition label in the market. The government of the country should improve the surveillance activity on nutrition label. Meantime, free trade activities especially on food industries are active now; an accurate nutrition label is the first key to success in the business. This research can inject awareness to food producers who incline to do global free trade business shall always assure the accuracy of the nutrition label no matter the tolerance or guidelines are different among the countries. Originality/value - There are many research about improvement in consumers' awareness towards nutrition label but very little research conducted on the accuracy of nutrition label. The main purpose of those research is to improve public health awareness but this may become insignificant if the values of nutrition label are inaccurate. Then, the asymmetric of tolerance limits would trigger awareness from policy makers or food manufacturers to be more responsible in providing credible nutrition label. At the end, consumers are protected from inaccurate nutrition labels and a healthy nation can be sustained.","[Kok, Sing Chuan; Radzi, Che Wan Jasimah Mohamed] Univ Malaya, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Kok, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",edmuskok@gmail.com,"RADZI, CHE WAN JASIMAH WAN MOHAMED/B-8361-2010","RADZI, CHE WAN JASIMAH WAN MOHAMED/0000-0002-7727-2077",University of Malaya Postgraduate Research Grant (PPP) [PG134-2015A]; University Malaya Research Grant (UMRG) under the Humanities Research Cluster [RP027E-15HNE],University of Malaya Postgraduate Research Grant (PPP); University Malaya Research Grant (UMRG) under the Humanities Research Cluster,"This research was fully sponsored by research grant under the University of Malaya Postgraduate Research Grant (PPP), Project No. PG134-2015A and partially sponsored by the University Malaya Research Grant (UMRG) under the Humanities Research Cluster, Project No. RP027E-15HNE.",,39,6,6,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In the case of the Pareto law and other instances of power-law distributions, the power-law tail can be explained in the framework of canonical statistical mechanics as a statistical mixture of canonical equilibrium probability densities of heterogeneous subsystems at equilibrium. In this picture, each subsystem interacts (weakly) with the others and is characterized at equilibrium by a canonical distribution, but the distribution associated to the whole set of interacting subsystems can in principle be very different. This phenomenon, which is an example of the possible constructive role of the interplay between heterogeneity and noise, was observed in numerical experiments of Kinetic Exchange Models and presented in the conference Econophys-Kolkata-I, hold in Kolkata in 2005. The 2015 edition, taking place ten years later and coinciding with the twentieth anniversary of the 1995 conference hold in Kolkata where the term Econophysics was introduced, represents an opportunity for an overview in a historical perspective of this mechanism within the framework of heterogeneous kinetic exchange models (see also Kinetic exchange models as D-dimensional systems in this volume).","[Patriarca, Marco; Heinsalu, Els] NICPB, Ravala 10, EE-10143 Tallinn, Estonia; [Chakraborti, Anirban] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, SCIS, New Delhi 110067, India; [Kaski, Kimmo] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Comp Sci, POB 15500, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland","National Institute of Chemical Physics & Biophysics (NICPB); Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; Aalto University","Patriarca, M (通讯作者)，NICPB, Ravala 10, EE-10143 Tallinn, Estonia.",marco.patriarca@kbfi.ee; els.heinsalu@kbfi.ee; anirban@jnu.ac.in; kimmo.kaski@aalto.fi,"Patriarca, Marco/AAK-2034-2020; Chakraborti, Anirban/A-4565-2010; Chakraborti, Anirban/AAD-2187-2020; Kaski, Kimmo/AAO-4320-2021; Patriarca, Marco/D-8759-2013","Patriarca, Marco/0000-0001-6743-2914; Chakraborti, Anirban/0000-0002-6235-0204; Kaski, Kimmo/0000-0002-3805-9687; Patriarca, Marco/0000-0001-6743-2914","Institutional Research Funding IUT of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [IUT39-1]; Government of India, Ministry of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology, Bioinformatics Division [BT/BI/03/004/2003(C)]; University of Potential Excellence-II grant of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India [47]","Institutional Research Funding IUT of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research; Government of India, Ministry of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology, Bioinformatics Division; University of Potential Excellence-II grant of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India","M.P. and E.H. acknowledge support from the Institutional Research Funding IUT(IUT39-1) of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research.

Evidence of this can be found in the opulent cultural and historical heritage of the Republic of Ragusa, which has helped Dubrovnik secure the status of a world-known brand, and not only in the sphere of tourism. Along with famous cultural monuments which are regarded as the cornerstone of Dubrovnik's historical heritage (such as the City Walls of Dubrovnik, the Cathedral, the Rector's Palace, the Sponza Palace etc.), the city teems with many lesser-known - but not any less valuable - examples of historical legacy from more modern times, specifically the 19th and 20th centuries. These include fountains, parks, walks, bathing places, gardens, etc. Among these, the Gradac park from the late 19th century stands out as a prime example of landscape architecture, where a costly Bird Park/minizoo was situated during the Interwar period. Since the eco-historical heritage of Dubrovnik is reflected in its very name, which stands for oak forest (dubrava) and which used to cover most of the city area, the paper will present a number of examples of Dubrovnik's historical urban landscape that complement the city scenery and serve as an integral element of its eco-historical heritage as well.","[Penava, Marija Benic] Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia; [Dujmic, Daniel] Univ Zadar, Dept Hist, Iva Vojnovica 102, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik; University of Zadar,"Penava, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Lapadska Obala 7, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia.",marija.benicpenava@gmail.com; daniel_dujmic@yahoo.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,35,44,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500001,0

In key strategic documents of the Republic of Croatia micro-enterprises have their place and a role as holders of realization of certain strategic objectives at the national level. Namely, at a national level strategic documents have been adopted in which target values and indicators are set based on which the effectiveness and implementation of the strategic goals will be evaluated for the strengthening of the economy, industry development, innovativeness strengthening and the acquisition of necessary knowledge and skills for creating the conditions for a successful and sustainable business. Holders of activities for realizing specific strategic objectives are also micro enterprises, which, if the focus themselves to contribute with their success to the realization of the strategic objectives set at national level, can improve their performance. One way to ensure this is to implement the Balanced Scorecard model (BSC model) and to improve business performance via implementation of their strategic direction and thereby enable themselves to actively participate in strengthening the entrepreneurial activities at the local, regional and national market. This paper presents an overview of research on the possibilities and limitations of implementing the BSC model in the business of micro-enterprises for the purposes of improving business performance. The aim of this paper is to analyse the possibilities of implementing the BSC model in the business of micro-enterprises. A review of some previous research and criticism on this subject, it was concluded that the application of the BSC model in micro-enterprises is a rather limited, but with the adaptation of the model it is possible to apply this model for measuring and monitoring business performance of micro-enterprises.","[Stavlic, Katarina; Galic, Katarina Potnik] Polytech Pozega, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia",,"Stavlic, K (通讯作者)，Polytech Pozega, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia.",kstavlic@vup.hr; kpotnikgalic@vup.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,9,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1145,1153,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500112,0

Design/methodology/approach - For the determination of hygiene-technical conditions of VM, an observation list that included criteria for estimation of hygiene-technical suitability was made. A total of 51 milk samples were collected in three different seasons. The swabs and the cleaning liquid (eluates) of dispensing nozzles and chambers were also sampled. The main groups of microorganisms were determined by colony count technique according to international standards in all collected samples. Findings - The aerobic colony count was higher than 100,000 CFU/mL in 20 (39.2 per cent) of milk samples. Its mean value was 4.8 log10 CFU/mL. The mean values of Enterobacteriaceae, psychrotrophic microorganisms, lipolytes, proteolytes, yeasts and moulds together, coagulase-positive staphylococci and somatic cell count were 3.3 log10 CFU/mL, 4.1 log10 CFU/mL, 3.2 log10 CFU/mL, 3.9 log10 CFU/mL, 2.2 log10 CFU/mL, 2.8 log10 CFU/mL and 5.3 log10 cells/mL, respectively. E. coli was found in 33.3 per cent of milk samples, while Listeria monocytogenes and antibiotics were not detected. The inner surface contamination of the dispensing nozzles and chambers was estimated in the range from 1.8 log10 CFU to 6.0 log10 CFU/cm(2). The presence of detergents and disinfectants in supply valve eluates was determined in more than one-third of the samples. The hygienic-technical conditions of observed VM show some deviations from specified hygienic-technical requirements which could influence the safety of raw milk. Research limitations/implications - The data about construction and the cleaning practice of VM, included in the experiment, were not available during the inspection facility. Originality/value - In the paper the pathogenic and also the spoilage microorganisms in milk in the combination with hygienic conditions of inside surfaces of VM were studied.","[Torkar, Karmen Godic; Kirbis, Andrej; Vadnjal, Stanka; Biasizzo, Majda; Galicic, An; Jevsnik, Mojca] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Torkar, KG (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",karmen.torkar@zf.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,41,5,5,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

By using time-series modeling techniques we evaluated the vertical price transmission between producer and consumer prices in selected agricultural markets, between the years 1997-2016. To examine the long-run relationship we applied a cointegration approach. An asymmetric error correction model was employed to quantify the extent, speed and nature of price adjustment. Moreover this approach allows us to test for the existence of a non-linear relationship between prices at various levels of the vertical food supply chain. The cointegration results indicate that the producer and consumer prices are cointegrated and we found that the price transmission along the food supply chain is asymmetric.","[Vargova, Lucia; Rajcaniova, Miroslava] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Policy, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Vargová, L (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Policy, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",xvargoval@uniag.sk; miroslava.rajcaniova@uniag.sk,"Rajcaniova, Miroslava/GNP-5216-2022","Rajcaniova, Miroslava/0000-0003-4688-7690",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-15-0552],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-15-0552,,52,0,0,0,1,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1739-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,268,279,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6FH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426613300032,0

This article studies the impact of air pollution on pandemic mortality. The analysis combines a panel dataset on infant and all-age mortality with a novel measure of air pollution based on the burning of coal in a large sample of U.S. cities. We estimate that air pollution contributed significantly to pandemic mortality. Cities that used more coal experienced tens of thousands of excess deaths in 1918 relative to cities that used less coal with similar pre-pandemic socioeconomic conditions and baseline health. Factors related to poverty, public health, and the timing of onset also affected pandemic mortality. The findings support recent medical evidence on the link between air pollution and influenza infection, and suggest that poor air quality was an important cause of mortality during the pandemic.","[Clay, Karen; Severnini, Edson] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, 4800 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Lewis, Joshua] Univ Montreal, Dept Econ, 3150 Rue Jean Brillant, Montreal, PQ H3T 1N8, Canada",Carnegie Mellon University; Universite de Montreal,"Clay, K (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, 4800 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",kclay@andrew.cmu.edu; joshua.lewis@umontreal.ca; ersevernini@gmail.com,,"Clay, Karen/0000-0003-3978-6656",Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago; Heinz College; Berkman Fund at Carnegie Mellon University; Universite de Montreal,Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago; Heinz College; Berkman Fund at Carnegie Mellon University; Universite de Montreal,"We thank Martha Bailey, Antonio Bento, Christian Dippel, Walker Hanlon, Frank Lewis, and seminar participants at the 2015 NBER DAE Summer Meetings, the 2015 CNEH Meetings, the 2015 AERE Summer Conference, the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, McGill University, Carnegie Mellon University, and University of Southern California for valuable comments and suggestions.

Subsequent authors noted that private investment flows overwhelm public ones, arguing that private investment must be mobilized for a transition. However, the role of private investment in a major economic transition is poorly understood, particularly when the investment is not inherently attractive to investors and must be made attractive through policy. We present a model representing investment-macroeconomic interactions with classical features. Among its novel features is a distinction between affected sectors, which are sensitive to the amount of green capital in the economy because of network effects and forward-backward linkages, and unaffected sectors, which are relatively insensitive. We argue that affected sectors are both harder to change and nearer to the base of the economy. In model runs, we observe that in a green transition, the affected sector lags the unaffected sector with possible implications for a transition strategy. Thus, in the model, firm and investor behavior postpones deeper and more systemic changes until late in the transition.","[Kemp-Benedict, Eric] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute,"Kemp-Benedict, E (通讯作者)，Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.",eric.kemp-benedict@sei-international.org,,"Kemp-Benedict, Eric/0000-0001-5794-7172",,,,,82,23,23,6,63,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This led to a large trade surplus accompanied by large inflows of silver money. The increase in the money supply did not have much effect on rice prices or consumption, but did lower interest rates. The lower interest rates and higher real money balances caused a large increase in real estate prices. This local financial glut lasted more than 20 years. Along the China coast, the banking system allowed businesses to move funds easily in and out of areas, such as northern Taiwan, but once silver reached Taiwanese farmers in the village economy, it did not flow so easily. Studies of early finance that focus on commercial networks generally overlook such problems.","[Olds, Kelly B.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Olds, KB (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",olds@ntu.edu.tw,"Olds, Kelly/Q-9603-2019",,"Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C.

For the first time using survey data, methane production and cost functions for anaerobic digesters are estimated for U.S. dairy and swine operations. Farm size, digester inputs, digester design parameters, and construction materials all affect the productivity and profitability of an anaerobic digester. Economies of size were evident for plug flow and complete mix anaerobic digesters, which were more economically feasible on dairy farms than on swine operations. Methane production alone is not enough to provide positive net present values. On dairy farms, economic feasibility could be achieved by marketing co-products, but swine farms required government support to achieve positive NPVs.","[Cowley, Cortney; Brorsen, B.

The volume of European Union Allowances traded represents over 45% of all the carbon dioxide generated by human activity within the continent. In its first two phases (2005-2012), the behaviour of the EU ETS was erratic, as a result of discretionary policies, an oversupply of allowances and reduced economic activity due to the global crisis. These factors caused excessively low prices that distorted the initial goals of achieving low-carbon solutions. From 2013, changes were made to the market regulation mechanisms in order to correct these structural deficiencies. Empirical analysis of daily prices in the two central phases of the market, following the pattern of ARCH and GARCH models, shows that the measures taken within the EU generated greater confidence and stability in the market and thus reduced volatility. Subsequent price behaviour, following a bullish path, has confirmed the success of the measures taken and their contribution to fulfilling emission reduction targets.","[Galan-Valdivieso, Federico] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Villar-Rubio, Elena] Univ Granada, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Huete-Morales, Maria-Dolores] Univ Granada, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Fac Labour Sci, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Universidad de Almeria; University of Granada; University of Granada,"Villar-Rubio, E (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",fgalan@ual.es; elvillar@ugr.es; mdhuete@ugr.es,"Galán-Valdivieso, Federico/AAH-6589-2020; Morales, María Dolores Huete/I-3392-2015; Huete, María Dolores/HZL-5674-2023","Galán-Valdivieso, Federico/0000-0001-9632-2941; Villar Rubio, Elena/0000-0002-9079-3213; Huete Morales, Maria Dolores/0000-0002-8403-9150",Social-Labour Statistics and Demography project [30.BB.11.1101],Social-Labour Statistics and Demography project,"This contribution was carried out with funding and support from the Social-Labour Statistics and Demography project (30.BB.11.1101), being conducted at the Faculty of Labour Sciences (University of Granada).",,78,9,10,2,136,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A successful market introduction largely depends on consumer acceptance of this food. The current study investigates the motivational drivers and barriers of the adoption of Spirulina (a specific type of micro-alga)-enhanced food. By means of two qualitative studies and a quantitative survey with 1325 Belgian participants, early adopter consumer segments of Spirulina-enhanced food are identified (sporting individuals, vegetarians and foodies), and compared with a contrast group (life enjoyers). The motivational drivers and barriers to the adoption of eco-friendly Spirulina-enhanced food across the identified consumer segments is assessed. The results show that health consciousness and the willingness to compromise on taste are major motivational drivers of the adoption intention for sporting individuals, vegetarians and foodies. Neophobia only has a negative effect on this adoption intention for the foodies, while it does not play a role for sporting individuals and vegetarians. Neither food involvement nor environmental concern is a significant driver of Spirulina-enhanced food adoption intention. Implications for marketers and for policy makers are proposed.","[Moons, Ingrid; De Pelsmacker, Patrick] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Mkt, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Barbarossa, Camilla] Toulouse Business Sch, Dept Mkt & Int Business, Social & Innovat Mkt Lab, 1 Pl Alphonse Jourdain, F-31000 Toulouse, France",University of Antwerp; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education,"De Pelsmacker, P (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Mkt, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",Ingrid.moons@uantwerpen.be; c.barbarossa@tbs-education.fr; Patrick.depelsmacker@uantwerpen.be,,"De Pelsmacker, Patrick/0000-0003-1258-662X; BARBAROSSA, Camilla/0000-0002-9534-1005",,,,,70,35,36,1,57,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in empirical research, as failing to do so can produce model misspecification and preclude causal inference. In this article, we adopt a two-step procedure to deal with unobserved spatial heterogeneity, while accounting for spatial dependence in a cross-sectional setting. The first step of the procedure takes explicitly unobserved spatial heterogeneity into account to endogenously identify subsets of farms that follow a similar local production econometric model, i.e. spatial production regimes. The second step consists in the specification of a spatial autoregressive model with autoregressive disturbances and spatial regimes. The method is applied to two regional samples of olive growing farms in Italy. The main finding is that the identification of spatial regimes can help drawing a more detailed picture of the production environment and provide more accurate information to guide extension services and policy makers.","[Bille, A.

The present study examines the relationships between the utilization of diagnostic tests and socioeconomic, insurance, lifestyle, and health factors among the elderly in Malaysia. Analyses based on the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011 (NHMS 2011) suggest that high income and having private insurance are associated with a higher likelihood of utilizing diagnostic tests. However, low education levels, being employed and smoking are associated with a lower propensity to utilize. These results provide public health administrators with useful information on policy development. In particular, the proposed policies include providing the poor with nominal price of basic diagnostic tests, introducing various health education programmes to the public, creating health awareness campaigns to encourage elders who do not own private insurance to utilize diagnostic tests, as well as making basic diagnostic tests compulsory for all elders owning government insurance.","[Cheah, Yong Kang] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Changlun, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Cheah, YK (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Changlun, Malaysia.",cheahykang@gmail.com,"Cheah, Yong Kang/M-2677-2014","Cheah, Yong Kang/0000-0002-6793-7055","Population Studies Unit (PSU), University of Malaya (UM) [IF002-2014]","Population Studies Unit (PSU), University of Malaya (UM)","The author would like to thank the Director General of Health, Malaysia for his permission to use the data from the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011 and to publish this paper.

The problem is unique in that both verified data and unverified user-generated data are available for consideration during decision making. The problem is motivated by the recent need of integrating unverified social data (e.g., Twitter posts) with data from more traditional sources, such as on-the-ground assessments and aerial flyovers, to make optimal decisions during disaster relief. Integrating social data can enable identifying larger numbers of needs in shorter amounts of time, but because the information is unverified, some of it may be inaccurate. This paper seeks to provide a proof of concept illustrating how the unverified social data may be exploited. To do so, a framework for incorporating uncertain user-generated data when locating Points of Distribution (PODs) for disaster relief is presented. Then, three decision strategies that differ in how the uncertain data is considered are defined. Finally, the framework and decision strategies are demonstrated via a small computational study to illustrate the benefits user-generated data may afford across a variety of disaster scenarios.

It utilizes the constituency of Youth NGOs: YOUNGO, as a case study to examine the relationship between selection of participatory strategies, power sources (following Nasiritousi et al. in Int Environ Agreem Politics Law Econ 16(1):109-126, 2016), recognition and agency using ego and alter perceptions. It finds that young people's selection of participatory strategies and power sources is shaped by the level of agency which they perceive to be available to them. When self-perception of agency is high, young participants offer constructive policy amendments which can lead to recognition and agency, though only within certain policy areas and the silos in which they are negotiated. When self-perception of agency is low, youth interpret this as lack of recognition, leading to efforts to assert their relevance and/or to challenge procedural legitimacy: neither of which are well received by decision-makers. In reality, several of the challenges faced by young participants are not structurally unique to their constituency; however, their lack of financial resources does hinder their ability to fully utilize modes of participation which previous studies have found to be beneficial to other NSAs, such as side-events. Financial constraints also restrict the ability of youth participants, many of whom are volunteers, to develop professional relationships with key actors over time, meaning that the level of agency developed by more established, better-resourced NSAs remains largely out of reach. These findings have implications for the understanding of NSA agency, which has previously been treated as homogeneous and raises further questions regarding procedural legitimacy of the UNFCCC and its role in mobilizing and empowering the next generation.","[Thew, Harriet] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Thew, H (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",H.Thew@Leeds.ac.uk,,"Thew, Harriet/0000-0001-8671-7595",,,,,26,33,35,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

However, the accuracy of individual age statements usually remains unknown, and due to the lack of precise information it can only be assumed that excessive occurrence of multiples of five in age distributions reflects inferior numerical skills. This article addresses this lacuna by identifying 162 individuals in two independent data sources: self-reported age statements and independently kept records which are based on family heritage books and church registers. This method makes it possible to identify individual misreporting and the degree of accuracy of each individual. Findings show that not everyone who reported a multiple of five was reporting an incorrect age, nor was it the case that everyone who reported an age that was not a multiple of five was reporting an accurate age. The empirical analysis shows that the commonly used binary numeracy indicator is correlated with the observed degree of accuracy in age statements, and that a more sophisticated occupational background reduces this inaccuracy. These results tentatively suggest that the commonly used binary indicator measuring age heaping is a valuable proxy for numerical skills and occupational background in a population.","[Blum, Matthias] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Krauss, Karl-Peter] Inst Donauschwab Geschichte & Landeskunde, Tubingen, Germany",Queens University Belfast,"Blum, M (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",,,"Blum, Matthias/0000-0003-4129-9873",,,,,38,10,10,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Using a Stock-Flow Consistent approach based on the Lotka-Volterra logic, we couple its nonlinear monetary dynamics of underemployment and income distribution with abatement costs. A calibration of our model at the scale of the world economy enables us to simulate various planetary scenarios. Our findings are threefold: 1) the +2 degrees C target is already out of reach, absent negative emissions; 2) the long-term (resp. short-term) results of climate change on economic fundamentals may lead to severe economic consequences without the implementation (resp. in case of too rapid an application) of proactive climate policies. Global warming (resp. too fast transition) forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output and capital losses (resp. to lower carbon emissions), thus endangering financial stability; 3) Implementing an adequate carbon price trajectory, as well as increasing the wage share, fostering employment, and reducing private debt make it easier to avoid unintended degrowth and to reach a +2.5 degrees C target.","[Giraud, Gael; Mc Isaac, Florent] AFD, 5 Rue Roland Barthes, F-75012 Paris, France; [Bovari, Emmanuel; Giraud, Gael] Paris 1 Univ Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France; [Bovari, Emmanuel; Giraud, Gael; Mc Isaac, Florent] Inst Louis Bachelier, Chair Energy & Prosper, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France",,"Mc Isaac, F (通讯作者)，AFD, 5 Rue Roland Barthes, F-75012 Paris, France.",mcisaacf@afd.fr,,"Bovari, Emmanuel/0000-0002-5267-0802; McIsaac, Florent/0000-0002-5169-8256",Chair Energy Prosperity; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project MeET-MaDyS) [ANR-15-CE05-0028],Chair Energy Prosperity; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project MeET-MaDyS)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors are grateful to three anonymous referees for their fruitful comments and suggestions.

Initially a partial equilibrium approach is used to analyse private transport consumption as a self-produced commodity formed by household vehicle and fuel use. We particularly focus on the impact of private vehicle-augmenting technical progress in this framework. We show that household fuel use will fall if it is easier to substitute between vehicles and fuel in the household production of private transport services than it is to substitute between private transport and the composite of all other goods in overall household consumption. The analysis is then extended, through Computable General Equilibrium simulation, to investigate the wider implications of similar efficiency improvements when intermediate demand, prices and nominal income are endogenous. The subsequent reduction in the price of private transport service (not observable in market prices) allows the wage measured relative to the CPI to rise whilst the wage relative to the price of foreign goods falls. This simultaneously increases UK international competitiveness, encouraging increased exports and reduced import penetration whilst allowing employment to rise. This provides an additional supply-side stimulus to production, employment and household income.","[Figus, Gioele; Turner, Karen] Univ Strathclyde, Int Publ Policy Inst, Ctr Energy Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Figus, Gioele; Swales, J.

An understudied case is that of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), which recently have become the dominant provider of specific surgical procedures. While the majority of ASCs focus on a single specialty, a growing number are diversifying to offer a wide range of surgical services. We take a multiple output cost function approach to an empirical investigation that compares production economies in single specialty ASCs with those in multispecialty ASCs. We applied generalized estimating equation techniques to a sample of Pennsylvania ASCs for the period 2004-2014, including 73 ASCs that specialized in gastrointestinal procedures and 60 ASCs that performed gastrointestinal as well as other specialty procedures. Results indicated that both types of ASC had small room for expansion. In simulation analysis, production of GI services in specialized ASCs had a cost advantage over joint production of GI with other specialty procedures. Our results provide support for the focused factory model of production in the ASC sector.","[Carey, Kathleen] Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 715 Albany St, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Mitchell, Jean M.] Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, 37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Boston University; Georgetown University,"Carey, K (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 715 Albany St, Boston, MA 02118 USA.",kcarey@bu.edu; mitchejm@georgetown.edu,,"Carey, Kathleen/0000-0002-7924-431X",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [HSR01023768-01],Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),"The authors acknowledge the comments on earlier versions of this paper of Stephen Parente, Ellerie Weber, and Gary Young, and of participants at the International Health Economics Biennial World Congress 2015, the American Society of Health Economists Biennial Meeting 2016, and the AcademyHealth Annual Research Meeting 2016.

We compare garden and semi-forest coffee systems, including non-certified and Rainforest Alliance certified semi-forest coffee, and evaluate yields, returns to land, returns to labor and profits. We use original household- and plot-level survey from 454 households and 758 coffee plots derived from a household survey and Geographic Information Systems, and ordinary least squares and fixed effects regression models. We find that more intensified garden coffee plots bring about higher yields and returns to land than less intensified semi-forest coffee plots; and that Rainforest Alliance certification of semi-forest coffee leads to higher returns to land and labor, and profits than non-certified semi-forest and garden coffee, mainly by guaranteeing farmers a better price and not by improving yields.

To this purpose, we employ an enriched version of the agent-based Eurace macroeconomic model, where we have included an energy sector with a fossil-fuel power producer as well as a renewable-energy based one. Both power producers take pricing and capacity investment decisions based on the price of imported fossil fuel and the feed-in tariff government policy. Results show that the feed-in tariff policy is effective in fostering the sustainability transition of the energy sector and that it increases the level of investments with a positive impact on the unemployment rates. Moreover, we observe that its financing costs do not impact government finances, which actually improve following the better economic conditions. For high policy intensity, however, we observe an increasing GDP share of the investment sector in the economy, due to the building-up of renewable production capacity, with a resulting crowding out of consumption, higher interest rates and prices. The final outcome on household well-being therefore depends on what extent the chosen value judgment recognizes the importance of an economically and ecologically sustainable growth path.","[Ponta, Linda; Raberto, Marco; Cincotti, Silvano] Univ Genoa, DIME CINEF, Via Opera Pia 15, I-16145 Genoa, Italy; [Teglio, Andrea] Univ Jaume 1, Campus Riu Sec, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Teglio, Andrea] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy",University of Genoa; Universitat Jaume I; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Ponta, L (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, DIME CINEF, Via Opera Pia 15, I-16145 Genoa, Italy.",linda.ponta@unige.it; marco.raberto@unige.it; teglio@uji.es; silvano.cincotti@unige.it,"Ponta, Linda Maddalena/AFV-9751-2022; Ponta, Linda/AFN-0406-2022; Teglio, Andrea/AAI-9500-2021; Cincotti, Silvano/A-4680-2016","Ponta, Linda Maddalena/0000-0002-8997-6207; Cincotti, Silvano/0000-0001-6778-0185; Raberto, Marco/0000-0002-0624-5709",EU-FP7 collaborative project SYMPHONY16 [611875],EU-FP7 collaborative project SYMPHONY16,"The authors acknowledge EU-FP7 collaborative project SYMPHONY16 under grant no. 611875.

Here, we present methodology and results of the first study examining national mitigation pledges presented at the 2015 Paris climate summit, relative to equity benchmarks and 1.5 A degrees C-compliant global mitigation. Uniquely, pertinent ethical choices were made via deliberative processes of civil society organizations, resulting in an agreed range of effort-sharing parameters. Based on this, we quantified each country's range of fair shares of 1.5 A degrees C-compliant mitigation, using the Climate Equity Reference Project's allocation framework. Contrasting this with national 2025/2030 mitigation pledges reveals a large global mitigation gap, within which wealthier countries' mitigation pledges fall far short, while poorer countries' pledges, collectively, meet their fair share. We also present results for individual countries (e.g. China exceeding; India meeting; EU, USA, Japan, and Brazil falling short). We outline ethical considerations and choices arising when deliberating fair effort sharing and discuss the importance of separating this choice making from the scholarly work of quantitative equity modelling itself. Second, we elaborate our approach for quantifying countries' fair shares of a global mitigation effort, the Climate Equity Reference Framework. Third, we present and discuss the results of this analysis with emphasis on the role of mitigation support. In concluding, we identify twofold obligations for all countries in a justice-centred implementation of 1.5 A degrees C-compliant mitigation: (1) unsupported domestic reductions and (2) engagement in deep international mitigation cooperation, through provision of international financial and other support, or through undertaking additional supported mitigation activities. Consequently, an equitable pathway to 1.5 A degrees C can only be imagined with such large-scale international cooperation and support; otherwise, 1.5 A degrees C-compliant mitigation will remain out of reach, impose undue suffering on the world's poorest, or both.","[Holz, Christian; Kartha, Sivan; Athanasiou, Tom] Climate Equ Reference Project, 2150 Allston Way,Suite 460, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; [Kartha, Sivan] Stockholm Environm Inst, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA 02144 USA; [Athanasiou, Tom] EcoEquity, 2150 Allston Way,Suite 460, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA",,"Holz, C (通讯作者)，Climate Equ Reference Project, 2150 Allston Way,Suite 460, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.",cholz@climateequityreference.org; skartha@sei-us.org; toma@ecoequity.org,"Holz, Christian/S-7519-2019","Kartha, Sivan/0000-0002-6014-2161; Holz, Ceecee/0000-0003-0722-1044",Rockefeller Brothers' Fund; Christian Aid; WWF International; Oxfam International,Rockefeller Brothers' Fund; Christian Aid; WWF International; Oxfam International,"The authors are grateful for the immensely fruitful discussions among the members of the Civil Society Equity Review coalition that are too many to name here.

Using comprehensive farm-level data from the eastern Brazilian Amazon, we found that market proximity had a significant positive correlation with fertilizer adoption, even after controlling for liquidity, land tenure, education, experience and access to rural extension services. Nevertheless, few smallholders completely replaced nutrients from vegetation with fertilizers. Instead, we found that a hybrid system that combines nutrients from vegetation and fertilizers was approximately twice as common as exclusive fertilizer use. We suggest that the option for this diversified nutrient portfolio may result not only from a lack of capital or knowledge regarding return on fertilizer use, but also from the need to adapt to the economic constraints facing smallholders and minimize risk. Results indicate that a rural extension program aimed at supporting a rapid and complete replacement of ashes from vegetation by fertilizers could prove unsuccessful for Amazonian smallholders.","[Morello, Thiago Fonseca] Alameda Univ S-N, BR-09606045 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil; [Piketty, Marie-Gabrielle] TA C-47-F,Campus Int Balllarguet, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Gardner, Toby] Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D,Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Parry, Luke; Barlow, Jos] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Ferreira, Joice] Embrapa Amazonia Oriental, BR-66017970 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Tancredi, Nicola S.] Coordenacao Reg ICMBio 4, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Tancredi, Nicola S.] Ave Julio Cesar 7060, BR-66617420 Bairro Val De Cans, Brazil; [Piketty, Marie-Gabrielle] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Tancredi, Nicola S.] Inst Chico Mendes Conservacao Biodiversidade ICMB, Itaituba, Para, Brazil",Stockholm Environment Institute; Lancaster University; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); CIRAD,"Morello, TF (通讯作者)，Fed Univ ABC, Ctr Modelling Engn & Appl Social Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",fonseca.morello@ufabc.edu.br; marie-gabrielle.piketty@cirad.fr; toby.gardner@sei-international.org,"Silva, Thiago/GON-8711-2022; Barlow, Jos/HGE-9486-2022; Parry, Luke/ABD-4194-2021","Barlow, Jos/0000-0003-4992-2594; Parry, Luke/0000-0003-0330-9516",,,,,81,15,16,1,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Design/methodology/approach Self-reported data concerning the consumption of milk, yogurt and dairy products in general were collected online among 1,705 adults in Canada. Also included in the survey instrument were measures of NK and health beliefs as well as questions from the food technology neophobia scale. Anti-consumption of milk, yogurt and dairy as well as alternative dairy consumption as a function of these characteristics, in addition to demographic characteristics, is analysed using probit models. Findings Individuals who demonstrate resistance to innovations in food technology, those with lower levels of dairy-specific NK, and people who have less belief that dairy avoidance will have negative impacts on their health are more likely to be anti-consumers of milk and/or yogurt. The same is true for dairy products in general with the exception that people with higher levels of dairy-specific NK are more likely to be anti-consumers of dairy products in general. Originality/value Inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D has negative consequences for long-term health. Given that dairy products are the primary source of these nutrients in the Canadian diet, it is important to understand the reasons behind dairy anti-consumption so that appropriate policy measures can be taken to address potential public health issues.","[Allen, Shannon; Goddard, Ellen] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Farmer, Anna] Univ Alberta, Dept Agr Food & Nutr Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Allen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",ssaville@ualberta.ca,,"Goddard, Ellen/0000-0002-5638-0562","Canadian Dairy Commission; Food and Health Innovation Initiative (Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Alberta)","Canadian Dairy Commission; Food and Health Innovation Initiative (Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Alberta)","We would like to thank the Canadian Dairy Commission and the Food and Health Innovation Initiative (Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Alberta) for financial support.",,53,23,24,4,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, the existing wireless pick-by-light systems have limited range and introduce additional maintenance efforts, which make them inapplicable for bigger warehouses. This paper presents a wireless pick-by-light system based on LoRaWAN, a leading LPWAN standard, which is fully scalable. The proposed system offers long range due to unique LoRa RF modulation technique. In order to extend the battery life and thereby to minimize maintenance costs, the pick-by-light modules are built on power optimized LoRaWAN end devices. The system also suggests RSSI based asset tracking inside warehouses within the same framework for smarter routing of the human picker. In order to verify the proposed system, a prototype is developed and evaluated.

Stated preference (SP) methods are a particularly potent class of economic valuation methods, but they are also particularly controversial. In response to accumulating criticism of SP, deliberative monetary valuation (DMV) has been proposed as an alternative approach and has gained considerable attention in recent years. However, being a combination of elements from two theories-neoclassical welfare economics and theory of deliberative democracy-it lacks a convincing, consistent theoretical foundation. In our paper, we propose some clarifying adjustments regarding rationality assumptions and aggregation issues by drawing upon the work of Amartya Sen. We find that many of his ideas lead to a harmonisation of DMV's theoretical foundations, e.g. meta-rankings of preferences, impartial spectator and the plurality of impartial reasons.

The second aim is to answer the question whether these attitudes have changed with the introduction of active participation of citizens through the use of the participatory budget. The survey included 40 problematic questions. In the majority of them a five-step Likert scale was applied. The results of the survey show that the dating analysed period surveyed groups of questioned young Poles had very low interest in gmina financial activity but it was slightly rising. The feeling of real influence on local issues among the respondents is slowly rising what may result, among other things, from the fact that the processes of participatory budget in municipalities became widespread. Additionally, the percentage of people who do not feel the need to increase their impact on municipal affairs continues to raise what can be caused by existing more satisfactory possibilities for citizens to participate in the activities of municipalities.","[Bednarska-Olejniczak, Dorota; Olejniczak, Jaroslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Bednarska-Olejniczak, D (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",dorota.olejniczak@ue.wroc.pl; jaroslaw.olejniczaki@ue.wroc.pl,"Bednarska-Olejniczak, Dorota/AFQ-1572-2022; Bednarska-Olejniczak, Dorota/R-6238-2017; Olejniczak, Jarosław/F-7780-2014","Bednarska-Olejniczak, Dorota/0000-0002-4472-0099; Olejniczak, Jarosław/0000-0003-2028-8446",,,,,14,2,2,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-700-8,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,1,,,,62,72,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL2ZZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443500006,0

Also, body image dissatisfaction may lower the likelihood of engaging in long-term healthy eating habits and in the level of attention paid to the quality of the food consumed. As a result, body image may be related to consumers' choice to purchase and consume health-enhancing food products. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach A pilot study of a small sample of Italian yogurt consumers was employed to explore if there is a relationship between respondents' level of body image dissatisfaction and the number of health-enhancing yogurt choices. The data were collected by means of a virtual-shelf technique and were analysed using a negative binomial regression. Findings Results indicate that body image dissatisfaction is inversely related to the number of yogurt packages with health-enhancing features chosen from the virtual shelf. Also, respondents who read the nutrition label and those with more knowledge regarding leading functional yogurt brands, selected a higher number of functional yogurts from the virtual shelf compared, especially among women. Research limitations/implications The results indicate that body image dissatisfaction is inversely related to the number of yogurt packages with health-enhancing features chosen from the virtual shelf. Also, respondents who read the nutrition label and those with more knowledge regarding leading health-enhancing yogurt brands selected a higher number of health-enhancing yogurts options from the virtual shelf compared to others, especially among women.

Specifically, it aims to understand which attributes are most likely to increase consumption and garner price premiums. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses key informant interviews and a convenience sample (n=203) of supermarket shoppers in Vermont. It uses Likert-type scales to measure the likelihood of increased purchase and paying price premiums based on a series attributes including animal welfare, fair labor standards, family farms and environmental stewardship. It calculates and compares mean ratings of each attribute and use an ordinal regression to measure the effect of demographic attributes on each attribute's rating. Findings Interviewed stakeholders named low milk prices and evolving industry structure as harming dairy farm viability. They list supply control and improved promotion as potential solutions. Survey respondents say attributes supporting animal welfare, farm workers, family farms and healthy soil are most likely to garner increased consumption and price premiums. Research limitations/implications The authors use a convenience sample, so generalization to larger populations is not advisable. Practical implications Promotion around animal welfare, farm workers, family farms and healthy soil is most likely to be effective, based on the results of this study. The survey responses are very highly correlated, suggesting that a multi-attribute eco-label may garner the most support. Social implications This work can inform efforts to promote dairy farm viability, an important sector of the agricultural economy in Vermont and elsewhere in the USA.

Evidence of acrylamide causing tumours in rodents has led to the chemical being classified as probably carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The purpose of this paper is to examine consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for a reduction in the acrylamide content of baby food and, therefore, a reduction in the risk of cancer. Design/methodology/approach - A discrete choice experiment is conducted on UK consumers incorporating different levels of seven attributes: packaging, production method (organic, GM and conventional), acrylamide level, sugar, salt, one of five portions of fruit and vegetable per day and price. Consumer WTP for low acrylamide content is estimated using a mixed logit model. Findings - The empirical results indicate consumers assign a high value to safer baby food, with low acrylamide content. The WTP premium for baby food with low acrylamide (105 per cent) is the highest of all attributes assessed. Consumers also have a preference for organic baby food, in contrast to an aversion towards GM. The study results indicate that reducing the acrylamide content in baby food is desirable for consumers. Originality/value - This is the first study to estimate consumers' WTP for reducing the acrylamide content of baby food in the UK. Existing research has been limited to examining the exposure of young children, in addition to the potential health risks.","[Harkness, Caroline; Areal, Francisco] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Areal, F (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading, Berks, England.",f.j.areal@reading.ac.uk,"Areal, Francisco Jose/ABC-8321-2021; Areal, F.

The paper contribute to the literature on hedonic pricing by applying this model to the Chinese market and including COO as product attribute. Design/methodology/approach A hedonic price model is adopted to measure the effect of search attributes on wine sales in China. A reduced form of the classical hedonic analysis is used as in Nerlove (1995), given the assumption that prices and attributes are taken as exogenous to consumers. Findings Results show that the COO represents the attribute that most influences wine sales in China. Protected indicators of origin, which denote wine with recognised certificates, are also significant, reinforcing the importance of the production area. Vintage attribute does not impact sales, suggesting a low level of consumer experience with wine. Research limitations/implications The study suffers from the limitations of results' generalisability, given the size and characteristics of the sample. In the future research, the model should be tested on a larger sample. Moreover, it can be applied on other products, in which COO represents an information and quality cue. Practical implications Firms operating in sectors where COO implies specific characteristics of quality should enhance this attribute in their marketing strategies to increase their competitive advantage. Also policy implications with respect to the governmental actions to support wine producers are discussed. Originality/value Hedonic price analysis represents a well-established model; however, to the best of the authors' knowledge it has never been used in China before. This study also highlights the primary role of COO as search attribute in wine purchase.","[Hu, Lala] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Venice, Italy; [Baldin, Andrea] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Copenhagen Business School,"Hu, LL (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Venice, Italy.",lala.hu@unive.it; ab.mpp@cbs.dk,"Baldin, Andrea/G-9320-2019","Baldin, Andrea/0000-0002-4386-2423; Hu, Lala/0000-0001-5492-3706",,,,,69,17,17,2,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In addition, the paper finds a low level of knowledge about the use of techniques and methods for managing and evaluating risks in the surveyed companies. In addition, the survey attempted to ascertain whether there was a designated person, or possibly a department, within the company in charge of risk management. Based on the conducted research it can be concluded that there is a significant need for additional education on risk management among non-financial companies in Croatia. Thanks to this analysis it can be construed that the lack of familiarity with the basic methods and techniques probably had an influence on the overall exposure of the economy to the last crisis. Finally, this research points to the weakness and unpreparedness of businesses in Croatia and their susceptibility to future shocks.","[Karanovic, Goran] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42,Pp 97, Opatija 51410, Croatia; [Karanovic, Bisera] Business Sch PAR, Trg Rijecke Rezolucije 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Stambuk, Ana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Karanovic, G (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42,Pp 97, Opatija 51410, Croatia.",gorank@fthm.hr; bisera.karanovic@par.hr; ana.stambuk@efri.hr,"Štambuk, Ana/Y-9689-2018; Karanovic, Goran/H-1617-2019","Štambuk, Ana/0000-0002-5138-1662; Karanovic, Goran/0000-0002-6515-935X",,,,,23,1,1,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,638,649,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900066,0

Design/methodology/approach The performance is evaluated through a discrete event simulation model, which mirrors a part of one of Norway's largest grocery retailer and uses their POS data to reflect a realistic demand pattern of 232 stores for one year. Findings The findings indicate that a current age-based replenishment policy (EWA policy) provides a significant improvement of 17.7 percent increase in availability for perishables with a shelf life between 4 and 11 days, but suffers from high inventory levels and only reduces waste by 3.4 percent compared to a base stock policy. A proposed adjustment to the EWA policy, EWA(SS), provides a more balanced performance in the conducted study with a reduction of 10.7 percent waste and 10.3 percent increase in availability by keeping the same average inventory level. Practical implications Sharing and utilizing RSL information for replenishment of perishables with a predetermined shelf life between 6 and 11 days can be beneficial, and could enable the replenishment processes to be automated. However, for products with longer shelf life, the benefits slowly diminish. Originality/value The study proposes a new age-based replenishment policy which in the conducted study showed a more balanced performance improvement, in both waste and availability, compared with previous replenishment policies.","[Kiil, Kasper; Hvolby, Hans-Henrik; Strandhagen, Jan Ola] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Kiil, Kasper; Hvolby, Hans-Henrik] Aalborg Univ, Dept Mat & Prod, CELOG, Tekn Nat Videnskabelige Fak, Aalborg, Denmark; [Fraser, Kym] Univ Kurdistan Hewler, Kurdistan Business Sch, Erbil, Iraq; [Fraser, Kym] Aalborg Univ, Ctr Logist, Aalborg, Denmark; [Fraser, Kym] Univ South Australia, Future Ind Inst, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Dreyer, Heidi] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Aalborg University; University of Kurdistan Hewler; Aalborg University; University of South Australia; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Kiil, K (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Trondheim, Norway.;Kiil, K (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Mat & Prod, CELOG, Tekn Nat Videnskabelige Fak, Aalborg, Denmark.",kasper.kiil@relexsolutions.com; hhh@celog.dk; kym.fraser@unisa.edu.au; heidi.c.dreyer@ntnu.no; ola.strandhagen@ntnu.no,"Hvolby, Hans-Henrik/AAY-8028-2020","Hvolby, Hans-Henrik/0000-0002-5574-5216; Strandhagen, Jan Ola/0000-0003-3741-9000; Fraser, Kym/0000-0003-3590-0597",Norwegian Research Council (NRC),Norwegian Research Council (NRC)(Research Council of Norway),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance provided by the Norwegian Research Council (NRC) for the financial support of Retail Supply Chain 2020.

However, the performance of FBs under the formal care approach has not yet been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the quantity of food donation (QFD) and the variety of food donation (VFD) of FBs in Korea. Design/methodology/approach - Aspects of quantity of donations, variety of donations, and changes in the number of donors and recipients for Korean FBs were considered. Regression analysis and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index were employed for the analysis, and data were collected through on-site interviews in Korea and online information. Findings - Korean FBs were initially based on the concept of gift exchanges, with the expectation of receiving something in return, and thus did not employ the concept of real gifts or charity. Moreover, Korean FB development was compelled, as this exchange was enacted into law. Therefore, the QFD increased rapidly post the legislation of FBs, a fact not observed in other countries. The authors verified that the QFD and VFD in Korea increased significantly within a decade due to the government intervention. Research limitations/implications - Aspects such as satisfaction and the nutritional needs of FB beneficiaries are not investigated in detail. Originality/value - The study found that global FBs, which are an inherently informal system, could also be successfully developed as a policy-based formal care system.","[Kobayashi, Tomio] Aichi Inst Technol, Fac Business, Dept Management, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Kularatne, Jagath] Nagoya Univ, Int Cooperat Ctr Agr Educ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Taneichi, Yutaka] Yamaguchi Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol Innovat, Div Agr Sci, Yamaguchi, Japan; [Aihara, Nobuhide] Nagoya Bunri Univ, Fac Hlth & Human Life, Dept Food Business, Inazawa, Japan",Nagoya University; Yamaguchi University,"Kobayashi, T (通讯作者)，Aichi Inst Technol, Fac Business, Dept Management, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.",t-kobayashi@aitech.ac.jp,"Kobayashi, Tomio/L-1536-2017; KOBAYASHI, Tomio/HCI-3499-2022",,JSPS KAKENHI [15K07627]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K07627] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The key issue concerns the assessment of the attempt to optimize the economic and financial performance of the VAT settlement. The farmer chooses and settles VAT in a flat-rate system or according to the general rules. The question is which form is more favourable. On the basis of mathematical formulas, an appropriate criterion has been selected for the choice of the form of VAT settlements in agriculture. Even though VAT has been functioning in Polish agriculture for many years, its rules are misinterpreted. From the point of view of the ordinary farmer, it means many cases of erroneous choices which, consequently, reduce his efficiency. This paper systemises knowledge in this regard. It also shows possible changes in the law and their potential impact on farmers' choices of a VAT taxation form.","[Kondraszuk, Tomasz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Jaworski, Jacek] WSB Univ Gdansk, Dept Finance, Gdansk, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Kondraszuk, T (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",tomasz_kondraszuk@sggw.pl; jjaworski@wsb.gda.pl,"Jaworski, Jacek/AAK-7010-2021; Jaworski, Jacek/AFS-4868-2022","Jaworski, Jacek/0000-0002-6629-3497; Kondraszuk, Tomasz/0000-0003-0359-3123",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,124,130,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.127,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500015,0

Slovenia and Croatia as EU Member states should follow also EU regulation. During the accession process to EU Slovenia was not very successful in implementing the environmental regulation. Nevertheless eco taxes was implemented far before the accession process and they were in accordance to recommendations at EU level. The first Eco tax was introduced in 1995 and after that much more eco taxes followed. In Croatia the first Eco tax was introduced in 1994 and it was the special tax (excise duty) on petroleum products. In 2010, in accordance with the recommendations of the EU, Croatia has replaced this special tax on petroleum products with excise duties on energy products and electricity. Excise duties on energy products and electricity, in addition to petroleum products, include energy products used for heating and transport, as well as electricity. Environmental taxes are one of the most suitable and widely used policy instruments for tackling the pollution problems. As an instrument of environmental policy, an environmental tax is a tax, the tax base of which is a physical unit (or proxy of a physical unit) of something that has a proven, specific negative impact on the environment, and which is identified as a tax in the European System of Accounts (ESA 95). These taxes have a double role. They are in fact used to alleviate the burden of other taxes and are also earmarked, in the sense that the revenues they raise are pre-committed to specific expenditure programmes and as such provide an income source for environmental protection in municipal and state budgets. Despite the number of different eco taxes the revenues from eco taxes are low, and at EU level even decreasing. Partly this is the result of other environmental measurements that promote more environmental friendly production. The goals of environmental policy can be easily figured from budget documents, especially those connected to performance budgeting. In the paper we will present the development of eco taxation in Slovenia and Croatia and comparison of budget performance indicators of environmental policy in both countries.","[Kotnik, Ziga; Klun, Maja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Grdinic, Maja] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Ljubljana; University of Rijeka,"Kotnik, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Adm, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",ziga.kotnik@fu.uni-lj.si; maja.klun@fu.uni-lj.si; maja.grdinic@efri.hr,"Kotnik, Žiga/ADB-2849-2022; Grdinic, Maja/R-5094-2018","Kotnik, Žiga/0000-0003-2723-9364; Grdinic, Maja/0000-0002-8648-6018",Croatian Science Foundation under the project Tax Policy and Fiscal Consolidation [8174],Croatian Science Foundation under the project Tax Policy and Fiscal Consolidation,This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project Tax Policy and Fiscal Consolidation (8174),,0,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,558,566,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900058,0

However, every election in the Czech Republic is relatively costly, the country spends more than CZK 1 billion a year, most of which is the cost of municipalities. The aim of the paper is to analyze the most significant costs of these municipalities, using the data of the Czech Statistical Office and the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic. Significant differences in individual cost items have been identified, including in municipalities that are similar in size (number of eligible voters, number of electoral districts), as well as their powers (statutory cities, municipalities with extended powers, etc.). The possible way to reduce these differences (and costs) is to reduce the number of electoral districts, leading in particular to a fall in wage costs for members of the district electoral commission, which represent the most significant part of the total cost of municipalities.","[Kral, Martin; Hajek, Ladislav] Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Král, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",martin.kral.2@uhk.cz; ladislav.hajek@uhk.cz,,,"Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic [2103]","Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic","This study is supported by internal research project No. 2103 Investment evaluation within concept Industry 4.0 at Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",,11,7,7,0,4,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-700-8,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,1,,,,472,481,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL2ZZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443500046,0

Producer groups and organizations play an important role in Polish agriculture. Through group activity Polish farmers obtain numerous benefits, achievement of which would be impossible if they acted on their own. Since Poland joined the European Union, entities could receive financial aid within the Rural Development Programme. In the 2014-2020 programming period, conditions to receive financial aid have significantly changed in comparison to previous periods. Most of all, financial support was aimed only at new groups which were approved before 1 January 2014 at the latest. Moreover, groups gathering producers of poultry, poultry meat (fresh and chilled), and fruit and vegetables groups were excluded from receiving financial aid within RDP 2014-2020. By 30 September 2017, Agricultural producer groups were paid nearly 240 million EUR. Introducing new restrictive regulations concerning support for producer groups and organizations may contribute to a breakdown of the process of creating these entities. Data indicate that the number of agricultural producer groups decreased significantly in comparison to e.g. 2013 when new legal regulations had not been applied yet. The aim of the paper is to discuss the mechanism of providing financial aid to agricultural producer groups within the Rural Development Programme.

The action research methodology was applied, where a range of co-researchers contributed towards study design and review. Findings The research reveals the main barriers to recycling and how such perceptions differ depending on whether the respondents do or do not recycle, with convenience and cost being the main issue according to the already recycling participants. On the other hand, participants who do not recycle state that their main reason is not enough waste and lack of space. Practical implications Participants recommended a range of measures, which could improve the current food waste services in Bristol. For example, they suggest that business engagement should address the barriers voiced by the participants applying the framings used by them, rather than assuming restaurants and cafes are not aware of the issue. By inviting a variety of non-academic stakeholders into the process of research design and analysis, the project addressed the imbalances in knowledge production and policy design.

To take a global view of these controversial uses, this paper reconsiders the genesis of natural capital as an economic concept, not in its present-day form, but from its almost unknown, ancient origins in the 1900s-1910s, in the writing of Alvin S.

Alternatively, we estimate here a fiscal reaction function for the Spanish regions over the period 1995-2010, paying special attention to the impact of the federal fiscal stance on regional fiscal imbalances. Our results indicate that higher public deficits for the central government encourage larger fiscal imbalances at the regional level.

We also find a significant impact from fiscal decisions taken by governments at the same decision-making tier in a specific region.","[Molina-Parra, Agustin; Martinez-Lopez, Diego] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ, Off 3-1-43,Ctra Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Molina-Parra, A (通讯作者)，Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ, Off 3-1-43,Ctra Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",amolpar@upo.es; dmarlop1@upo.es,"Martinez-Lopez, Diego/AAL-8379-2020","Martinez Lopez, Diego/0000-0001-8651-582X",Fundacion Publica Andaluza Centro de Estudios Andaluces [PRY054/14],Fundacion Publica Andaluza Centro de Estudios Andaluces,"This paper has been totally funded by the Fundacion Publica Andaluza Centro de Estudios Andaluces through the project PRY054/14 in its IX Call for Research Projects.

The two regions share similar cultural heritage, whereas now they are on similar paths of development directed towards postindustrial economy and creative industries. The aim of the study was to determine the strategies of cultural tourism in both regions, the extent to which the cultural tourism is integrated into the tourism offer of the regions, the type of culture, cultural heritage and cultural/civilizational identity that is promoted for tourism purposes, and to explore whether inauthentic/simulational or authentic tourism is being promoted. A mixed method content analysis was conducted on a sample of tourism websites (N = 107) of two distinct tourist stakeholders in both regions, with the appropriate checks of research validity and reliability. The results show differences between the two regions with regard to the cultural tourism strategies, wherein Slavonia and Baranja opts for traditions/ethnic cultural tourism, while Vojvodina follows a more diversified strategy, both in cultural tourism and in tourism in general. Notwithstanding the fact that both regions emphasise their locality uniqueness to a same degree, Vojvodina is much more involved into projecting representations of authenticity and difference from everyday/mass/artifical that can be experienced when visiting Vojvodina. It seems that Slavonia and Baranja focus on tourists that seek peace and relaxation, with ensuing shallow cultural experiences (casual and incidental cultural tourists), while Vojvodina aims more for tourists who seek and/or find deeper and more elaborated cultural experiences (purposeful cultural tourists). The authors bring the paper to a close by delineating practical and theoretical importance of the study and prospects for the future research.","[Pavic, Zeljko] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Lorenza Jegera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Davidovic, Nemanja] European Affairs Fund AP Vojvodina, Dept Cooperat, European Reg & Int Inst, Hajduk Veljkova 11, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Armenski, Tanja] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradov 3, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of Novi Sad,"Pavic, Z (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Lorenza Jegera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",zpavic@ffos.hr; davidovic@vojvodinahouse.eu; tanja.armenski@dgt.uns.ac.rs,"Pavić, Željko/AAD-1976-2020; Pavic, Zeljko/ABD-2198-2021","Pavic, Zeljko/0000-0001-7027-4451",,,,,25,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,879,887,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900092,0

Thereby, strive is to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of certain activities which implies a developed reporting system as a prerequisite for measuring achieved results. The public health system in the Republic of Croatia is organized through health and public health institutes at county level. Their activities are aimed at improving the health of the population. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the current reporting and efficiency measurement system and to suggest improvements that will enable the implementation and integration of strategic thinking of organizational units within the public health system. The use of contemporary methods and strategic management tools requires a comprehensive and unified system that ensures information base for monitoring the efficiency of results and the effectiveness of set goals. Accordingly, the objectives of the research are to identify the features of the existing reporting system on the efficiencyand effectiveness of public health services and related organizational structure on a sample of four regional public health institutes and the national institute, whichrepresent the majority of public health services in the Republic of Croatia. The analysis was conducted based on a survey, interviews and available official data for six common organizational units. The major results show discrepancy incertain forms of reporting between the institutes and the inconsistency of organizational solutions for the implementation of particular programs and activities, with an emphasis on internal recording, analysis and reporting. The contribution of this paper is in the critical analysis and the proposed reporting system model as a basis for measuring the efficiency using modern strategic tools, for the purpose of evaluating and developing health care programs, health standards and promoting overall population health.","[Petrlic, Antonija; Fabic, Mirjana Grcic; Vitezic, Neda] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Petrlic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia.",antonija.petrlic@efri.hr; mirjana.grcic.fabic@efri.hr; neda.vitezic@efri.hr,"Fabic, Mirjana Grcic/ABC-6230-2020; Vitezic, Neda/R-9943-2018; PETRLIĆ, ANTONIJA/R-6639-2018; Grčić Fabić, Mirjana/GNP-4472-2022; Fabić, Mirjana Grčić/R-3492-2018","PETRLIĆ, ANTONIJA/0000-0001-9750-4923; Grčić Fabić, Mirjana/0000-0002-8995-7452; Fabić, Mirjana Grčić/0000-0002-8995-7452",,,,,30,0,0,0,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,660,669,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900068,0

Any manager of small and medium-sized enterprises looks for suitable strategies that will enable them to succeed in a competitive environment. Most often, they focus on common reducing costs, increasing market share, introducing new products, strengthening relationships with customers and retaining talented staff in the organization. Some managers, however, still do not realize that communication is the most important tool for improving the organization's performance. Currently, the communication process is no longer only the exchange of information. It is the basis of influencing prosperity of the organization and its competitiveness. In any organization, communication of managers is both a factor that unites people who work in it and participate differently on its performance, and partly a factor that actively participate in all management processes. The communication is used to the goals set in the strategies for evaluation and monitoring, and particularly it is important in the field of human relations. Undoubtedly, it is the cornerstone of the success of any organization. Both the internal communication for operational decisions and the communication of strategic decisions are of great importance to improving the performance of SMEs and optimize their management. Effective communication link setup is not only important for the consistency of all work activities, but also for stimulating job performance, work behaviour, motivation and employee loyalty. The paper deals with the influence of managerial communication to the performance of 148 SMEs.","[Rehor, Petr; Vrchota, Jaroslav] Univ South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Rehor, P (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",rehor@ef.jcu.cz; vrchota@ef.jcu.cz,"Řehoř, Petr/S-1425-2017; Vrchota, Jaroslav/D-6145-2016","Vrchota, Jaroslav/0000-0002-8363-3131",[GAJU 79/2013 / S]; [GAJU 053/2016/S],;,This paper was supported by GAJU 79/2013 / S and GAJU 053/2016/S.,,30,0,0,0,3,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-701-5,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,2,,,,258,267,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL3AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443600025,0

Design/methodology/approach Discriminant analysis was applied to a national sample of 3,004 respondents in Italy to separately depict local and organic consumers' profiles based on personal values, eating habits, food purchase motivations, and involvement. Findings Organic consumption showed a lower penetration compared to local consumption. However, organic consumers adhered to more sustainable consumption principles. Adopting healthy diets and sharing self-transcendence values emerged as common traits of both consumers. Regular consumption made both consumers' profiles look similar by sharing more sustainability-related traits. Research limitations/implications Only two out of the different types of foods promoted as sustainable were considered. Further insights could be made regarding fair trade foods and food promoted by voluntary sustainability standards. Practical implications The overlapping motivations of the two consumer profiles provided evidence of the potential efficacy of joint promotion in favour of sustainability and demonstrated that a synergic approach among food systems could foster more sustainable consumption. Originality/value This study identified common sustainability motivations among different consumer groups, based on sustainable food categories, adopting a holistic vision of SFC.","[Scalvedi, Maria Luisa; Saba, Anna] CREA Res Ctr Food & Nutr, Rome, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Scalvedi, ML (通讯作者)，CREA Res Ctr Food & Nutr, Rome, Italy.",marialuisa.scalvedi@crea.gov.it; anna.saba@crea.gov.it,"Saba, Anna/U-4421-2017","Saba, Anna/0000-0002-3682-2036; Scalvedi, Maria Luisa/0000-0003-4604-2276",,,,,68,38,39,7,71,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.
