Why and how did they fail to predict the scale of the challenge to the European Union manifest in the Leave vote of the referendum? Mainly supportive of the hegemony of the European Union and its vision of social progress, social scientists have propagated a view of normality which legitimizes that hegemony through the interpretation of its cultural opposition as irrational, emotional and populist. While the cultural tensions driving the Leave victory have been extensively documented, the implications of this long-standing divide for the UK state, the party system and democratic citizenship have received only limited attention from university intellectuals. In their commitment to the European Union hegemony, they have interpreted the cultural challenge in ways likely only to increase its strength.","[Salter, Brian] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Salter, B (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2 2LS, England.",brian.g.salter@kcl.ac.uk,,"Salter, Brian/0000-0002-0779-2712",,,,,123,6,6,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

The lecture argues that by contrast these aspects can be addressed by the Schumpeterian growth paradigm in which: (i) growth results primarily from innovation; (ii) innovation responds to incentives shaped by economic policies and institutions; (iii) new innovations replace old technologies (creative destruction).","[Aghion, Philippe] Coll France, 3 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France; [Aghion, Philippe] London Sch Econ, London, England",Universite PSL; College de France; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Aghion, P (通讯作者)，Coll France, 3 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.;Aghion, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",paghion@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,28,0,0,4,19,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Based on issue characteristics and firm characteristics, we investigate the likelihood that the inclusion of covenant clauses in financial contracts is positively related to the riskiness of bond issues. Using a hand-collected database of Russian firms that place bonds in both the domestic and Eurobond markets, we provide evidence that Russian bondholders use covenant protection to compensate for different creditor protections when the firm has Eurobonds in its debt portfolio. We also find a general negative relation between covenant protection and the bond's yield.","[Bazzana, Flavio; Gabriele, Roberto] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy; [Zadorozhnaya, Anna] Moscow State Univ Railway Engn, Moscow, Russia",University of Trento; Russian University of Transport,"Bazzana, F (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Trento, Italy.",flavio.bazzana@unitn.it; anna_zador@mail.ru; roberto.gabriele@unitn.it,"Gabriele, Roberto/AAY-2080-2021; Zadorozhnaya, Anna/AAQ-6634-2021; Bazzana, Flavio/N-9675-2013","Bazzana, Flavio/0000-0003-1467-6776; Nikiforova, Anna/0000-0002-3527-017X; Gabriele, Roberto/0000-0003-4819-0758",,,,,33,3,3,3,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1566-0141,1873-6173,,EMERG MARK REV,Emerg.

We study the totality of information requests filed with Mexican federal government agencies from 2003 to 2015, over 1 million requests in all. We use unsupervised methods to categorize requests, revealing the diversity of topics including environment, security, budgets, and government procurement and employees. While many topics have clear public accountability-seeking purposes, others are focused on more private, micro-political goals. Analysis over time and across states reveals linkage between information demand and issues of public interest such as environmental impacts and criminal violence. Our results demonstrate that, given functioning access-to-information institutions, citizens in a transitional democracy really do demand information relevant to public accountability.

We find that EME local currency sovereign bond yields are indeed influenced by exchange rate risk (volatility and expected depreciation of the exchange rate). This finding holds when controlling for endogeneity and a number of key domestic and international factors. We also show that the effect of exchange rate volatility has strengthened over time, particularly since the US Federal reserve announced in May 2013 that it would reduce the pace and size of its large-scale asset purchases. The influence of exchange rate volatility is less pronounced in EMEs with higher shares of foreign ownership of local currency sovereign bonds, larger capital account openness and greater exchange rate flexibility. Our findings have a number of implications for policymakers, in particular as to how emerging market economies can be vulnerable to perception of greater exchange rate risk as global monetary conditions tighten.","[Gadanecz, Blaise; Miyajima, Ken; Shu, Chang] Bank Int Settlements, Monetary & Econ Dept, Cent Bahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Gadanecz, B (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Monetary & Econ Dept, Cent Bahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",blaise.gadanecz@bis.org,,"Miyajima, Ken/0000-0001-6250-6697",,,,,63,17,20,2,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

To this end, we make use of three models (a baseline, an asymmetric and a threshold model) based on the empirical growth literature augmented by debt. By exploring the time series dimension in order to properly account for the historical experience of each country in the sample, we aim to detect potential heterogeneities in the relationship across euro-area economies. Our findings suggest that while public debt thresholds are higher in peripheral than in central countries, private debt thresholds are higher in core euro-area countries. Moreover, while a reduction in nonfinancial corporations' and public debt has a negligible effect on growth, the response is very relevant in the case of households but clearly differs across countries (the average impact being higher in peripheral than in central countries). Therefore, according to our results, peripheral countries especially should be aware of the adverse consequences of private debt accumulation and a reduction in households' debt in those countries may be crucial to stimulate consumption and growth.

Our analysis suggests that court-ordered redistricting in the 1960s significantly influenced the 1/n effect, because dividing districts (increasing their number) and merging districts (reducing their number) both reduce public spending. After redistricting, the positive relationship between seats and spending holds for lower chambers in bicameral legislatures.

We distinguish close social networks (composed of friends and family) abroad and at the current location, and broad social networks (composed of same-country residents with intention to migrate, either internationally or locally). We find that social networks abroad are the most important driving forces of international migration intentions, with close and broad networks jointly explaining about 37% of variation in the probability intentions. Social networks are found to be more important factors driving migration intentions than work-related aspects or wealth (wealth accounts for less than 3% of the variation). In addition, we find that having stronger close social networks at home has the opposite effect by reducing the likelihood of migration intentions, both internationally and locally.

We find that, regardless of the reason for the turnover, CDS, loan, and bond yield spreads increase at the time of management turnover, when management risk is highest, and decline over the first three years of the new CEO's tenure. The effects increase with prior investor uncertainty about the new management. These results are consistent with the view that management risk affects firms' default risk. An understanding of management risk yields a number of implications for corporate finance.","[Pan, Yihui] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Wang, Tracy Yue] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Weisbach, Michael S.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Weisbach, Michael S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Pan, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, David Eccles Sch Business, Dept Finance, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",yihui.pan@eccles.utah.edu,,"Pan, Yihui/0000-0003-1563-6223",,,,,37,26,26,7,79,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We propose a new index of occupation-level IT intensity and document several long-term changes in the occupational landscape over the past decades. Using Census and US KLEMS micro-data, we show that: (i) the bulk of productivity growth after 1950 is concentrated in IT intensive sectors; (ii) the share of workers in IT jobs has expanded significantly, with little or no pause and IT jobs enjoy a large and growing earnings premium, even after controlling for general task requirements (e.g., cognitive, non-routine); and (iii) the rise of the IT intensive employment share is closely associated with declines in the manufacturing employment share. While earnings premia for college-educated and cognitive/non-routine workers have flattened in the aggregate since 2000, we show that they continued growing in IT intensive jobs and that these jobs have played a key role in accounting for the surge of high tech service labor productivity. We also use our IT intensity index to estimate industry-specific elasticities of substitution between IT and non-IT intensive labor, finding values of 1.6 in manufacturing and 1.3 in services. Finally, we revisit a long-standing question about the relationship between technological progress and productivity and provide evidence that occupation-level IT intensity is positively associated with output growth, especially in the services sector.

Unlike most countries, the labor market in China appears to be holding up well, despite sharp slowdown in economic growth. This paper argues that there are underlying fundamental mechanisms that help explain the resilience of China's labor market. The key to understanding labor market dynamics in China is that rural-to-urban migrant flows are more sensitive to growth than urban workers in the process of fast urbanization, which serves as a main shock absorber to buffer employment against adverse shocks. Therefore, we propose a generalized Okun's Law (GOL) that incorporates migrant flows with unemployment rates to capture the relation between labor market dynamics and economic cycles. The original Okun's Law can be regarded as a special case of the GOL for developed countries that have already completed urbanization. Conducting empirical analysis with both China's national- and city-level data and cross-country panel data, we find strong evidence supporting the GOL theory. Findings in the paper have implications for a deeper understanding of the wisdom of Okun's Law and its application in labor market policies.","[Liu, Xiaoguang] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lam, Raphael; Schipke, Alfred] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Schipke, Alfred] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shen, Guangjun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; International Monetary Fund; Harvard University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Shen, GJ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing 102202, Peoples R China.",hnshgj@126.com,,,National Social Science Foundation [16CJL049]; Natural Science Fund of China [71603296],National Social Science Foundation; Natural Science Fund of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The National Social Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 16CJL049; Natural Science Fund of China, Grant/Award Number: 71603296",,31,6,7,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In doing so, this experiment is the first of its kind to isolate the relationship between temptation and cheating as its primary focus, to create a randomized control group for comparative purposes, and to be conducted without deceiving subjects. The evidence shows that people who tempt themselves to cheat are more likely to cheat. Further, people who self-select into the opportunistic setting cheat to a greater extent than individuals placed into the same opportunistic condition by random assignment. There are no gender differences in choice of environment or likelihood of cheating. An individual's self-reported value of ethics predicts honest behavior but only for subjects who consider their moral principles to be very important in their everyday lives.

To capture the leptokurtosis, which is inherent in most financial series, data are modeled by using Gram-Charlier (GC) expansions. Since we are interested in operating with several series simultaneously, the distribution of the sum of GC random variables is derived. This latter turns out to be a tail-sensitive density, suitable for modeling the distribution of a portfolio return-losses and, accordingly, can be conveniently adopted for computing risk measures such as the value at risk and the expected shortfall as well as some performance measures based on its partial moments. The closed form expressions of these risk measures are derived for cases when the density of a portfolio is the sum of GC expansions, either with the same or different kurtosis. An empirical application of this approach to a portfolio of financial asset indexes provides evidence of the comparative effectiveness of this technique in computing risk measures, both in and out of the sample period.

The logical extension is that when these natural resources interact, then the ecosystem is a collection or portfolio of natural capital and liabilities. However, natural capital and liabilities held in an ecosystem portfolio are more complex to manage than financial asset portfolios. The key problem in a financial asset portfolio is adjusting the rates of return on assets for risk and correlation of risk. In contrast, the returns on natural assets and liabilities require many other adjustments arising from stock-related returns and depreciation that endogenously depend on both stocks and controls, including interactions among these variables. This means ecosystem portfolio analysis extends beyond the consideration of uncertainty and involves understanding complex economic-ecological tradeoffs, even in a deterministic setting. We use capital theory in the context of a deterministic bioeconomic model of valuable wildlife, livestock, and a pathogen that can be passed between them to develop a portfolio balancing approach to understanding the tradeoffs associated with ecosystem management. This specific ecosystem is highly relevant to conservation, health, and livestock agriculture. Within the context of this example, we also explore issues of mitigation and adaptation to disease risks, and the management implications of cross-species transmission. A final contribution is to examine how exports and infection risks influence the ecological thresholds that epidemiologists often focus on to guide disease management.","[Horan, Richard D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Fenichel, Eli P.] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT USA; [Finnoff, David] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Reeling, Carson] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",Michigan State University; Yale University; University of Wyoming; Western Michigan University,"Horan, RD (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",horan@msu.edu; eli.fenichel@yale.edu; finnoff@uwyo.edu; carson.reeling@gmail.com,,"Reeling, Carson/0000-0002-6203-0649; Finnoff, David/0000-0003-0775-9733","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health [2011-67023-30872, 1R01GM100471-01]; NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program [1414374]; Michigan State University AgBioResearch; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1414374] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health; NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program; Michigan State University AgBioResearch; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant #2011-67023-30872, grant #1R01GM100471-01 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health, NSF grant #1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program, and Michigan State University AgBioResearch.

A longitudinal analysis of casual users and long-term subscribers,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bike sharing; Longitudinal trends; Public transport interaction; Market segments; Bike share usage; Spatial correlations,BIKE SHARE; IMPACT; WASHINGTON; MELBOURNE; RIDERSHIP; WEATHER; SCHEME,"Bicycle Sharing Systems (BSS) are rapidly being implemented globally providing a low-cost active transport option that extends travel distances with greater flexibility than other transport modes. The role a BSS plays in a city can be characterised by the type of users and their trip purposes, but little is known about how use changes over time or the factors impacting change. This longitudinal case study identifies trends in BSS patronage disaggregated by types of users and examines how policies (e.g., helmets, public transport fares) can affect usage by different user types. Time-stamped origin and destination trip data for the Melbourne Bike Share System (MBSS) from 2010 to 2016 was analyzed to identify trends by casual users and long-term subscribers (LTS). Overall, usage increased marginally, but the proportion of casual trips increased from 50% (in 2010) to 80% (in 2016). Policy changes within the MBSS area (e.g., provision of courtesy helmets, the introduction of a Free Tram Zone (FTZ)) affected use by the two types of users differently. However, the initial system objectives and system architecture have not changed in response. Usage by the two market segments by socio-demographic and geographic variables highlighted that both user groups correlated strongly with proximity to major transport hubs. However, while LTS usage is positively correlated with proximity to high-density employment districts, casual usage is positively correlated with the availability of separate bicycle lanes and paths and proximity to tourism destinations. Findings underline the importance of understanding BSS use by market segments and reviewing BSS policy, objectives, planning and design to adequately respond to changing user needs and manage the future evolution of BSS.","[Jain, Taru] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 23 Coll Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Jain, Taru] Sch Planning & Architecture, Dept Phys Planning, New Delhi, India; [Wang, Xinyi] Georgia Inst Technol, 788 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Rose, Geoffrey] Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Civil Engn, 23 Coll Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Johnson, Marilyn] Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Civil Engn, 22 Alliance Lane, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Monash University; School of Planning & Architecture, New Delhi; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Monash University; Monash University","Jain, T (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 23 Coll Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",taru.jain@monash.edu; xinyi.wang@gatech.edu; geoff.rose@monash.edu; marilyn.johnson@monash.edu,"Wang, Xinyi/AAW-9922-2020; Johnson, Marilyn/IYJ-0004-2023; Jain, Taru/J-8934-2019; jain, taru/AAR-7231-2020","Johnson, Marilyn/0000-0003-1272-1684; Jain, Taru/0000-0003-2664-0711",doctoral program under the Sustainable and Effective Public Transport Graduate Research Industry Partnership; Monash University Australia and Transport for Victoria,doctoral program under the Sustainable and Effective Public Transport Graduate Research Industry Partnership; Monash University Australia and Transport for Victoria,"This study was funded as part of a doctoral program under the Sustainable and Effective Public Transport Graduate Research Industry Partnership, co-funded by Monash University Australia and Transport for Victoria (the statutory office responsible for the planning and coordination of all transport systems in Victoria, Australia).",,52,25,28,1,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

When money only serves as savings instruments, I find that the optimality of Friedman rule breaks up only if agents prefer late resolution of uncertainty. However, if an additional role of money as a medium of exchange is introduced, then the Friedman rule achieves generally suboptimal level of aggregate consumption regardless of agents' preferences for the timing of uncertainty resolution. The aggregate output uncertainty, nevertheless, crucially determines the level of optimal inflation rate in this case. Lastly, the optimal degree of aggregate output uncertainty given a positive inflation rate turns out to be generally non-zero regardless of the role of money.","[Jung, Kuk Mo] Hanyang Univ, Div Int Studies, Int Bldg 5th Floor, Seoul 04763, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Jung, KM (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Div Int Studies, Int Bldg 5th Floor, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",kmjung@hanyang.ac.kr,,,,,,,53,1,1,1,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Using administrative data, we examine the changes in plan participant investment choices that resulted from the streamlining and how these changes might affect participants' eventual retirement wellbeing. We show that streamlined participants' new allocations exhibited significantly lower within-fund turnover rates and expense ratios, and we estimate this could lead to aggregate savings for these participants over a 20-year period of $20.2 M, or in excess of $9,400 per participant. Moreover, after the reform, streamlined participants' portfolios held significantly less equity and exhibited significantly lower risks by way of reduced exposures to most systematic risk factors, compared with their non-streamlined counterparts.","[Keim, Donald B.; Mitchell, Olivia S.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,2300 SH DH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Keim, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,2300 SH DH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",keim@wharton.upenn.edu; mitchelo@wharton.upenn.edu,,,TIAA Institute; Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,TIAA Institute; Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,"Research support for the analysis herein was provided by the TIAA Institute and by the Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

We find that, on average, individual investors who live in their birthplace invest almost three times more of their portfolio capital in local firms than other locals. A bias toward birthplace firms persists for a long time after moving elsewhere and increases significantly for homecomers. Our detailed analysis suggests that individual investors' proximity bias is largely an urban phenomenon, which is explained neither by the information hypothesis nor by the familiarity hypothesis. We find that more sophisticated investors, in terms of portfolio diversification, earn, on average, abnormal portfolio returns, but they do this regardless of their portfolio distortion.

Calibrating management strategies/decisions to consider the effect of disease may help to reduce disease impacts on forests. Here, we use a novel generalisable, bioeconomic model framework, which combines an epidemiological compartmental model with a Faustmann optimal rotation length model, to explore the management decision of when to harvest a single rotation, even-aged, plantation forest under varying disease conditions. Sensitivity analysis of the rate of spread of infection and the effect of disease on the timber value reveals a key trade-off between waiting for the timber to grow and the infection spreading further. We show that the optimal rotation length, which maximises the net present value of the forest, is reduced when timber from infected trees has no value; but when the infection spreads quickly, and the value of timber from infected trees is non-zero, it can be optimal to wait until the disease-free optimal rotation length to harvest.

We present an innovative use of collective action games to not only measure propensity for cooperation, but to improve local understanding of groundwater interrelationships and stimulate collective governance of groundwater, based on a pilot study in Andhra Pradesh, India. The games simulate crop choice and consequences for the aquifer. These were followed by a community debriefing, which provided an entry point for discussing the interconnectedness of groundwater use, to affect mental models about groundwater. A slightly modified game was played in the same communities, one year later. Our study finds communication within the game increased the likelihood of groups reaching sustainable extraction levels in the second year of play, but not the first. Individual payments to participants based on how they played in the game had no effect on crop choice. Either repeated experience with the games or the revised structure of the game evoked more cooperation in the second year, outweighing other factors influencing behavior, such as education, gender, and trust index scores. After the games were played, a significantly higher proportion of communities adopted water registers and rules to govern groundwater, compared to other communities in the same NGO water commons program. Because groundwater levels are affected by many factors, games alone will not end groundwater depletion. However, games can contribute to social learning about the role of crop choice and collective action, to motivate behavior change toward more sustainable groundwater extraction.

The results point to unpaid work-time devoted to household chores, child care, and care for the elderly-as the largest single factor explaining 33% of the difference in profits observed between male- and female-run businesses. When comparing male and female business owners with similar business and personal characteristics, the difference in business profits disappears. The results point to initial endowments, rather than returns on those endowments, as the reason why female-run businesses are less profitable.

We exploit variation across counties and across time in teenagers' exposure to condom distribution programs in schools. We find that access to condoms in schools increases teen fertility by about 12 percent. The results suggest that the effects of condom access varied significantly across different programs; the positive fertility estimates are driven by communities where condoms are provided without mandated counseling. Programs that mandated counseling have zero or negative fertility effects, but estimates on these counties are less robust across specifications.","[Buckles, Kasey S.; Hungerman, Daniel M.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, 3052 Jenkins Nanovic Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Buckles, Kasey S.; Hungerman, Daniel M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Buckles, Kasey S.] Inst Labor Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Notre Dame; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Buckles, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, 3052 Jenkins Nanovic Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",kbuckles@nd.edu; dhungerm@nd.edu,,,,,,,60,12,12,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Examination of global data shows that government banks with politically connected CEOs experienced significantly higher loan default rates and worse operating performance during the crisis than those without politically connected CEOs. However, these politically connected CEOs were less likely than others to be penalized for the poor performance of their banks. Our evidence suggests that politically connected CEOs of government banks can influence a bank's lending decisions by using their political power and influence to relax lending standards and to reap private benefits that thus raise their banks' sensitivity to a crisis.

We, also, find that pit users, who had been active in both trading venues, remain active in the electronic market. However, there is no evidence of pit traders (locals) transitioning to the electronic market. Nevertheless, some of them are still active in options pits.

From a spatial perspective, this bioeconomic optimization model broadens away from invasive species spread at a frontier or to neighbors by examining short and long-distance dispersal, directionality in spread, and network geometry. In terms of uncertainty and dynamics, this framework incorporates several sources of stochasticity, decisions with multi-year implications, and temporal ecological processes. This paper employs a unique Markov decision process planning algorithm and a Monte Carlo simulation of the stochastic system to explore the spatial-dynamic optimal policy for a river network facing a bioinvasion, with Tamarisk as an example. In addition to exploring the spatial, stochastic, and dynamic aspects of management of invasions, the results demonstrate how the interaction of spatial and multi-period processes contributes to finding the optimal policy. Those interactions prove critical in determining the right management tool, in the right location, at the right time, which informs the management implications drawn from simpler frameworks. In particular, as compared to other modeling framework's policy prescriptions, the framework here finds more use of the management tool restoration and more management in highly connected locations, which leads to a less invaded system over time.","[Hall, Kim Meyer] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Albers, Heidi J.] Univ Wyoming, Haub Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82070 USA; [Taleghan, Majid Alkaee; Dietterich, Thomas G.] Oregon State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University; University of Wyoming; Oregon State University,"Hall, KM (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",KIM.HALL@OREGONSTATE.EDU; JO.ALBERS@UWYO.EDU; ALKAEE@EECS.OREGONSTATE.EDU; TGD@EECS.OREGONSTATE.EDU,,"Albers, Heidi J/0000-0002-3775-7870","National Science Foundation [0832804, 1331932]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [0832804] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1521687, 1331932] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"Funding was provided by National Science Foundation (0832804, 1331932).",,36,5,7,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We first use a text mining approach and find that the awareness of reputation risk (management) as reflected in annual reports has increased during the last ten years and that it has gained in importance relative to other risks. Furthermore, we provide the first empirical study of the determinants and value of reputation risk management. Our results show that larger firms, as well as firms that are located in Europe and have a higher awareness of their reputation, are significantly more likely to implement a reputation risk management program. Finally, we obtain initial indications of the value-relevance of reputation risk management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Water users in the semi-arid areas of British Columbia, including the Okanagan basin, are deeply concerned about the potential negative impacts of water markets. With drought risk rather than chronic water scarcity as the primary water management challenge, water users' concerns are reasonable. Dry-year option contracts may capture some of the benefits of market-based instruments without the risk implications of conventional water markets. Dry-year water option contracts are financial instruments that water-sensitive users can use to hedge themselves against drought impacts, and if appropriately managed through a water supplier, they may be an efficiency-enhancing alternative to crop insurance. We argue that with appropriate support, dry-year option contracts can be a useful low-cost tool to mitigate drought impacts in semi-arid regions of British Columbia. Such contracts may enable the innovative local water management solutions envisioned in British Columbia's recently enacted Water Sustainability Act.","[Janmaat, John; Rahimova, Nargiz] Univ British Columbia, IK Barber Sch Arts & Sci, Kelowna, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Janmaat, J (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, IK Barber Sch Arts & Sci, Kelowna, BC, Canada.",,,,,,,,53,1,1,0,17,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Our results show that the program expedited participant exit from UI, produced UI savings that exceeded program costs, and improved participant employment outcomes. Analyses of program effects on the UI exit likelihood show that the program's effects are partly associated with increased participant exit up through the time when program activities were scheduled, reflecting voluntary exit of participants from UI to avoid program activities and disqualifications of participants who failed to meet eligibility requirements. In addition, the program induced substantial participant exit from UI in the period after participants fulfilled requirements and their interactions with the program had ended, suggesting that the job-counseling services offered by the program may have helped participants to conduct more effective job searches. Our findings provide evidence that reemployment programs that combine an eligibility review with mandatory participation in job-search services can be effective during recessions.","[Michaelides, Marios] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Michaelides, Marios; Mueser, Peter] IMPAQ Int, Columbia, MD 21044 USA; [Mueser, Peter] Univ Missouri Columbia, Dept Econ, 118 Profess Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Mueser, Peter] Univ Missouri Columbia, Harry S Truman Sch Publ Affairs, 118 Profess Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Mueser, Peter] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Cyprus; American Institutes for Research; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Michaelides, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.;Michaelides, M (通讯作者)，IMPAQ Int, Columbia, MD 21044 USA.",mariosm@ucy.ac.cy; mueserp@missouri.edu,"Michaelides, Marios/S-1843-2017","Michaelides, Marios/0000-0002-0775-4724","U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (DOL/ETA); European Research Council (ERC)","U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (DOL/ETA); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","This paper is based on data collected by IMPAQ International (IMPAQ) as part of a study funded by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (DOL/ETA).

These errors translate in turn to considerable errors in the model predictions, for example, for the magnitude of the equity premium or return predictability. We demonstrate that these nonlinearities arise from the presence of multiple highly persistent processes, which cause the exogenous states to attain values far away from their long-run means with nonnegligible probability. These extreme values have a significant impact on asset price dynamics.","[Pohl, Walter] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Bergen, Norway; [Schmedders, Karl] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Zurich, Switzerland; [Wilms, Ole] Tilburg Univ, Dept Finance, Tilburg, Netherlands",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Zurich; Tilburg University,"Pohl, W (通讯作者)，NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Bergen, Norway.",,,"Wilms, Ole/0000-0001-9606-2289",Zurcher Universitatsverein,Zurcher Universitatsverein,"Walter Pohl is with Department of Finance, NHH Norwegian School of Economics.

As a rare but important exception, Ethiopia's agriculture sector recorded remarkable rapid growth during 2004-14. This paper explores this rapid change in the agriculture sector of this important country - the second most populous in Africa. We review the evidence on agricultural growth and decompose the contributions of modern inputs to growth using an adjusted Solow decomposition model. We also highlight the key pathways Ethiopia followed to achieve its agricultural growth. We find that land and labor use expanded significantly and total factor productivity grew by about 2.3% per year over the study period. Moreover, modern input use more than doubled, explaining some of this growth. The expansion in modern input use appears to have been driven by high government expenditures on the agriculture sector, including agricultural extension, but also by an improved road network, higher rural education levels, and favorable international and local price incentives.

Using exogenous variation in education from a compulsory schooling change combined with wealth data for the Swedish population, we estimate the effect of education on stock market participation and on the share of financial wealth invested in stocks, conditional on participation. For men, an extra year of education increases market participation by two percentage points and the share of financial wealth allocated to stocks by 10%. We find suggestive evidence that greater financial wealth is a potential channel through which education increases participation, consistent with the existence of fixed costs. Lower risk aversion is a potential channel through which education increases the stock share. The reform has less effect on female schooling attainment and there is no evidence that this additional education affects women's asset allocation. There is no evidence of spillovers to children.","[Black, Sandra E.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Black, Sandra E.] NHH, Bergen, Norway; [Black, Sandra E.; Devereux, Paul J.; Lundborg, Petter; Majlesi, Kaveh] IZA, Durham, NC 27713 USA; [Black, Sandra E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Devereux, Paul J.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Devereux, Paul J.] Univ Coll Dublin, Geary Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Devereux, Paul J.] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Lundborg, Petter; Majlesi, Kaveh] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Lundborg, Petter] CED Lund, Lund, Sweden; [Majlesi, Kaveh] Knut Wicksell Ctr Financial Studies, Lund, Sweden",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); National Bureau of Economic Research; University College Dublin; University College Dublin; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Lund University,"Black, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Black, SE (通讯作者)，NHH, Bergen, Norway.;Black, SE (通讯作者)，IZA, Durham, NC 27713 USA.;Black, SE (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Devereux, Paul/0000-0003-0221-8241","Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence Scheme, FAIR Project [262675]","Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence Scheme, FAIR Project","The data used in this paper come from the Swedish Interdisciplinary Panel (SIP) administered at the Centre for Economic Demography, Lund University, Sweden.

As we expected, we found underperformance due to management costs and, more specifically, due to a homogeneous performance that we suggest it is induced by the actual investment policy. We also found that the observed betas have values closer to 1, especially in the case of the all SIEFORES system benchmark, a result that proves the observed homogeneous performance in all the SIEFORES. With our results we also prove that the return paid by Mexican Public pension funds is due to factors different than portfolio manager skills, supporting the proofs given in the related literature of pension fund demand inelasticity in Mexico, due to a noisy and uninformed pension fund selection.

In response to such private politics, firms seek to maintain political support in the localities in which they operate so that they can avoid conflict and secure access to resources. To secure local support and defuse opposition, some firms take actions that expand access to essential public goods, services, and economic opportunities, while others use targeted clientelistic benefits that reward only a few. What accounts for this variation? Answering this question is key to identifying the development consequences of private politics. This article explores this question through a study of multinational mining firms operating in Bolivia, drawing on qualitative data from interviews as well as an original household survey. It shows that the political structures and organization in the localities in which firms operate create distinct incentives for firms to distribute benefits in targeted or inclusive ways. This finding contributes to studies of the local politics of natural resources and firm responses to social contestation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Comovements in these are examined at the household and village levels, combining satellite imagery and household (Nepal Living Standard Measurement Survey) data. Projections of the impact of economic growth based on Engel curves turn out to be highly inaccurate: forest conditions remained stable despite considerable growth in household consumption and income. Firewood collections at the village level remained stable, as effects of demographic growth were offset by substantial reductions in per household collections.

To the extent that the nonconspiring industry members set their prices under the price umbrella of the cartel, the customers of the nonconspiring firms suffer overcharges just like customers of the conspiring firms. Whether these so-called umbrella plaintiffs have standing to sue for antitrust damages is an unresolved policy question, because the Supreme Court has not spoken on umbrella damages. In this article, we identify the judicial concerns regarding umbrella damage claims, which can be traced to Mid-West Paper and Petroleum Products Antitrust Litigation. These decisions raise concerns that the fact of injury is conjectural and the measurement of the damages is speculative. We first review the divided judicial treatment of standing for umbrella plaintiffs. Next, we describe the economics of umbrella pricing, which reveals that umbrella claims are not inherently conjectural. We then examine the econometric analysis necessary to estimate damages, demonstrating that umbrella damage estimates are not inherently speculative. We also examine some difficulties that exist in damage estimation generally and for umbrella plaintiffs in particular. Finally, we argue that granting standing to umbrella plaintiffs is consistent with the goals of antitrust policy.

An initiative of the European Commission under Jean-Claude Juncker's leadership, Capital Markets Union seeks to realize a long-standing goal of European policy makers: a financial system in which capital markets will absorb more of citizens' savings and play a greater role in corporate finance. Market-based banking, too, is set to benefit from Capital Markets Union, which includes measures to revive the European securitization market. Given that market-based finance - or shadow banking - shouldered much of the blame for the financial crisis of 2007-2008, its resurgence as a policy priority of the European Union constitutes a puzzle. The present article lays the theoretical groundwork for a special issue that tackles this puzzle. It argues that rather than an end in itself, Capital Markets Union represents an exercise in governing through financial markets'. Pioneered in the United States, governing through financial markets is a political strategy adopted by state actors in pursuit of policy goals that exceed their institutional capacity.","[Braun, Benjamin; Huebner, Marina] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, D-50676 Cologne, Germany; [Gabor, Daniela] Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England",Max Planck Society; University of West England,"Braun, B (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, D-50676 Cologne, Germany.",bb@mpifg.de,,"Braun, Benjamin/0000-0002-5186-5923",,,,,116,57,59,2,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

For instance, having a child usually warrants a (cost-reducing) premium compared to remaining childless. These premiums may equivalently be achieved as positive benefits for the preferable state, or as taxes for the non-preferred state. However, perceptions of fair treatment of the rich and poor may differ with the frame. This paper contributes to the understanding of framing effects in tax and benefit system design by providing an empirical test with actual political decision-makers exposed to system-relevant considerations. Using a survey-experiment, we find participants (N = 608) to grant higher premiums for having children to low income families in a benefit frame, but to high income families in a tax frame. A similar framing effect occurs in a second scenario based on real competencies of our respondents. In both scenarios the effect is moderated by the political ideology of participants parties. Its occurrence among policy-makers raises concerns about imbalanced tax and benefit schedules being designed unintentionally despite (or because of) attention to social fairness.

However, focal points remain largely outside the formal apparatus of game theory. This paper develops a model of play in 2 x 2 games where payoff differences determine what strategy players will perceive as salient and choose to play. The model uniquely predicts which outcome will emerge for virtually the entire class of 2 x 2 normal form games. For the subset of such games involving coordination and asymmetric payoffs, payoff differences identify focal outcomes and strategies in the same way shared social knowledge produces coordination in Schelling's symmetric games. The model characterizes situations when Nash equilibria are likely to be played, even in a one-shot interaction, and predicts which equilibrium will obtain in games containing more than one. It identifies other circumstances in which a non-equilibrium outcome will predominate. Finally, the theory specifies when a player is likely to select a strategy based solely on consideration of her own payoffs, and when and why the same player will be prompted to act strategically. Experimental results are presented that test the predictions of the model.","[Leland, Jonathan W.] Natl Sci Fdn, Div Social & Econ Sci, 2415 Eisenhower Ave, Alexandria, VA 22314 USA; [Schneider, Mark] Chapman Univ, Econ Sci Inst, One Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA",National Science Foundation (NSF); Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Leland, JW (通讯作者)，Natl Sci Fdn, Div Social & Econ Sci, 2415 Eisenhower Ave, Alexandria, VA 22314 USA.",jonathanwardleland@gmail.com; schneide@chapman.edu,,"Leland, Jonathan/0000-0002-4879-0238",,,,,35,2,2,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-4870,1872-7719,,J ECON PSYCHOL,J.

The case of the city of Burgos,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans SUMP; Sustainable measures; Urban transport; Emissions; Cost-effectiveness,CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRANSPORT,"74% of Europeans live and move every day in cities, and 40% of the total CO2 emissions from transport is caused by urban mobility. The decarbonisation of urban transport can therefore produce a substantial reduction in total CO2 emissions. Cities have proposed various measures to reduce CO2 emissions from mobility, concentrating particularly on reducing private individual transport (car) by offering a range of alternatives. Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) are not new in Europe, as numerous precedents in France, UK, Italy and Germany have now been underway for a decade. SUMPs propose a strategy to reduce dependence on private cars by imposing a series of measures. As the plans were designed for the long term (ten to fifteen years), it is only natural to question their effectiveness after a certain time has elapsed. However, there is little literature on this issue. To fill this gap this article proposes a methodology to evaluate Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans using indicators to assess the current situation of the city in terms of the effectiveness of the measures implemented, focusing on the specific case of the city of Burgos in Spain, where the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan was introduced in 2005, and on the results based on the proposed methodology. CO2 savings are always the primary target of a SUMP. Most assessments highlight changes in behaviour or public perception, but contain no in-depth analysis of cost-effectiveness. This paper aims to calculate a cost analysis for each tonnes of CO2 saved. This methodology is used in other fields such as lighting and energy, but not in transport due to its complexity. However, effectiveness ratios can be calculated with the available data on modal shift and investments in the SUMP, taking into account the costs as a whole. Other methodologies to determine external cost savings are included in the proposed methodology to achieve a more accurate ratio and consider more external factors.","[Maria Diez, Jose; Gonzalo-Orden, Hernan; Rojo, Marta] Univ Burgos, Burgos, Spain; [Eugenia Lopez-Lambas, Maria; Garcia-Martinez, Andres] Univ Politecn Madrid, Transport Res Ctr, TRANVSyT, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Burgos; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Diez, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Burgos, Dept Ingn Civil, EPS Univ Burgos, Campus La Milanera,Calle Villadiego S-N, Burgos 09001, Spain.",jmdmartinez@ubu.es,"Rojo, Marta/N-7564-2019; López-Lambas, María Eugenia/AAV-2459-2020; Lambas, María Eugenia/AAX-4652-2021; Gonzalo-Orden, Hernan/AAZ-8348-2021","Rojo, Marta/0000-0003-4747-4433; López-Lambas, María Eugenia/0000-0003-4050-453X; Gonzalo-Orden, Hernan/0000-0003-1777-2333",,,,,34,29,30,1,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The model innovates on the previous political economy literature which views such institutional arrangements arising only as a response to internal technological forces, not to strategic interactions within the state and with neighboring states. The model explains how these interactions lead communities of individuals to choose among three alternative types of institutional arrangements: 1) a union, i.e., a setting wherein both the vertical and the horizontal fragmentation of a state is minimized; 2) an alliance, whereby a state becomes more vertically fragmented by creating an upper government tier devised to take advantage of economies of scale; 3) autonomy, where horizontal fragmentation is maximized, as no merging of communities occurs and no higher government tier is created.

Evidence from India's National Rural Employment Guarantee,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public works; Wages; NREGA; National Rural Employment Guarantee; Asia; India,PROGRAMS EVIDENCE; WELFARE,"We estimate the impact of the world's largest public works program, India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), on agricultural wages. NREGS was rolled out across India in three distinct phases, and this phased introduction is used to identify difference-in-difference estimates of the program effect. Using monthly data on wage rates from the period 2000-2011 in 209 districts across 18 Indian states, we include district-specific fixed effects and trends to control for differences in wage rates in the absence of the program. We find that, on average, the program boosted the growth rate of real daily agricultural wages by 4.3% per year. The effect of the scheme is more consistent with an increase in the growth rate of wages than with a discontinuous jump in wages. The effect was concentrated in some states and in the agricultural peak season, appears to have been gender-neutral and was biased towards unskilled labor. Since many of the world's poorest depend on casual agricultural labor for their livelihood, while at the same time minimum-wage legislation is unlikely to be effective in many developing countries, we argue that rural public employment programs constitute a potentially important anti-poverty policy tool.

Our objective is to test whether the export capacity of firms is one of the determinants of the occurrence of the horizontal and vertical spillovers generated by foreign direct investment. In order to determine whether the productivity effects arising from horizontal and vertical (backward and forward) spillovers are conditioned by the exports of firms, value added and total factor productivity equations for Turkish manufacturing industry firms for the years 2003-11 are estimated using the panel data method. Our estimation results show that the productivity effects generated by horizontal, backward, and forward spillovers of foreign direct investment are more pronounced for export-oriented firms.","[Ebghaei, Felor; Wigley, Arzu Akkoyunlu] Hacettepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Beytepe Campus, TR-06800 Cankaya, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Wigley, AA (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Beytepe Campus, TR-06800 Cankaya, Turkey.",f.ebghaei@hacettepe.edu.tr; arzus@hacettepe.edu.tr,,,,,,,31,6,6,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Given the influence of the entrepreneur within these micro-sized ventures, an especially relevant question is how entrepreneurial perceptions impact international growth. Drawing on organizational learning and performance feedback theory, we hypothesize that entrepreneurs who perceive the venture to have either not met or to have exceeded growth expectations will subsequently internationalize more than entrepreneurs who perceive growth expectations to have simply been met. A sample of 226 international, micro-sized ventures from the Kauffman Firm Survey is used to test the hypotheses. The results confirm a U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurial perceptions and internationalization. The relationship is more pronounced among innovative micro-sized ventures than non-innovative ones.

I show that this outcome may arise as the equilibrium of a signaling game between banks and their debt investors when a negative shock affects the correlated asset returns of a fraction of banks and their sponsored vehicles. The rescue is interpreted as a good signal and reduces the refinancing costs of the sponsoring bank. If banks' leverage is high or the negative shock is sizable enough, the equilibrium is a pooling one in which all banks rescue. When the aggregate financial sector is close to insolvency, banks' expected net worth would increase if rescues were banned. The model can be extended to discuss the circumstances in which all banks collapse after rescuing their vehicles.","[Segura, Anatoli] Banca Italia, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Segura, A (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Rome, Italy.",,,,AXA Research Fund,AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),"The views expressed in this paper are the author's own and do not necessarily coincide with those of Banca d'Italia.

In 2 studies, we rely on the generalized axiom of revealed preferences to explore the severity of choice inconsistencies resulting from intuitive and cognitive judgments separately, as well as overall severity across the 2 types of judgments. We focus on choice inconsistency that leads to the inefficient use of individuals' budget and not on the simple preference divergence that may result from the 2 types of judgments. We find that budget waste resulting from intuitive and cognitive judgments is comparable but that overall budget waste across the 2 types of judgments is significantly higher. These findings suggest that the inconsistency in choices resulting from intuitive versus cognitive judgments is responsible for significant loss of decision utility in individuals' economic decisions, rather than choice inconsistencies resulting from a specific type of evaluation in itself.

Given that the data envelopment analysis cross-efficiency method can provide a more reliable reference set, a large number of studies targeting performance evaluation and its applications adopt this method. Few studies, however, address the issue of the non-uniqueness of weights in cross-efficiency evaluation. Whereas, this paper proposes a cross-efficiency interval considering all weighting schemes along with a VIKOR aggregate model to gauge the universal productive efficiency of 16 major Chinese commercial banks of China and rank them for the period of 2007-14. Specifically, we use the cross-efficiency interval to generate the global performance of each bank based on internal and external assessment while using VIKOR to compare the solution with the attitude index which ranks all of the banks. The results indicate that the cross-efficiency interval can provide more information than the traditional DEA model, that the banking system efficiency of China has been improved during the study period, especially for SOBs; that JSBs are more efficient compared with SOBs; and the efficiency gap narrowed during the study period.

We show that the social welfare functionals that aggregate individual social preferences by means of the generalized bargaining solution of Nash support the liberal social contract if they verify non-paternalistic benevolence, that is, if the associate social welfare functions are strictly increasing in the private welfare of all individuals. The existence of a liberal social contract follows as a corollary of this property of supportability. We characterize the liberal social contract as a case of application of Habermas's norms of communicative action to the allocation of scarce resources by public finance and the market.","[Ythier, Jean Mercier] Univ Paris Pantheon Assas, CRED, Paris, France; [Ythier, Jean Mercier] IDEP, Paris, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Ythier, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Pantheon Assas, CRED, Paris, France.;Ythier, JM (通讯作者)，IDEP, Paris, France.",jean.mercier-ythier@u-paris2.fr,"Mercier Ythier, Jean/HGC-4687-2022","Mercier Ythier, Jean/0000-0001-9571-7458",,,,,42,1,1,0,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Together with a handful of other countries, Ghana offers the opportunity to analyze the distributional changes in the past two decades, since four comparable household surveys are available. In addition, unlike many other countries in SSA, Ghana's rapid growth translated into fast poverty reduction. A closer look at the distributional changes that occurred in the same period, however, suggests less optimism. The present paper develops an innovative methodology to analyze the distributional changes that occurred and their drivers, with a high degree of accuracy and granularity. Looking at the results from 1991 to 2012, the paper documents how the distributional changes over time hollowed out the middle of the Ghanaian household consumption distribution and increased the concentration of households around the highest and lowest deciles; there was a clear surge in polarization indeed. When looking at the drivers of polarization, household characteristics, educational attainment, and access to basic infrastructure all tended to increase over time the size of the upper and lower tails of the consumption distribution and, as a consequence, the degree of polarization.

Price trends in natural hazard zones may shift significantly and abruptly after a disaster signalling structural systemic changes in property markets. It challenges accurate market assessments of property prices and capital at risk after major disasters. A rigorous prediction of property prices in this case should ideally be done based only on the most recent sales, which are likely to form a rather small dataset. Hedonic analysis has been long used to understand how various factors contribute to the housing price formation. Yet, the robustness of its assessment is undermined when the analysis needs to be performed on relatively small samples. The purpose of this study is to suggest a model that can be widely applicable and quickly calibrated in a changing environment. We systematically study four statistical models: starting from a typical standard hedonic function and gradually changing its functional specification by reducing the hedonic analysis to some basic property characteristics and applying kriging to control for neighbourhood effects. Across different sample sizes we find that the latter performs consistently better in the out-of-sample predictions than other traditional price prediction methods. We present the specific improvements to the traditional spatial hedonic model that enhance the model's prediction accuracy. The improved model can be used to monitor price changes in risk-prone areas, accounting for changes in flood risk and at the same time controlling for autonomous market responses to flood risk.","[de Koning, Koen; Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil CSTM, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Bin, Okmyung] East Carolina Univ, Dept Econ, Ctr Nat Hazards Res, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",University of Twente; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"de Koning, K (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil CSTM, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",k.dekoning@utwente.nl; t.filatova@utwente.nl; BINO@ecu.edu,"Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930",,,,,43,10,10,4,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Rising obesity rates are the result of changes in people's diets and lifestyles. Income growth and urbanization are factors that contribute to these changes. Modernizing food retail environments may also play a certain role. For instance, the rapid spread of supermarkets in many developing countries could affect consumer food choices and thus nutritional outcomes. However, concrete evidence about the effects of supermarkets on consumer diets and nutrition is thin. A few existing studies have analyzed related linkages with cross-sectional survey data. We add to this literature by using panel data from households and individuals in urban Kenya. Employing panel regression models with individual fixed effects and controlling for other factors we show that shopping in supermarkets significantly increases body mass index (BMI). We also analyze impact pathways. Shopping in supermarkets contributes to higher consumption of processed and highly processed foods and lower consumption of unprocessed foods. These results confirm that the retail environment affects people's food choices and nutrition. However, the effects depend on the types of foods offered. Rather than thwarting modernization in the retail sector, policies that incentivize the sale of more healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables in supermarkets may be more promising to promote desirable nutritional outcomes.

By changing the nominal rate the central bank influences the liquidity premium, and hence the cost of taking leverage. Lower nominal rates make liquidity cheaper and raise leverage, resulting in lower risk premia and higher asset prices, volatility, investment, and growth.

These comprise a list which is often challenging in developing countries: well-designed and sequenced reforms; the implementation of complementary policies; the creation of regulatory capacity; attention to poverty and social impacts; and strong public communication.

This paper discusses four additional mechanisms that can be explained by bounded rationality: (a) implicit discrimination, (b) self-stereotyping and self-censorship, (c) rules of thumb adapted to disadvantaged environments that are dysfunctional in more privileged settings, and (d) adaptive preferences, in which an excluded group comes to view its exclusion as natural. Institutions, if they are stable, come to have cognitive foundations---concepts, categories, social identities, and worldviews---through which people mediate their perceptions of themselves and the world around them. Abolishing or reforming a discriminatory institution may have little effect on the social categories it created; groups previously discriminated against by law may remain excluded through custom and habits of the mind. Recognizing new forces of social exclusion, behavioral economics identifies ways to offset them. Some interventions have had very consequential impacts.","[Hoff, Karla; Walsh, James] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Walsh, James] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",The World Bank; University of Oxford,"Hoff, K (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,120,7,9,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

We construct indicators of credit risk exposures in three main Canadian FMIs and use multivariate extreme value methods to estimate this probability. We find large differences in the levels of systemic risk across participants. Conditional on the participant being distressed, we re- estimate these probabilities and find that some participants create large exposures to FMIs, resulting in a larger level of systemic risk than the rest of the participants.

To achieve those aims, we present a review of public policies in Chile and the results of an original quantitative analysis that measures the travel times required to access the opportunities and activities located in the city. The results show that housing policies put people at a disadvantage by increasing the distance between them and the opportunities of the city. Three decades after the implementation of housing policies, transport still fails to mitigate these distances and instead of alleviating the patterns of segregation, it may have reinforced them. The travel times required increase towards the periphery (even though densities do not decrease) and are higher than the averages of the city in social housing estates.","[Martinez, Cristhian Figueroa; Hodgson, Frances; Mullen, Caroline; Timms, Paul] Univ Leeds, ITS, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Martínez, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, ITS, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",tscaf@leeds.ac.uk,"Timms, Paul/S-3178-2019; Figueroa, Cristhian/S-9785-2017","Figueroa, Cristhian/0000-0002-6399-8360; Mullen, Caroline/0000-0003-2915-5009",CONICYT/BECAS Chile [72160477],CONICYT/BECAS Chile(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),The first author is grateful to Natan Waintrub for his help in the conceptual models and the interpretation of results.

Given the insights from the psychological and political science literature about the role of education in the formation of social values, in this paper, we analyze two channels through which education shapes tax morale. We find that education has a positive impact on tax morale for those individuals that are net beneficiaries of the welfare state, and a negative impact for those that are net contributors. Furthermore, our results indicate that the more highly educated because of their better knowledge on public affairs exhibit higher levels of tax morale in countries that have better quality public services, a fairer tax system and higher quality institutions.

We show that this positive relationship between risk taking and retirement flexibility is weakened and under some conditions even turned around if not only capital market risks, but also productivity risks are considered. Productivity risk in combination with a high elasticity of substitution between consumption and leisure creates a positive correlation between asset returns and labour income, reducing the willingness of consumers to bear risk.","[Adema, Yvonne] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [Bonenkamp, Jan] APG, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bonenkamp, Jan] Netspar, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Meijdam, Lex] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Meijdam, Lex] Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Meijdam, Lex] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Adema, Y (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.",y.adema@cpb.nl,,"Meijdam, Lex/0000-0002-9626-5761",,,,,34,1,1,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

This paper presents a cotton fund that consists of a set of contracts credit, insurance, warrant and forward - that enables producers to tackle specific agricultural risks and gain access to market finance. These financial contracts proved to be successful at guaranteeing the fund as issuer of state-contingent debt securities in the capital markets. The fund, as an intermediary, lent to cooperatives to help finance small cotton producers in northern Argentina. The paper explains the experimental design of this innovative fund and presents a potential alternative to government intervention by moving away from ex post subsidies for small producers and, instead, facilitating ex ante private credit. The paper contributes to the literature on rural financial intermediation by designing a new mechanism to raise funds coming from relatively uninformed investors and creating collateral substitutes through delegated monitoring to overcome asymmetric information and limited commitment.","[Alem, Mauro] Interamer Dev Bank, Infrastruct & Environm Sect, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Jorge Elias, Julio] Univ CEMA, Dept Econ, Av Cordoba 374, RA-1054 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Jorge Elias, Julio] Univ CEMA, Business Sch, Av Cordoba 374, RA-1054 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Inter-American Development Bank,"Elias, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ CEMA, Dept Econ, Av Cordoba 374, RA-1054 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Elias, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ CEMA, Business Sch, Av Cordoba 374, RA-1054 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",je49@ucema.edu.ar,,,Latin American Association of Development Financing Institutions (ALIDE); Rommel Acevedo Latin American Award on Development Banking,Latin American Association of Development Financing Institutions (ALIDE); Rommel Acevedo Latin American Award on Development Banking,We thank three anonymous referees and the editor Jacques Trienekens for very useful comments.

In the experimental section we propose a three-layer IoT model, business-oriented, and distributed over multiple cloud environments, comprising the Physical, Fog/Edge, and Application layers.","[Banica, Logica; Radulescu, Magdalena] Univ Pitesti, Fac Econ & Law, Targu Din Vale St 1, Pitesti 110040, Romania; [Polychronidou, Persefoni] Cent Macedonia Inst Technol, Dept Accounting & Finance, Terma Magnisias 62124, Serres, Greece; [Stefan, Cristian] Spiru Haret Univ, Fac Engn Informat & Geog, 13 Ion Ghica St,Dist 3, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti; Spiru Haret University,"Banica, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pitesti, Fac Econ & Law, Targu Din Vale St 1, Pitesti 110040, Romania.",olga.banica@upit.ro,"Polychronidou, Persefoni/AAG-9291-2019; Radulescu, Magdalena/AEW-0205-2022","Polychronidou, Persefoni/0000-0003-1517-011X;",,,,,27,2,2,0,5,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,250,264,,10.18502/kss.v3i10.3542,0.0,,,15,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7SJ,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455399000016,0

The data pertains to a survey of 356 cattle farmers from selected villages of Northern Ethiopia. Findings indicate that 94 per cent of the cattle owners were interested in procuring cattle insurance, and 77 per cent of them were willing to pay the benchmark annual premium of 4 per cent of the animal's value. The average number of cattle that each farmer was willing to insure was nearly three. The findings further indicate that income and education levels of the respondents, among other factors, influence the farmers' attitude towards participation in cattle insurance and the number of cattle to be insured by them. These findings suggest that educating farmers on the benefits of livestock insurance can stimulate this important risk management strategy. Public action may be required to incentivise insurance companies entering the market for the first time and to address the barriers to participation by poor households. Even though our study was restricted to some areas of northern Ethiopia, the findings can have a wider practical application for governmental and non-governmental institutions wishing to establish cattle insurance in developing countries.","[Bishu, Kinfe G.] Mekelle Univ, Dept Nat Resource Econ & Management, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Bishu, Kinfe G.] Med Univ South Carolina, Sect Hlth Syst Res & Policy, Charleston, SC USA; [Lahiff, Edward; O'Reilly, Seamus] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Cork, Ireland; [Gebregziabher, Mulugeta] Med Univ South Carolina, Dept Publ Hlth Sci Biostat, Charleston, SC USA",Mekelle University; Medical University of South Carolina; University College Cork; Medical University of South Carolina,"Bishu, KG (通讯作者)，Mekelle Univ, Dept Nat Resource Econ & Management, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",kinfeg@yahoo.com,"o'reilly, seamus/AAD-4539-2022; Bishu, Kinfe/Q-8469-2019","o'reilly, seamus/0000-0002-2887-7336; O'Reilly, Seamus/0000-0002-1873-450X; Lahiff, Edward/0000-0001-8001-0185","Rural Capacity Building Project, Ministry of Agriculture in Ethiopia [CDANR/RCBP/35/2011]; International Foundation for Science (IFS) [S/5154-1]; Mekelle University","Rural Capacity Building Project, Ministry of Agriculture in Ethiopia; International Foundation for Science (IFS)(International Foundation for Science); Mekelle University","This work was supported by the Rural Capacity Building Project, Ministry of Agriculture in Ethiopia [CDANR/RCBP/35/2011]; and International Foundation for Science (IFS) [Grant number S/5154-1] under the collaboration between University College Cork (UCC) and Mekelle University for PhD Project.

First, they allegedly abuse market power by forcing unfavorable contracts on media revenue allocation upon teams as a whole and on smaller teams in particular (vertical allocation of media revenue). Second, they allegedly form a cartel with selected teams to the detriment of smaller teams by providing unjustified extra payments to these teams (horizontal allocation of media revenues). In doing so, the cartel members allegedly secure supracompetitive rents from the authorities and cement an unfair competitive advantage over the outsider teams. Employing concentration measures from empirical economics, we present an assessment of whether the current antitrust allegations against F1 may be considered valid or not. We show that the allocation scheme employed in F1 considerably differs from those in other professional sports championships. We find the empirical picture to be consistent with an anticompetitive interpretation of F1 media revenue structures and policies. We conclude that there is merit in initiating an in-depth antitrust investigation of Formula One motor racing.

The methodology proposed here is a part of a new method of corporate strategic management using a stakeholder approach based on game theory (which is being developed at the Faculty of Economics and Administration of Masaryk University) and use of abductive reasoning and Charles Sanders Peirce's trichotomy of methods. Solvers of strategic cases find themselves in situations which need to be clarified, while only possessing partial information from the whole chain of events.

Using a sample of 15,019 firm-year observations for Chinese listed firms over the period 2001-2011, we find that firms with Big 4 auditors are associated with less stock price delay and this negative association is weaker for SOEs than for NSOEs. Our findings suggest that high-quality auditors play an important role in the price formation process, in that there is less stock price delay, and this role varies across firms with different ownership structures. Additional analyses show that the audit quality of international Big 4 auditors is perceived to be different from that of domestic Big 4 auditors. The effect of the perceived audit quality on price delay is different for SOEs controlled by the central government compared to those controlled by the local governments.

Motivated by the increased attention this phenomenon has recently received in top-tier finance journals, we provide two contributions. First, we review the academic literature by systematically comparing studies in terms of their country coverage, methodology, results, explanations, trading implications and potential post-publication disappearance in order to derive a general picture on the existence and practical relevance of the SIM effect. Second, we extend the empirical work on the subject by analyzing whether the SIM effect exists in investment universes of highly liquid individual stocks and commodity futures which we would expect to be most efficiently priced. Our results indicate that this is indeed the case (with a higher effect strength in the stock market than in the commodity futures market). Furthermore, our findings support earlier studies showing that the effect is robust (across testing approaches and time) and appears to be concentrated in the industrial sector. However, we find that the SIM effect has become weaker (stronger) in the stock (commodity) market since it has become part of the public information set and that the effectiveness and persuasiveness of standard investment strategies based on the effect are limited.

In particular, monetary policy appears to impact risk premia in stock and bond prices and to effectively control the liquidity premium in the economy (the cost of holding liquid assets). We review these findings and recent theories proposed to explain them, and we outline a conceptual framework that unifies them. The framework revolves around the central role of liquidity in risk sharing and explains how monetary policy governs its production and use within the financial sector.","[Drechsler, Itamar] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Savov, Alexi; Schnabl, Philipp] NYU, Stern Sch Business, 550 1st Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Drechsler, Itamar; Savov, Alexi; Schnabl, Philipp] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Schnabl, Philipp] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 0DX, England",University of Pennsylvania; New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Drechsler, I (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Drechsler, I (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",idrechsl@wharton.upenn.edu; asavov@stern.nyu.edu; pschnabl@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,71,13,16,5,46,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

The study is based on the analysis of premises for expansionary fiscal policy implementation both from theoretical and empirical perspective. In the face of strong economic shocks, such as the recent crisis, the special attention is paid on its size, instruments and time horizon. The content analysis of the literature supported by empirical evidence devoted to fiscal policy in context of its impact on the course of business cycles was conducted. The authors used Ameco and IMF data referring to the public finance with special focus on countries belonging to euro area and the US. It was claimed that the attempts to reduce increasing public debt via fiscal consolidation in early years of the crisis 2009-2011 have very likely resulted in a higher debt to GDP as euro area entered its second recession. At the same time, only countries with large fiscal space like the US could afford the bigger fiscal stimulus, and as a result registered output losses in these economies were smaller compared to Europe. In conclusion it should be emphasized that contractionary fiscal policy in a depressed economy had not only a negative short-term impact on GDP, but through hysteresis effects permanently affected the expected path of future growth. Despite this, the costs of expansionary fiscal policy are also worth to be taken into account and even in a depressed economy such policy surely should be timely, targeted and contemporary as sustainability of public finance in the long-term is recommended.","[Dziemianowicz, Ryta; Kargol-Wasiluk, Aneta; Wildowicz-Giegiel, Anna] Univ Bialystok, Fac Econ & Management, Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok,"Dziemianowicz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bialystok, Fac Econ & Management, Bialystok, Poland.",,,"Dziemianowicz, Ryta/0000-0002-7755-9887",,,,,38,0,0,0,1,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-6044,,978-80-87927-53-3,PROC ECON FINAN CONF,,,2018,,,,,,,11,31,,10.20472/EFC.2018.009.002,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505163200002,0

The analysis of differences with the description must be included in the notes to the financial statements. Then we can find out in detail what the differences result from. Most often, if revenues and expenses do not coincide, this results, for example, from the acceptance of revenues by tax law and, on the other hand, non-acceptance by tax law. This situation may also concern costs that will be recognized by the balance sheet law and will be eliminated by tax regulations. The situation of the financial result in terms of tax and balance sheet concerns taxpayers of personal income tax and income tax from legal persons.

Promoting increased walking for transport may contribute to reduced air pollution, noise and traffic congestion. Understanding the geography of pedestrian motor vehicle collisions (PMVCs) can provide evidence to inform policy and planning that targets increased walking while reducing pedestrian injury risk, however age-related differences in the geography of injury are expected given differences in activity patterns and physical and cognitive abilities. The purpose of this paper is to explore spatial patterns of pedestrian motor vehicle collisions (PMVCs) by age, injury severity, and location in Canada's largest city, the City of Toronto. Geographical variation in PMVCs and injuries by age (namely seniors and children) and severity were explored using indirect standardized rates. Moran's I statistics were estimated to study the spatial clustering of PMVCs across urban and inner suburban neighbourhoods. Distinct spatial patterns of PMVCs and injuries were evident among children and seniors. While evidence of spatial clustering was indicated for both age groups, children's injuries revealed the strongest clustering, while PMVCs involving seniors were more dispersed. Furthermore, fatal and major injury events appeared to be concentrated toward and within Toronto's inner suburbs for both age groups. Findings from this study demonstrate the importance of planning pedestrian safety interventions that acknowledge spatial differences in geographic patterns of PMVCs by age.","[Grise, Emily; Buliung, Ron] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Programs Environm, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Rothman, Linda] York Univ, Fac Hlth, Sch Kinesiol & Hlth Sci, Norman Bethune Coll, N York, ON, Canada; [Howard, Andrew] Univ Toronto, Dept Surg, Child Hlth Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Howard, Andrew] Univ Toronto, Dept Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Howard, Andrew] Hosp Sick Children, Orthoped Surg, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Grise, Emily] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C2, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga; York University - Canada; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); McGill University,"Grisé, E (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Programs Environm, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.;Grisé, E (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C2, Canada.",ernily.grise@mail.mcgill.ca; ron.buliung@utoronto.ca; lrothman@yorku.ca; andrew.howard@sickkids.ca,"Howard, Andrew W/C-7163-2009","Howard, Andrew/0000-0001-7226-6471",,,,,52,11,13,2,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The development environments of knowledge - based systems currently existing have interface components with high level, object - oriented programming languages, database management, etc., and some applications of artificial intelligence are developed in languages such as C, Prolog, ADA, etc. In this context, the main components of a system based on knowledge in the selection of waste models are: Creating and administering the database, Database Query, Statistical Data Processing, Artificial Intelligence Applications. Data and knowledge to be stored and processed within a system in the waste domain refer to certain categories that are subject to recycling and aggression of environmental factors. The waste description and experiments in this area generate two categories of data, namely: 1. descriptive data, 2. experimental data. The data that describes the source material of the waste (descriptive data) is predominantly knowledge that will be represented in the database within an evolutionary universal data structure. In this paper are presented a series of theoretical aspects regarding one of the techniques used in artificial intelligence, namely the recognition of forms for selection waste patterns. Form recognition is a technique of artificial intelligence, which has as object classification of a set of objects, processes or events, regardless of their nature. Given a division into classes of known forms, it must be indicated to which class belongs an unknown form. Determination of belonging to a class is done taking into account the similarity of the unknown form to the forms of the class.","[Iancu, Eugenia; Burciu, Aurel] Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Iancu, E (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Suceava, Romania.",eiancu@seap.usv.ro; aurelb@usv.ro,"Burciu, Aurel/ADB-6064-2022; Eugenia, Iancu/D-5891-2015",,,,,,12,0,0,1,10,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"2, TEPES VODA STR, IASI, 700 714, ROMANIA",,,978-1-910129-18-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,434,440,,10.18662/lumproc.93,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM9BY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470307900038,0

Effective financial management has long been recognized as the 'lifeblood' of construction contractors, especially during economic periods of recession. The main reason for insolvency in the built environment is the lack of working capital to support contractors' site operations. Therefore, it is vital to accurately predict the project working capital requirements at the pre-tender stage and closely monitor project cash-flow during the physical production process. The proposed methodology entails the development of a cash-flow/ working capital calculation process based on spreadsheet modelling and the Gantt chart for the derivation of project disbursements S-curves, revenue step function curves, and maximum/net cash-flow profiles. The model is implemented to a recently delivered typical infrastructure project - the construction of a new peripheral highway reinforced concrete bridge - and a sensitivity analysis is conducted to reach useful conclusions concerning the significance in infrastructure working capital of the following variables examined: the retention percentage, the 'front-end rate loading' by the contractor, and the premium advance incentive by the owner. The lowest maximum working capital requirement results from the provision of an advance mobilization payment by the owner to the contractor at project start-up and the selection of the latest start times site work execution program. The herein presented study is expected to assist both researchers and practitioners operating within the public construction sector in decision-making towards more effective financial management of infrastructure projects.","[Kantianis, Dimitrios D.; Liapis, Konstantinos J.] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, Athens, Greece",Panteion University,"Kantianis, DD (通讯作者)，Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, Athens, Greece.",dkant@panteion.gr,"Kantianis, Dimitrios D./ABC-9794-2021","Kantianis, Dimitrios D./0000-0001-9338-2375",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,69,87,,10.18502/kss.v3i10.3531,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7SJ,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455399000005,0

Nevertheless, the views on the direction of the causality relationship between savings and economic growth are rather controversial. The Solow model-based view supports to the hypothesis of income-driven growth and hence asserts that the causality relation operates from national savings to income. Savings play a major role in providing national capacity for investment and thus lead to the higher economic growth. On the other hand, the Keynesian model-based view, by advocating income-led savings growth, claims that causality operates from national income to savings. Namely, savings, as the non-consumed part of the income, are affected by changes in the level of income rather than determining the level of income. Therefore, there is no opportunity to influence the economic growth rate by implementing the policies aiming to increase the rate of savings. This study aims to investigate the validity of the views related to the Solow and Keynesian-based models for the Turkish economy by using Johansen cointegration analysis and Granger causality test. Thus, empirical results also show whether policies that encourage savings would be effective in order to accelerate economic growth in Turkey.","[Karahan, Ozcan] Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Bandirma, Turkey",Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University,"Karahan, Ö (通讯作者)，Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Bandirma, Turkey.",okarahan@bandirma.edu.tr,"Karahan, Özcan/D-9357-2018",,,,,,31,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-93452-5; 978-3-319-93451-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,127,139,,10.1007/978-3-319-93452-5_8,0.0,,,13,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BQ4NA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000591182600008,0

The most significant socio-cultural threats to the Russian society today are dissolution of Russia's traditional spiritual and moral values and the weakening of the unity of Russia's nationalities.

In this work we shall socio-cultural needs and civil identity of young people in the context of security psychology and the theory of socio-cultural identity. To achieve this purpose, the following methods were used: interviews, questionnaires, and factor analysis. The results of evaluation of the socio-cultural needs of young students were processed using the factor analysis. The results of factor analysis made it possible to establish the fact that one of the main socio-cultural needs of the Russian youth is the national and civilian identity. The needs for national-civilian identity are associated with a sense of patriotism, which maintains desire to develop one's homeland, and bolster connections with it, which manifests itself in his professional activities. The formation of civilian attitudes and patriotism in youth and of the socio-cultural identity in Russian citizens will save the state's sovereignty, resolve the creed crisis, and revive the respect for the state, society, family, and national historic and cultural heritage.","[Kislyakov, Pavel] Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Smeleva, Elena] Ivanovo State Univ, Ivanovo, Russia; [Gowin, Olga] Univ Vechta, Vechta, Germany",Russian State Social University (RSSU); Ivanovo State University,"Kislyakov, P (通讯作者)，Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia.",,"Shmeleva, Elena/H-7821-2016; Kislyakov, Pavel Aleksandrovich/E-4701-2016","Shmeleva, Elena/0000-0002-4698-5226;",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [18-413-370002\18],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),The publication was prepared within the framework of a research project supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (grant No. 18-413-370002\18 Sociocultural needs of young people in countering emerging threats and risks).,,25,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,691,697,,,,,,7,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000077,0

Distinguishing two types of risks, we show that, contrary to this traditional view, the relationship between risk and incentives can be positive. In franchise contracting, this implies that the royalty rate decreases with the risk faced by the franchisee on the local market. Using a unique panel dataset combining French franchise and financial data, we address this issue empirically, alongside performance outcomes. The data support the hypothesis of a negative relationship between risk and the royalty rate, which contradicts the prediction of the standard agency theory. Furthermore, our estimations provide evidence that chain performance increases with an adjusted royalty rate. This paper has important implications for contract design, showing that with increasing local market uncertainty and low-risk aversion, franchisors should reduce the royalty rate.","[Lanchimba, Cintya] Escuela Politec Nacl, E11-253, Quito 170517, Ecuador; [Fadairo, Muriel] Univ Lyon, UJM St Etienne, GATE Lyon St Etienne, UMR 5824, 10 Rue Trefilerie, F-42023 St Etienne, France; [Windsperger, Josef] Univ Vienna, Fac Business Econ & Stat, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Escuela Politecnica Nacional Ecuador; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); University of Vienna,"Fadairo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, UJM St Etienne, GATE Lyon St Etienne, UMR 5824, 10 Rue Trefilerie, F-42023 St Etienne, France.",cintya.lanchimba@epn.edu.ec; josef.windsperger@univie.ac.at; muriel.fadairo@univ-st-etienne.fr,"; Lanchimba, Cintya/U-5725-2018","windsperger, josef/0000-0002-3413-5160; Lanchimba, Cintya/0000-0003-2837-9107",,,,,71,18,19,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Thus, in the study of risk analysis, it is appreciated that, essentially, there are two categories of variables that cause the greatest sensitivity of the result indicators: the cost structure, being considered the main cause of the economic risk, and the financial structure of the enterprise, which has the potential to determine the financial risk. The size of the operating risk is conditioned by the enterprise's ability to efficiently manage the cost structure and to take into account the fact that it develops unequal sensitivity to activity level variations because some expenditure vary (proportionally or non-proportionally) to the volume of activity, being categorized as variable costs, and another category of expenditure is low or almost of insignificant variability depending on the volume of activity variation, being considered as fixed or structure expenditure, these costs lead to a decrease in enterprise flexibility as they do not have the property to adapt when the volume of activity is changing. Based on these considerations, in the methodological approach of this paper we considered the way of determining the economic risk for two economic entities, which operate in the same geographical area, having the same object of activity, through the instrumentation used in cost-volume analysis, this model of analysis is also a useful tool for forecasting and managerial control.","[Mihalciuc, Camelia Catalina] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Mihalciuc, CC (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",cameliam@seap.usv.ro,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"2, TEPES VODA STR, IASI, 700 714, ROMANIA",,,978-1-910129-18-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,361,374,,10.18662/lumproc.87,0.0,,,14,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM9BY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470307900032,0

Although research has shown that word choice and tone can help identify fraudulent financial reports, it is as yet unclear how this occurs when these reports are written by many individuals, some of whom are unaware that financial misrepresentation is occurring. Through an examination of industry recommendations and interviews with individuals experienced in writing the MD&A section, the authors confirm that many hands are involved in drafting this portion of financial reports. The authors then structure an experiment, using a real fraud case, that asks participants to write an MD&A from truthful prior U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and a memo from the CFO with suggestions of what to say in the current period MD&A. Unbeknownst to participants the CFO memo was created using phrases from financial statements subsequently identified to be fraudulent. The authors find that individuals do unwittingly write MD&A associated with fraudulent financial statements with relatively little suspicion and that linguistic cues contained in the CFO memo are transmitted to the ultimate MD&A through naive and innocent participants.","[Murphy, Pamela R.; Purda, Lynnette; Skillicorn, David] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Murphy, PR (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Smith Sch Business, Goodes Hall, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",pamela.murphy@queensu.ca,,"Purda, Lynnette/0000-0002-8693-8045; Skillicorn, David/0000-0003-0605-4029",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),Funding for this research was provided by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.,,27,5,5,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Our main concern is how one country deals with the policies proposed by the IMF and the degree of government freedom. This paper is an attempt to assess how much a country needs the IMF. Argentina's and Brazil's recovery experience following the devaluation of the national currency provides an interesting case of analysis. Following the 1999 currency devaluation, Brazil pursued a closely monitored economic policy supported by the IMF, while Argentina, after the 2001-2002 crisis, pursued a more independent policy that in many cases opposed the IMF's recommendation. This paper compares the performances of both countries, as well as the benefits of pursuing or not the IMF's recipe to get out of a foreigner that could come from the balance of payments deficit. As we can see, pursuing the recipe of the IMF does not ensure either success or failure. This paper compares the experience of both countries with which it has the best strategy for recovery. Economic performance shows us that both countries have come back in a similar way, highlighting the need for the IMF to engage in recovery.","[Neamtu, Daniela Mihaela] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Neamtu, DM (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Suceava, Romania.",dananeamtu999@gmail.com,"Neamtu, Daniela Mihaela/IAQ-7440-2023","Neamtu, Daniela Mihaela/0000-0002-8488-0900",,,,,11,0,0,1,7,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"2, TEPES VODA STR, IASI, 700 714, ROMANIA",,,978-1-910129-18-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,68,+,,10.18662/lumproc.63,0.0,,,15,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM9BY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470307900008,0

And cash flow ratios have provoked the attention of practitioners and academic researchers to use to evaluate the performance of a company. This study examines, over the 3-year period (2012-2014), the liquidity position of selected 125 companies of the Sri Lankan economy using cash flow statement ratios and classic liquidity ratios suggested by various researchers. The total number of companies listed in the main market of the Colombo Stock Exchange is 313. Classic ratios were obtained from the Osiris database, and cash flow ratios were calculated by using financial statements of selected companies. The ratios, which I examined, are those current ratio, quick assets ratio, total assets to total liabilities ratio, and interest coverage ratio. Similarly, cash flow ratios examined were operating cash flow ratio, critical needs cash coverage ratio, cash flow to total debt ratio, and cash interest coverage ratio. And for investigation to find out how strong is relationship between classic and cash flow ratios correlation analysis were made. Results, which were got after correlation analysis showed positive relationship between classic and cash flow ratios. However additional t-tests analysis, showed substantial difference. The main point of the abovementioned results suggests that well-known liquidity ratios should not be used only for calculating liquidity since a company can have serious cash flow problems with positive liquidity ratios and increasing profits. Liquidity ratios developed using the statement of cash flows provide additional information or sometimes better insight on the financial strength or weakness of a company.","[Petriashvili, Aleksandre] Univ Econ, Dept Corp Finance, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Petriashvili, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Corp Finance, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",xpeta28@vse.cz,,,Internal Grant System of the University of Economics in Prague [IGA/48/2016],Internal Grant System of the University of Economics in Prague,The paper has been prepared within the research project theoretical approaches to optimize the capital structure (supported by the Internal Grant System of the University of Economics in Prague no.

On average, Czechs view the distribution of disposable income as more unequal than it actually is. This biased perception results from underestimating total income shares belonging to bottom quintiles and overestimating the total income share belonging to the top income quintile. Whereas the majority of Czechs prefer some level of income stratification, there are about four tenths of people who would prefer to live in a completely equal society. These are primarily older, less educated and lower income people whose preferences formulated under uncertainty are mostly consistent with the maximin principle and inequality aversion.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors use the non-parametric data envelopment analysis approach to analyze the financial performance of 247 branches in 2014, spread over 14 states of a country. After checking for possible misspecification bias, the authors use the fractional regression approach in the second stage of the analysis to assess possible drivers of the efficiency of bank branches in terms of the size of business, funding mix, per employee contribution to business and profit and business per transaction. In addition, the authors included spatial parameters like economic condition and competitive position of branches in their analysis. Findings - The authors find that on an overall basis, there might be a deliberate initiative of the top management of the bank to over-branch in order to improve the output at the aggregate level which is above the level of cost minimization. The study clearly indicates to the top management that low-cost deposit is a significant driver of branch efficiency apart from business per transaction, income per employee. Moreover, it is found that branches located in areas of high branch concentration are more efficient, and local economic condition does drive efficiency of branches. Practical implications - The authors address the dilemma faced by the top management of banks in arriving at an appropriate scientific benchmark to assess the performance of branches based on the drivers of efficiency and initiate suitable strategic interventions to improve their efficiency. Originality/value - The integrated assessment of the efficiency of bank branches and arriving at the drivers of efficiency using the fractional regression model framework are likely to prove beneficial in the benchmarking exercise of the performance of bank branches.","[Saha, Asish] FLAME Univ, Dept Finance, FLAME Sch Business, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Hock-Eam, Lim; Yeok, Siew Goh] Univ Utara Malaysia, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintok, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Saha, A (通讯作者)，FLAME Univ, Dept Finance, FLAME Sch Business, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",asish_saha@hotmail.com,"Saha, Asish/HGE-9058-2022; University, FLAME/HSG-7860-2023","Saha, Asish/0000-0002-6262-3655; University, FLAME/0009-0003-3435-6187; Lim, Hock Eam/0000-0003-2165-0224",,,,,47,6,6,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - The multivariate GARCH-dynamic conditional correlation is deployed to estimate the time-varying linkages of the selected conventional and Islamic Asian and international stock index returns with the Malaysian stock index returns, covering approximately eight years daily starting from 29 June 2007 to 30 June 2016. Findings - In general, in terms of volatility, the results indicate that both Asian and international Islamic stock indices are more or less volatile than its conventional counterparts. From the correlation analysis, we can see that both the conventional and Islamic MSCI indices of Japan provide more diversification benefits compared to Southeast Asian region, China, Hong Kong and India. Meanwhile, in terms of international portfolio diversification, the results tend to suggest that both the conventional and Islamic MSCI indices of the USA provide more diversification benefits compared to the UK, Canada, France, Germany and Switzerland. Originality/value - The findings of this paper may have several significant implications for the Malaysia-based equity investors and fund managers who seek for the understanding of return correlations between the Malaysian stock index and the world's largest stock market indices in order to gain higher risk-adjusted returns through portfolio diversification. With regard to policy implications, the findings on market shocks and the extent of the interdependence of the Malaysian market with cross-border markets may provide some useful insights in formulating effective macroeconomic stabilization policies in the efforts of preventing contagion effect from deteriorating the domestic economy.","[Saiti, Buerhan; Noordin, Nazrul Hazizi] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Inst Islamic Banking & Finance, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia,"Saiti, B (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Inst Islamic Banking & Finance, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",borhanseti@gmail.com,"Noordin, Nazrul Hazizi/IQV-8946-2023; ULUYOL, Burhan/C-8168-2017","ULUYOL, Burhan/0000-0002-9984-489X; Noordin, Nazrul Hazizi/0000-0002-8094-4962",Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia through Research Initiative Grant Scheme (RIGS) [RIGS15-008-0008],Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia through Research Initiative Grant Scheme (RIGS),"The authors acknowledge that this study was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia through Research Initiative Grant Scheme (RIGS), Research Project ID: RIGS15-008-0008.

Understanding who the competitors are and how they behave is a basic prerequisite for firms to adopt the right strategic positioning. Strategy and performance, therefore, are considered to be inseparable. In this manuscript, we exploit these two central areas in the field of business management from the perspective of grain terminal operators. A framework of analysis based on robust operations and strategic management literature is built to identify the strategic pattern of 24 intermodal grain terminals spread throughout the five Brazilian regions. The operational efficiency of the terminals is assessed through Data Envelopment Analysis. Subsequently, strategic groups are identified with the support of Cluster Analysis. Results suggest the existence of two major strategic groups: diversified small-scale terminals and focused large-scale terminals. The study is concluded by arguing that diversified small-scale terminals tend to offer a wider range of secondary services as an alternative to counterbalance their small transshipment scale, therefore, are likely to adopt a differentiation strategy; large-scale terminals, on the other hand, tend to focus mainly on the transshipment process, thus, are likely to adopt a cost leadership strategy. Theoretical and managerial implications resultant from the findings are presented and discussed.","[Santos, Alexandre Borges; Batalha, Mario Otavio] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Agribusiness Syst Studies GEPAI, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Sproesser, Renato Luiz] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Sch Business & Management ESAN, Dept Management, Cidade Univ, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul,"Santos, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Agribusiness Syst Studies GEPAI, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",borges.alexandre@dep.ufscar.br,"Batalha, Mario O/J-9302-2012","Batalha, Mario Otavio/0000-0003-2711-3358; Santos, Alexandre/0000-0001-8064-4794",CNPq [402434/2009-9]; FAPESP [14/17426-3]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [14/17426-3] Funding Source: FAPESP,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC)),The authors acknowledge financial support from CNPq (grant No. 402434/2009-9).

However, the reasons for this phenomenon in developed and developing countries vary considerably. In the first group of countries, youth unemployment is caused by a series of macroeconomic crises of recent years, in the second group - the inability to organize the optimal number of jobs sufficient for the ever-increasing flow of young cadres. Indeed, it is in the countries with a growing economy that today about 90% of all the world's young people live. Youth unemployment has become stagnant throughout the world. At the same time, many newly-entered young people automatically become working poor and become one of the most vulnerable categories of citizens. The paper presents both youth unemployment and the growth of the share of young working poor influences the internal aggregate demand, the inadequacy of financial resources in public funds of funds in connection with the transition of young employees to informal forms of hiring, decision-making in favor of emigration to more prosperous regions and employment in foreign companies. In the process of analyzing the problem, typical institutional traps, which are encountered in the world practice, are blocking the reduction of youth unemployment, as well as a positive experience of overcoming them. The paper discusses tools for working with young people that can be useful for adapting the younger generation to modern trends in the labor market and reducing the proportion of working poor.","[Shpilina, Tatyana; Vasiutina, Ekaterina; Mosalev, Anton] Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Nanyunja, Robinah] Pilot Int, Kampala, Uganda",Russian State Social University (RSSU),"Shpilina, T (通讯作者)，Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia.",ShpilinaTM@rgsu.net; VasjutinaES@rgsu.net; MosalevAI@rgsu.net; robinahknanyunja@robinahknanyunja.com,"Mosalev, Anton/F-6781-2013; Shpilina, Tatyana/R-3474-2018; Vasiutina, Ekaterina/U-4254-2018","Mosalev, Anton/0000-0001-7213-5308;",,,,,23,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,765,773,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000086,0

The special focus is concentrated on its causes and consequences. The research hypothesis states that fiscal illusion is mainly determined by institutional factors and leads to deterioration of public finance. In relation to the formulated hypothesis, the article aims to assess the size of fiscal illusion in the EU-28 countries in years 2004 and 2015. For this purpose, the index of fiscal illusion was used. The principal component analysis (PCA) allowed the indication of four factors which were included in the formula of index. These four factors embrace different measures and indicators that can be assigned to different dimensions of fiscal illusion. The highest value of the index in 2015 was achieved in Greece (0,991), Italy (0,973) and Hungary (0,955) whereas the lowest in Ireland (0,047). The results of the study revealed the importance of institutional determinants, which both influence the quality of public finance and the size of fiscal illusion.","[Wildowicz-Giegiel, Anna; Kargol-Wasiluk, Aneta] Univ Bialystok, Fac Econ & Management, Warszawska St 63, PL-15062 Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok,"Wildowicz-Giegiel, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bialystok, Fac Econ & Management, Warszawska St 63, PL-15062 Bialystok, Poland.",a.wildowicz@uwb.edu.pl; a.kargol@uwb.edu.pl,,,,,,,59,0,0,1,1,NEWTON ACAD AS,PRAHA 1,"POLITICKYCH VEZNU 10, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87325-12-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,176,189,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQ1LR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576786300018,0

Furthermore, the independent variables are Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), Financing to Deposit Ratio (FDR) and Bank Indonesia Sharia Certificates (SBIS). The results showed that the CAR and FDR have a significant negative effect on NPF. While, the SBIS rate has not effect on NPF. The result of simultaneous regression show that the CAR, FDR and SBIS rate have effect on NPF.

We find that those who live and work in suburban areas are more likely than others to shop at traditional stores to conduct pre-purchase and purchase activities for books and clothing, likely because of the slow diffusion of e-shopping in these areas. On the other hand, travel time to stores is positively associated with online shopping for books but not for clothing, and onerous travel modes are associated with pre-purchase activities on the internet. Thus, shopping accessibility negatively affects e-shopping.

We use China as a case study, wherein the fulfillment of surging demands for redistribution is largely dependent on whether or not the political elites will advocate for redistribution. Using data from the Chinese General Social Survey, we find that the political elites prefer significantly less progressive taxation and less redistributive expenditure than the public. The gap in redistributive preference is larger on the expenditure side than on the taxation side. Moreover, the causes of the gap appear to vary by the measures for redistribution. Accounting for covariate differences fully explains the gap in preference for progressive taxation, but not the gap in preference for redistributive expenditure.","[An, Weihua] Emory Univ, Dept Sociol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [An, Weihua] Emory Univ, Inst Quantitat Theory & Methods, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Ye, Maoliang] Xiamen Univ, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Dept Publ Finance,Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Ye, Maoliang] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Emory University; Emory University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Ye, ML (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Dept Publ Finance,Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Ye, ML (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",weihuaan@gmail.com; maoliang.ye@post.harvard.edu,"Ye, Maoliang/AAF-7534-2020","Ye, Maoliang/0000-0003-0240-8686","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720161075]; Youth Grant for Humanities and Social Sciences Research, Chinese Ministry of Education [14YJC790156]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Youth Grant for Humanities and Social Sciences Research, Chinese Ministry of Education","We are indebted to the editor Jan-Egbert Sturm, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

We extend that theory to analyze same-gender contests in that marketplace, and to elaborate the idea that what the woman sells is not just sex but exclusive access to her sexual charms. Women compete on sex appeal and on the promise of exclusiveness (faithfulness), with the goal of getting a man who will provide material resources. Men compete to amass material resources, with the goal of getting a good sex partner. Female competition includes showing off her sexual charms, offering sex at a lower price than rivals, seeking to improve her physical assets (e.g., by dieting), and use of informational warfare to sully rivals' reputations while defending her own reputation against malicious gossip. We review evidence of these patterns, including evidence that female body dissatisfaction and pathological eating patterns increase when women perceive an unfavorable sex ratio (i.e., shortage of eligible men). Men compete in groups to amass resources, so men see other men not just as sexual rivals but also as coalition partners. Male homophobia is often not about sex but rather invokes the stereotype that a homosexual man will not be an effective coalition partner. Misunderstandings about whether sex or exclusivity is the central commitment can complicate marital adjustment for couples. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In this article, we use a joint sample of banks and nonbanks between 1965 and 2013 to analyze the determinants of this leverage difference. We find that a single factor, asset risk, is able to explain up to 90% of this difference. Banks' assets consist of a diversified portfolio of nonbank debt. Therefore, banks have much lower asset risk than do nonbanks. Because asset risk is a major determinant of capital structure choice, this factor is able to explain a large fraction of the difference between bank and nonbank leverage.","[Berg, Tobias] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany; [Gider, Jasmin] Univ Bonn, Inst Financial Econ & Stat, Bonn, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; University of Bonn,"Berg, T (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany.",t.berg@fs.de; jasmin.gider@uni-bonn.de,,"Gider, Jasmin/0000-0002-3729-2989",,,,,27,25,27,1,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Using survey-based data of a sample of U.S. RJVs, we build on the theory of dynamic entrepreneurship to develop an empirical model of cross-RJV differences in performance. We find that ventures that include a university as a research member are relatively more successful, measured in terms of research goals completed, than ventures that do not. We also find that those RJVs that have a longer research duration and that are led by a firm with prior RJV experience are similarly more successful. Our empirical analysis also shows that membership size is not a significant covariate with research success. We conclude the paper with a call for additional research and with a policy statement that is based on our finding of a positive and significant relationship between university membership and RJV success.","[Bray, Jeremy W.; Link, Albert N.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Link, AN (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",jwbray@uncg.edu; anlink@uncg.edu,,"Bray, Jeremy/0000-0001-7712-160X",,,,,41,5,5,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Behavioral responses showed more positive attitudes toward ads comprising MVs and GF messages. A whole-brain analysis revealed that visual regions are strongly elicited by LF (vs. GF) messages, whereas an area related to personal value computing, future positive aspirations, and social benefits-namely, the anterior cingulate cortex-is strongly activated by GF (vs. LF) messages. The MV triggered stronger activation in areas related to pitch processing and visual scenes, whereas the FV provoked a higher neural-audiovisual integration. Furthermore, neural activation in the inferior frontal gyrus significantly predicted attitudes toward ads pronounced by the MV, and the activation in the orbitofrontal gyrus predicted attitudes toward ads comprising GF messages. Taken together, this article sheds light on a differential neural processing of gain and loss frames as well as MV and FV. It also suggests that messages expressing social benefits (e.g., environmental) could be processed differently from those reporting individual advantages (e.g., healthy). Finally, it advises managers and associations which market environmentally responsible products and ideas the voice and frame of the message which generate the highest subconscious value.","[Casado-Aranda, Luis-Alberto; Sanchez-Fernandez, Juan; Montoro-Rios, Francisco J.] Univ Granada, Dept Mkt & Market Res, Calle Averroes19,1A, Granada 18013, Spain",University of Granada,"Casado-Aranda, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Mkt & Market Res, Calle Averroes19,1A, Granada 18013, Spain.",lcasado@ugr.es,"Casado-Aranda, Luis-Alberto/P-9968-2019; Montoro-Rios, Francisco J/A-6955-2011; Casado-Aranda, Luis-Alberto/H-5118-2018; Sanchez-Fernandez, Juan/I-1651-2015","Sanchez-Fernandez, Juan/0000-0001-6725-920X; Montoro-Rios, Francisco J/0000-0003-4715-3875","Andalusia Regional Government [P12-SEJ-1980]; Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports of Spain; Formation of University Professor (FPU) contract [FPU14/04736]","Andalusia Regional Government; Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports of Spain(Spanish Government); Formation of University Professor (FPU) contract(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The research was supported by the Andalusia Regional Government under a grant of the Excellence Research Project P12-SEJ-1980 and the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports of Spain.

We formulate a conceptual hypothesis by differentiating the production (e.g., commuting) aspects from the consumption (e.g., leisure) aspects of travel. We argue that less capable people may focus more on the production aspects, whereas more capable people may focus more on the consumption aspects. Two operationalized hypotheses are introduced for empirical verification: (1) travel time is significantly related to individual capability and is shorter for less capable people, and (2) the variance of travel time, indicating the degree of freedom of movement, has a positive association with individual capability. To confirm the hypotheses empirically, an activity travel survey was conducted in middle-income group housing, slums, and slum rehabilitation units in Mumbai, India. Our results support both hypotheses, suggesting that, when people are less capable, they attach more importance to the production aspects of travel, but as capability increases, the consumption aspects become more vital. Based on our findings, we discuss practical implications for transport appraisal in the development context.","[Chikaraishi, Makoto; Fujiwara, Akimasa] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima 7398529, Japan; [Jana, Arnab; Bardhan, Ronita; Varghese, Varun] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Urban Sci & Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Hiroshima University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Chikaraishi, M (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Int Dev & Cooperat, 1-5-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima 7398529, Japan.",chikaraishim@hiroshima-u.ac.jp; arnab.jana@iitb.ac.in; ronita.bardhan@iitb.ac.in; varunvarghese17@gmail.com; afujiw@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Bardhan, Ronita/AAG-3032-2020; Jana, Arnab/C-4116-2016; Chikaraishi, Makoto/J-9296-2015; Varghese, Varun/ABF-7035-2020; Bardhan, Ronita/Q-7316-2019; Fujiwara, Akimasa/N-3328-2013","Bardhan, Ronita/0000-0001-5336-4084; Jana, Arnab/0000-0001-8210-1566; Varghese, Varun/0000-0001-6524-7192; Bardhan, Ronita/0000-0001-5336-4084; Fujiwara, Akimasa/0000-0002-3354-0631","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H04938, 15H02271] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,56,14,14,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

These models also make unusual policy predictions: Useless government spending, technical regress, capital destruction, and forward guidance can raise output. Moreover, these predictions are larger as prices become less sticky and as changes are expected further in the future. I show that these predictions are strongly affected by equilibrium selection. For the same interest-rate path, equilibria that bound initial jumps predict mild inflation, small output variation, negative multipliers, small effects of far-off expectations and a smooth frictionless limit. Fiscal policy considerations suggest the latter equilibria. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find that in a game with only a few regions, aggregate behavior across regions is largely consistent with the theoretical predictions.

We collect data on 619 MFIs from 75 countries over the period of 1996-2012 and merge them with country-level data on government ideology and other economic and institutional factors. We find that MFIs operating in a left wing regime have higher portfolio growth rates relative to the ones operating in a right wing or a centrist regime. Furthermore, under leftist political leadership, MFIs have lower funding costs, lower operating costs, and lower default costs. The electoral incentives of left wing governments, however, impair the capacity of MFIs to increase financial revenue. Thus, despite having lower costs, these MFIs are not more sustainable relative to those operating in right wing or centrist regimes. Academics and policymakers devote substantial resources to better understand the conditions under which MFIs are more likely to flourish and deliver on their promises. We contribute to this endeavor by empirically showing that government ideology is an important determinant of MFI performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study provides three major findings. First, a productivity gap exists between large enterprises and SMEs in Korea. Second, this productivity gap between large firms and SMEs has been expanding. Third, the R&D efficiency in large enterprises is greater than that in SMEs. Finally, the spillover effects in both firm groups in Korea are asymmetric. That is, even if the productivity spillover effect is significant in enterprises of both sizes, a large enterprise is more likely than an SME to benefit from the spillover effects.","[Kim, Jin Woong; Ro, Young-Jin] Dong A Univ, Dept Int Trade, 225 Gudeok Ro, Busan 49336, South Korea",Dong A University,"Ro, YJ (通讯作者)，Dong A Univ, Dept Int Trade, 225 Gudeok Ro, Busan 49336, South Korea.",jwkim01@dau.ac.kr; yjro71@gmail.com,,,Dong-A University,Dong-A University,This work was supported by the Dong-A University research fund.,,69,4,4,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

This research examined the graduates' views of the subject Accounting and Tax Office, whether after graduating from this course, they are better prepared for practice and if it increases their competitiveness in the labour market. The research also dealt with issues related to the ability to work in a large team, using their own creativity and responsibility for their work. Several statistical procedures have been used. The normal distribution was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, but as the file is on the edge of number of 50, a Shapiro-Wilk test was executed to test whether the data come from a normal distribution.

We find that, given average grant levels during our sample period, a 10% increase in new options granted leads to a 2.8% to 4.2% increase in equity volatility.

As a result, researchers often attribute instances of organizational nonconformity to shifts in consumer expectations. Acknowledging that many markets are best characterized as brokered markets whereby consumers and producers come together via a third party, this article explores an alternative, relational mechanism that can account for rapid market changes that occur in defiance of consumer expectations. In short, we suggest that consumer expectations may be applied differentially as a function of the way they travel through the market. We refer to this phenomenon as institutional interruption, and define it as the process whereby existing modes of institutional reproduction are temporarily disturbed via alterations to a market's relational structure. Central to the proposed framework is a distinction between two styles of network brokerage: transmission and transformation. Both modes contribute to markets by moving tangible resources, such as goods and capital, from one party to the other. Where they differ is in their capacity to actively transform or block the diffusion of various intangible things-here being consumer expectations-upon which markets are constructed. In an empirical section, we apply the transmission-transformation distinction to help explain growth and decline in product heterogeneity in the global hedge fund industry from 1994 to the present.","[Smith, Edward Bishop; Gai, Shelby L.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Management & Organizat Dept, Evanston, IL USA",Northwestern University,"Smith, EB (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Management & Organizat Dept, Evanston, IL USA.",ned-smith@kellogg.northwestern.edu; shelby.gai@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation,Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation,"We have benefited from the advice of Gautam Ahuja, Matt Bothner, Jeannette Colyvas, Tim Conley, Jane Dutton, Joseph Gerakos, Brayden King, Edward Laumann, John Levi Martin, William Ocasio, Damon Phillips, Ezra Zuckerman, and participants at the MIT TIES workshop, the 2012 Organizational Ecology Conference (Copenhagen), and the 2011 Global Absolute Returns Congress (London, UK).

We constructed an experiment in which the subjects' wage expectations were used as a reference point (RP) and representatives of two distinct psychological profiles in decision-making served as subjects. Sixteen university students-eight maximizers and eight satisficers-were recruited to participate in the functional MRI study. Maximizers normally put more effort and time to optimize their choices. Our design featured a constraint on time and maximal number of offers. Behavioral data showed that maximizers, unlike satisficers, tried to optimize the outcome even under such constraints. Functional MRI responses in the areas of the PFC (posterior medial frontal cortex and right rostral portion of the PFC), occipital cortex (left lingual gyrus and occipital visual areas), inferior parietal lobule on the right, and the angular gyrus correlated positively with increased wage offers weighted according to the PT's value function. Furthermore, maximizers and satisficers differed markedly in how brain activation was engaged in the medial PFC. Previous neuroimaging studies on the PT's value function have used status quo as an RP, whereas our results demonstrated activity in distributed brain networks when salary expectation served as an RP. Furthermore, the PT's value function effect on frontal cortex differs according to the psychological profile, being stronger among maximizers than satisficers.","[Suomala, Jyrki; Hlushchuk, Yevhen; Kauttonen, Janne; Heinonen, Jarmo; Palokangas, Lauri] Laurea Univ Appl Sci, NeuroLab, Vanha Maantie 9, Espoo 02650, Finland; [Suomala, Jyrki] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Hlushchuk, Yevhen; Numminen, Jussi] Helsinki Univ Hosp, HUS Med Imaging Ctr, Helsinki, Finland; [Heinonen, Jarmo] Aalto Univ, Aalto NeuroImaging, Espoo, Finland",Laurea University of Applied Sciences; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Helsinki; Helsinki University Central Hospital; Hyvinkaan Sairaala; Aalto University,"Suomala, J (通讯作者)，Laurea Univ Appl Sci, NeuroLab, Vanha Maantie 9, Espoo 02650, Finland.",jyrki.suomala@laurea.fi,"Kauttonen, Janne/HPD-2243-2023","Kauttonen, Janne/0000-0003-2432-5072",,,,,61,3,3,0,8,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

When the product market is competitive and employees have low bargaining power, the unique equilibrium is for each firm's owners to offer equity-based compensation to their employees. In this setting, equity-based compensation leads to a lower wage rate, which makes each firm more competitive with its rival. However, this unique equilibrium is a Prisoner's Dilemma for the firms' original owners.

Not only has the literature on religion and development blossomed over the last decade, but partnerships between international development institutions and faith communities have also multiplied. Yet, little is said about how such engagement is to take place beyond reference to general principles, and beyond the instrumental use of religion for achieving pre-determined international development goals. The aim of the paper is to propose some methodological grounding for engaging development and religion at the normative level. It does so on the basis of Amartya Sen's capability approach and Pope Francis's encyclical Laudato Si': On Care of Our Common Home. Although the latter is written by the global Catholic leader, it is addressed to every human being and urges a redefinition of the meaning of development. Our paper argues that the encyclical contains a potentially fruitful methodological proposal for engaging development and religion. We analyze how such a methodology has been applied in an exercise by the UK Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) to facilitate a global dialogue on development and religion in different geographical contexts. After addressing some of the limits of the methodology of Laudato Si', we examine how Sen's normative conceptualization of development and methodological proposal toward dialogue and reason about values including religious ones could complement some religious approaches and methodologies, such as in Laudato Si', to yield innovative proposals for engaging development and religion.

The research is focused on organizations from the metal construction industry. The sample consists of organizations from Romania operating in the before mentioned area, which have a consolidated position in the market and conducted efforts in implementing TQM systems. The data analysis was conducted through quantitative research methods, based on statistical processing. Regarding the research tools used for data collection, a survey based on a questionnaire was employed. The designed and pre-tested questionnaire contains items based on factors considered important in analysing and evaluating the TQM system, based on the evaluation criteria of the EFQM European Excellence Award (European Foundation for Quality Management), which provides credibility to the research. The objective of the present research is analysing the components of the TQM system, leadership and quality culture, in companies from the Romanian metal construction industry and their influence on customer relationship. The empirical research was conducted between September 2014 and August 2015, and the study is based on questioning 263 managers from 23 companies. The main research results show a very strong positive relation between the variables leadership, quality culture and customer relationship. It was also noticed that the management team of the analysed organizations is concerned with the continuous quality improvement process and that efforts are made for satisfying and exceeding customers' expectations, thus existing the premises for creating customers' dedicated organizations and achieving long term excellence. A surprising result concerning the leadership style favourable to quality culture's development was obtained. The managers from the analysed organizations which have an authoritarian leadership style favour the development of a quality culture more than managers who adopt a democratic style.","[Ilies, Liviu; Salagean, Horatiu Catalin; Beleiu, Ioana] Babes Bolyai Univ, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Beleiu, I (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",ioana.beleiu@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Beleiu, Ioana Natalia/Y-1554-2019","Beleiu, Ioana Natalia/0000-0002-1400-3259",,,,,20,10,10,0,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2017,19.0,,,,11,,1050,1063,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9VF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413858500009,0

In this framework, we test causality from cost efficiency to bank growth and then from bank growth to market concentration. We apply this approach to banking industry in Association of South East Asian (ASEAN) over the period of 1999-2014. The efficiency scores have been estimated by employing Slack Based Measurements Data Envelopment Analysis (SMB DEA). We apply Two-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and Panel Vector Auto Regression (PVAR) to account for endogeneity in estimation models. The results show that cost efficiency enables the banks to grow and obtain higher market share. The resultant growth then leads to higher market concentration/bank market power. There is also some evidence to support for quiet life (QL) hypothesis. Therefore, both ES and QL hypotheses may coexist in ASEAN banking industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The financial cycle is captured by a monthly Country-Level Index of Financial Stress (CLIFS). Based on two Markov-switching and one threshold vector autoregressive model, information from the CLIFS and industrial production are combined to identify those episodes of financial market stress that are associated with a substantial negative impact on the real economy. By applying this framework to 27 European Union countries, the paper is a first attempt to provide a chronology of systemic financial stress episodes as a complement to the expert-detected events that are currently available.

Recent empirical findings reveal that considerable flexibility exists within the certification process, which permits the loosening of linkages to a region and dilutes the certification guarantee.

Rwanda is a key case study in this debate, with proponents of developmental patrimonialism and party capitalism' arguing that companies owned by the ruling party or the military play positive roles in economic development. This debate often focuses on macro-level, elite politics. This paper instead uses a Foucauldian lens to examine the micro-level politics of pyrethrum production in Rwanda, which is managed by a military-owned company. The company utilizes incentive-based governmental strategies, in line with state discourses, in addition to punitive, disciplinary regimes. The paper demonstrates that state agricultural strategies depend on multiple factors, including multi-scale political tensions between the ruling party's desire for control and its discourse of entrepreneurship'.","[Huggins, Chris] Univ Ottawa, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, Fac Social Sci, Room 8052,120 Univ Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Huggins, C (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, Fac Social Sci, Room 8052,120 Univ Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",chuggins@uottawa.ca,,,Department of Geography and Environmental Studies (DGES) at Carleton University; Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Philip E.

We focus on the case of the labor market where some municipalities offer too few workplaces for their local population, forcing some of their residents to long drives. We apply this new accessibility measure to explain households' annual mileage in Switzerland using a Heckman model to account for carless households. We find that car travel demand is much greater in municipalities with a relative undersupply in the local labor market compared to a balanced or oversupplied local labor market. The results show that driving increases with greater distance to the labor market center. The model estimates allow policy makers and planners to quantify as a first assessment the expected average mileage in each municipality for new settlements and to identify municipalities with low expected annual mileage.","[Loder, Allister; Tanner, Reto; Axhausen, Kay W.] ETH, Inst Transport Planning & Syst IVT, HIL F 32-2,Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tanner, Reto] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Transport Sci, Div Syst Anal & Econometr SEC, Teknikringen 72, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Royal Institute of Technology,"Loder, A (通讯作者)，ETH, Inst Transport Planning & Syst IVT, HIL F 32-2,Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",Allister.Loder@ivt.baug.ethz.ch,"Axhausen, Kay W/A-1598-2008; Loder, Allister/JXN-9130-2024","Loder, Allister/0000-0003-3102-6564",ETH [ETH-04 15-1],ETH(ETH Zurich),The authors thank the two anonymous referees for their comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

On a sequence of yearly reference days, the insured can choose between a guaranteed return (linked to the insurer's asset result) and a capped index participation. The cap is adjusted at the beginning of each year such that both alternatives have the same value and the option to select is costless (product structuring condition). We point out that this condition cannot always be met. If the guaranteed return exceeds the upper bound of the capped index participation, the insurer can make a side profit. We show that a rather low insurance result also implies a rather low stock exposure, even if the insured opts for the index participation. Concerning the impact of the index dynamics, we emphasize that it is important to distinguish between jump and diffusion risk because the pricing of jump risk has an impact on cap rates that can be offered to an insured. Finally, we show that the optimal decision strategy of a CRRA investor implies an index selection even if it is unfairly priced such that the insurer indeed makes a side profit.","[Mahayni, Antje] Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Lotharstr 65, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany; [Muck, Matthias] Univ Bamberg, Chair Banking & Financial Control, Karntenstr 7, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Mahayni, A (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Lotharstr 65, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.",antje.mahayni@uni-due.de; bwl-bfc@uni-bamberg.de,"Muck, Matthias/HNP-0484-2023","Muck, Matthias/0000-0003-2364-9833; Prof. Dr. Mahayni, Antje/0000-0001-8750-2895",,,,,39,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

This paper explores the role of negotiation over budget allocation and coalition formation in water boards, to provide an explanation for such user-specific gaps between tax payments and subsidies. We propose a bargaining model to represent the sequential nature of the negotiation process in water districts, in which stakeholder representatives may bargain upon a fraction of the budget only. The structural model of budget shares estimated from the data on French Water Agencies performs well as compared with reduced-form estimation.

The favors increase the probability of a given member approving the chair's proposal via a smooth voting function. The decision-making protocol is any quota voting rule. The paper characterizes the optimal allocation of any given level of favors and the optimal expenditure-minimizing level of favors. The optimal allocation divides favors uniformly among a coalition of the committee members. At a low level of favors, the coalition comprises all committee members. At a high level, it is the minimum winning coalition. The optimal expenditure level guarantees the chair certain support of the minimum winning coalition if favors are abundant and uncertain support of all committee members if favors are scarce; elitist or egalitarian committees are compatible with a strategic chair. The results are robust to changing the chair's objectives and to alternative voting functions, and reconcile theoretical predictions with empirical observations about legislative bargaining experiments, lobby vote buying and executive lawmaking.","[Zapal, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11121, Czech Republic; [Zapal, Jan] CSIC, IAE, Barcelona GSE, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics,"Zápal, J (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11121, Czech Republic.;Zápal, J (通讯作者)，CSIC, IAE, Barcelona GSE, Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",j.zapal@cerge-ei.cz,"Zapal, Jan/D-3390-2013","Zapal, Jan/0000-0002-5167-3788",Czech Science Foundation [14-27902P],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"I would like to thank discussant Matthias Dahm, associate editor and two anonymous referees.

Based on the UN dataset of all cities in the world with population 750,000 and a number of other datasets, and with an innovative application of the Gini-coefficient, this study explores the ongoing trends and patterns of contemporary human urban settlement over the past half century, particularly the phenomenal growth of megacities (10 million+) and their powerful internal and external driving forces. Key findings: (1) Cities around the world are becoming bigger and bigger, and megacities, the world's biggest cities, are unleashed, with a clear divergence between mega-global cities with more powerful and advanced business services sectors or international financial centers, and mega-local cities that do not; (2) an empirical megacity relationship whereby a country or territory will potentially have one megacity for every 100 million people in the country with the prime city population largely controlled by country population; (3) powerful internal forces at work: the prime city of each country tends to dominate their respective urban structures and occupy an increasingly-larger share of national population, giving an endogenous account as to why some cities, particularly the largest cities, become bigger and bigger; (4) major external forces: among the tested 20 and aggregated 5 variables, IT, and finance and business sectors are the key external factors driving the growth of cities and megacities, transforming mega-local cities to mega-global cities; (5) improved transport and telecommunication networks are also strong external factors driving megacity growth, in contrast to common perceptions and most of the existing literature.

We show, theoretically, that when markets can be served by exports or through foreign affiliates, a strict hierarchy of firm characteristics and the number of markets they invest in or exports can only be established for firms engaged in foreign direct investment (FDI), but not for exporters. Empirically, our findings confirm the significant role of firm heterogeneity in the structure of European international activity, as well as the increasing relationship between firm characteristics and the number of markets in which they operate. Additionally, in line with our predictions, the estimates reveal the existence of heterogeneous effects and non-linearities in this relationship, with important differences between exporters and firms engaging in FDI.","[Alguacil, Maite; Marti, Josep; Orts, Vicente] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Alguacil, Maite; Orts, Vicente] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Alguacil, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.;Alguacil, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",alguacil@uji.es; arnauj@uji.es; orts@uji.es,"Orts, Vicente/K-5921-2014; Alguacil, Maite/AAA-2338-2019; Alguacil, Maite/K-9815-2014","Orts, Vicente/0000-0003-1708-9868; Alguacil, Maite/0000-0002-6501-9170; Alguacil, Maite/0000-0002-6501-9170",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-58975-P]; Universitat Jaume I [UJI-B2016-53],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Universitat Jaume I,Authors would like to thank for the financial support from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (ECO2014-58975-P) and Universitat Jaume I (UJI-B2016-53).,,31,5,5,1,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

We study how far in advance earnings calendars are pre-announced and find that investors are more attentive to earnings news when such details are disclosed well ahead of time. This variation in investors' attention affects short-run and long-run stock returns, thereby creating incentives for firms to strategically pre-announce the report date on short notice when the earnings news is bad. Consistent with this idea, firms pre-announce their report dates well ahead of time when earnings are good and do it at the very last moment when earnings are bad. A trading strategy that exploits such variations yields abnormal returns of 1.5% per month. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This result is driven, in the lab experiments, by a higher turnout rate among the majority than among the minority. Such evidence is however in stark contrast with the main theoretical model of electoral participation in public choice, the pivotal voter model, which predicts that the supporters of an underdog candidate participate at a higher rate, given the higher probability of casting a pivotal vote. This paper tries to reconcile this discrepancy by showing that a bandwagon effect can be generated within the pivotal voter model by concavity in the voters' utility function, which makes electoral participation more costly for the expected loser supporters. Given the strict relationship between concavity and risk aversion, the paper also establishes the role of risk aversion as a determinant of bandwagon.","[Grillo, Alberto] TSE, 21 Allee de Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Grillo, A (通讯作者)，TSE, 21 Allee de Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",alberto.grillo.88@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,12,12,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2017,172.0,3-4,,,,,465,482,,10.1007/s11127-017-0457-5,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FD8CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407753200010,0

Exploiting a discontinuity in the tax schedule, we isolate the impact of the tax from other determinants of mobility. We compare homeowners with self-assessed house values on either sides of a cut-off value where the tax rate jumps from 1 to 3 percent. We find that a higher SDLT has a strong negative impact on housing-related and short distance moves but does not adversely affect job-induced or long distance mobility.

For the sake of realism the model allows the local jurisdictions to choose between firm-specific and non-firm-specific policies. We show that the implementation of the jurisdictional firm-specific policy is weakly welfare dominant.

The politics of urban slums has primarily been examined through the lens of clientelism. In contrast, associational activity has gone relatively understudied in these spaces, reserved instead as a focus of inquiry for middle-class neighborhoods. Drawing on twenty months of fieldwork and an original survey of 1,925 residents across 80 settlements in the north Indian cities of Jaipur, Rajasthan and Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, I find that local associations are prevalent features of political life in India's slums. These associations colloquially referred to as katchi basti vikas sarnitiyaan, or slum development committees afford residents a degree of organizational formality in otherwise informal spaces. They provide a medium for making individual and collective claims on the state. While patron client networks do pervade slums, this study demonstrates that vertical ties co-exist with horizontal associations, producing a multi-dimensional space in which residents mitigate risk and demand development.

In contrast, recent contributions from the technology lifecycle literature have argued that policies should be tailored to differing technological characteristics in industries for mass-produced standardized goods, complex engineered products, and as we argue complex product systems (CoPS). In this paper, we extend this argument by introducing a set of separate policy mixes for each industry type, which appears most capable of providing the key resources required for catching-up: knowledge, market access, financial investment and technology legitimacy. This framework is used to analyze catching-up patterns in China's wind, solar PV, and biomass power plant industries, drawing mainly on policy documents and 106 interviews with key industry actors. We find that traditional top-down catching-up policies played a decisive role in the development of China's wind industry, but were of limited importance in the early solar PV industry, and resulted only in a limited period of rapid growth in the biomass power plant industry. The relative progress achieved in these three industries is not related to top-down policy guidance alone, but also to private sector initiative, international interdependencies, and flexibility in adapting policy mixes to each industry's technological characteristics.

There has been little empirical study of how ethnicity and class shape economic outcomes in informal market interactions. We conduct an audit experiment one of the first audit experiments in Africa seeking to address this gap. We experimentally manipulate class, with confederates presenting as different classes; this may be the first audit study to take this approach. This is also one of the first in-person audits to have multiple transactions for each buyer and seller, thus allowing for the use of buyer and seller fixed effects. We find little evidence that, all else equal, sharing an ethnicity on its own inuences market treatment. Class, however, does have substantial effects, at least for non-coethnics. High-class non-coethnics receive higher prices per unit than low-class non-coethnics. Our findings suggest that the boundaries of group identity appear to be at least partially defined by class in the informal economy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using trade flow data, I test models designed to match these trade price data. Even with significant pricing frictions, the models imply a stronger trade response to exchange rates than found in the data.

The empirical framework adopted allows credit spreads to depend on common systematic risk factors derived from structural models and incorporates dynamic conditional correlations (DCC) between spreads. Results show that there is a surprisingly weak correlation between the two markets in normal times. However, during crises, there is a sudden and strong increase in the correlation between U.S. and Canadian credit spreads. The analysis of credit spread correlation within each market also shows an unusual increase in credit spread correlations between sectors and between risk classes in the U.S. during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. This increase persists over the post-crisis period. By contrast, in Canada, credit spread correlations between sectors remain remarkably stable over time, suggesting an interdependence of credit spreads within the Canadian market.

We replace their examination of voting procedures and social welfare functions in the 1940s and 1950s in the context of their growing involvement with policy-making. Confronted with natural scientists' and McCathythes' accusations of ideological bias, positive studies emphasizing that collective decisions mechanisms were unstable and inefficient, and normative impossibilities, economists largely relied on the idea the policy ends they worked with reflected a social consensus. As the latter crumbled in the 1960s, growing disagreement erupted on how to identify and aggregate those individual values which economists believed should guide applied work, in particular in cost-benefit analysis. The 1970s and 1980s brought new approaches to collective decision: Arrow's impossibility was solved by expanding the informational basis, it was showed that true preferences could be revealed by making decision costly, and experimentalists and market designers enabled these mechanisms to be tested in the lab before being sold to those public bodies looking for decision procedures that emulated markets. In this new regime, the focus paradoxically shifted to coordination, revelation and efficiency, and those economists studying collective decision processes were marginalized.","[Cherrier, Beatrice] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, CREM, Caen, France; [Fleury, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Cergy Pontoise, France",Universite de Caen Normandie; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Cherrier, B (通讯作者)，Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, CREM, Caen, France.",beatrice.cherrier@gmail.com; jbfleury@gmail.com,,"Cherrier, Beatrice/0000-0001-6117-3149",COST Computational Social Choice [IC1205]; INET,COST Computational Social Choice; INET,"We thank Eric Posner, Glen Weyl, Roger Backhouse, Steven Medema, Vincent Merlin, Antoinette Baujard, Maxime Desmarais-Tremblay, Muriel Gilardone, Bernard Grofman, Herrade Igersheim, Alain Marciano, Dennis Mueller, Fabio Padovano, Maurice Salles and the participants at HIS-RECO (ENS-Cachan), at the Bridging Public and Social Choice conference (Center for Public Choice, University of Rennes I) and at the Quadratic Voting conference (Becker-Friedman Institute, University of Chicago).

Results show that the most financially knowledgeable investors: (a) held 18% points more stock than their least knowledgeable counterparts; (b) could anticipate earning 8 basis points per month more in excess returns; (c) had 40% higher portfolio volatility; and (d) held portfolios with about 38% less idiosyncratic risk, as compared with their least savvy counterparts. Our results are qualitatively similar after controlling on observables as well as modeling sample selection. We also examine portfolio changes to assess the potential impact of the financial literacy intervention. Controlling on other factors, those who elected to take the financial literacy survey boosted their equity allocations by 66 basis points and their monthly expected excess returns rose by 2.3 basis points; no significant difference in volatility or non-systematic risk was detected before versus after the survey. While these findings relate to only one firm, we anticipate that they may spur other efforts to enhance financial knowledge in the workplace.","[Clark, Robert] North Carolina State Univ, Poole Coll Management, Box 7229, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Lusardi, Annamaria] George Washington Univ, Sch Business, 2201 G St,Suite 450E,Duques Hall, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Mitchell, Olivia S.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,3000 SH DH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",North Carolina State University; George Washington University; University of Pennsylvania,"Clark, R (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Poole Coll Management, Box 7229, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",robert_clark@ncsu.edu,"Lusardi, Annamaria/AEB-6291-2022",,Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania; Office of Employee Benefits at the Federal Reserve System,Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania; Office of Employee Benefits at the Federal Reserve System,"Research support for the work reported herein was provided by the Pension Research Council/Boettner Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, as well as the Office of Employee Benefits at the Federal Reserve System that provided the data for the study and partial funding for the project.

Papua New Guinea provides a unique case study, as it is recorded as having the most decentralized precolonial political institutions of any postcolonial state.

I analyse the formation of an organization called the African Agricultural Technology Foundation to show how differences between two major pro-biotech actors - the Rockefeller Foundation and the agricultural biotechnology industry - were negotiated, so that these actors could work together towards the goal of getting GM technologies used and accepted in Africa.

A defining feature of this executive federalism is a pragmatic willingness to both borrow from and reconstitute very different types of past federalisms. A case in point is President Barack Obama's Race to the Top (RttT) initiative, which sought to stimulate the adoption of specific education reforms in state governments around the country through a series of highly prescriptive but entirely voluntary policy competitions. This paper evaluates the results of such efforts. To do so, it draws on four original data sets: a nationally representative survey of state legislators, an analysis of State of the State speeches, another of state applications to the competitions themselves, and finally, an inventory of state policymaking trends in a range of education policies that were awarded under the competition. This paper then relies upon a variety of identification strategies to gauge the influence of RttT on the nation's education policy landscape. Taken as a whole the evidence suggests that RttT, through both direct and indirect means, augmented the production of state policies that were central components of the president's education agenda.","[Howell, William G.] Univ Chicago, Amer Polit, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Dept Polit Sci, 1155 East 60th St,Suite 149, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Magazinnik, Asya] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, 323 Robertson Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",University of Chicago; Princeton University,"Howell, WG (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Amer Polit, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Dept Polit Sci, 1155 East 60th St,Suite 149, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",whowell@uchicago.edu; asyam@princeton.edu,,,,,,,57,25,54,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Using a unique dataset of 671 financial penalties imposed on 68 international listed banks over the period 2007 to 2014, we find a negative relation between financial penalties and pre-tax profitability but no relation with after-tax profitability. This result is explained by tax savings, as banks are allowed to deduct specific financial penalties from their taxable income. Moreover, our empirical analysis of the stock performance shows a positive relation between financial penalties and buy-and-hold returns, indicating that investors are pleased that cases are closed, that the banks successfully manage the consequences of misconduct, and that the financial penalties imposed are smaller than the accrued economic gains from the banks' misconduct. This argument is supported by the positive abnormal returns accompanying on the announcement of a financial penalty. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using an extensive sample over the period 1997 to 2015, we find that the five-factor model consistently outperforms the three-factor model in the Chinese equity market. In contrast to the findings in Fama and French (2015a), both value and profitability factors are important, while the investment factor is found to be redundant for describing average returns in our sample. With respect to the double-sorted left-hand-side (LHS) portfolios, the main problem with the five-factor model is its failure to fully capture the high average returns of stocks whose returns perform like those of growth firms that invest conservatively due to low profitability. On the other hand, although we find mixed results in the three-dimensional sorting, the LHS portfolios with extremely low average returns are those that cause serious problems for the five-factor model.

The dominant view among most economic policy analysts and commentators seems to be that the actions of the Greek government in the months before the deal had been erratic and lacked coordination. In this paper we argue instead that the decisions of the Greek leaders, including asking the voters to reject the earlier terms demanded by the creditors in a referendum, can be rationally explained by the logic of brinkmanship. We develop a game-theoretic model to show that the actions of the Greek government are consistent with a strategy aimed at getting a better bailout deal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas neurophysiological responses such as pupil dilation and galvanic skin response (GSR) have provided a significant explanatory value in the mechanisms of decision-making, other, less known physiological responses indicators, such as body posture, may provide additional valuable insight into decision-making processes. Here, we report the results from two separate high-resolution eye-tracking studies in which pupil dilation and body posture provide both independent and interacting contributions in predicting preference judgments and choice. These results suggest an improved assessment and prediction of choice by using a combination of pupil dilation and posture, relative to only employing 1 of the measures. However, the use of this combined measure needs to be employed with care, as the dynamic relationship between pupil size and posture is affected by different categories of stimuli, in particular, fashion brands, and wine brand logos. We discuss these findings in light of the academic and commercial call for neuroimaging and physiology measures that can predict and explain the mechanisms underlying preference formation and value-based choice.","[Ramsoy, Thomas Zoega] Ctr Behav Innovat, Holbaek, Denmark; [Ramsoy, Thomas Zoega] Singular Univ, Moffett Field, CA USA; [Jacobsen, Catrine] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Friis-Olivarius, Morten; Bagdziunaite, Dalia; Skov, Martin] Copenhagen Business Sch, Decis Neurosci Res Grp, Dept Mkt, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Friis-Olivarius, Morten; Skov, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Danish Res Ctr Magnet Resonance, Hosp Hvidovre, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Copenhagen Business School; University of Copenhagen,"Jacobsen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark.",cj@ifro.ku.dk,"Jacobsen, Catrine/E-7326-2015; Ramsøy, Thomas Z/E-2849-2019",,"Decision Neuroscience Project (DNP) from the Danish Agency for Science, Technology, and Innovation [09 - 065451]","Decision Neuroscience Project (DNP) from the Danish Agency for Science, Technology, and Innovation","Thomas Zoega Ramsoy was supported by a grant, The Decision Neuroscience Project (DNP) [09 - 065451] from the Danish Agency for Science, Technology, and Innovation.",,73,14,19,3,66,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

We incentivize and measure actual contributions to an environmental public good to ascertain whether being excluded from a rebate can affect contributions and, if so, whether the rationale for exclusion influences such effects. Treatments, i.e., three rules that determine who is selected and excluded, are randomly assigned. Two of the rules base exclusion on subjects' initial contributions. The third is based upon location and the rationales are always explained. The rule that targets the rebate to low initial contributors, who have more potential to raise contributions, is the only rule that raised contributions by those selected. Yet by design, that same rule excludes the subjects who contributed the most initially. They respond by reducing their contributions even though their income and prices are unchanged.","[Alpizar, Francisco; Robalino, Juan] CATIE, Res Program Econ & Environm Dev, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica; [Alpizar, Francisco; Norden, Anna] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Norden, Anna] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Pfaff, Alexander] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC USA",CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza; University of Gothenburg; Lund University; Duke University,"Alpízar, F (通讯作者)，CATIE, Res Program Econ & Environm Dev, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica.;Alpízar, F (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",falpizar@catie.ac.cr,,"Robalino, Juan/0000-0003-1450-7382; Alpizar, Francisco/0000-0001-8479-081X; Norden, Anna/0000-0001-8965-1501","Tinker Foundation; Sida; CRED; NSF DMUU center at Columbia University; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1463122] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0951516] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Tinker Foundation; Sida; CRED; NSF DMUU center at Columbia University; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are grateful for valuable comments from two anonymous referees, and from Paul Ferraro, Olof Johansson-Stenman, Mattias Sutter, Peter Martinsson, Martin Kocher, Louis Preonas, and participants in seminars at University of Costa Rica, University of Gothenburg, Columbia University, AERE conference, EfD Initiative, EAERE conference, and EEA meeting.

This asymmetry is particularly acute for earnings goals, when compensation is contingent on a single goal, when the pay-performance relationship around the goal is concave-shaped, and for grants with non-equity-based payouts. Firms that exceed their compensation target by a small margin are more likely to beat the target the next period and CEOs of firms that miss their targets are more likely to experience a forced turnover. Firms that just exceed their Earnings Per Share (EPS) goals have higher abnormal accruals and lower Research and Development (R&D) expenditures, and firms that just exceed their profit goals have lower Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenditures.

In this paper, we aim to quantify the implication of the borrowing constraints on the transmission mechanism of monetary and fiscal policy, using a DSGE model with a heterogeneous production side of private and state-owned sectors. We fit our model to China's quarterly data from 2005 to 2014 and conduct several experiments. The main findings are as follows. First, a monetary policy shock interacts with private firms' borrowing constraint, thus having an additional effect on real variables, named reallocation effect. This is a deviation from the standard New Keynesian framework, where the real effect comes from the price rigidity. Second, intensified borrowing constraints of the privates firms reduce the efficacy of a tax rate cut shock for private firms and lessen the tightening effects on the state-owned firms of such shock. Third, intensified borrowing constraints on the privates firms reduce the efficacy of an expansionary monetary policy shock for private firms and enhance its effectiveness for the state-owned firms. The model can be easily extended to other developing economies in a similar environment.","[Wang, Ren] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410205, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Hou, Jie] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [He, Xiaobei] Cf40 Finance Forum, Beijing 100009, Peoples R China; [Song, Hui] Shandong Univ, Res Ctr Games & Econ Behav, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Capital University of Economics & Business; Shandong University,"Hou, J (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.",renwang@hnu.edu.cn; jie_hou_cueb@163.com; xiaobei_he@sina.com; songh@sdu.edu.cn,,,"Research and Innovation Center of Metropolis Economic and Social Development, CUEB","Research and Innovation Center of Metropolis Economic and Social Development, CUEB","Jie Hou acknowledges financial support from Research and Innovation Center of Metropolis Economic and Social Development, CUEB.",,31,5,8,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

It situates this analysis in the wider historical context of the protracted transition to democracy between 1989 and 2008, the rural class structure of the country, the changing character of contemporary agroextractive capitalism, and the long-standing class struggle for redistributive land reform. By examining the Paraguayan agrarian reform impasse under the short-lived government of Fernando Lugo (2008-2012) through an interactive state/society framework, this paper attempts to locate the sources of current social and political conflict in the country, and the demands of rival social groups. In doing so, the paper argues that the rise and fall of Lugo occurred in the context of structural legacies from the Stroessner era (1954-1989) that have remained largely unchanged and that coexist today with an expanding agro-extractivist development model. They lead to the conceptualization of the continued predatory or oligarchic state in the country.","[Ezquerro-Canete, Arturo] St Marys Univ, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada; [Ezquerro-Canete, Arturo] Univ Autonoma Zacatecas, Preparatoria S-N, Zacatecas 98064, Zac, Mexico; [Fogel, Ramon] CERI, Cruz Defensor 1816 C Jose Marti, Asuncion, Paraguay",Saint Marys University - Canada; Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas,"Ezquerro-Cañete, A (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Int Dev Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",arturo_ezquerro@hotmail.co.uk,"Fogel, Ramon/AAJ-9923-2021","Fogel, Ramon/0000-0001-6106-2406",,,,,74,19,25,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Instead of the default fixed effects approach to modelling panel data, we apply a novel within-between specification aimed at uncovering the contextual source of variation, focusing on the effects of electoral concerns on grant allocation within and between municipalities. We find evidence of a substantial political bias in grant allocations both within and between municipalities, particularly when it comes to local-level electoral concerns.

This phenomenon is particularly debated in the pharmaceutical industry where (Western) pharmaceutical companies have started to offshore clinical research to so-called nontraditional clinical research countries. This study empirically investigates the changing geography of clinical research between the years 2002 and 2012. Building on the concept of national innovative capacity (Furman et al., 2002, Res. Policy, 31, 899-933), we shed light on different drivers of countries' attractiveness as a location for clinical research including arguments related to the supply (cost)-side, the demand-side, and the knowledge base. Our results challenge existing views on the extent of the phenomenon as well as the involvement of particular countries. Across nontraditional countries, the level of clinical research activities is driven by knowledge rather than cost arguments. Moreover, the rising strength of the knowledge base of nontraditional countries enables them to increasingly direct research in favor of local needs.","[Haeussler, Carolin] Univ Passau, Technol Management & Entrepreneurship OTE, D-94032 Passau, Germany; [Rake, Bastian] Univ Passau, Dept Org Technol Management & Entrepreneurship OT, D-94032 Passau, Germany",University of Passau; University of Passau,"Rake, B (通讯作者)，Univ Passau, Dept Org Technol Management & Entrepreneurship OT, D-94032 Passau, Germany.",carolin.haeussler@uni-passau.de; bastian.rake@uni-passau.de,,"Haeussler, Carolin/0000-0002-3505-010X; Rake, Bastian/0000-0002-9116-9789",,,,,84,12,13,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

By exploiting variation in the number of branches per capita across NUTS3 regions and variation in financial dependence across sectors, we support a positive and significant role of finance in fostering the access to foreign markets of SEs. This evidence is robust to the use of alternative measures, the control for omitted variables and the correction for endogeneity. We show that the banking sector reduces the incidence of sunk entry costs by providing both credit and destination-specific information. Finally, we provide original evidence on the role of the territorial diffusion of foreign banks' branches on SEs' exports. While no direct effect is detected, we disclose a minor and indirect effect of foreign branches working through their influence on the banking sector development at the local level.","[Lo Turco, Alessia] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Maggioni, Daniela] Univ Catania, Dept Polit Sci, Via Vittorio Emanuele 8, I-95100 Catania, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; University of Catania,"Lo Turco, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",a.loturco@univpm.it; d.maggioni@unict.it,,/0000-0002-4942-5486,,,,,63,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We argue that after more than a decade in power, few of the promises to reform the agrarian sector in favour of peasant and family producers were fulfilled. This situation constitutes a paradox, because these governments came to power partly on the back of a wave of social mobilization in which peasant and indigenous movements had been key actors. However, rural social movements were incapable of pressuring the state to change this situation. At the heart of this paradox lies a contradiction, which is that in their political proposals rural social movements called for an interventionist state, but they did not have the ability to control it through their alliance with political parties and politicians. This introduction offers a theoretical framework to better comprehend the struggles of the peasantry and the rentier nature of the state in Latin America, in order to contribute to the discussion on agrarian class reconfiguration under neoliberalism.","[Vergara-Camus, Leandro] Univ London, SOAS, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Kay, Cristobal] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, POB 29776, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Vergara-Camus, L (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",lv6@soas.ac.uk,"Kay, Cristóbal/F-7454-2014; Vergara-Camus, Leandro/ITU-9103-2023","Kay, Cristóbal/0000-0002-9727-7596; Vergara-Camus, Leandro/0000-0002-6959-9942",,,,,87,50,57,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In addition, we analyse the impacts of global financial crisis (2007-2009) on stock market volatility interactions and modify the BEKK-MGARCH-type models by including financial crisis dummies to assess their impact on volatilities and spillovers. Major findings reveal that correlations among emerging markets (EMs) are lower compared with correlations among DMs and increase during financial crises. Furthermore, we detect evidence of volatility spillovers and observe that own-volatility spillovers are higher than cross-volatility spillovers for EMs suggesting that shocks have not been substantially transmitted among EMs compared to DMs. We also find significant asymmetric behaviour in DMs while weak evidence is detected for EMs. Finally, the DCC-with-skewed-t density model provided improved diagnostics compared to other models partly due to its taking into account fat tails and skewed features often present in financial returns.

To this end, a wide range of measures accounting for several dimensions of integration is employed. In addition, we evaluate the performance of each measure by relying on an established international finance result, i.e., increasing financial integration leads to declining international portfolio diversification benefits. Using monthly equity market data for three different country groups (i.e., developed markets, emerging markets, developed plus emerging markets) and a dynamic indicator of international portfolio diversification benefits, we find that (i) all measures give rise to a very similar long-run integration pattern; (ii) the standard correlation explains variations in diversification benefits as well or better than more sophisticated measures.

Twitter utilizes the push technology that allows firms to reduce information asymmetry by disseminating news to a broader set of investors in a timely manner. Using hand collected acquisition announcements from Twitter covering the period from 2009 to 2012, we find that the acquirer size is a main determinant of disclosing acquisition announcements on Twitter. Large acquirers announce their acquisitions on Twitter and, as a result, are able to attenuate the anticipated negative market reaction at acquisition announcement. We find no evidence that the attenuation effect of announcing acquisitions on Twitter subsequently reverses or that announcing acquisitions on Twitter is positively associated with pre-announcement earnings management. Overall, our results suggest that Twitter has become an important investor relation channel for major corporate events such as acquisition announcements and that large acquirers can use this new channel to enhance stability in their stock prices.

We unpack decentralization along multiple dimensions and consider the individual effects of local elections, the creation of new administrative units, fiscal transfers, and local public service delivery. We use comprehensive data from Indonesia's National Violence Monitoring System (NVMS), a new dataset that records the incidence and impact of violence in Indonesia. We use these data to examine the relationship between the different dimensions of decentralization and different types of local violence in Indonesian districts during 2001-10. Our analyses suggest that there is a positive association between local service delivery and at least some forms of violence. We argue that the positive effect of service delivery on violence is due to newly generated distributive conflicts among local ethnic groups around the control over and access to services. By comparison, district splitting and the introduction of direct elections of district heads are negatively associated with some forms of violence. There is little evidence that fiscal transfers, in general, mitigate conflict.

It develops a conceptual framework in which an individual may have three alternatives: to be a farmer in an already established place, to be a rural worker, or to migrate to the agricultural frontier in order to deforest. This model implies that land inequality affects deforestation positively. Based on data from municipalities with positive deforestation from 2002 to 2011, a model has been estimated to test this theoretical prediction. By making use of an instrumental variable, results show that there is statistical evidence to support the existence of a direct relationship between land inequality and deforestation. Results are stronger for the period 2002-2005. This might be due to command and control policies which have significantly increased the cost of clearing land since the mid-2000s.","[Sant'Anna, Andre Albuquerque] Brazilian Dev Bank BNDES, Ave Chile 330,13th Floor, BR-20031170 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Sant'Anna, Andre Albuquerque] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Ave Chile 330,13th Floor, BR-20031170 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Sant'Anna, AA (通讯作者)，Brazilian Dev Bank BNDES, Ave Chile 330,13th Floor, BR-20031170 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;Sant'Anna, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Ave Chile 330,13th Floor, BR-20031170 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",andre.santanna@bndes.gov.br,,"Sant'Anna, Andre/0000-0002-5408-6765",,,,,38,22,22,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Based on a policy simulation imposing universal card acceptance among merchants, we find that overall cash usage would decrease by only 8.0 percentage points, implying that cash usage in small-value transactions is driven mainly by consumer preferences.","[Wakamori, Naoki] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Welte, Angelika] Bank Canada, Currency Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Tokyo; Bank of Canada,"Wakamori, N (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",nwakamo@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp; awelte@bankofcanada.ca,,"WAKAMORI, NAOKI/0000-0003-2730-0049",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB/TR 15],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are grateful to the editor, two anonymous referees, Klaus Adam, Victor Aguirregabiria, Jason Allen, Carlos Arango, Heng Chen, Ben Fung, Chun-Yu Ho, Kim P.

Today they need to rapidly respond to constant changes and transformations that are shaping education in Russia. Yet the incentive schemes that are used by many Russian universities do not provide rewards for an ability to actualise professors' potential in different types of activities and thus demonstrate the diversity of their professional competencies. Meanwhile, this ability to adapt to new realities is a highly sought-after skill for professors today. This paper presents an analysis of indicators used in an incentive scheme in one Russian university. This scheme entails a system of points awarded for activities in different areas: educational, scientific research and internationalisation. The results are as follows. Firstly, the current incentive scheme does not account for levels of diversity of activities. At the same time, given the dynamic pace of change, one of the factors determining the quality of professors' human capital should be their ability to pursue a wide spectrum of activities. Secondly, our analysis highlighted an extremely low level of diversity of human capital among university professors. Thirdly, we compiled two ratings of the types of activities pursued by professors - one based on points for the respective activities and another based on their popularity among professors. The ranking of activity types does not match across the two ratings. Fourthly, the diversification of human capital of professors varies across university departments and differs depending on their job role and gender. Assessing the level and nature of the diversification of human capital among university professors enabled carrying out a deeper analysis of this capital and identifying the growth points and threats to competitiveness of both the professors and the university as a whole. This analysis can be used to adjust the work incentive schemes for professors and improve the effectiveness of strategic planning of finances and human resources. On the whole, we believe that improving the diversification of human capital among university professors is a suitable mechanism to facilitate their successful adaptation to continued changes in Russia's education system.","[Bagirova, Anna; Shubat, Oksana] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Bagirova, A (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",a.p.bagirova@urfu.ru; o.m.shubat@urfu.ru,"Bagirova, Anna/M-7440-2013; Shubat, Oksana/M-7443-2013","Bagirova, Anna/0000-0001-5653-4093; Shubat, Oksana/0000-0002-0929-8144",Act 211 Government of Russian Federation [02.A03.21.0006],Act 211 Government of Russian Federation,"The work was supported by Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation, contract No. 02.A03.21.0006.",,28,0,0,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,10,17,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000002,0

It defines possibilistic distribution of soft data used for corporate client credit risk assessment by applying fuzzy logic modeling, with a major goal to develop a new expert decision-making fuzzy model for evaluating credit risk of corporate clients in a bank. Currently, predicting a credit risk of companies is inaccurate and ambiguous, as well as affected by many internal and external factors that cannot be precisely defined. Unlike traditional methods for credit risk assessment, fuzzy logic can easily incorporate linguistic terms and expert opinions which makes it more adapted to cases with insufficient and imprecise hard data, as well as for modeling risks that are not fully understood. Fuzzy model of soft data, presented in this paper, is created based on expert experience of corporate lending of a commercial bank in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This market is very small and it behaves irrationally and often erratically and therefore makes the risk assessment and management decision making process very complex and uncertain which requires new methods for risk modeling to be evaluated. Experts were interviewed about the types of soft variables used for credit risk assessment of corporate clients, as well as for providing the inputs for generating membership functions of these soft variables. All identified soft variables can be grouped into following segments: stability, capability and readiness/willingness of the client to repay a loan. The results of this work represent a new approach for soft data usage/assessment with an aim of being incorporated into a new and superior soft-hard data fusion model for client credit risk assessment.","[Brkic, Sabina] Amer Univ Bosnia & Herzegovina, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Hodzic, Migdat] Int Univ Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Dzanic, Enis] Univ Bihac, Bihac, Bosnia & Herceg",International University of Sarajevo,"Brkic, S (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Bosnia & Herzegovina, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",sabc1122@aubih.edu; migdathodzic@gmail.com; enis.dzanic@bih.net.ba,"Dzanic, Enis/J-8427-2012; hodzic, migdat/R-4286-2019",,,,,,13,0,0,1,4,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,189,202,,,,,,14,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900011,0

The evidence also shows a rebalancing from bank loans towards bonds. To study these developments, we develop a dynamic open economy model where these modes of finance are determined endogenously. The model replicates the stylized facts following a drop in world interest rates; in particular, rebalancing towards bonds occurs because bank credit becomes relatively more expensive, reflecting the scarcity of bank equity. More generally, the model is suitable for studying interactions between modes of finance and the macroeconomy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on retirement behavior, work hours over the life cycle, and efficiency gains. We find that the labor supply of older workers is very responsive to changes in tax and transfer programs and show that the gains, in terms of old-age work hours, are non-trivial. However, we also find that longer careers may not substantially increase aggregate hours because workers may reallocate labor supply over the life cycle in response to retiring later. Moreover, since longer careers may also reduce saving rates, we also find that changes in tax and transfer programs aimed at boosting the employment rates of the elderly may reduce output per head.","[Diaz-Saavedra, Julian] Univ Granada, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Díaz-Saavedra, J (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Granada, Spain.",julianalbertodiaz@ugr.es,"Saavedra, Julián Díaz/AAA-6687-2019","Saavedra, Julián Díaz/0000-0002-6585-4053",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2011-25737],Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),This work was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2011-25737].,,34,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

New regulations forced commercial banks to improve credit risk management and existing statistical models. This paper, based on data obtained from three major banks of Georgia, develops logit model to examine mortgage loan borrowers' characteristics that determine their default probability Similar data is rarely available for developing countries, therefore findings of this study can be useful for those countries as well. According to the research, main characteristics that determine borrowers' creditworthiness are payment to income ratio, loan to value ratio, credit history and borrower's type (whether borrower receives income in that bank). Average prediction accuracy of the model within the sample equals to 93.4%. Findings of this study will enable commercial banks in Georgia to improve their credit risk assessment and make decisions on loan approval cost efficiently. In addition, acquired results can be used by the National Bank of Georgia to estimate the adequacy of loan loss provisions, to assess commercial banks credit portfolio used as collateral for monetary operations and to enhance collateral base to support de-dollarization policy.","[Ergeshidze, Aleksandre] Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ TSU, Fac Econ & Business, Tbilisi, Georgia",Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University,"Ergeshidze, A (通讯作者)，Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ TSU, Fac Econ & Business, Tbilisi, Georgia.",aergeshidze@gmail.com,"Ergeshidze, Aleksandre/ABF-4797-2021; Ergeshidze, Aleksandre/AAH-5267-2019",,,,,,27,0,0,0,9,BC GRUP INC,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH, 2134 SOK, DERELI APT.

We use composite indices of these regulations to capture their intensity in coverage and employ an instrumental variables strategy to overcome the endogeneity of regulations to outcomes. We estimate the effects of CARs on real exchange rate appreciation, foreign exchange pressure, crisis resilience, and post-crisis overheating using annual data from 1995 to 2011 for 51 emerging economies. We find that all CARs, except the financial sector-specific restrictions, reduce foreign exchange pressure and real exchange rate appreciation, contributing to greater macroeconomic stability. Our results further indicate that increasing the restrictiveness of CARs in the run-up to the crisis moderates the growth decline, thus enhancing crisis resilience, and that countries that used CARs experienced less overheating from capital inflow surges during post-crisis recovery. The latter two results imply that CARs are useful countercyclical policy instruments. Our estimates provide evidence in favor of models in which imperfect capital mobility can generate sustained effects on real exchange rates.","[Erten, Bilge] Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, 43 Leon St,312A Lake Hall, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ocampo, Jose Antonio] Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Profess Practice Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA",Northeastern University; Columbia University,"Erten, B (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Dept Econ, 43 Leon St,312A Lake Hall, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",b.erten@neu.edu; jao2128@columbia.edu,"Erten, Bilge/S-4871-2019","Erten, Bilge/0000-0002-3142-8072",,,,,52,23,27,0,10,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

In this paper an alternative approach is proposed that utilises model based minimum sum of squared residuals estimators combined with Bayesian Information Criterion model selection. Conditional on the presence of a bubble, the dating procedures suggested are shown to offer consistent estimation of the start and end dates of a fixed magnitude bubble, and can also be used to distinguish between different types of bubble process, i.e. a bubble that does or does not end in collapse, or a bubble that is ongoing at the end of the sample. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed dating approach out-performs the recursive unit root test methods for dating periods of explosive autoregressive behaviour in finite samples, particularly in terms of accurate identification of a bubble's end point.

Using empirical data from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania between 2013 and 2015, this article examines the relation between Bodenrichtwerten and statistically determined location values. It turns out that Bodenrichtwerte tend to underestimate location values of arable land by 11.5% on average. This underestimation can be traced back to the pronounced increase of land prices in the observation period. As an alternative to the expert-based determination of location values, we suggest a nonparametric smoothing procedure that rests on the Propagation-Separation Approach. The application of this data-driven procedure achieves an accuracy comparable to that of official Bodenrichtwerte at the one-year ahead prediction of location values without the requirement of expert knowledge.","[Helbing, Georg; Shen, Zhiwei; Odening, Martin; Ritter, Matthias] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Helbing, G (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",georg.helbing@agrar.hu-berlin.de,"Odening, Martin/AAV-9918-2020; Ritter, Matthias/G-2391-2017","Ritter, Matthias/0000-0003-2543-3673",German Research Foundation (DFG); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),Financial support from the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) is gratefully acknowledged.

Two scenarios for the year 2025 are evaluated on the basis of two representative weeks. The first scenario is considered as baseline and models currently used production mix. The second scenario focuses on the effect of German Energiewende policy on the transmission networks as expected in 2025. The results confirm that in the context of Central Europe, higher feed-in of solar and wind power increases the total transport of electricity between the transmission system operator areas as well as the average load of lines and volatility of flows. Also, an increase in number of critical high-load hours is observable. Taking into account only the Czech transmission system, considerable rise both in transported volume and volatility are observed only on border transmission lines, not inside the country. Moreover, our qualitative analysis shows that all these mentioned effects are strengthened by the presence of German-Austrian bidding zone.","[Janda, Karel] Univ Karlova, Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Prague, Czech Republic; [Malek, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Recka, Lukas] Univ Karlova, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Charles University Prague; University of Amsterdam; Charles University Prague,"Janda, K (通讯作者)，Univ Karlova, Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Prague, Czech Republic.",Karel-Janda@seznam.cz; janmalek.jm@gmail.com; lukasrecka@gmail.com,"janda, karel/A-3951-2008; janda, karel/GNP-1410-2022; Rečka, Lukáš/C-3456-2013","janda, karel/0000-0001-7096-6300; Rečka, Lukáš/0000-0003-3115-5884",,,,,45,0,0,0,4,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The CR is represented by a set of selected plants from the region Vysocina, Pardubice and Hradec Kralove which constitutes 35 % of nation-wide milk production. For comparability of input, data for calculations regardless of the size of enterprises in the production of milk were obtained, absolute data are converted to a common base of 100 days of feeding cows. Panel data were evaluated by Statistics program. As a variable was considered in the calculation of milk production, as well as significant cost items such as feed costs and interdependencies between variables are expressed as means of production and cost functions. A development of milk production in the CR and the EU since 2007 is almost identical according to a calculated growth rate from a view-point of comparability of results. Also after cancellation of milk quotas in 2015 there is a slight production increase within the EU. In the framework of the set of enterprises in the EU, the decisive part of producers is distributed with milk yields 7 - 10 thousands kg with expenses for feeds 5-15 cents per kg of milk production. In the CR for the mentioned level of expenses for feeds the reached production moves in a range 610 thousand kg with a wider dispersion of values. On base of testing within all regression functions, a close dependence has been proved among the monitored parameters. From the carried analysis of relations between expenses for feeds and milk production can be supposed an effort of agricultural enterprises to reduce significant cost items including to expenses for feeds for reaching of favourable competitiveness of the own production because purchase mil prices within the EU will further converge.","[Janecka, Marie; Homolka, Jaroslav] CULS Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Janecká, M (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",janecka@cmsch.cz; homolka@pef.czu.cz,"Homolka, Jaroslav/H-6666-2018","Homolka, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5349-082X",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,131,137,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400017,0

As remittances are more stable than all other external flows (foreign direct investments and official development assistance), governments attempt to harness these resources. By contrast, discussion on internal remittances is rather non-existent, mostly because of the lack of statistical data, difficulty to capture the flows through informal channels and lack of understanding of internal remittance importance. It is argued that remittances (both external and internal), as stable sources of income, contribute to savings as well as to increase of financial inclusion of individuals who receives remittances. This paper is expected to provide an answer to the question whether individuals who receive remittance more likely to use bank accounts and other services (e.g. loans, debit cards, credit cards etc.) offered by financial institutions than those who do not receive them. Therefore, this paper aims to address the impact of internal remittance on financial inclusion of individuals in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). As a data source, we use World Banks' Global Findex data set from 2014. We estimate logistic regression models with a set of dummy dependent variables for financial inclusion, i.e. having bank account, having debit card, having credit card, borrowing and savings, and regress them on receipt of internal remittance. It is expected that research results will contribute to better understanding of the relationship between internal remittances and financial inclusion in BiH.","[Jukan, Meldina Kokorovic; Okicic, Jasmina] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Oruc, Nermin] Ctr Dev Evaluat & Social Sci Res, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Jukan, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",meldina.kokorovic@untz.ba; jasmina.okicic@untz.ba; noruc@cdess.ba,"Jukan, Meldina Kokorovic/AAS-7598-2021; Okicic, Jasmina/AAG-9595-2020","Jukan, Meldina Kokorovic/0000-0002-4954-5437; Okicic, Jasmina/0000-0002-3440-413X",,,,,19,0,0,0,3,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,130,141,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900007,0

It is their goal to join components of alternative medicine based on methods used in ancient Egypt with common wellness and physiotherapeutic methods. On the premises there is a beer spa, a sea spa, and a children's spa. Though part of a former malt house has been converted into accommodations, its capacity is insufficient; to meet demand, they collaborate with five local hotels. Thanks to the brewery and spa's collaboration with a national transport carrier, their visitors are provided concessionary fare. Thus, Roznov brewery and Roznov beer spa are becoming the most important entity for destination management in the microregion. The network of tourist industry entities that is being created increases the performance rate not only of the brewery introduced, but of the whole microregion. For this research, methods of observation, interviews with Roznov brewery and Roznov beer spa managers, and location field research during a number of stays in the beer spa were used. In the course of data collection, the marketing mix, competitor analysis, PEST and SWOT analyses, and guests' preferences were analyzed.

Deregulation started in early 1990s, which led to new emerging possibilities in the energy markets, by also changing risks exposure within the energy sector. Moreover, the global climate changes created an additional pressure on business activities, which greatly changed the level of risk exposure. Those changes triggered new trends - implementation of risk management within the energy sector, more and more becoming companies recognized need for Enterprise Risk Management or ERM. The ERM is representing thorough methods of managing all risks that the company might be exposed to, by inherently requiring alignment of risk management with corporate governance and strategy. Risk management is comprehensive process tangling multiple phases, thus for this study chosen phase includes; Risk identification and evaluation. In addition, goal of this study is identification and evaluation of risks in development of energy sector, specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Therefore, during the process of identification of risks, several groups of risks have been identified and classified, thus authors have selected main four risks due to their intensity and frequency. Also, the evaluation has been conducted for those selected risks by applying relevant statistical methods. During the course of this study, the secondary data has been used and statistical methods used are correlation, regression and factor analysis. The research results accentuate that the four groups of risks fall into category of high-frequency and high-intensity risks. Therefore, it is essential to adequately implement the ERM in the energy sector of BiH, ultimately decreasing their influence on the company's performance. Finally, future studies can be focused on importance of implementation of EMR (and ISO 31000: 2009) to improve business performance within energy sector.","[Lelic, Edina Siljegovic] Publ Enterprise Elektroprivreda BiH Inc Sarajevo, TPP Tuzla, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Smajlovic, Selma] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Lelic, ES (通讯作者)，Publ Enterprise Elektroprivreda BiH Inc Sarajevo, TPP Tuzla, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",edina.siljegovic@bih.net.ba; selma.smajlovic@untz.ba,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,95,110,,,,,,16,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900005,0

Since the focus is on answering to how questions, a case study strategy is employed; this is the most appropriate research strategy for analyzing a real phenomenon within its natural framework. So, the current article aims to analyze the type of emotions and the emotional flows that cross the Facebook page of the Faculty of Management (FM) from the National University of Political Studies and Administration, Bucharest, Romania. The posts and comments posted on faculty's Facebook page, during the academic year 2016/2017, are extracted; thus, 456 posts and 118 comments are analyzed. These are processed using both social network analysis and sentiment analysis; the former concentrates on the relationship established between FM and the members of its online community while the latter brings forward the type of emotions that are disseminated within FM online community. The main results show that FM's Facebook page acts more like a communication tool than as a social network that supports knowledge sharing among community's members. Therefore, it can be argued that FM's Facebook page serves as a tool for the faculty to share its achievement and events, and although it supports members' interactions these do not occur very often. Besides, the emotional content of FM's posts and comments range from negative to positive while FM's members distribute mainly neutral emotions; still, FM remains the main generator while its members act as receivers. These findings have both theoretical and practical implication. On the one hand, it links the social network theories with the ones from the educational area and knowledge management field. On the other hand, it offers a tool for the educational institution management and it sheds light on the emotional content of posts and comments.","[Leon, Ramona-Diana] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012104, Romania",,"Leon, RD (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",ramona.leon@facultateademanagement.ro,"Leon, Ramona D./G-1091-2015","Leon, Ramona D./0000-0002-1448-0522",,,,,36,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,779,789,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800061,0

After briefly introducing the political context of Bangladesh and its NGOs, the paper identifies and defines a radical NGO sub-sector. It then reviews the activities of these organisations during the pre-1990 military government era and during the subsequent period of electoral democracy. Some important achievements are identified, but also many failures that have led to decline, leaving behind an NGO sector dominated by credit and service delivery organisations. The paper then explains this decline by focusing on three inter-related factors: (i) an institutional setting dominated by clientelistic structures that have undermined efforts to build horizontal alliances among excluded groups in civil society, or links between NGOs and political parties; (ii) a shift in donor support from mobilisation to market-based service delivery agencies; and (iii) internal structures that have generated legitimacy and accountability problems by encouraging elite capture, co-option and personalised leadership in the radical sub-sector. It concludes with some brief reflections on the main implications of these failures.","[Lewis, David] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lewis, D (通讯作者)，LSE, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",d.lewis@lse.ac.uk,"Lewis, David/O-7695-2018","Lewis, David/0000-0003-0732-9020",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-155-25-0064]; Nuffield Foundation [SGS/00456/G]; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-155-25-0064] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Nuffield Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [RES-155-25-0064]; Nuffield Foundation [Ref SGS/00456/G];,,78,30,32,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Furthermore, specific probability was calculated through conditional probability formula of upper tail, while PM2.5 concentrations of two cities is no less than given concentrations. The results showed that when the average daily PM2.5 concentrations in adjacent places increased and reached a certain threshold, the probability of extreme fog and haze weather showed an increasing trend.

Although the volume of milk imports fell after the abolition of quotas in March 2015, due to ensuing domestic production increases, they still remain important. Following the quota abolition, the level of milk imports increased in both volume and value in Austria, the Czech Republic, the U.K., Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, and in Croatia. Bulgaria imports increased only in terms of volume. On other hand, the same countries which milk imported, also milk exported. The Netherlands are major exporters of butter on intra-EU markets where the export value of butter almost doubled between the pre-2009 and post-2015 periods. For exports of butter outside the EU the Netherlands together with France and Ireland have the highest shares. Butter exports from the Netherlands, France and Ireland all increased after the lifting of quotas. Among all EU countries, only Latvia experienced a decline in post-2015 imports.","[Mach, Jiri] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hoskova, Pavla] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Thompson, Stanley] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Mach, J (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",mach@pef.czu.cz; hoskova@pef.czu.cz; thompson.51@osu.edu,"Mach, Jiri/H-4657-2018; Hošková, Pavla/H-4594-2018","Mach, Jiri/0000-0002-0526-4246; Hošková, Pavla/0000-0003-0139-8498",,,,,10,1,1,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,204,211,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400027,0

As we have identified there is a lack of neuroscience research on social campaigns, toward the end we present examples of using EEG (Frontal Asymmetry Index) to understand our reaction toward advertised objects, in relation to an individuals' political and ideological beliefs. In study 1 (n = 33), conducted prior to the presidential election in Poland, we tested EEG reaction toward the two candidates running for president representing the right wing and the left. The Frontal Asymmetry Index was analyzed in relation to respondents' political attitudes: conservatism vs. liberalism. In the second study (n = 33) we tested brain reaction (EEG) to two social advertisements referring to homosexuality. This was also analyzed in relation to attitudes toward homosexuality. Both studies showed a correlation between the Frontal Asymmetry Index and attitudes: analyzed brain waves when presented with stimuli (pictures and ads) reflected attitudes shown toward the studied object.

The main hypothesis is that the Government deliberately regulates certain issues through the law, as there is no expectation that the Collective Agreement will be reached soon. The methodology has been based on contemporary analysis of labour legislation which is based not only on the idea of self-regulation, but also on the need to regulate the market in order to make it more efficient, or in line with political intentions. There are two aspects of this approach: regulation as exogenous factors that influence economic flows, and also perfect regulation, enabling perfect market competition. More specifically, the focus is on certain mechanisms that are regulated by the new law in an innovative way, which has given rise to argumentative discussion on the new normative mechanisms and their practical implementation. One of the most important novelties in the Labour Law is the provision under which collective agreements are concluded for a period of three years, creating the possibility to track cyclical movements in the economy and to adapt to the market situation. On the other side the legislator has decided for certain issues that used to be defined under collective agreements to be regulated in detail by law, hence reducing the manoeuvre space for collective bargaining between the workers and the employers. Latest developments are showing that the Union of Employers' Associations of Republika Srpska is losing interest for tough negotiations with syndicate, as collective agreement is not obligatory requirement in front of them, similarly like in Great Britain, where it depends on the goodwill of the signatories, it seems that the Labor Law directly contributed to these developments.","[Markus, Ranko] GOPA Representat Off BiH, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",,"Markus, R (通讯作者)，GOPA Representat Off BiH, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",ranko.markus@yep.ba,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,624,636,,,,,,13,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900039,0

Data that were presented in the report by Ministry of Science and Education show that in the previous academic year (2015/2016) the proportion of foreign students in institutions of higher education has reached 8%. The forecast for year 2016/2017 is even higher - 10%. This number has risen significantly over the past several years. Higher education export in Latvia is fast growing sector. It contributes to the national economy directly (by tuition fees and taxes - EUR 84.5 million) and indirectly (housing expenses, buying food, tourism etc.).

The main aim of this paper is to identify and explain changes in comparative advantages distribution and trade commodity structure which have occurred during the above mentioned time period. In addition, this paper also focuses on the problem of Czech agrarian trade volume growth and decreasing unit price development. The analyzed time period spans the years 2001 to 2015. Trade structure and comparative advantages distribution are evaluated in relation to EU countries (28 current EU members). Differences in the date of their EU accession are not taken in account. The commodity structure (HS system applied) is specifically analyzed in relation to unit value, trade volume development and comparative advantages distribution development. To successfully accomplish the above mentioned objectives, this paper applies basic competitiveness analyses (Lafay index and Trade balance index). The results derived from individual analyses are highlighted by utilizing the Product Mapping Method. The data source for individual analyses was obtained from the Czech Statistical Office. During the period of analysis, Czech agrarian trade increased its dependency on EU Countries. The share of EU countries in regards to Czech agrarian trade turnover has increased from 78% to 88%. Czech agrarian exports are dominated by low processed and semi-processed aggregations having a low unit value. On the other hand, imports from the EU can be characterized by a much higher unit value and a much higher processing level. Unfortunately, the unit value of Czech agrarian exports has been consistently decreasing. However, on the opposite side, the unit value of imports has been steadily increasing.

This paper examined the impact of safety climate as well as co-worker support on near miss reporting intention. A model of near miss reporting system usage intention by incorporating safety climate, co-worker support with extended technology acceptance model (TAM2), was proposed. 313 samples from several departments of a manufacturing company were valid for analyses. We found out that (1) Behavioral intention to use a near miss incident reporting system was affected indirectly by safety climate and self-efficacy. And computer self-efficacy had less impact on intention than safety climate. (2) The behavioral intention was directly influenced by subjective norm, perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of use. Subjective norm exerted almost the same impact on intentions as perceived usefulness did. (3) Safety climate had effect on both subjective norm and co-worker support. (4) Safety climate indirectly influence perceived usefulness via subjective norm as well as co-worker support. The usage of incident reporting system was mainly affected by human factors more than practical factors in our findings.

According to the authors, public-private partnership (PPP) is described as the foundation of the innovative activity, as an essential tool for increasing the efficiency of the national innovative system, which contributes to incentives of investment, and optimal use of material, technical, human and financial resources. The article examines the interaction between the government and private business at different stages of the innovative process which promotes the improvement of design arrangement quality and the efficiency of the investment and innovative activity. In the article, the authors pay special attention to the necessity of application of life cycle contracts (LCC) as an effective instrument of the implementation of public private partnership for the development of the national economy. Also, they give their own definition of lifecycle contract, and the key characteristics of LCC. The authors suggest a business model of the interaction between the state and private business based on PPP and LCC, contributing to improving the quality of design arrangements and the efficiency of investment and innovative activity in the HPU sector. The advantages and disadvantages of PPP (based on LCC) for the business and government are also identified and substantiated in the article. Moreover, the authors developed and gave scientific and theoretical credence to the technique for efficiency evaluation of investment projects, implemented as part of PPP on the basis of LCC. This technique is based on the use of the net present value, the profitability index, the internal rate of return and take into account possible fluctuations of investment risk. All these factors as a whole enable one to assess the efficiency of investments in innovation-oriented companies. According to the results of the research, the authors concluded that it is the projects of PPP, based on life cycle contracts, that can be the real instruments, contributing to the stabilization and improvement of the situation for the development of innovative-investment activity of the companies.","[Timchuk, Oksana; Dorzhieva, Erzhena; Nikityuk, Lyubov; Dykusova, Anastasia] Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Lermontov St 83, Irkutsk 664074, Russia",Irkutsk National Research Technical University (INRTU),"Timchuk, O (通讯作者)，Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Lermontov St 83, Irkutsk 664074, Russia.",,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,665,670,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600109,0

Liquidity shock was massive due to high connectivity with the quality of underlying (securitized) assets. Thus, the problem of solvency was main driver of the liquidity crisis on the interbank market. Counterparty risk was transmitted to the money market through various channels: direct or indirect exposition to shadow banking, confidence channel, asset price channel and wholesale funding run. The structure of paper is following: first part analyzes financial market infrastructure of shadow banking, wholesale funding (originate-to-distribute) model and ABCP market; the second one describes financial market turmoil and contagion to the money market. Liquidity crisis strongly hit many segments of the money market: unsecured money market, repo market, FX swap market, Eurodollar market. Liquidity crisis was severe due to strong correlation between counterparty risk and liquidity premium as well between funding and market liquidity. Monitoring of the main causes of the liquidity crisis in his early stages is important for the fast reaction by central banks in terms of collateral quality and quantity of the reserve ' s supply.","[Titze, Miroslav] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Titze, M (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.",xtitm02@vse.cz,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,20,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This study differs from these research issues by the analysis of so called intellectual offshores from the viewpoint of regional economies. Intellectual off-shores are considered as specific tools for increasing efficiency of knowledge and technology transfer. One of the innovative methods for offshoring is the spatial crowd-investing. It is used for attracting funding to intellectual offshores development. Crowd-investing becomes increasingly popular in the conditions of limitedness of sources for investments. Intellectual off-shores are usually perceived as large infrastructure projects. Usually, when pooling funds for such projects, the minimal investment stock is fixed; this helps to limit the number of potential stakeholders and makes relationships between them more transparent and simple. It is worth noting also that such projects, in fact, erase the difference between institutional and private investors in their access to regional knowledge stock. It means that both institutions, as funds and private investors, can participate in large infrastructure projects funding and knowledge creating. The pooling of private stakeholders diminishes the regional budgets' burden and helps to solve the problem of effective knowledge and technology transfer within regional economies.","[Tkachenko, Elena; Karlik, Alexander; Shakirov, Timur] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises & Ind Complexe, St Petersburg, Russia; [Bodrunov, Sergey] Inst New Ind Dev, St Petersburg, Russia; [Rogova, Elena] Natl Res Univ, St Petersburg Sch Econ & Management, Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Tkachenko, E (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ Econ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises & Ind Complexe, St Petersburg, Russia.",eletkachenko@ya.ru; inir@inir.ru; erogova@hse.ru; timur.shakirov18@gmail.com,"Tkachenko, Elena A./G-9715-2014; Rogova, Elena/K-2821-2015; Karlik, Aleksander E/O-8253-2015",,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,679,684,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600111,0

This study extends the sustainable livelihoods framework to examine and compare the factors affecting farmers' land use decision-making regarding land use choices and crop diversification. A panel dataset of 514 farm households in Ha Tinh (Vietnam) and 422 farm households in Ubon Ratchathani (Thailand) collected in 2007 and 2013 is used for the analyses. The results reveal that (i) farmers' land use decision-making is determined by various factors representing the livelihood platforms, weather shock experience and expectation, and physical-economic conditions of the living localities, and (ii) crop diversification is a weather shock-coping strategy of rural households. We suggest that (i) promoting farm land reconsolidation and privatization, (ii) enhancing access to credit sources and national electricity networks, and (iii) improving rural road conditions and attracting investments in rural non-agricultural sectors contribute to reducing farmers' vulnerability to climate variability.

To answer this question, a model for optimizing production and products selling within profit maximization was developed. The main advantages of the proposed model is the creation of a production structure that will provide the maximum profit, while several types of products, sale price, limited resources are taken into account. The proposed model was tested on the materials of the operating company. The model included 14 types of finished products, their sale price, the rate of consumption of raw materials, restrictions on the available raw materials, technical and labor resources.

Therefore, it is reasonable to look to the exporting sector and its growth prospects to find the impact of this structural change. In this study, we examine one specific country-Latvia-to find the impact of European Structural and Investment Fund (ESIF) financing on Latvian companies' tendency to export, disaggregated between large and small companies, experienced and less experienced management, and lastly between ESIF funds. We used a difference-in-differences methodology, combined with propensity score matching to eliminate the impact of any factors other than the treatment with EU funding and thus prove a positive relation between receiving EU funding and the exporting decision. We find a statistically significant, positive effect on exports' revenues for the funding recipients over those that had not received ESIF financing, the average treatment effect on the treated of which is 24.7%. What is more, we also find that, as we hypothesized, small companies would experience a greater effect from this influx of capital; more experienced management used the money more efficiently; and the agricultural investment fund had a more pronounced impact on the exporting decision than the regional development one. It can therefore be concluded that ESIF financing is indeed a boon to the Latvian economy and its competitiveness. These findings should indeed yield the government some insight into more efficient ways to allocate the delegated capital.","[Viksna, Vents; Bekeris, Reinis] Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, Riga, Latvia",,"Viksna, V (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, Riga, Latvia.",,,,National Research Program SUSTINNO,National Research Program SUSTINNO,"We would like to thank Dr. Talis Putnins, Dr. Konstantins Benkovskis, Anna Zasova, and Marija Krumina for their continued support and contribution to our paper.

For this purpose, the dataset-covering the 1984-2013 time-span, was used to analyze this relationship. Institutional quality (political risk indicators) is the composite index of International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). Besides institutional quality, three macroeconomic indicators i.e. exchange rate, per capita GDP and natural resources, has been selected to develop a relationship. Unit root test, Cointegration test, autoregressive distributed lag model and error correction model were used. The results of unit root test indicated that all the variables are integrated at first difference. The results of cointegration test indicated that there exists a long run cointegration among the variables. The estimated elasticities show that institutional quality has a significant positive relationship with FDIboth in the short and long run. Similarly, per capita gross domestic product has also a significant positive relationship with FDI in the short and long run. These results suggested that any positive change in institutional quality and per capita GDP will bring encouraging and boosting change in FDI inflow.","[Asif, Muhammad] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Dept Management Sci, Abbottabad, Pakistan; [Majid, Abdul] Hazara Univ, Dept Management Sci, Mansehra, Pakistan",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); Hazara University,"Asif, M (通讯作者)，COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Dept Management Sci, Abbottabad, Pakistan.",m_asif@ciit.net.pk; abdulmajidmughal@hotmail.com,"Asif, Muhammad/ABA-1874-2021",,,,,,77,28,30,0,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Since the relationship between age-at-interview and school level is not precise, we introduce fuzziness in the model. We find that the ban has generated a 10-gram reduction in sugar intakes from morning snacks at school, and a significant reduction in the frequency of these morning snacks.

We define traditional banking by four hallmark characteristics: relationship loans, core deposit funding, revenue streams from traditional banking services, and physical bank branches. Banks that adhered more closely to this business strategy were an estimated 8 to 13 percentage points more likely to survive from 1997 to 2012 compared to other small banks using less traditional business strategies.

First, by augmenting a double differencing approach with a research design with three ingredients (a common set of companies simultaneously listed on two stock exchanges, binding capital controls, and different timing of changes in transaction costs), we obtain a control group that has identical corporate fundamentals as the treatment group. We apply the research design to Chinese stocks that are cross-listed in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Second, we allow transaction costs to have different effects in markets with different maturity. We find a significantly negative relationship, on average, between stamp duty increase and price volatility. However, this average effect masks some important heterogeneity. In particular, when institutional investors have become a significant part of the traders' pool, we find an opposite effect. Overall, our results suggest that a Tobin tax could work in an immature market, but can backfire in a more developed market. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the comparative statics of ambiguity and of risks have structural similarities under the smooth ambiguity aversion model (Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji, 2005). The determinant condition on ambiguity preferences is analogous to that on risk preferences. However, the comparative statics have fundamental differences under the alpha-maxmin model (Ghirardato, Maccheroni, and Marinacci, ()). When relative risk aversion is less than 1, only an increase in ambiguity, which broadens support for an investor's belief in the probability of the return distribution in the manner of a strong increase in risk, can reduce demand for an uncertain asset.","[Huang, Yi-Chieh] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Tzeng, Larry Y.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept & Grad Inst Finance, Taipei 10048, Taiwan; [Tzeng, Larry Y.] Natl Chengchi Univ, RIRC, Taipei 11605, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; National Taiwan University; National Chengchi University,"Huang, YC (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.",huangyic@fcu.edu.tw; tzeng@ntu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) [MOST 104-2410-H-035-052, MOST 102-2410-H-002-028-MY3]","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","We deeply appreciate the anonymous coeditor's helpful and valuable suggestions.

Why do banks choose to hide their risk exposure from the public? And should policy makers force banks to be more transparent? In the model, bank opacity is costly because it encourages banks to take on too much risk. But opacity also reduces the incidence of bank runs (for a given level of risk taking). Banks choose to be inefficiently opaque if the composition of their asset holdings is proprietary information. In this case, policy makers can improve upon the market outcome by imposing public disclosure requirements (such as Pillar Three of Basel II). However, full transparency maximizes neither efficiency nor stability. The model can explain why empirically a higher degree of bank competition leads to increased transparency.

Instead, the U.S. tax system allows for businesses of all forms to use losses to offset positive income in other periods and the owners of pass-through businesses to offset current-year income from other sources. Little is known about how the losses of pass-throughs, including S corporations, are used. In this paper, we use administrative tax data to trace entity-level S-corporation losses through to their owners. We find that the owners of S corporations are able to use a large fraction of losses in the year that the loss occurs, ranging from a low of 49 percent in 2009 to a high of 68 percent in 2005. Because the lack of an immediate tax refund for losses can distort business decisions, that high current-year usage suggests that the tax treatment of losses may have less of a distortionary effect on the business and investment decisions of S corporations.","[Lim, Katherine] US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC 20226 USA; [Patel, Elena] Univ Utah, Eccles Sch Business, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Saunders-Scott, Molly] Congress Budget Off, Tax Anal Div, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Congressional Budget Office,"Lim, K (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC 20226 USA.",katherine.lim@treasury.gov; elena.patel@eccles.utah.edu; molly.saunders-scott@cbo.gov,,,,,,,17,1,1,1,1,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The objective is to maximize the weighted sum of expected revenues from selling salmon either in the spot market or in futures contracts and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of the revenues over the planning horizon. The scenario tree for the multistage stochastic programming model is generated based on a procedure that combines Principal Component Analysis and state space modelling. We present results for 3 different CVaR percentiles and different degrees of risk-aversion. The results indicate that salmon producers should use futures contracts to hedge price risk already at fairly low degrees of risk-aversion.

In recent years, these methods have become more popular and are now broadly used in personality and social psychology. Approximately 20 implicit measurement methods have been developed, and new ones are being introduced continuously. So far, research on indirect measuring methods has focused on the development of new methods as well as improving existing ones. However, different methods have different strengths and the associated mental structures differ. This article provides a critical overview of implicit measurement methods by comparing them to selected criteria, to support the choice of method for a specific research purpose. Furthermore, we assess the suitability of the discussed implicit methods for marketing research. In this context, we show the superior potential of the affective misattribution procedure, a common example of a category of tasks used to measure attitudes implicitly. The affective misattribution procedure is an affective priming paradigm that, unlike other affective priming variants, depends on the response interference and has good internal consistency (.70 < alpha < .90) and produces robust effects (average d = 1.25).","[Znanewitz, Judith; Braun, Lisa; Hensel, David; Altobelli, Claudia Fantapie] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Mkt, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany; [Hattke, Fabian] Univ Hamburg, Chair Org & Management, Hamburg, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University; University of Hamburg,"Znanewitz, J (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Mkt, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",znanewitz@hsu-hh.de,,"Hensel, David/0000-0001-8369-1377; Hattke, Fabian/0000-0003-3673-2855",,,,,99,14,19,0,25,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

Design/methodology/approach This paper estimates two-way export potentials from an augmented three-dimensional panel gravity model of bilateral trade between Malaysia and the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region, spanning the 1990-2014 period. Utilizing interviews with government officials and industry experts in Malaysia and Chile, this paper also provides insights into market access issues. Findings The empirical findings of this study suggest that Malaysia has trade potential in Chile, but Chile is overtrading with Malaysia. By major products traded, both countries are found to be overtrading, as the export basket remains concentrated in this partnership. Through the interviews, fewer restrictions are reported by the various stakeholders, as the extent of trade engagement remains somewhat low. The main challenge identified within specific sectors in both the countries relates mainly to procedures established to secure compliance with labeling regulations for food products. Research limitations/implications The sectoral findings reveal that there is indeed scope for expanding exports beyond the current major products traded, particularly in base metal and scientific and measuring equipment from the Malaysia and Chile perspectives, respectively. Thus, product diversification matters to intensify trade cooperation between the two countries. Non-tariff measures need to be streamlined by both parties to ensure further product diversification to food trade, particularly for Chile. Originality/value The limited literature on cross-regional trade within the broader framework of Southeast Asia and LAC only support the fact that potentials do exist but do not appear to provide much research evidence. Empirically, this paper will add to the existing literature on the potentials that hold in the Malaysia-Chile partnership. Further, a lack of adequate information remains on market access and other barriers in both the nations to facilitate decisions on trade opportunities. The findings of the study fill that vacuum of information pertaining to market access and trade facilitation through interviews with various stakeholders in Malaysia and Chile.","[Devadason, Evelyn S.] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Govindaraju, V.

It focuses on how migration flows developed in the wake of the establishment of the European Monetary Union, and whether migration flows became stronger, and more responsive to economic fluctuations, in the euro area. It estimates a gravity equation of bilateral gross migration flows on a global sample and on a sample restricted to the first 12 members of the euro area. It is found that unemployment is a strong and robust determinant of bilateral migration flows both globally and in the euro area. EU accession and the lifting of labour market restrictions on new member states had a large effect on gross migration flows. While mutual euro area membership is not associated with an overall rise in migration, it is associated with increased flows from countries where unemployment is high to those where it is lower. Migration flows among the euro-area 12 have been on an increasing trend since the late 1990s; after falls in 2009 they picked up again in 2010 and 2011. The evidence overall suggests that labour mobility plays an increasing role in the adjustment to asymmetric shocks in the EU and the euro area.","[Arpaia, Alfonso; Kiss, Aron] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Employment Social Affairs & Inclu, Rue Joseph II 27, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Palvolgyi, Balazs; Turrini, Alessandro] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs, Rue Loi 170, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",,"Kiss, A (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Directorate Gen Employment Social Affairs & Inclu, Rue Joseph II 27, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",Aron.KISS@ec.europa.eu,,"Kiss, Aron/0000-0002-2366-8332",,,,,26,3,3,3,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

This implementation of the largest social pension program in the world offers a unique setting for studying the economics of intergenerational relationships during development, given the rapidity of China's population aging, traditions of filial piety and co-residence, decreasing number of children, and dearth of formal social security, at a relatively low income level. We draw on rich household surveys from two provinces at distinct development stages - impoverished Guizhou and relatively well-off Shandong - to better understand heterogeneity in the impact of pension benefits. Employing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that around the pension eligibility age cut-off, the NRPS significantly reduces intergenerational co-residence, especially between elderly parents and their adults sons; promotes pensioners' healthcare service consumption; and weakens (but does not supplant) non-pecuniary and pecuniary transfers across three generations. These effects are much larger in less developed Guizhou province. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The rise in sovereign yields was accompanied by a significant increase in sovereign CDS market activity. This pattern raised concerns that destabilising speculation via outright short-selling of CDS (so-called 'naked CDS') was behind the increase in bond yields. In response, policy-makers introduced a ban on naked CDS trading. We investigate the effect of the ban on the price discovery process of sovereign credit risk, contrasting results for the post-ban period with those obtained prior to the ban. We use intraday data on sovereign CDS and bonds across a number of euro area countries. Our first main finding is that the CDS market dominates the bond market in terms of price discovery. That is, CDS premia in most cases adjust quicker to reflect new information than bond spreads. This result holds also when taking into account transaction costs. Our second main finding is that the ban on short-selling did not alter price discovery dynamics or reduce the efficiency of the market. Finally, we find that prior to the ban, CDS spreads were persistently higher than bond credit spreads, even after controlling for transaction costs. This points to the presence of market frictions that limit the ability of arbitrage forces to fully close pricing gaps between the two markets. However, these pricing discrepancies were in many cases largely eliminated following the introduction of the ban. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

By using firm-level data from big data matching out of China's Customs Database and Chinese Industrial Enterprise Database, we study the foreign market entry order strategy of the Chinese exporters and assess the role of credit constraints in the process of internationalization. The results confirm the negative effect of credit constraints on firms' exporting behavior and entry-time decision. Firms with less credit constraints are more likely to be a pioneer in the foreign market, and those severely credit constrained firms are prevented from doing so because they lack sufficient liquidity. Our robustness tests with different product categories and ownership confirm the evidence. It is also found that a firm's choice decision for being a pioneer or a follower in exporting each new product-market combination is jointly determined by the firm-level and host-country level characteristics, and that firms with larger scale, higher productivity, lower production costs and more intense competition are more likely to be pioneers. We also find that the entry timing decision of the followers is influenced by the pioneers' performance and product category. The results further confirm the existence of crowding out effect and spillover effect between pioneers and followers, and have important policy implications for China's further financial (credit) market reform and for internationalizing Chinese MNEs.","[Qi, Jianhong] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhaoyong] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Churchlands, WA, Australia; [Liu, Hui] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Edith Cowan University; Shandong University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, ZY (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Churchlands, WA, Australia.",qijianhong@sdu.edu.cn; zhaoyong.zhang@ecu.edu.au; lhui0826@126.com,"Zhang, Zhaoyong/D-5100-2013; Li, Wang/M-1612-2019; JIANHONG, QI/K-3617-2015","Zhang, Zhaoyong/0000-0001-9596-2648;","Major Program of the National Social Science, China [17ZDA040]; National Natural Science Foundation, China [71473150]; Sumitomo Foundation, Japan","Major Program of the National Social Science, China; National Natural Science Foundation, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sumitomo Foundation, Japan","The authors wish to thank Donald Lien, Kiyotaka Sato, the international conference participants at YNU in Japan, and anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions on an early version of the paper.

At the same time, despite the known adverse impacts of air pollution, questions remain of willingness-to-pay for cleaner air as existing studies are scarce and have several endogeneity concerns. To address this knowledge gap, I apply a locational equilibrium model to data from Indonesia. This model exploits migration patterns induced by spatial variation in air quality, wages, and cost-of-living to value air quality. I control for (a) migration distance and religious preferences, and (b) endogeneity of air pollution using a wind-and distance-based fire hotspots instrument. My estimates of MWTP of PM2.5 are higher than results from hedonic property models. I also consider heterogeneous MWTP and show that households with children and higher education level have larger valuation for clean air. In sum, this paper demonstrates a potentially novel and rigorous tool to value air quality improvements in developing countries and is an important first step to help policymakers evaluate policies to contain this growing problem.","[Soo, Jie-Sheng Tan] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Soo, JST (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",jiesheng.tan@nus.edu.sg,,"Tan-Soo, Jie-Sheng/0000-0003-1804-9462",,,,,52,12,14,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

To answer this question, we consider futures price models for commodity derivatives that allow for stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rates and a correlation structure between the underlying variables. We examine the empirical pricing performance of these models on pricing long-dated crude oil derivatives. Estimating the model parameters from historical crude oil futures prices and option prices, we find that stochastic interest rate models improve pricing performance on long-dated crude oil derivatives, when the interest rate volatility is relatively high. Furthermore, increasing the model dimensionality does not tend to improve the pricing performance on long-dated crude oil option prices, but it matters for long-dated futures prices. We also find empirical evidence for a negative correlation between crude oil futures prices and interest rates that contributes to improving fit to long-dated crude oil option prices.

Despite the obvious benefits of shifting the burden of resolution from taxpayers to bank creditors, bank bail-ins may also give rise to costs as the financial consequences for bank shareholders and creditors being bailed in could endanger their own financial situation and potentially entail systemic implications. Using granular data on the securities cross-holdings among the largest euro area banking groups, we construct a multi-layered network model where each layer represents bail-inable securities of a specific seniority layer of the creditor hierarchy. The model can be a useful tool for resolution authorities to inform the policy discussion on both the composition and level of loss absorbing capacity of banks and the direct contagion risk following a bail-in. We find that due to low levels of securities cross-holdings in the interbank network there is no direct contagion in terms of creditor banks failing as a result of another bank being bailed in. At the same time, we document that a bail-in will have pecuniary consequences on the different liability holders and our framework allows for an exact quantification of those effects. In addition, we show that recapitalisations following a bail-in will change the network structure and hence the embedded contagion risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a new class of dynamic copula-GARCH models that exploits information from high-frequency data for hedge ratio estimation. The copula theory facilitates constructing a flexible distribution; the inclusion of realized volatility measures constructed from high-frequency data enables copula forecasts to swiftly adapt to changing markets. By using data concerning equity index returns, the estimation results show that the inclusion of realized measures of volatility and correlation greatly enhances the explanatory power in the modeling. Moreover, the out-of-sample forecasting results show that the hedged portfolios constructed from the proposed model are superior to those constructed from the prevailing models in reducing the (estimated) conditional hedged portfolio variance. Finally, the economic gains from exploiting high-frequency data for estimating the hedge ratios are examined. It is found that hedgers obtain additional benefits by including high-frequency data in their hedging decisions; more risk-averse hedgers generate greater benefits.","[Lai, Yu-Sheng] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 1 Daxue Rd, Puli Township 545, Nantou County, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University,"Lai, YS (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 1 Daxue Rd, Puli Township 545, Nantou County, Taiwan.",yushenglai@ncnu.edu.tw,"Lai, Yu-Sheng/S-7142-2019","Lai, Yu-Sheng/0000-0003-1344-0817",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [103-2410-H-260-011],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The author would like to thank the editors and the anonymous referee for their helpful comments and suggestions that substantially improve the manuscript.

England voted strongly to leave Europe while Scotland backed remain by 62% to 38%. The Scottish government published its draft bill on a second independence referendum in October 2016. The move does not mean another referendum will definitely be held, but this does raise the possibility that Scotland might choose independence and staying in the EU without the rest of the United Kingdom. If Scotland charts a course of independence from the rest of the United Kingdom, then they would likely either issue their own currency or join or form another currency area. In this paper, we test the microeconomic foundations of a common currency area for Scotland, United Kingdom, and the rest of the United Kingdom without Scotland. We find that the United Kingdom, Scotland, and the United Kingdom without Scotland all meet the microeconomic criteria for a common currency area. In contrast, banking data suggest that lending in Scotland is different from lending in the rest of the United Kingdom, adding some doubt to the issue of whether or not Scotland is a common currency area with the United Kingdom.","[Binner, Jane M.; Chaudhry, Sajid M.; Mullineux, Andrew W.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Swofford, James L.] Univ S Alabama, Mobile, AL USA",University of Birmingham; University of South Alabama,"Binner, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,"Chaudhry, Sajid/0000-0001-8769-8920",,,,,19,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We use an instrumented difference in-differences method with an original, exhaustive panel of 36,530 French municipalities over the 1994-2010 period. Our estimation results show that inter-municipal cooperation led to an increase in the four (municipal plus inter-municipal) tax rates, which accounts for 35% of the increase observed by the taxpayer on average. Tax increases are greater for the four tax rates when a tax regime consisting in sharing tax-bases between municipal and inter-municipal governments has been adopted. As for municipal tax rates alone, the smaller the municipality, the sharper their decrease. Finally, the heterogeneity of the youth share of the population between municipalities is a key driver of the extent to which the impact of inter-municipal cooperation differs across municipalities.","[Breuille, Marie-Laure] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, CESAER, AgroSup Dijon,UMR1041, Besancon, France; [Duran-Vigneron, Pascale] Univ Strasbourg, Univ Lorraine, CNRS, BETA, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Samson, Anne-Laure] PSL Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, LEDa, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France",INRAE; Universite de Franche-Comte; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Lorraine; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Duran-Vigneron, P (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Univ Lorraine, CNRS, BETA, F-54000 Nancy, France.",marie.breuille@inra.fr; pascale.duran-vigneron@univ-lorraine.fr; anne-laure.samson@dauphine.fr,,"Samson, Anne-Laure/0000-0003-0360-0004","ESF Research Networking Program Public Goods, Public Projects, Externalities; region of Lorraine [AAP-005-079]","ESF Research Networking Program Public Goods, Public Projects, Externalities; region of Lorraine(Region Grand-Est)","This work was supported by grants from the ESF Research Networking Program Public Goods, Public Projects, Externalities and from the region of Lorraine (Grant AAP-005-079).

Motivated by this research gap in the literature, we study the effect of economic- and knowledge-related innovation impediments on a degree of formal openness in innovation. Analyzing a 3 years panel dataset of German manufacturing firms obtained from Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP) database, we find that knowledge-related obstacles induce firms to increase the scale of R&D outsourcing as well as to engage in innovation cooperation partnerships. Contrariwise, a non-significant relationship is detected between economic related innovation impediments and R&D openness. Hence, the study suggests that a high degree of openness in innovation is driven by knowledge shortages rather than cost-risk minimization objectives.","[Bzhalava, Levan] Caucasus Univ, Caucasus Sch Business, Politkovskaya 10, GE-0186 Tbilisi, Georgia; [Bzhalava, Levan; Cantner, Uwe] Grad Coll Econ Innovat Change DFG GK 1411, Dept Econ, Chair Microecon, Carl Zeiss Str, D-307743 Jena, Germany; [Bzhalava, Levan; Cantner, Uwe] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Carl Zeiss Str, D-307743 Jena, Germany; [Cantner, Uwe] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Mkt & Management, I2M Grp, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Southern Denmark,"Bzhalava, L (通讯作者)，Caucasus Univ, Caucasus Sch Business, Politkovskaya 10, GE-0186 Tbilisi, Georgia.;Bzhalava, L (通讯作者)，Grad Coll Econ Innovat Change DFG GK 1411, Dept Econ, Chair Microecon, Carl Zeiss Str, D-307743 Jena, Germany.;Bzhalava, L (通讯作者)，Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Carl Zeiss Str, D-307743 Jena, Germany.",lbzhalava@cu.edu.ge; uwe.cantner@uni-jena.de,"; Cantner, Uwe/A-9187-2015","Bzhalava, Levan/0000-0002-2890-2706; Cantner, Uwe/0000-0002-2067-493X",,,,,64,5,5,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

The largest errors arise in economic downturns and during Fed easings when investors overestimate future short rates and, thus, underestimate future bond returns. At a one-year horizon, errors about the path of the real rate (as opposed to inflation) account for 80% of short-rate forecast error variance, with more than half of that number attributed to the Fed easing more aggressively than the public expected.

Also the importance of effective leadership in hospitality organizations has been stressed widely in literature. This issue has drawn the attention of researchers towards the field of management, especially in women's studies. Generally, various studies have shown that the leader-follower behavior based on gender-oriented variables, play an important role in fulfilling an organization's objectives in hospitality organizations. This study was based on a preliminary sample, consisting of the members of public (government-owned) hospitality organizations. In emphasizing the moderating role of the gender variable, this study presumes these facts and examines the relation between the organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and the leader-member exchange (LMX) in hospitality organizations. The results obtained indicate that the LMX and gender have a significant and positive effect on OCBs. However, the findings also indicate that gender plays no moderating role in the relationship between OCB and LMX in hospitality organizations.","[Estiri, Mehrdad; Khajeheian, Datis] Univ Tehran, Fac Management, Tehran, Iran; [Amiri, Nader Seyyed] Univ Tehran, Fac Entrepreneurship, POB 14395-796,Farshi Moghadam St,16th St, Tehran 1439813141, Iran; [Rayej, Hamzeh] Univ Tehran, Business Management, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran; University of Tehran; University of Tehran,"Amiri, NS (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Fac Entrepreneurship, POB 14395-796,Farshi Moghadam St,16th St, Tehran 1439813141, Iran.",mehrdadstiri@ut.ac.ir; nadersa@ut.ac.ir; datiskh@ut.ac.ir; hamzehrayej@gmail.com,"Seyyedamiri, Nader/H-1542-2017; Estiri, Mehrdad/C-1775-2014; Khajeheian, Datis/Z-3177-2019","Estiri, Mehrdad/0000-0003-1892-0852; Khajeheian, Datis/0000-0001-9913-3732",,,,,69,25,30,3,46,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

We ask whether agricultural growth in developing countries increases the expenditures of poorer households more than growth in other sectors. While some reduced form analyses have tackled this question using either country-level time series data, regional panel data for one country, or cross-sectional country data, this paper is unusual in using panel data for many countries. We improve on much of the existing literature by devising an instrumental variables strategy to correct for the endogeneity of sectoral GDP growth, involving averaging over sectoral income growth rates for neighboring countries. Our principal finding from our instrumental variable estimator is that the estimated elasticities associated with growth in agricultural income are significantly greater than for non-agricultural income for all but the extreme top and bottom deciles. In the middle range of the income distribution the effect of a given GDP growth due to agriculture is 3-4 times larger than if it was due to non-agricultural activities. Having established that on average growth in GDP originating in agriculture is more beneficial for poorer deciles, we finally explore whether this is a pattern which holds across different groupings of countries. A second important finding is that there is heterogeneity across some groupings. Most particularly, we find that it is the poorest people in the poorest countries for whom agricultural income growth is the most beneficial. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Its cross-disciplinary character implies a complex process of forming a development discourse in which different disciplines are simultaneously proposing different and sometimes contradictory discourse components, and where there is-still-a Western hegemony, despite the fact that research is mainly focused on the so-called developing countries. Based on the theories of Michel Foucault, this paper studies the role and influence of academic journals in shaping the contemporary development discourse by means of identifying the main areas of research, the citation networks, and the most influential articles, countries and institutions. Our bibliometric analysis focuses in four development journals that are ranked in the Social Sciences Citation Index in the subject category of planning and development: World Development, Development and Change, Third World Quarterly and European Journal of Development Research. The analysis for the period 2000-2015 produces four main results: i) The four journals coincide on various areas of common interest (related to aid, poverty, sustain ability and development challenges), which share the same rules of formation of the development discourse. ii) Journals have a limited influence in shaping the development discourse because of their inability to generate citation bursts, and the existence of a high proportion of disconnected articles that mostly receive self-citations. iii) There is a clear preponderance of the Anglo-Saxon academia in the scientific production. iv) In comparative terms, World Development stands out as the most influential journal in shaping the development discourse. These results may be useful for authors and editors of development journals in order to paint a broader picture of the contemporary development discourse and to identify important editorial challenges and possible ways to strengthen the journals' coherence and influence in the formation of the development discourse.

Two identification strategies are used: propensity score matching and panel fixed effects estimation. We focus on three indicators of labor market success: employment, earnings and hours worked. We find that electrification raises the annual incomes earned by those who work in paid employment, for both men and women in both countries. For India, both genders work fewer hours, suggesting that electricity raises productivity. For South Africa, where the labor market has less absorptive capacity, there is no employment benefit of electrification. But women who work benefit the most from the productivity gains of electrification: they have greater increases in earnings than men. Our findings suggest that the benefits of electrification do not accrue universally, but rather depend on gender roles, supporting policies and the labor absorptive capacity of the economy.

We test whether consumer demand for payment instruments is price elastic, namely whether consumers are likely to deviate from their preferred methods in order to get a discount or to avoid a surcharge. We find that the occurrence of price incentives is low, but that given cash discounts, the probability that a cash transaction is conducted by a consumer who prefers other payment methods increased by 19.2 percent, after controlling for merchant category and dollar value of the transaction. Payment method choice is affected very strongly by consumer individual preferences, but steering by merchants may be effective under some circumstances. Both merchants' reluctance to offer price discounts and consumers' limited response to them lead to the low observed occurrences of such incentives. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This resulted in a gold mining boom, making gold the main export product and the main source of economic growth of the country. We hypothesize that gold extraction improved population living standards. This paper investigates how the gold boom in Burkina Faso which began in 2007 has affected socioeconomic outcomes. We use a simple theoretical model to motivate the testing of several hypotheses regarding these impacts. Employing a difference-in-differences strategy as well as panel data models, we estimate the impacts using data from household surveys undertaken in 2003 and 2009 and administrative data. Consistent with our model, the results suggest that areas hosting gold extraction have better average living standards in terms of headcount ratios, poverty gaps and household expenditures than do areas without gold. However, the gold boom is also shown to have potentially increased local inequality and child labor in areas with these income gains. These results demonstrate the importance of proactive government policy in mitigating negative welfare impacts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

An implication is that the stock-market, recognizing overconfident-CEO behavior, will react less positively to repurchase announcements. The hypothesis is strongly supported: Overconfident managers repurchase stock at lower levels of cash holdings, and respond more to stock-price declines. Entrenchment exacerbates this behavior. Interestingly, institutional investors appear to encourage repurchases, perhaps to curb excessive investment. Overconfident-CEOs are also more likely to substitute repurchases for dividends or capital expenditure. Consistent with our hypothesis, the stock-market reaction to these share repurchase announcements is less positive. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about how CTs achieve this impact. We conducted a mixed-method review of studies in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Fourteen quantitative and eight qualitative studies met our inclusion criteria, of which eleven and five, respectively, demonstrated evidence that CTs decrease IPV. We found little support for increases in IPV, with only two studies showing overall mixed or adverse impacts. Drawing on these studies, as well as related bodies of evidence, we developed a program theory proposing three pathways through which CT could impact IPV: (a) economic security and emotional well-being, (b) intra-household conflict, and (c) women's empowerment. The economic security and well-being pathway hypothesizes decreases in IPV, while the other two pathways have ambiguous effects depending on program design features and behavioral responses to program components. Future studies should improve IPV measurement, empirical analysis of program mechanisms, and fill regional gaps. Program framing and complementary activities, including those with the ability to shift intra-household power relations are likely to be important design features for understanding how to maximize and leverage the impact of CTs for reducing IPV, and mitigating potential adverse impacts.

It does so by using a novel analytical decomposition of the contribution of new firms to job creation, which allows to separately focus on different margins. In particular, the contribution of new firms to job creation can be expressed as a combination of four different elements: start-up ratio; survival share; average size of firms at entry; and average post-entry growth rate of survivors. This comprehensive characterization of entrants' employment dynamics points to regularities and differences in business dynamism across countries, and can be used as an important diagnostic tool by policy makers.","[Calvino, Flavio] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Calvino, Flavio] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, CES, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France; [Calvino, Flavio; Criscuolo, Chiara; Menon, Carlo] OECD Directorate Sci Technol & Innovat, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-750163 Paris, France; [Criscuolo, Chiara] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Menon, Carlo] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, SERC, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Paris School of Economics; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Criscuolo, C (通讯作者)，OECD Directorate Sci Technol & Innovat, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-750163 Paris, France.;Criscuolo, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",flavio.calvino@oecd.org; chiara.criscuolo@oec-d.org; carlo.menon@oecd.org,"Menon, Carlo/AAL-3158-2020","Menon, Carlo/0000-0003-0678-0434; Menon, Carlo/0000-0002-2309-9977",French National Research Agency (ANR); ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The views expressed here are those of the authors and cannot be attributed to the OECD or its member countries.

Supporters of more disclosure argue that increased transparency will improve tax compliance, while opponents argue that it will divulge sensitive information that is, in many cases, misunderstood. Our results show that in Australia large private companies experienced some consumer backlash and, perhaps partly in anticipation, some acted to avoid disclosure. We detect a small increase (decrease) in tax payments for private (public) firms subject to disclosure suggesting differential costs of disclosure across firms. Finally, we find that investors react negatively to anticipated and actual disclosure of tax information, most likely due to anticipated policy backlash rather than consumer backlash or the revelation of negative information about cash flows.

We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in the capital gains tax rate reduces the value of equity by around 0.3%, which suggests that the capital gains tax significantly raises firms' cost of capital.

This article explores such in the South African case. The article shows a precipitous growth in the magnitude of South African assets held and traded by international investors - increasingly institutional investors and other' financial institutions, such as hedge funds and complex investment vehicles. The composition of these assets, and the motivation for trading, has also altered, shifting towards a complex set of rand-denominated, short-term assets in equity, bond and derivatives markets traded for capital gains. Given this, the article contends that it is the portfolio considerations of such investors, rather than economic fundamentals', that have come to determine key economic prices, including the exchange rate, causing volatility, large swings and sudden adjustments. This, it is argued, places monetary policy in a predicament. In the context of liberalized capital accounts, together with the prioritization of inflation targeting, open-market interventions are ineffective at managing exchange rate movements and volatility, and often reinforce both the patterns of trading and subsequent vulnerabilities while carrying their own costs. In these respects, the nature of South Africa's global financial integrations has exposed it to new forms of external vulnerability, with both these developments, and associated monetary policies, deepening the financialization of the South African economy.","[Isaacs, Gilad] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Kaltenbrunner, Annina] Univ Leeds, Dept Econ, Business Sch, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Witwatersrand; University of Leeds,"Isaacs, G (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, 1 Jan Smuts Ave, ZA-2000 Johannesburg, South Africa.",gilad.isaacs@wits.ac.za,,"Isaacs, Gilad/0000-0002-2419-9777",,,,,112,13,13,2,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

We show that, to alleviate credit constraints and encourage investment, the second-best optimal emission tax falls short of marginal emission damages. The optimal response to shocks depends on how the shock affects the size of the environmental and credit market failures and the effectiveness of the tax in alleviating these market failures. Under mildly restrictive assumptions on functional forms, the optimal response to a (persistent) negative productivity shock or a tightening of credit is to reduce the emission tax. Our results are informative for how climate change policy should optimally change with the business cycle.","[van den Bijgaart, Inge M.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Smulders, Sjak] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Smulders, Sjak] Tilburg Univ, TSC, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Gothenburg; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"van den Bijgaart, IM (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",inge.van.den.bijgaart@economics.gu.se,,"Smulders, Sjak/0000-0003-3753-6469; van den Bijgaart, Inge/0000-0003-0180-8792",,,,,32,9,8,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Outcome uncertainty is expressed by some probabilities, which is determined according to the gap between team qualities. In this turn, the qualities of teams are randomly estimated by average wages of their players. However, unlike previous studies, these probabilities are further adjusted according to the past results of these specific teams during the championship. Moreover, instead of relying on an aggregate indicator to estimate the uncertainty about the final ranking, we estimate the probability of each possible final ranking. This procedure allows us to make use of a more complete information statistics in estimation than usually done in this kind of studies. We provide three main results. First, the effect that uncertainty about the match outcome has on supporters' attendance is positive, significant and non-linear. Second, concerning the final ranking, we identify two opposite effects on supporter's behaviour. While their attendance is inversely related to the gap between the position of their preferred team and its followers in the ongoing ranking, their attendance is also higher if the gap between each teams in the final ranking is sufficiently low. Third, supporters' attendance is not linearly decreasing with the position of the supported team in the championship, but this link presents a sinusoidal curve. The reason is that supporters' attendance also depends on the likelihood of their team to accede to Europea League during the next season, and also on the likelihood of their team being drawn out of Ligue 1 at the end of the season. We also show that supporters' attendance is directly proportional to the uncertainty level about the championship final victory. In particular, the attractiveness of the championship is negatively affected by the recent financial power of PSG.","[Guironnet, Jean-Pascal] Univ Normandie UCBN, CREM, CNRS, Caen, France",Universite de Caen Normandie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Guironnet, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Normandie UCBN, CREM, CNRS, Caen, France.",jean-pascal.guironnet@unicaen.fr,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,6,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Second, we find that firm information asymmetry, a common feature of emerging markets, moderates the negative relationship between the firm's financial constraints and debt security issuance.

Instead, we suggest a different possibility: that food choices are structurally conditioned by income inequality, first; and, second, that we eat what huge oligopolistic food producers and distributors have on offer, which is in turn shaped or facilitated by neoliberal state intervention. To highlight the relevance of structural factors, we develop an index that measures the risk of exposure to what we call the neoliberal diet for low-to-middle-income working classes. Using this index, we compare the United States and Canada, advanced capitalist countries that are also agro-export powerhouses, with a group of countries including the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) plus Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey. We conclude that state interventions need to refocus on reducing social inequality and the social determinants of food production and distribution. Transcending individualistic and consumption approaches will help us appreciate that the state, not the individual consumer, is best positioned to implement change when it comes to food choices and food production.","[Otero, Gerardo; Gurcan, Efe Can; Liberman, Giselle] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Pechlaner, Gabriela] Univ Fraser Valley, Dept Sociol, 33844 King Rd, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada",Simon Fraser University; University of Fraser Valley,"Otero, G (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",otero@sfu.ca,"Gürcan, Efe Can/AAA-3697-2020","Gürcan, Efe Can/0000-0002-5415-3163",Social Sciences and the Humanities Research Council of Canada [639851],Social Sciences and the Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Social Sciences and the Humanities Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: 639851",,95,19,21,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

When we extend the basic model by taking different characteristics into consideration, we find that an increase in the magnitude of skill-biased technological change will conditionally in a way similar to that in the basic model or unconditionally widen the wage inequality.","[Pi, Jiancai; Zhang, Pengqing] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Pi, JC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pi2008@nju.edu.cn; yourdavidchang@163.com,"Pi, Jiancai/AAY-5955-2021","Pi, Jiancai/0000-0003-4327-8355",National Social Science Foundation in China [16BJY080],National Social Science Foundation in China,We would like to express our sincere thanks to two anonymous reviewers and the editor Hamid Beladi for their detailed comments on improving this paper.

We suggest that this reaction might be non-linear; the safe haven status of a satellite currency may hold in calm periods, but breaks down when risk aversion is elevated. A stylized model of portfolio allocation between assets denominated in euro and the satellite currency suggests the presence of two regimes characterized by different reactions of the exchange rate to an increased stress in the euro area. In the diversification regime, the satellite currency appreciates in reaction to an increase in the expected variance of EUR assets, while in the flight to safety regime, the satellite currency depreciates in response to increased expected volatility. We suggest that the switch between regimes is related to changes in risk aversion, driven by the level of strains in the financial system as captured by financial stress indicators. Using the Bayesian Markov-switching VAR model, the presence of these regimes is identified in the case of the Czech koruna, the Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The amendments were successful in steering debtors out of Division I debt restructuring and into the more cost-effective Division II debt restructuring. Although total insolvencies remained flat after the amendments, they led to a significant substitution out of bankruptcies and into debt restructuring. The extent of substitution greatly depends on regional and individual circumstances. For example, generous asset exemptions under bankruptcy at the provincial level discourage debt restructuring, whereas home ownership encourages it. Our results show, therefore, that the impact of national bankruptcy policies can have sizably different impacts at the regional level.","[Allen, Jason] Bank Canada, Financial Markets Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Basiri, Kiana] HEC Montreal, Inst Appl Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Bank of Canada; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Allen, J (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Financial Markets Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,"Basiri, Kiana/AAD-7565-2021","Allen, Jason/0000-0003-2558-9061; Basiri, Kiana/0000-0001-8743-0350",,,,,26,2,2,2,10,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We propose an appealing specification for this type of problem, and its novelty is illustrated by the fact that countries use linear strategies in equilibrium, although their utility and damage functions are highly convex. The stock of pollution under cooperation is always lower. Surprisingly, emissions are always higher in distant periods under the cooperative scenario; and we show through examples that this is a significant finding rather than some marginal effect. It is also shown that the efficient allocation of pollution abatement is driven only by the respective technologies of the countries. Finally, a dynamic transfer scheme allowing to implement the cooperative solution is proposed.","[Bahel, Eric] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Bahel, E (通讯作者)，Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",erbahel@vt.edu,,,,,,,34,2,3,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

R.",,,Influencing transport behaviour: A Bayesian modelling approach for segmentation of social surveys,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MODES,"Current approaches for understanding and influencing transport behaviour often involve creating fixed, homogenous groups of similar surveyed individuals in order to explore specific behavioural profiles, an approach known as segmentation. Most commonly, segmentation is not based on a formal statistical model, but either a simple 'a priori' defined group classification narrative, failing to capture the complexity of varying group characteristics, or a 'post hoc' heuristic cluster analysis, applied to multidimensional behavioural variables, creating complex descriptive group narratives. Here, we present an alternative, Bayesian finite mixture-modelling approach. A clear group narrative is created by constraining the Bayesian prior to group survey respondents based on the predominance of a single apposing transport behaviour, while a detailed insight into the behavioural complexity of each group is achieved using regression on multiple additional survey questions. Rather than assuming within group homogeneity, this creates a dynamic group structure, representing individual level probabilities of group membership and within group apposing travel behaviours. This approach also allows for numerical and graphical representation of the characteristics of these dynamic, clearly defined groups, providing detailed quantitative insight that would be unachievable using existing segmentation approaches. We present an application of this methodology to a large online commuting behaviour survey undertaken in the city of Exeter, UK. Survey respondents are grouped based on which transport mode type they predominantly commute by, and the key drivers of these predominant behaviours are modelled to inform the design of behavioural interventions to reduce commuter congestion in Exeter. Our approach allows us to prioritise the most effective intervention themes, and quantify their potential effect on motor vehicle usage. For example, we identify that individuals that predominantly commute by public transport, but also sometimes motor vehicle, do so on average up to one day per week less often, if they are strongly concerned about the environment, demonstrating how an intervention to promote environmental awareness could greatly reduce motor vehicle usage within this group.","[Dawkins, L.

Think tanks, unlike interest groups, do not bring with them electoral constituencies to advocate on behalf of, so the ways in which they persuade legislators to adopt their opinions cannot simply be electoral in nature. Using a dataset of think tank citations from congressional floor speeches and committee testimony records, I compare the influence of think tanks based on a new measure of their ideologies and, in doing so, show that think tanks engage in strategic ideological positioning to maximize their influence. An additional hypothesis examined is the relationship between think tank members' previous work experiences in government with the organizations' overall prominence. By treating think tanks as strategic actors in legislative politics, I show that think tanks' ideological positioning affects directly how members of Congress engage with them, both by citing them in floor speeches and in calling them to testify, with more extreme think tanks being cited more frequently in floor speeches and more moderate think tanks called more often to testify.","[Lerner, Joshua Y.] Northwestern Univ, Pritzker Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",Northwestern University,"Lerner, JY (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Pritzker Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",joshlerner1@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,7,8,7,68,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2018,175.0,3-4,,,,,347,366,,10.1007/s11127-018-0541-5,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GG9QZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433037400008,0

We take a critical look at current efforts to measure women's empowerment at the individual/ household level through standardized tools. We examine the results of a household survey conducted in Nepal using the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which was developed as a monitoring and evaluation tool for the Feed the Future Initiative. Our interpretation of the results is informed by qualitative fieldwork conducted in the same region. In our quantitative analysis, we regress correlates of empowerment identified in the literature, such as age, education, household wealth, income, and household composition, on individual empowerment as measured by the WEAI. While several factors associated with women's empowerment are significantly associated, household composition and intra-household relationships, which we expected to be essential factors in the local context, appear to be unrelated to the WEAI empowerment score. A measure of critical consciousness tested alongside the WEAI instrument appears instead to be closely associated with these factors. Our qualitative findings reveal that there is a discrepancy between local meanings of empowerment and definitions of empowerment defined in terms of agency. Based on these results, we suggest that improvements in measurement may be possible if approaches that measure power predominantly in terms of agency or decision-making were to include critical consciousness in their framework.

This paper thus seeks to reconstruct post-1989 organisational and ownership transformations in Poland's rail-, road-, and urban-transport companies, as well as those involved in inland shipping. Where freight is concerned, carriage on standard- and broad-gauge railways can be evaluated as mostly deregulated. In turn, in relation to the carriage of passengers, all carriers existing up to mid-2005 had originated within the PEP (Polish State Railways) Group. The most common form of transformation in ownership of passenger carriers is communalisation of existing companies, with shares in the hands of regional authorities. The first private operator appeared as late as 2007 (the present-day Arriva in the province (voivodship) of Kujawsko-Pomorskie). The disintegration of the national road carrier (PKS) resulted in the founding of about 40 new freight-transport firms, the majority of which were closed down soon. Equally, in the case of the PKS passenger enterprises, the most common form of privatisation has involved leasing by workers. The privatisation occurring previously involved, not only Polish investors, but also foreign capital (Veolia, later taken over by Arriva, and the Israeli Egged Holding via its affiliate Mobilis). However, the share of public-capital ownership remains substantial, often resulting in final bankruptcy of road companies. Among the operators involved in urban transport, public ownership remains dominant in various forms (commercialised, communalised, or budgetary units). In contrast, small private firms dominate in inland shipping. Moreover, systemic transformation plus Poland's EU accession have given rise to the conditions underpinning the emergence of Europe's largest shipowners (OT Logistics, the former Odratrans Group).","[Taylor, Zbigniew; Ciechanski, Ariel] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Twarda 51-55, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences,"Taylor, Z (通讯作者)，Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Twarda 51-55, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland.",z.taylor@twarda.pan.pl; ariel@twarda.pan.pl,"Ciechański, Ariel/AAB-9112-2020; Ciechański, Ariel/HIR-7353-2022","Ciechański, Ariel/0000-0002-4123-6533",,,,,66,8,8,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Using data from a randomized controlled trial in Uganda, we examine: (1) whether low-income households enrolled in an economic-empowerment intervention consisting of matched savings, workshops, and mentorship reduced spending on basic needs and (2) how varied levels of matching contributions affected household savings and consumption behavior. We compared primary school-attending AIDS-affected children (N = 1,383) randomized to a control condition with two intervention arms with differing savings-match incentives: 1:1 (Bridges) and 1:2 (Bridges PLUS). We found that: (1) 24 months post-intervention initiation, children in Bridges and Bridges PLUS were more likely to have accumulated savings than children in the control condition; (2) higher match incentives (Bridges PLUS) led to higher deposit frequency but not higher savings in the bank; (3) intervention participation did not result in material hardship; and (4) in both intervention arms, participating families were more likely to start a family business and diversify their assets.","[Wang, Julia Shu-Huah] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Social Work & Social Adm, Room 519,Jockey Club Tower,Centennial Campus, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ssewamala, Fred M.] Washington Univ, Brown Sch, Campus Box 1196,One Brookings Dr,Off 235, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Neilands, Torsten B.] UCSF Sch Med, Dept Med, 550 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Bermudez, Laura Gauer] Columbia Univ, Sch Social Work, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Garfinkel, Irwin] Columbia Univ, Sch Social Work, Contemporary Urban Problems, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Waldfogel, Jane] Columbia Univ, Sch Social Work, Social Work & Publ Affairs, 1255 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Brooks-Gunn, Jeannie] Columbia Univ, Child Dev & Educ, Teachers Coll, 525 West 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Brooks-Gunn, Jeannie] Columbia Univ, Pediat, Coll Phys & Surg, 525 West 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [You, Jing] Renmin Univ China, China Antipoverty Res Inst, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Washington University (WUSTL); University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University Teachers College; Columbia University; Columbia University; Renmin University of China,"Wang, JSH (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Social Work & Social Adm, Room 519,Jockey Club Tower,Centennial Campus, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jshwang@hku.hk; FMS1@WUSTL.EDU; torsten.neilands@ucsf.edu; lgb2123@columbia.edu; ig3@columbia.edu; jw205@columbia.edu; brooks-gunn@columbia.edu; jing.you@ruc.edu.cn,"Wang, Julia Shu-Huah/ABB-7928-2021","Wang, Julia Shu-Huah/0000-0002-6128-8242; You, Jing/0000-0002-0152-0724; Ssewamala, Fred/0000-0002-4849-5650",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [1R01HD070727-01],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),The Bridges to the Future study was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) under Award Number 1R01HD070727-01.

Using a socio-ecological framework, we model the extent to which individual-level characteristics, social environment factors and perceptions of physical environment factors at the neighbourhood and metropolitan scales influence choice of the bicycle as the main transport mode. An exploratory factor analysis distilled the indicators of the latent constructs of the socio-ecological framework into factors, which reflect physical environment challenges and opportunities perceived at the neighbourhood and metropolitan scales; influence of significant others; perceived status symbol of the bike; and perceived commuting benefits of bicycling. A binary logistic regression analysis of the determinants of utility cycling shows that while overall, bicycle ownership is an important determinant of cycling, between the genders, males are more likely to bicycle than females. Also, cyclists are more likely to be non-tertiary educated individuals. Whereas 'perceived neighbourhood-scale challenges' decrease the odds of cycling, 'perceived neighbourhood-scale opportunities', which reflect the availability of bicycle lanes, alternative roads and traffic control measures increase the likelihood of cycling among the study respondents. An interaction term between neighbourhood-scale physical environment opportunities and challenges, however, correlates negatively with cycling, suggesting that overall the metropolitan physical environment is not ideal for cycling. The study points to a huge potential for cycling in the metropolis and provides an empirical basis for interventions needed to remove barriers to bicycle commuting.","[Acheampong, Ransford A.; Siiba, Alhassan] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Museum Bldg, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Acheampong, Ransford A.; Siiba, Alhassan] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Trinity College Dublin; University of Hong Kong,"Acheampong, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Museum Bldg, Dublin 2, Ireland.",Acheampr@tcd.ie,"Acheampong, Ransford/AAK-8200-2020","Acheampong, Ransford/0000-0002-2712-3866; Siiba, Alhassan/0000-0002-7030-7927",,,,,61,29,30,0,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

While many of these episodes are in countries where official finance is important, we also identify episodes where a substantial fraction of domestic investment is financed by private capital inflows. Although there is evidence of a positive growth effect of such inflows in the short run, that positive impact dissipates after 5 years and turns negative over longer horizons. Many such episodes end abruptly, with compression of the current account and sharp slowdowns in investment and growth. Summing over the inflow (current account deficit) episode and its aftermath, we find that growth is slower than when countries rely on domestic savings. The implication is that financing growth and investment out of foreign savings, while not impossible, is risky and too often counterproductive.","[Cavallo, Eduardo] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, NBER, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, CEPR, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Panizza, Ugo] Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Panizza, Ugo] CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland",Inter-American Development Bank; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Panizza, U (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.;Panizza, U (通讯作者)，CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland.",cavalloe@iadb.org; eichengr@berkeley.edu; ugo.panizza@graduateinstitute.ch,"Panizza, Ugo/AAU-2064-2021",,,,,,42,10,13,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Results reveal that EP Financial Institutions (EPFIs) generally have higher liquidity than non-EPFIs and such a finding remains valid after controlling other variables. Moreover, bank regulations positively affect bank liquidity and such a positive effect is stronger for EP Financial Institutions (EPFIs) than for non-EPFIs. Results suggest that EPFIs hold more liquidity buffers likely because of the higher risks and costs that accompany the adoption of EP as well as more effective bank regulations for EPFIs as opposed to non-EPFIs. In addition, banks that plan to adopt EP in the future should increase their liquidity holdings after adopting EP. Furthermore, authorities concerned should encourage non-EPFIs to adopt EP or other eco-friendly measures so that bank regulations can increase liquidity more effectively.","[Chen, Naiwei] Changzhou Univ, Business Sch, Changzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Hsiu-Hsi; Lin, Chia-He] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Chiayi, Taiwan",Changzhou University; National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, NW (通讯作者)，Changzhou Univ, Business Sch, Changzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",nwctw@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,36,11,12,5,42,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

This paper attempts to shed light on this issue by using the O'Donnell (2012)decomposition approach. This approach enables us to decompose the relative profitability of European banks into an output-input price index and a total factor productivity index, with the former further decomposed into two price indexes and the latter further into four productivity and efficiency measures. Our results show that European banks' profitability was not only weak, but also deteriorated over time. Our further analysis shows that the decline in the output-input price index was due to declines in relative lending rate and relative return on securities and an increase in funding costs, while the decline in the productivity index was driven by declines in technical efficiency, scale efficiency, and residual mix efficiency.

We show how this space expands and contracts over time through cumulative causation. Such a dynamic framework allows us to appreciate the role of secondary towns in rural-urban migration and poverty reduction. Secondary towns occupy a unique middle ground between semi-subsistence agriculture and the capitalistic city; between what is close-by and familiar and what is much further away and unknown. By opening up the horizons of the (poorer) rural population and facilitating navigation of the non-farm economy, secondary towns allow a broader base of the poor population to become physically, economically and socially mobile. Secondary towns therefore have great potential as vehicles for inclusive growth and poverty reduction in urbanizing developing countries. These are the insights emerging from in-depth life history accounts of 75 purposively selected rural-urban migrants from rural Kagera, in Tanzania.

We use data on exposures between large European banks, broken down by both maturity and instrument type, to characterise the main features of the multiplex (or multi-layered) structure of the network of large European banks. Banks that are well connected or important in one network, tend to also be well connected in other networks (i.e. the network features positively correlated multiplexity). The different layers exhibit a high degree of similarity, stemming both from standard similarity analyses as well as a core-periphery analyses at the layer level. We propose measures of systemic importance that fit the case in which banks are connected through an arbitrary number of layers (be it by instrument, maturity or a combination of both). Such measures allow for a decomposition of the global systemic importance index for any bank into the contributions of each of the sub-networks, providing a potentially useful tool for banking regulators and supervisors in identifying tailored policy responses. We use the dataset of exposures between large European banks to illustrate that both the methodology and the specific level of network aggregation may matter both in the determination of interconnectedness and in the policy making process.

We demonstrate in parametric and numerical models that the weights given to consumption and amenities in the utility function matter substantially for the steady state equilibrium stock and its stability and dynamics. Both conventional saddle point equilibria and indeterminacy with infinite number of equilibria and saddle-node bifurcation is possible depending on the weights given to consumption and amenities. In addition, we show that for each inefficient equilibrium stock, there is a unique subsidy rate that can move the economy from an inefficient equilibrium to an efficient one. The presence of indeterminacy provides a challenge to resource policies, because the system becomes unpredictable. Therefore, expectations and market psychology may play an important role in resource utilization and provision of amenities.","[Amacher, Gregory] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Coll Nat Resources, 307 C Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24601 USA; [Ollikainen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Puhakka, Mikko] Univ Oulu, Dept Econ, POB 4600, Oulu 90014, Finland",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Helsinki; University of Oulu,"Puhakka, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oulu, Dept Econ, POB 4600, Oulu 90014, Finland.",gamacher@vt.edu; markku.ollikainen@helsinki.fi; Mikko.Puhakka@oulu.fi,,"Ollikainen, Markku/0000-0003-3333-4683",,,,,32,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The current governance structure of the European Monetary Union severely limits the capacity of both national and supranational actors to provide a core public good: macroeconomic stabilization. While member states have institutionalized fiscal austerity and abandoned other macroeconomic levers, the European polity lacks the fiscal resources necessary to achieve stable macroeconomic conditions - smoothing the business cycle, ensuring growth and job creation and mitigating the impact of output shocks on consumption. Capital Markets Union, we argue, is the attempt of European policymakers to devise a financial fix to this structural capacity gap. Using its regulatory powers, the Commission, supported by the European Central Bank (ECB), seeks to harness private financial markets and instruments to provide the public policy good of macroeconomic stabilization. We trace how technocrats, think tanks, and financial-sector lobbyists, through the strategic use of knowledge and expertise, established securitization and market-based finance as solutions to the European Monetary Union's governance problems.","[Braun, Benjamin; Huebner, Marina] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Paulstr 3, D-50676 Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Hübner, M (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Paulstr 3, D-50676 Cologne, Germany.",Marina.Huebner@mpifg.de,,"Braun, Benjamin/0000-0002-5186-5923",,,,,124,22,23,2,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

To examine this, we use a uniquely large data set of public and private corporate bankruptcy filings spanning a banking-sector reform that deregulated bank entry across different regions of India. We find that increased banking competition is associated with more firms seeking a stay on assets, a decline in bankruptcy duration, and a shift toward workouts rather than liquidations.

The sensitivity of payouts to cash flow increases as the cross-segment correlation in a conglomerate decreases. Corporate payouts increase after mergers and acquisitions (M&As), especially among M&As in which acquirers and targets are less correlated.

Very little is known as to whether a disability is associated with a higher risk of being out of school for children in developing countries. This paper presents and analyzes the gap in enrolment in both primary and secondary education between children with and without disabilities using for the first time an internationally tested and comparable measure of functional difficulties (e.g. seeing, hearing, and walking). Using nationally representative datasets from 15 developing countries, this paper finds a consistent and statistically significant disability gap in both primary and secondary school attendance. The paper econometrically examines potential explanations for this disability gap using several specifications. A household fixed effect model shows that disability reduces the probability of school attendance by a median 30.9 percentage points, and that neither individual characteristics nor their socio-economic and unobserved household characteristics explain the disability gap. While general poverty reduction policies, through for instance social transfers to the poor may improve school attendance in general, they seem unlikely to close the disability gap in schooling. The disability gap for primary-age children follows an inverted U-shape relationship with GNI per capita. This suggests that, as GNI per capita rises and more resources become available for improving access to education in middle-income countries, children without disabilities increasingly attend school, whereas the situation of children with disabilities may improve more slowly. Despite the adoption of an inclusive education agenda globally, this paper shows that more research and policy attention 'is needed to make schooling disability-inclusive in developing countries. More attention is also necessary regarding the functional difficulties experienced by children, as some may be preventable and the schooling inequalities associated with them may thus be avoidable.

Building on the analysis for a representative bank, it considers the implications for corrective taxation of various aspects of bank heterogeneity, connectedness, and asymmetries of information.","[Keen, Michael] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Keen, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mkeen@imf.org,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,5,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2018,74.0,1,,,,,4,33,,10.1628/fa-2018-0001,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GB6ES,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429162500002,0

The study consists of a cluster-randomized, longitudinal design. After the baseline survey, half of these village clusters were randomly selected to receive the transfer and a follow-up was conducted 17 months later. We find that the short-term impact of household income increases from the cash transfer leads to substantial SWB gains among caregivers. After a year's worth of transfers, caregivers in beneficiary households have higher life satisfaction and are more likely to believe in a better future. We examine whether program impacts on consumption, food security, resilience, and hopefulness could explain the increase in SWB but do not find that any of these mechanisms individually mediate our results.","[Kilburn, Kelly] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Global Hlth & Infect Dis, Carolina Populat Ctr, 123 West Franklin St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA; [Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Publ Policy, Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Abernethy Hall,Campus Box 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Angeles, Gustavo] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Maternal & Child Hlth, Carolina Populat Ctr, 123 West Franklin St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA; [Tsoka, Maxton] Univ Malawi, Ctr Social Res, Res, Zomba, Malawi; [Mvula, Peter] Univ Malawi, Ctr Social Res, Zomba, Malawi",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of Malawi; University of Malawi,"Kilburn, K (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Global Hlth & Infect Dis, Carolina Populat Ctr, 123 West Franklin St, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA.",kkilburn@unc.edu; shanda@email.unc.edu; Gustavo_angeles@unc.edu; tsokamax@gmail.com; petermvula58@yahoo.com,,,NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD050924] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,59,17,17,3,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

We also extend the analysis of income shifting and study whether Spanish taxpayers also responded to the different tax treatments given to the two types of savings income (from movable capital and capital gains) until 2007, transforming savings income from one type to the other. The results of our study demonstrate three facts. First, Spanish taxpayers did respond to the different tax rates, shifting income from the general base to different forms of savings, especially capital gains. The highest-income individuals and the self-employed and business owners are the groups where this behaviour was most marked. Second, the self-employed and business owners also turned income from movable assets into capital gains, guided by their different tax rates. And third, we find signs of anticipation' and learning' effects caused by the 2007 tax reform. We believe that the results obtained will enrich the growing literature on income shifting.","[Lopez-Laborda, Julio; Valles-Gimenez, Jaime; Zarate-Marco, Anabel] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"López-Laborda, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.",julio.lopez@unizar.es; jvalles@unizar.es; azarate@unizar.es,"Valles-Gimenez, Jaime/R-5073-2018; Vallés-Giménez, Jaime/AAK-5749-2020","Valles-Gimenez, Jaime/0000-0002-2542-4956; Vallés-Giménez, Jaime/0000-0002-2542-4956; Zarate Marco, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-5525-4556",Regional Government of Aragon; European Regional Development Fund (Public Economics Research Group); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2016-76506-C4-3-R],Regional Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); European Regional Development Fund (Public Economics Research Group); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"A version of this paper was presented to the XXII Encuentro de Economia Publica (Santander, 5-6 February 2015), in which it obtained the Encuentro de Economia Publica-Instituto de Estudios Fiscales Prize.

Based on a comprehensive dataset of intraday prices for 28 market regions in 19 countries, we compare the markets with regards to price variation and market structure. In particular, seasonal patterns, volatility, and the occurrence of price spikes are examined and compared with respect to determinants such as market design and production characteristics. We find that regional electricity markets in Australia are characterized by relatively low levels of annual, weekly and intra-daily seasonal patterns, but are by far the most volatile markets in this study. We also conduct a principal component analysis (PCA) based on the identified market characteristics to further investigate the differences between the considered markets. Our results illustrate that more than 80% of the variance in the data can be explained by three principal components, that, based on their loadings can be interpreted as a dispersion factor, a weekly and intra-daily seasonality factor and a factor related to price levels. We also find that electricity markets organized as day-ahead markets exhibit a significantly lower overall price variation compared to markets with real-time trading. These differences exist in a cross-market observation, as well as for markets that feature both trading schemes. Our results provide important information for market participants by classifying the considered markets with respect to associated price and volatility risks.","[Mayer, Klaus] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Financial Management & Capital Markets, Munich, Germany; [Truck, Stefan] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Technical University of Munich; Macquarie University,"Trück, S (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Bldg E4A, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",stefan.trueck@mq.edu.au,,"Trueck, Stefan/0000-0002-5302-3850",Australian Research Council [DP1096326]; Australian Research Council [DP1096326] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by funds from the Australian Research Council through grant no.

C.",,,THE SENSITIVITY OF CO2 EMISSIONS UNDER A CARBON TAX TO ALTERNATIVE BASELINE FORECASTS,CLIMATE CHANGE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon tax; CGE modeling; emissions sensitivity; climate,,"Future carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions under a carbon tax depend on the time-path of the economy under baseline (business-as-usual) conditions as well as the extent to which the policy reduces emissions relative to the baseline. Considerable uncertainties surround the baseline forecasts for fuel prices, energy efficiency (energy-GDP ratios), and GDP, as evidenced by the significant ranges in the forecasts by government agencies and research institutions in the U.S. This paper assesses the significance of these uncertainties to the path of CO2 emissions under a carbon tax. We do this by examining the emissions levels and quantities of abatement that result from the E3 general equilibrium model under a range of alternative baseline forecasts for fuel prices, energy efficiency, and GDP, where the different baselines are produced through suitable changes to key model parameters. In addition, we consider how the time-profile of the carbon tax needed to achieve specified CO2 abatement targets is affected by such forecast-linked changes in parameters. We find that the sensitivity of baseline emissions to alternative forecasts depends on the particular forecasted variable under consideration. Baseline CO2 emissions are highly sensitive to alternative scenarios related to the rate of energy efficiency improvements in the nonenergy sector and the rate of general economic growth. In contrast, such emissions are much less sensitive to alternative scenarios related to the productivity of fossil fuel production. The extent of abatement from the baseline is generally fairly insensitive to changes in the scenarios for time-paths of fuel prices, energy-efficiency and GDP. We also find that short-term emissions targets can be achieved with relatively moderate carbon taxes under all of the baseline scenarios considered.","[Chen, Yunguang; Goulder, Lawrence H.; Hafstead, Marc A.

This paper quantifies the labor market and poverty effects of Honduran minimum wages from 2005 to 2012. Using 13 household surveys as repeated cross-sections, I estimate the net effects of minimum wage hikes using variation from annual reforms to multiple minimum wages, a 60% increase, and changes in the number of minimum wage categories. Evidence shows that employers are partially complying with minimum wage laws, and respond to hikes by increasing their level of non-compliance. Higher minimum wages reduce covered (formal) employment and increase uncovered (informal) employment. Formal sector wages increase but greater labor supply in the informal sector leads to a negative net effect on wages. This last result is often empirically ambiguous, although consistent with the dual-sector minimum wage model. I find no evidence that minimum wages reduce extreme or moderate poverty.

In line with the notion that signals are more valuable to receivers in environments of elevated information asymmetries and under the premise that long-distance transactions present such an environment, we empirically reveal that patent activity and founding team entrepreneurial experience are more effective in increasing venture capital investments when the distance between investors and investees is elevated. Our results, therefore, corroborate the rationale that because tacit knowledge circulates mostly within local circles, it diminishes the value of signals for local transactions, as a priori knowledge about potential target firms is more easily assessed by investors. Our study contributes to the literature on the factors that drive the value of signals, on the literature that studies the function of patents and other forms of intellectual property as a means to boost firm performance, and on the literature on the geography of venture capital investments.","[Kolympiris, Christos] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Hoenen, Sebastian] Wageningen Univ, Management Studies, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kalaitzandonakes, Nicholas] Univ Missouri, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Bath; Wageningen University & Research; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Kolympiris, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",c.kolympiris@bath.ac.uk; Sebastian.hoenen@wur.nl; kalaitzandonakesn@missouri.edu,,"Kolympiris, Christos/0000-0003-1933-6332",Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Strategic Grant [20050176],Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Strategic Grant,Research funding provided by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Strategic Grant #20050176 is gratefully acknowledged.

However, due to the limited availability of specific financial data, previous research has barely assessed the impact of angels on companies' performance. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by providing evidence from a unique dataset made up of 432 angel-backed French companies which are compared to two control groups, one randomly selected and another one consisting of similar enterprises. This double comparison process enables us to purge our analysis of structural effect and to demonstrate the importance of the methodology in generating the sample. Indeed, the results we obtain significantly differ depending on the control group. Our results show that the positive influence of angels depends on the condition of the comparison. The set of BA-backed companies is more likely to exhibit superior performance when it is compared to a random sample whereas the companies' performance is either identical or worse when it is compared to a sample composed of k-nearest neighbors. In addition, using a quantile regression technique makes it possible to differentiate the effect of business angels based on the distribution of the value of the growth rate.","[Levratto, Nadine] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, CNRS, EconomiX, Batiment G,200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Tessier, Luc] Univ Paris Est Marne la Vallee, ERUDITE, Batiment Bois Etang,5 Blvd Descartes Champs Marne, F-75454 Marne La Vallee, France; [Fonrouge, Cecile] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ecole Gest, 1416 Desj Hydroqc, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada",Universite Paris Nanterre; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres,"Levratto, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, CNRS, EconomiX, Batiment G,200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",nadine.levratto@u-paris10.fr,,"Fonrouge, Cecile/0000-0002-9930-7066",network France Angels,network France Angels,"This research was partially supported by the network France Angels which provided us a list of companies backed by business angels.

The implementation of fiscal reforms, public debt reduction and the high level of accumulated reserves gave them more policy space than in the past. As a result, Latin American countries were able to implement countercyclical policies to face the negative economic and social consequences associated with the recent macroeconomic shock. Some countries performed better than others. In particular, Social Democratic and Centrist governments enjoyed more fiscal space; they had realized larger budget surpluses over the good years and were able to cope with the crisis without impairing their fiscal conditions. Yet, Latin America has experienced a public finance deterioration in the most recent years. While governments are showing an increasing ability on taxation they are still facing some problems on the expenditure side. As a result, fiscal policy returned acyclical after the period of the crisis. The sustainability of public accounts may be strengthened increasing tax pressure on the richest, reducing tax evasion and improving current spending efficiency. However, the increasing political problems are putting many questions about future trends of public finance in the region.","[Martorano, Bruno] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Martorano, Bruno] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, NADEL Ctr Dev & Cooperat, Zurich, Switzerland",Maastricht University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Martorano, B (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht Grad Sch Governance UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands.",bruno.martorano82@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,2,2,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We use data from 820 rural households to examine the effect of this financial innovation on their financial behavior. We find that using mobile money services increases the likelihood of saving, borrowing, and receiving remittances. The corresponding amounts of each service are also significantly higher among mobile money user households relative to their nonuser counterparts. We demonstrate that the mechanism of this impact is a reduction in transaction costsa combination of transportation fares and service chargesassociated with household proximity to mobile money agents. To illustrate the convenience of service proximity, we demonstrate that the household's likelihood and frequency of using mobile money services reduces with the distance to the nearest mobile money agent. This distance variable is then used to instrument for the potentially endogenous mobile money adoption. We finally perform propensity score matching to reinforce the robustness of our results; our results are consistent across all these specifications. The results imply that developing and enhancing access to and usage of pro-poor financial products could be a first step to achieving greater financial inclusion.","[Munyegera, Ggombe Kasim; Matsumoto, Tomoya] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Munyegera, GK (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",kasimgm@gmail.com,,"Matsumoto, Tomoya/0000-0002-1570-2713","MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), Global Center of Excellence; JSPS [25101002]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H02619, 25101002, 26301018] Funding Source: KAKEN","MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), Global Center of Excellence; JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","MEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), Global Center of Excellence; JSPS KANENHI Grant No. 25101002",,36,56,57,4,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Design/methodology/approach The study employs a cross-sectional research design to collect data used to test for mediation under this study. Structural equation model (SEM) through use of bootstrap in the Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) was adopted to establish the existence and type of mediation by social network in the relationship between institutional framework and financial inclusion. Findings Social network had a partial mediating effect in the relationship between institutional framework and financial inclusion. In addition, institutional framework through its regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive pillars also exhibited a significant direct effect on financial inclusion. Besides, social network had a positive and significant effect on financial inclusion. This suggest that there exist both a direct effect of institutional framework on financial inclusion and an indirect effect of institutional framework through social network on financial inclusion. Research limitations/implications While the sample for this study was big enough, it limited itself to only poor households in rural Uganda. Besides, the current study adopted cross-sectional design, thus, leaving out longitudinal design to investigate the characteristics in the sample over time. Practical implications The study makes significant empirical contribution and implications to financial inclusion policy makers on evidence of the critical role played by social network in indirectly enhancing the relationship between institutional framework and financial inclusion of the poor who are vulnerable to exclusion by main stream financial services' providers. Originality/value The study recommends that social network, which acts as a conduit through which useful information flow and can be shared, plays a critical role in mediating the relationship between institutional framework and financial inclusion in rural Uganda. Therefore, the study contributes to existing body of literature by highlighting the mediating influence of social network in the relationship between institutional framework and financial inclusion, especially in rural Uganda.","[Bongomin, George Okello Candiya; Munene, John C.] Makerere Univ, Business Sch, Fac Grad Studies & Res, Kampala, Uganda; [Ntayi, Joseph Mpeera] Makerere Univ, Dept Procurement & Logist Management, Business Sch, Kampala, Uganda; [Malinga, Charles Akol] Makerere Univ, Dept Finance, Business Sch, Kampala, Uganda",Makerere University; Makerere University; Makerere University,"Bongomin, GOC (通讯作者)，Makerere Univ, Business Sch, Fac Grad Studies & Res, Kampala, Uganda.",abaikol3@yahoo.co.uk,"Ntayi, Joseph/HKW-6871-2023; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",,,,,,87,11,11,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

This demand has triggered changes throughout the food industry, and led to greater opportunities for product differentiation and the potential to add value to raw commodities. Greater differentiation and value adding over time has in turn dramatically changed the price spread or marketing bill between the farm value of products and the retail value. Thus a significantly greater percentage of the final price paid by consumers is now garnered down chain rather than up chain over the last 20 years. This apparent shifting of value creation or addition, as measured by the marketing margin, has invigorated empirical questions as to where, and how much value, is created along the agri-food value chain. First we define value creation/adding, and then we estimate the economic value added for 454 firms. We validate our findings by creating and employing three additional value creation measures - the modified economic value added, the creation or destruction of value, and the persistence of value creation. Finally we estimate value creation at each node of the value chain, measure the relative differences among firms and nodes, and estimate a model measuring the drivers of value adding.","[Cucagna, Maria Emilia; Goldsmith, Peter D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 1301 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Goldsmith, PD (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 1301 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",pgoldsmi@illinois.edu,,,,,,,89,30,31,3,80,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The study analyzes the stock of observed past disputes by socioeconomic group and the demand for conflict resolution services for unresolved conflicts or trajectories. It also models the hypothetical demand of justice services for future disputes. Results suggest that unequal access to justice might go beyond the financial costs of seeking justice and also depends on individual preferences and community infrastructure. These findings warn against focusing exclusively on formal justice costs to improve the equal access of the poor to conflict resolution services.,"[Cuesta, Jose] Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, Washington, DC USA; [Madrigal, Lucia] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Cuesta, Jose; Skoufias, Emmanuel] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Cuesta, Jose] UNICEF, Off Res Innocenti, Florence, Italy",Georgetown University; Inter-American Development Bank; The World Bank,"Cuesta, J (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, McCourt Sch Publ Policy, Washington, DC USA.;Cuesta, J (通讯作者)，UNICEF, Off Res Innocenti, Florence, Italy.",jac348@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

This chapter describes the results of a laboratory study which investigates preference in decision-making under certainty with multiple conflicting objectives and continuous decision variables. Techniques for solving such problems are taken from the fields of decision analysis and optimization: direct rating technique (SMART-like) and AHP. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the ability of each method to correctly express the decision-maker's preferences. If multi-criteria methods always support the decision-making process and better reflect to existing pattern of preferences of decision-maker, choices made in the decision-making process, obtained through multi-criteria methods, should be closer than the overall assessment. The results obtained in the experiment indicate that this is not the case. Furthermore, the research shows that the AHP method does not better reflect preferences. The results obtained by the AHP method significantly differ from the results obtained by the direct rating and overall assessment method.","[Cypryjanski, Jacek] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Inst IT Management, Dept Comp Methods Expt Econ, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland; [Grzesiuk, Aleksandra] West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Fac Econ, Zolnierska 47, PL-71210 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin; West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Grzesiuk, A (通讯作者)，West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Fac Econ, Zolnierska 47, PL-71210 Szczecin, Poland.",jacek.cypryjanski@wneiz.pl; aleksandra.grzesiuk@gmail.com,"Grzesiuk, Aleksandra/AAG-7401-2021","Grzesiuk, Aleksandra/0000-0003-2519-6516",,,,,16,1,1,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-99187-0; 978-3-319-99186-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,155,165,,10.1007/978-3-319-99187-0_12,0.0,,,11,Behavioral Sciences; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Behavioral Sciences; Business & Economics,BM1WR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000460629400012,0

Welfare is measured by various dimensions of poverty and food insecurity; and agricultural productivity is measured by maize yield and value of crop output per hectare. The poverty measures included per capita consumption expenditure, relative deprivation in terms of per capita consumption expenditure, poverty gap and severity of poverty; and the measures of food insecurity included caloric intake and relative deprivation in terms of caloric intake. Depending on the measure of welfare, the impact of agricultural productivity was estimated with a household fixed effects estimator, a two-part estimator or a correlated-random effect ordered probit estimator. The results indicate that growth in agricultural productivity has the expected welfare-improving effect. In terms of economic magnitude, however, both the direct effect and economy-wide spillover effect (in the non-farm sector) of a percentage increase in agricultural productivity on the poverty and food security measures are small. Efforts to effectively improve the welfare of rural agricultural households should therefore go beyond merely increasing agricultural (land) productivity.","[Darko, Francis Addeah] World Bank Grp, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, JI Jenderal Sudirman Kav 52-53, Jakarta 12190, Indonesia; [Palacios-Lopez, Amparo] World Bank Grp, Dev Data Grp, Washington, DC USA; [Kilic, Talip] World Bank Grp, Dev Data Grp, Rome, Italy; [Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",The World Bank; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Darko, FA (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, JI Jenderal Sudirman Kav 52-53, Jakarta 12190, Indonesia.",fdarko@worldbank.org,,,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) project,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) project,"Funding for this research was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) project.

Construction activities are specific in that their products are for long-term use and financially demanding for the investor. The underestimation of trends, technological changes and investor requirements leads to loss of clients and a significant deterioration in the economic situation. Creating a marketing strategy to keep it on the market can prevent these problems. In construction it means estimating trends and shaping a marketing strategy. This activity is very demanding and costly. It leads to the creation of Goodwill and its focus and is an integral part of the company's assets. If is the marketing strategy insufficient or wrong, it will result in the loss of Goodwill and therefore clients in the market. Construction companies needs to build Goodwill and record it as part of the company's property. Goodwill is also part of internal accounting. This is where the cost of marketing will take place, not only in terms of costs. There is a need for companies to deliberately choose the methods through which they will express the value of Goodwill.","[Dohnal, Radek; Lipovska, Zuzana] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Veveri 331-95, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Hanusova, Helena] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology; Brno University of Technology,"Dohnal, R (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Veveri 331-95, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",dohnal.r@fce.vutbr.cz; hanusova@fbm.vutbr.cz; lipovska.z@fce.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,42,50,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000005,0

Because of the lack of financial instruments in the market, it is difficult to transfer the risk out of the banking system, so the demand for new tools, such as asset-backed security (ABS), has come into being. But, ABS as an innovative business, its development is still inadequate mainly because of its low liquidity, so its liquidity effect for commercial banks is not obvious either. Thus, this paper analyzes the factors influencing the liquidity of ABS and the impacts of these factors on the liquidity effect of ABS by utilizing econometric model. And according to the results analysis, this paper concludes that the advantages of asset securitization outweigh its disadvantages, which means issuing ABS could improve the liquidity of commercial banks, and proposes relevant suggestions for the future development of ABS in China.","[Gan Qing; Liu Qiong; Jiao Yueqi] Harbin Inst Technol Weihai, Sch Econ & Management, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Gan, Q (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol Weihai, Sch Econ & Management, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,6,DALIAN UNIV TECHNICAL ELECTRONIC & AUDIO-VISUAL PRESS,DALIAN CITY,"NO.80 SOFTWARE PARK ROAD, HI-TECH ZONE, DALIAN CITY, LIAONING PROVINCE 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-202-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,313,320,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7UP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455659900045,0

Based on the influence of supply-side reform on the industry, specific strategies for competitiveness improvement are proposed from three aspects, namely, optimizing industrial structure, enhancing supply-side strength, and innovation and upgrading.","[Gao, Qian] China Univ Petr, Sch Chinese Law & Econ Management, ShengLi Coll, Dongying, Shandong, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; Shandong Institute of Petroleum & Chemical Technology,"Gao, Q (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Sch Chinese Law & Econ Management, ShengLi Coll, Dongying, Shandong, Peoples R China.",gaoqian-slupc@foxmail.com,,,Social science planning research project of Shandong Province: The research on the integration and innovation between Amoeba model and management accounting of petroleum equipment manufacturing industry [17CKJJ04]; Human and social science research project of Shandong Provincial Education Department: The research on competitiveness improvement driven by supply-side reform in the petroleum equipment manufacturing industry in the Yellow River delta region [J17RB123]; Key Project of Art Science in Shandong Province :Research on Innovation and Development of Shandong Folk Industry under the Vision of Cultural Poverty Alleviation [201806389]; Chun Hui project of ShengLi College China University of Petroleum: The research on the integration and innovation of management accounting tools which boost the new economic momentum from the perspective of Business finance integration [KY2018008],Social science planning research project of Shandong Province: The research on the integration and innovation between Amoeba model and management accounting of petroleum equipment manufacturing industry; Human and social science research project of Shandong Provincial Education Department: The research on competitiveness improvement driven by supply-side reform in the petroleum equipment manufacturing industry in the Yellow River delta region; Key Project of Art Science in Shandong Province :Research on Innovation and Development of Shandong Folk Industry under the Vision of Cultural Poverty Alleviation; Chun Hui project of ShengLi College China University of Petroleum: The research on the integration and innovation of management accounting tools which boost the new economic momentum from the perspective of Business finance integration,The Social science planning research project of Shandong Province: The research on the integration and innovation between Amoeba model and management accounting of petroleum equipment manufacturing industry (NO.:17CKJJ04).; The Human and social science research project of Shandong Provincial Education Department: The research on competitiveness improvement driven by supply-side reform in the petroleum equipment manufacturing industry in the Yellow River delta region (NO.:J17RB123).; Key Project of Art Science in Shandong Province :Research on Innovation and Development of Shandong Folk Industry under the Vision of Cultural Poverty Alleviation(NO.:201806389); The Chun Hui project of ShengLi College China University of Petroleum: The research on the integration and innovation of management accounting tools which boost the new economic momentum from the perspective of Business finance integration (NO.:KY2018008).,,9,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-623-5,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,56.0,,,,,,361,365,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000491539600082,0

A continuous flow of information allows uninformed traders to form expectations about the liquidation value of each asset. The authors find that insiders submit more market and limit orders than uninformed traders do, and that they are more attracted toward the high-volatility asset, which is the substitute. Moreover, insiders make more money with the substitute than with the main asset, and realize their biggest gains when insider trading is prohibited in the main asset.

Design/methodology/approach - With 912 CBMAs constructed by 431 Chinese-listed corporations from 2006 to 2015, the authors provide graph-theoretical methods to quantify directors' networks and build logistics models of CBMA success and generalized linear model for transaction value. Findings - The authors find that independent directors in central positions of board networks of CBMA significantly strengthen the possibility of success of CBMA and react more positively to large CBMA. The results reveal that state-owned enterprises reduce the importance of independent directors in central positions in assisting successful CBMA, but strengthen the importance in promoting large CBMA. Specifically, majority shareholders counteract the importance of independent directors in central positions in assisting successful CBMA, but improve the importance in promoting large CBMA. Originality/value - The findings suggest that independent directors in central positions, which are embedded in sets of board relationships and interactions, lead to efficient external corporate governance as a mechanism to facilitate a Chinese-listed firm's CBMA decision making.","[Guo, Chenxi; Lv, Ping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Chenxi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Fictitious Econ & Data Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Lv, P (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lvping@ucas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472173, 71002082, 7111010702, 71331005, 91546201]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge the support of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 71472173, 71002082, 7111010702, 71331005, 91546201).",,89,5,5,3,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Creative industry contributed more to the UK's GDP than financial services. This paper analyzes the British creative industry mainly in aspect of its achievements, reasons, advantages and disadvantages and effects by taking Manchester as an example to further explain the accomplishments which England has achieved, aiming to help people better understand the potential of developing creative industry. Traditionally, Englishmen are regarded as a group of conservative and stubborn people, who are unwilling to change and accept new things. However, England was the first country to put up a clear definition of creative industry and made it a real success. Because of the recession of the manufacturing industry, creative industry has an opportunity to develop and shoulder the responsibility of the optimum industrial structure. Along with the government's support and its unique combination of strength in media, culture and education which enable it to create trends and transmit its influence. Nowadays British creative industry has became second-to-none in the world. In terms of employment and output, the importance of creative industry has exceeded its financial industry, which has been providing directly or indirectly nearly half jobs for UK and generating over a staggering 8 pound million pounds an hour. Up to now, creative industry has become one of the main motivations for the growth of the British economy. Although creative industry in England still has some problems, it is still a huge successful history, generating lots of fortune and job opportunities for the British economy, and helping Manchester perfectly adopt its industrial structure. At present, Manchester is the distribution center of the creative industry in northeast, possessing well-established universities, culture and media institutions to drive the booming of the local creative economy. The success of Manchester is the epitome of British creative industry. Just as Francis Bacon said knowledge is power. Nowadays, the correctness of this well-known saying is proved by the success of creative industry.","[Hui, Wang] Xian Int Univ, Coll Humanities & Arts, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Hui, W (通讯作者)，Xian Int Univ, Coll Humanities & Arts, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,"wang, yinhui/JGD-1669-2023",,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-05-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,362,369,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450396400081,0

Swiss and Romanian wine farms are used to test the hypothesis that pressing grapes and processing them into wine will be financially advantageous for wine farms, while other diversification strategies are less promising. Survey results verify this hypothesis for Switzerland. For Romania, a winery on the farm and a positive attitude towards wine tourism are advantageous. Some amenities on the farm such as events or playgrounds allow higher prices to be charged, but this does not result in a better financial situation. Another success factor for both countries is the combination with arable farming. The conclusion is that targeted and well-adapted diversification strategies on wine farms can be recommended.","[Mann, Stefan] Eidgentoss Dept Wirtschaft Bildung & Forsch, Ettenhausen, Switzerland; [Stefan, Petrica] Univ Stiinte Agron & Med Vet Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Mann, S (通讯作者)，Agroscope Inst Nachhaltigkeitswissensch INH, Eidgenoss Dept Wirtschaft Bildung & Forsch WBF, CH-8356 Ettenhausen, Switzerland.",stefan.mann@agroscope.admin.ch,"PETRICA, STEFAN/HTT-2553-2023",,,,,,50,2,2,1,6,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The purpose of this paper is to confront two classic theories (internationalization process model (IPM) and post-acquisition integration types) to several EMNEs strategies within their initial conceptual frameworks, exploring how their practices lead to extend and update existing models. Design/methodology/approach This paper compares the classic IPM with the development stages of iconic EMNEs. This reveals how EMNEs' strategies can be analyzed within extant conceptual frameworks, extending their theoretical content. This approach is then applied to an empirical study of post-acquisition integrations conducted in France by EMNEs from 11 countries of origin. Findings Two theories are discussed, with suggested updates, within their extant frameworks, taking into account EMNEs' strategies. First, the initial IPM is re-explored to reveal concentrated paths, from all quadrants of the framework. Similarly, post-integration typologies are updated, including the partnering approach frequently implemented by EMNEs, and the holding approach empirically identified with some specific features (subjection). Originality/value This paper combines an analysis of some iconic EMNEs' internationalization processes and empirical data on up-market acquisitions by EMNEs from diverse countries of origin. It provides suggestions to update two IM theories.","[Marchand, Morgan] Univ Paris 09, Dauphine Management Res, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Marchand, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Dauphine Management Res, Paris, France.",morganmarchand@me.com,,,,,,,90,5,7,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Based on the seminal work of Lewis (2014), the author uses it to explain the sectoral specialisation of home countries and their firms and MNEs. Design/methodology/approach The paper is multi-disciplinary and entirely conceptual, with cool ideas but very few numbers and equations. Findings Emerging economies exhibit a duality in their economic structure that reflects itself in two largely different sets of location (L) characteristics. They are simultaneously home to both traditional sectors, which are resource and labour intensive, as well as modern sectors, which are knowledge and capital intensive, each of which can be analysed as having two sub-economies. These different sets of location advantages shape the firm-specific advantages of EMNEs and their FDI. Research limitations/implications This analysis helps to underline what shapes the ability of home countries to emerge, and the ability of their firms to grow and their MNEs to become internationally competitive. Few EMNEs can thrive in international markets without concurrent growth in their domestic markets. Maintaining the appropriate location assets to optimally support both types of sectors is costly. Each type of sub-economy requires different kinds of support sectors, infrastructure and policies, with little overlap. Weaknesses in its home country L advantages hinder the long-term competitiveness of their EMNEs. Practical implications Few EMNEs can thrive in international markets without concurrent growth in their domestic markets. Weaknesses in its home country L advantages hinder the long-term competitiveness of their EMNEs. Originality/value The extension of the Lewisian dual economy model allows a number of interesting new insights because it allows us to consider firms, non-firms, informality and the bottlenecks associated with promoting knowledge-intensive sectors in a globalised world. It emphasises structural change, and the need to manage pathways and effectively channel growth.","[Narula, Rajneesh] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Narula, R (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England.",r.narula@henley.ac.uk,,,,,,,55,9,9,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

As a significant example of urban development approaches, the smart city model has gained large attention by policy makers around the world. In the early 2010s, both, Shanghai and Berlin, implemented their own smart city strategies with the aim of establishing themselves as the leading smart city within their country or even continent. Basing on a multi-case study approach by linking inductive (data-driven) and deductive (theory-driven) methods iteratively, a universal smart city model is developed. Secondly, a quantitative index evaluating the smartness of the case cities is created and applied. Considering the results of the smart city index, the German capital scores higher, but regarding the priorities of the smart city strategies, Shanghai outperforms Berlin. It can be concluded that a top-down approach, as applied in Shanghai, leads to higher scores in smartness if the city's priorities are considered. A hybrid form, as applied in Berlin, leads to a better ranking in general smartness.","[Reiber, Lucie; Huang, Guanwei] Tongji Univ, Sino German Sch Postgrad Studies CDHK, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Tongji University,"Huang, GW (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Sino German Sch Postgrad Studies CDHK, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",lucie.reiber@tongji.edu.cn; guanwei.huang@tongji.edu.cn,,,Innovation and Information Management Chair of the Sino-German School for Postgraduate Studies of Tongji University,Innovation and Information Management Chair of the Sino-German School for Postgraduate Studies of Tongji University,This research was academically supported by the Innovation and Information Management Chair of the Sino-German School for Postgraduate Studies of Tongji University and the Strategic Leadership and Global Management Chair of Technical University Berlin.,,27,3,3,0,14,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-623-5,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,56.0,,,,,,419,422,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000491539600096,0

No commodity boom lasts forever, however, and threats to the continuation of this growth are mounting. Indonesia now faces the challenge of locking in gains and setting a course to sustain future development in less favourable times. Post-2000 growth differs from earlier experience in that exports of agricultural products, especially palm oil, have played a leading role. In contrast to the country's earlier oil and gas export boom, the gains from agricultural export growth have accrued mainly to private actors, including corporations, smallholders, and the agricultural labour force, with a much smaller share passing through government budgets. The government can no longer simply mandate the use of funds for development purposes; many other actors and institutions are involved. It is reasonable to suppose that the benefits from such a decentralised export boom would be widely diffused, with relatively large effects on rural and farm households and lower-skilled workers. However, this boom has been accompanied by a sharp rise in inequality and virtually no real wage growth. Moreover, while spending rose robustly during the boom, it is not clear that poor, farm-based households have chosen (or been able) to use gains to smooth consumption or to invest for future generations. The capacity to lock in gains at micro and macro levels is subject to significant policy influence. In line with the maxim that ` the time to repair a roof is when the sun is shining', currently healthy global economic conditions present an opportune moment for Indonesian policymakers to take stock and to look ahead, with an eye to optimal development policy settings.","[Shrestha, Rashesh] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Coxhead, Ian] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Shrestha, R (通讯作者)，Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,"Coxhead, Ian/0000-0001-6958-038X",,,,,30,5,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

This study investigates whether collective action through farmer groups has improved incomes among rural farming households in South Africa. The propensity score matching (PSM) method and the treatment effect approach were used to analyse a sample of 984 rural households from four districts in KwaZulu-Natal. The PSM results indicated that participation in farmer groups significantly and positively influenced household incomes. Group membership increased the average household incomes per adult equivalent by about R3000. However, the Rosenbaum bounds tests indicated that the impact estimates obtained using the PSM approach were not robust to hidden bias. The treatment effect regression model, which controls for hidden bias, was estimated, and the results supported those of PSM. The results also indicated that groups benefit more those who are educated and are males, suggesting a bias against the females and those less educated. The results suggest that organising smallholder farmers into groups can play a positive role in rural poverty reduction. For greater impact, policy makers should promote group formation and participation among smallholder farmers as well as introduce adult literacy classes to improve education levels.","[Sinyolo, Sikhulumile] Human Sci Res Council, Econ Performance & Dev, Private Bag X41, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Mudhara, Maxwell] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Discipline Agr Econ, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",Human Sciences Research Council-South Africa; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Sinyolo, S (通讯作者)，Human Sci Res Council, Econ Performance & Dev, Private Bag X41, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",sksinyolo@gmail.com; Mudhara@ukzn.ac.za,"Sinyolo, Sikhulumile/F-8769-2018","Sinyolo, Sikhulumile/0000-0001-9324-081X",,,,,53,10,11,4,35,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2018,57.0,1,,,,,78,90,,10.1080/03031853.2018.1451349,0.0,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,GD8ZB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430801700006,0

The factors significantly affecting WTP premium prices for organic products include higher disposable household income, older age group, gender, urban surroundings, larger household size and higher educational level. Male and female consumers, living in towns, in a family of up to 4 persons, with higher education, and within the income range of 500-2,000 euro a month would be willing to pay a premium up to 20% once a week for organic products.

The period examined, 2008-13, was one of great economic turmoil, yet it is unclear whether changes in inequality and poverty rates over this time period were mainly driven by changes in market income distributions or by tax-benefit policy reforms. We disentangle these effects by producing counterfactual (no reform') scenarios using tax-benefit microsimulation and representative household surveys for each country. For the first stage of the Great Recession, we find that the policy reaction contributed to stabilising or even decreasing inequality and relative poverty in the UK, France and, especially, Ireland. Market income changes nonetheless pushed up inequality and relative poverty in France. Relative poverty increased in Germany as a result of policy responses combined with market income changes. Subsequent policy reforms, in the later stage of the crisis, had markedly different cross-country effects, decreasing overall poverty in France, increasing it in Ireland, and giving mixed effects for different subgroups in Germany and the UK.","[Bargain, Olivier] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France; [Bargain, Olivier] CNRS, Paris, France; [Bargain, Olivier] EHESS, Paris, France; [Bargain, Olivier; Callan, Tim; Keane, Claire] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Callan, Tim; Keane, Claire] ESRI, Dublin, Ireland; [Callan, Tim; Keane, Claire] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Doorley, Karina] LISER, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IZA Institute Labor Economics; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France.;Bargain, O (通讯作者)，CNRS, Paris, France.;Bargain, O (通讯作者)，EHESS, Paris, France.;Bargain, O (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",olivier.bargain@univ-amu.fr; tim.callan@esri.ie; karina.doorley@liser.lu; claire.keane@esri.ie,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019","Doorley, Karina/0000-0002-6535-0648",Observatoire National de la Pauvrete et de l'Exclusion Sociale (ONPES),Observatoire National de la Pauvrete et de l'Exclusion Sociale (ONPES),We are grateful to the Observatoire National de la Pauvrete et de l'Exclusion Sociale (ONPES) for financial support.

Cultural differentiation erodes the support for general public good'provision and vertical redistribution, reducing in turn the attractiveness of adoption of the mainstream culture by the minority groups. Our model shows the possibility for multiple politico-cultural steady state trajectories depending strongly on the initial degree of cultural differentiation in the society. An exogenous increase in income inequality is shown to increase the likelihood of multiple steady state trajectories. In a context with multiple minority groups, cultural fragmentation favors integration into the mainstream culture.","[Bisin, Alberto] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Bisin, Alberto] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Verdier, Thierry] PSE, Paris, France; [Verdier, Thierry] Ecole Ponts ParisTech, Marne La Vallee, France; [Verdier, Thierry] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Verdier, Thierry] CEPR, London, England",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Verdier, T (通讯作者)，PSE, Paris, France.;Verdier, T (通讯作者)，Ecole Ponts ParisTech, Marne La Vallee, France.",thierry.verdier@ens.fr,,,ERC Grant TECrACOM [324004]; European Research Council (ERC) [324004] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC Grant TECrACOM(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),Thierry Verdier thanks financial support from the ERC Grant TECrACOM no. 324004.,,40,6,7,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

We find that T-REITs portfolio provides a slightly lower level of risk diversification benefit than investment trusts, but higher than the banks. The evidence suggests that portfolio managers and investors may not only be able to utilize knowledge deriving from the CAPM, but also utilize information retrieved from Fama-French model due to its relatively better performance on capturing the variation in T-REITs returns. Results also disclose that T-REITs show a degree of diversity in property focus, and reveal mainly defensive, small and financially distressed characteristics. Finally, based on the multiple observations, a case can be made for a possible linkage between property focus and yield improvement/risk taking structure of T-REITs. This study provides implications for the capacity of T-REITS and improve return enhancement capacity in an efficient portfolio management. Copyright (c) 2017, Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi.

This article deals with the issue of an organizational change and its management. The main objective of the research is to verify the existence of a statistically significant relationship between selected factors and the success of organizational changes in Slovak companies. In the short theoretical introduction, the article explains basic aspects of change management. The main part of the article deals with the analysis of variables affecting the outcome of changes taking place in companies. The empirical survey was carried out using the questionnaire method. The questionnaire was distributed to employees from different types of companies where the changes took place. The survey sample consists of 287 respondents. To test the statistical hypotheses, we used the Spearman's correlation coefficient. The test hypotheses were processed through the program Gretl. Based on the tested relationship between the variables, a significant relationship between the variables was found - the time needed to prepare and implement the change and the success of the change. Other variables also showed an impact on the final outcome of the change. It has been shown that the process of planning changes, checking upon changes, and the time needed to implement changes have an important role and a major effect on the ultimate success or failure of change in a company.","[Dobrovic, Jan; Timkova, Veronika] Univ Presov Presov, Dept Management, Fac Management, Konstantinova 16, Presov 08001, Slovakia",University of Presov,"Dobrovic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Presov Presov, Dept Management, Fac Management, Konstantinova 16, Presov 08001, Slovakia.",jan.dobrovic@unipo.sk; veronika.timkova@smail.unipo.sk,"Dobrovic, Ján/E-2828-2014; Dobrovič, Ján/AAG-8258-2021; Timková, Veronika/D-9353-2018; Loumová, Veronika/AAA-6043-2021","Dobrovic, Ján/0000-0002-0637-106X;",VEGA Project [1/0255/2016],VEGA Project(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The contribution is the result of the VEGA Project No. 1/0255/2016 The research on the possibility of optimization of process-oriented models of the financial administration management with a focus on transfer pricing and tax harmonization in the terms of EU.,,42,4,17,2,27,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Our results show that credit risk and liquidity risk do not have an economically meaningful reciprocal contemporaneous or time-lagged relationship. However, both risks separately influence bank stability and their interaction contributes to bank instability.

Accordingly, the unweighted average of dynamic conditional correlations between cross country bond returns significantly increases in phase 2. At first glance, the increased co-movement degree suggests an integration of the sample countries after the crisis. However, using correlation based stable networks, we show that this is not enough to make such a strong conclusion. In particular, we reveal that the increased average correlation is more likely to be caused by clusters of countries that exhibit high within-cluster co-movement but not between-cluster co-movement. Potential reasons for the post-crisis segmentation and important implications for international investors and policymakers are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We revisit this important question using a rich new dataset that covers two million repeat-sales housing transactions drawn from four major metropolitan areas. Our analysis applies a repeat-sales framework, including house and neighborhood-by-time fixed effects to control for unobserved differences in the quality of homes and their associated neighborhoods. In contrast to most of the recent literature, we find that black and Hispanic homebuyers pay premia of around 2% on average across the four cities- differences not explained by variation in buyer income or access to credit. We also show black and Hispanic buyers pay more for housing regardless of the race or ethnicity of the seller, suggesting that the estimated premia are unlikely to be driven by a very direct form of racial prejudice. Our estimates have implications for the levels and persistence of racial differences in home ownership, the segregation of neighborhoods, and the dynamics of wealth accumulation.

One of such interventions is the introduction of commodity exchanges. The theoretical justification is that commoditization reduces the high transaction costs associated with the information and enforcement problems characterizing agricultural markets of these countries. However it is not known whether these potential gains are transmitted to the various markets along a value chain. By taking the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) as a case, this paper examines the impacts of the introduction of the commodity exchange in transmitting price signals along the coffee value chain (world-export-auction-producer prices). We found that both the speed and symmetry of transmission remains weak even after the launch of ECX. At each level, the market chain was found to favor buyers. This implies that not only the country's gains from export are sub-optimal, the cumulative burden is on the millions of smallholder farmers who are located at the bottom of the chain. In a context where local agricultural markets remain traditional and export markets barely competitive, the introduction of the commodity exchange will have limited impacts in improving the performance of markets in transmitting price signals. Other policy measures to further liberalize both local and export markets are required.","[Gelaw, Fekadu; Speelman, Stijn; van Huylenbroeck, Guido] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Gelaw, F (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",FekaduGelaw.Mersha@UGent.be,"Gelaw, Fekadu/GXM-5336-2022","speelman, stijn/0000-0001-7692-3459",,,,,58,4,5,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper uses the 2005 attacks on the London Tube to provide causal evidence of the negative impact of terrorism on the value of proximity to public transportation. These attacks brought major transit stations into the spotlight as high-risk locations. As a result, surrounding communities became less attractive places in which to live and conduct business. I find that house prices closer to the major transit hubs of London fell by 6% for one year. This shock spread to Manchester as well: house prices closer to major transit hubs dropped by 9-14% for three to four years. I also show that new firms are less likely to locate near major stations after the attacks, particularly those relying on foot traffic. Among incumbent firms, those serving customers in person are most hurt by the attacks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Global quantitative targets and adaptation are the most accepted in contrast to a low acceptance of geoengineering. People that are more affected by climate change and value fairness a lot care more about global and sector targets and research and development. Surprisingly, being vulnerable to climate change does not increase the preference for adaptation by much. Furthermore, I analyze which countries or groups of countries are expected to play a leading role for each component. The EU is seen as a key player and not much is expected from the USA and China.

Three nine-variable systems are examined, including stock indexes in both local currency and US dollars plus foreign exchange rates. After finding only weak evidence of cointegration in the three nine-variable systems, vector autoregression models are used to identify which price indexes drive the others. Our initial tests are consistent with earlier findings; that is, the US market appears to be the clear price leader. However, after constructing alternative models with the US data series lagged one period (making it the first market reported each day rather than the last), the results are reversed; the US is no longer the price leader. The US market is driven by nearly all other markets, while making little or no impact on the others. Thus, in earlier studies using nonsynchronous data reported by calendar date, it only appears that the US drives other stock markets, when in fact the US is merely an equal participant in information transmission around the world.

This paper examines the influence of autocorrelation-based transformation on the systemic dynamics using exchange rates of CNY against different currencies among USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, MYR and RUB. First, we construct recurrence plots of exchange rate return sequences and autocorrelation sequences with a fixed sliding window length of 20. The recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) shows that the exchange rate return sequences exhibit lower degrees of determinism than the autocorrelation sequences. Further, by analyzing the RQA measures with bootstrap techniques and box plots, we reveal that the RQA measures of the exchange rate return systems and the auto correlation sequence systems are mostly significant, and the vertical structures of recurrence plots of autocorrelation sequences are more sensitive to the shuffles of bootstrap techniques. Finally, we investigate the evolution of RQA measures with the changes of sliding window lengths.

Using a comprehensive sample of publicly listed firms in 30 countries over the period 2001-2010, we find instead that greater foreign institutional ownership fosters long-term investment in tangible, intangible, and human capital. Foreign institutional ownership also leads to significant increases in innovation output. We identify these effects by exploiting the exogenous variation in foreign institutional ownership that follows the addition of a stock to the MSCI indexes.

Both effects are temporary. Over time, the perceived risk decreases, and the bias disappears. The distortion between perceived and actual risk is large, and the increase in cash is suboptimal.

This situation is particularly relevant in equity crowdfunding, which refers to a recent financial innovation originating on the Internet that targets small and innovative firms. In many jurisdictions, securities regulation offers exemptions to prospectus and registration requirements. We provide an into-depth discussion of recent regulatory reforms in different countries and discuss how they may impact equity crowdfunding. Building on a theoretical framework, we show that optimal regulation depends on the availability of an alternative early-stage financing such as venture capital and angel finance.

In addition, the cash holding effect is strong among stocks with high transaction costs, high short selling costs, and large idiosyncratic volatility, indicating that arbitrage on the cash holding effect is costly and risky.

They are increasingly protected in many countries of the South as a tool for economic, social, territorial, and ecological development. Implemented in the wake of the weakly prescriptive WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) of 1995, the choice of the institutional framework for protecting GIs nationally as well as associated public support infrastructure was left open. This led to divergences in overarching approaches and to GI institutionalization that differs remarkably across countries. Twenty years after TRIPs, the purpose of both this paper and of the special issue is to advance our understanding of the institutionalization of GIs, as an IPR, a quality standard, and a policy instrument in harnessing all of the expected benefits of GI protection. Building upon the contributions to this special issue, we use an original multilevel governance framework to analyze all the multifaceted roles of the state, in different empirical situations worldwide. This reflects the experiences of countries that have only recently implemented GI protection, such as Brazil, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, South Africa, Kenya, and West African countries, as well as of regions with a long history of GI protection, including the EU and the US. Based on an analysis of the complexity and diversity of all state, we show that global harmonization is underway with a convergence toward a prominent role of the state in GI regulation, in particular for defining GI content, which is specific for GIs when compared to other IPRs or quality standards. We suggest that the intervention of the state is supported by a universal desire to guard against unfair exclusion, and to protect a common heritage. (C') 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

By paying close attention to the practices that reshape the hill, we account for the active roles of people and material flows in shaping their identities, forms, and power relations. Social relations can be read in the landscape as their material outcomes are literally scoured into the hill slope. Such a material reading of Ethiopia's developmental state reveals three issues: First, drainage and soil conservation practices are configured by particular historical regimes of land distribution and rent appropriation. Second, the power of the Ethiopian government's model of the developmental state derives from the exploitation of this configuration by a new coalition of landholders and government officials. Government officials mobilize landholders to construct terraces in exchange for government support in conflicts over land and input distribution. When the terraces create obstructions that can trigger flooding, landowners convert them into drains and divert drainage flows to plots sharecropped by landless families. Consequently, the yearly mobilization for terrace construction does not halt soil erosion but further aggravates it. This continues because the performance of this yearly ritual affirms the authority of landholders and government agents. Third, landless families which fail to live up to the model of the farmer interested in soil conservation have created a competing trader model with its own institutions. The denial of their non-farmer identities by landholders and officials fuels generational conflicts over drainage which deepen the fractures in the hill and pose a challenge to government authority. Land degradation thus embodies both the powers and the limits of the developmental state. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We present empirical evidence suggesting a relatively clear, statistically robust, and intuitive characterization. Institutional factors that affect the likelihood of an abrupt and total loss of foreigners' capital (i.e., return of capital) dominate factors that affect rates of return conditional on a strictly positive terminal investment value (i.e., return on capital). The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that expropriation risk is most important among the available measures of different dimensions of institutional quality. A one standard-deviation reduction in expropriation risk is associated with a 72% increase in FDI, which is substantially larger than the effects of any other dimensions of institutional quality as simultaneously estimated in our empirical models of expected FDI inflows. We show that this evidence is consistent with the predictions of a standard theory of FDI under imperfect contract enforcement and multiple dimensions of political risk.","[Akhtaruzzaman, M.] Toi Ohomai Inst Technol, Rotorua, New Zealand; [Akhtaruzzaman, M.] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kumargaon, Sylhet, Bangladesh; [Berg, Nathan] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Berg, Nathan] Univ Newcastle, Dept Econ, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Hajzler, Christopher] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hajzler, Christopher] Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Shahjalal University of Science & Technology (SUST); University of Otago; University of Newcastle; Bank of Canada,"Berg, N (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",akhtar.zaman@toiohomai.ac.nz; nathan.berg@otago.ac.nz; chajzler@bankofcanada.ca,"Akhtaruzzaman, Muhammad/GMX-3485-2022","Hajzler, Christopher/0000-0001-9011-6581; Akhtaruzzaman, Md/0000-0001-7795-1451; Akhtaruzzaman, Muhammad/0000-0002-8308-9340",Australian Research Council [DP150100242],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank the Editor (Thomas Stratmann) and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions that have significantly improved this paper.

Systematic cojumps are prevalent in book-to-market portfolios and hence, their risk cannot easily be diversified away by investing in growth or value stocks. Nonetheless, large-cap firms have less exposure to systematic cojumps than small-cap firms. Probit regression reveals that systematic cojump occurrences are significantly associated with worse-than-expected scheduled macroeconomic announcements, especially those pertaining to the Federal Funds target rate. Tobit regression shows that Federal Funds news surprises are also significantly related to the magnitude of systematic cojumps.","[Chan, Kam Fong] Univ Queensland, Business Sch, 328A Colin Clark Bldg Blair Dr, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Bowman, Robert G.] Univ Auckland, Business Sch, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Neely, Christopher J.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Div, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA",University of Queensland; University of Auckland; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Chan, KF (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Business Sch, 328A Colin Clark Bldg Blair Dr, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",k.chan@business.uq.edu.au; j.bowman@auckland.ac.nz; neely@stls.frb.org,"Neely, Christopher/I-5749-2016","Neely, Christopher/0000-0003-2852-9419; Chan, Kam Fong/0000-0002-3868-3842",,,,,47,3,4,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

Except for a few high-profile, high-information races, the ballot order effect is large, especially in down-ballot races for judicial positions.

Our results show that leverage, firm size, capital expenditure, net working capital and cash flow volatility are important in determining cash holdings. When we divide our sample into two sub-samples: petrochemical and non-petrochemical firms, our results show a significant difference between the determinants of cash holdings of the two groups of firms. We also investigate the characteristics of high liquid firms (conservative firms). The results indicate that conservative firms are less leveraged, have large size, have low investment expenditures and have low cash flow fluctuation. Furthermore, dynamic panel estimation indicates that Saudi firms adjust their liquidity holdings quickly towards an endogenous target cash ratio. Copyright (c) 2017, Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi.

It investigates the interactions between livelihood assets, activities, and outcomes, and captures the dynamics of long-term changes and their underlying factors. The study aims to identify the classification of rural livelihood strategies, their transitions and factors influencing these processes and changes. We employ the dynamic livelihood strategy framework, and use panel data for 2008 and 2012 covering 464 households in 15 villages in Cambodia, for latent class cluster analysis and regression estimation. In this paper, livelihood strategies are quantified based on allocation of available resources, which overcomes the limitations of income-based analysis. Our study identifies five household livelihood strategies pursued in the study areas, and the results show that over 70% of households change livelihood strategies over time in response to evolving pressures, incentives and opportunities. The study identifies covariates that shape the choices of livelihood strategies and affects the households' access to more remunerative strategies, such as education, ownership of physical assets, and access to infrastructure. These findings suggest policy implications for improving the range of livelihood choices available to lower income groups to move out of poverty trap. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Are multiparty elections rewarded in both democracies and electoral authoritarian regimes? How do the rewards for institutional reforms compare to the rewards for substantive improvements in governance and political rights? These questions are of particular interest given both the spread of democracy and the emergence of autocracies with multiparty elections for the executive and legislature as the modal form of authoritarianism. To answer these questions, we examine temporal dynamics in aid flows before and after transitions to multiparty elections and the strategic allocation of aid rewards to specific sectors depending upon electoral competition and substantive improvements in governance and political rights. We find that, in the post-Cold War era, bilateral and multilateral donors reward the adoption of multiparty elections in both democracies and electoral authoritarian regimes while also rewarding substantive improvements in governance and political rights. Sector specific analyses reveal that multiparty elections are rewarded with greater democracy aid and economic aid in both democratic and electoral authoritarian regimes. Nevertheless, the quality of elections matters: the adoption of democratic elections receives greater aid gains than the adoption of authoritarian elections.","[Kim, Nam Kyu; Kroeger, Alex] Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, 511 Oldfather Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Kim, Nam Kyu] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Diplomacy, 53 Myeongnyun Dong 3-Ga, Seoul 110745, South Korea",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, NK (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, 511 Oldfather Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.;Kim, NK (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Diplomacy, 53 Myeongnyun Dong 3-Ga, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",namkyu@unl.edu; alex.kroeger@huskers.unl.edu,"Kroeger, Alex/K-9106-2019; Kim, Nam Kyu/P-1552-2017","Kim, Nam Kyu/0000-0003-0621-4192; Kroeger, Alex/0000-0001-7210-2899",,,,,83,8,8,2,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

The article gives major results. Even if the success of reforms in the short term and some progress in international currency' functions are recognised, some obstacles exist that dampen internationalization. If they were removed, the share of the RMB for example in international reserves could be around 10%. The economic size of a country that represents a tipping point of the process around 20% of the global GDP in the case of China is not the sole driver of internationalization: the continued implementation of liberalization reforms is a major challenge for China. This kind of internationalization coexists with an increasing regional influence of China and the RMB. A natural influence on regional trading and financial relations, functions that are more performed at a regional level, and the growing influence of the RMB on Asian exchange rates, call for a regional currency status, which is a specific and less strict type of internationalization. Thus, the form of internationalization of the RMB is today complex.","[Lahet, Delphine] Univ Bordeaux, Campus Pessac,Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France",Universite de Bordeaux,"Lahet, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, Campus Pessac,Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",delphine.lahet@u-bordeaux.fr,,,,,,,85,3,3,9,92,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

In recent years it has shifted toward offering pre-listing incentives to avoid listings and the costs and conflicts resulting from regulation. In this paper we take an initial step toward examining these pre-listing incentives. We allow the incentive structure, perverse incentives to destroy habitat or preemptive conservation, to be endogenously determined. We show that which incentive structure emerges depends on how high the conservation threshold is and on the relative costs of habitat conservation versus habitat destruction. It is critical to distinguish between these incentive structures because a policy that works in one setting does not necessarily work in the other. Our results shed light on policy decisions in several recent high-profile ESA cases.","[Langpap, Christian; Wu, JunJie] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Langpap, C (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",christian.langpap@oregonstate.edu; junjie.wu@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,29,15,15,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

We find a case where the GLBA consolidation destroys value captured by scope disequities. Four main results are demonstrated. First, bank capital requirement enhances a likelihood of bankruptcy and destroys value for the consolidated bank. Second, an increase in the regulatory guaranteed interest rate of the life insurance policy increases the default risk and decreases value for the consolidated bank. Third, on the contrary, the regulatory participation rate enhances the survival probability and value for the consolidated bank. Finally, our findings sound a cautionary note to adoption of regulatory mechanisms that may discourage functional consolidation of the GLBA.

Using disaggregated Chinese firm-level production data from 2004 to 2006, we find strong evidence that output trade liberalization boosts firm productivity. More importantly, after controlling for the firm's self-selection in regards to investment in worker training, our extensive empirical research suggests the following findings. First, with fiercer import competition, firms experience a decrease in profitability and hence are less likely to invest in worker training. Second, less productive firms are more likely to train their workers, as otherwise they would collapse and exit from the market. The lower the firm productivity, the more is invested in the firm's worker training.

Although these are distinct perspectives, income poverty and perceptions of financial difficulties are likely to be interrelated. Low income (especially if it persists) is likely to negatively affect perceptions of financial difficulties and, as recently suggested by the behavioural economics literature, (past) subjective sentiment may in return influence individual's income generating ability and poverty status. The aim of this paper is to determine the extent of these dynamic cross-effects between both processes. Using Luxembourg survey data, our main result highlights the existence of a feedback effect from past perceived financial difficulties on current income poverty suggesting that subjective perceptions can have objective effects on an individual's behaviour and outcomes.

Half-hourly data on consumption collected during the trial indicated that TOU tariffs reduced consumption at peak, with some reductions lasting beyond the end of the peak period and post-peak spikes in usage were not observed. IHD feedback resulted in the most reliable reductions and bimonthly billing the least. Moreover, consumers slightly increase the electricity usage during the first hours of the night and early in the morning. Households with greater education react to the information associated to the TOU tariffs slightly more than the average. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Often, impure public goods have a charitable or ethical dimension, giving ethically motivated consumers a convenient option to contribute to public goods through the marketplace (in addition to direct donations). Impure public goods could potentially promote ethical giving or alternatively hinder charitable behaviour. We implement an economics experiment with a between subject design to test the behavioural relevance of impure public goods with only a token (i.e. small) contribution to a public good. Contributions to the public good are negatively affected by the presence of impure public goods with token contributions. We explore one mechanism to offset this negative impact by making the token impure public good mandatory. We observe higher average contributions and several positive impacts on charitable behaviour, which supports the claim that this mechanism can potentially offset the negative impact of impure public goods.

Empirical tests exploit interstate bank branching deregulation, which relaxes financial constraints on private firms and can strengthen their bargaining position in an acquisition. Using a proxy for the degree to which targets depend on acquirers for financing, I find that private targets depend less on acquirers as a result of interstate bank branching deregulation. Relaxing financial constraints on private targets leads to an increase in target valuation multiples and a decrease in acquirer wealth gains.","[Greene, Daniel] Clemson Univ, Coll Business, Clemson, SC 29631 USA",Clemson University,"Greene, D (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Coll Business, Clemson, SC 29631 USA.",dtg@clemson.edu,,,Louis Samuel Brooke Jr. Scholarship; Steve Smith Fellowship; Georgia State University Dissertation Grant,Louis Samuel Brooke Jr. Scholarship; Steve Smith Fellowship; Georgia State University Dissertation Grant,"I am grateful for the guidance of my dissertation committee: Omesh Kini (chair), Mark Chen, Bob Comment, Vikram Nanda, and Chip Ryan.

We develop three models: a logit model of livestock choice, an OLS model of total livestock value, and a multinomial logit model of species choice. The data were collected from five countries in Southeast Asia. We find that climate has a significant impact on farmers' livestock choice. We use three climate projections to predict future impacts. Climate change would increase the probability of raising livestock. However, the total value of livestock owned per livestock farm will shrink 9%-10%. Climate change will cause farmers to choose smaller animals such as ducks, goats, and chicken rather than larger animals.","[Ou, Lun; Mendelsohn, Robert] Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Mendelsohn, R (通讯作者)，Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",lun.ou@yale.edu; robert.mendelsohn@yale.edu,"Mendelsohn, Robert/GZA-9112-2022",,,,,,21,8,9,1,19,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

A range of testing is defined by the hypotheses capturing determinants of probability to send money transfers, their volume, spending behaviour and probability of having skilled position. Our results demonstrate that reverse economic effects of remittances on the source country might be simply combination of regular and occasional form with different weight.

This is consistent with evidence from other countries, and Canadians perform relatively well in comparison with Americans but worse than individuals in other countries, such as Germany. Among Canadian respondents, the young and the old, women, minorities, and those with lower educational attainment do worse, a pattern that has been consistently found in other countries as well.

In this paper it is shown how this undesired consequence need no longer occur when elements of behavioral economics are incorporated in the otherwise standard model of public good provision. In particular, strategic complementarities between the public good contribution of the leading country and those of the follower may result either if the follower has specific non-egoistic or other-regarding preferences or if the leader's contribution positively affects the follower's beliefs, i.e., his conjectural variations, about the leader's behaviour.","[Buchholz, Wolfgang] Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany; [Buchholz, Wolfgang] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany; [Sandler, Todd] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",University of Regensburg; Ifo Institut; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Buchholz, W (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.;Buchholz, W (通讯作者)，CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany.",wolfgang.buchholz@ur.de; tsandler@utdallas.edu,,,"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF [RECAP 15 (FKZ 01LA1139A), ECCUITY (FKZ 01LA1104B)]; Vibhooti Shukla endowment at the University of Texas at Dallas",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Vibhooti Shukla endowment at the University of Texas at Dallas,"Wolfgang Buchholz gratefully acknowledges financial support from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF through the research projects RECAP 15 (FKZ 01LA1139A) and ECCUITY (FKZ 01LA1104B).

We measure diversity using indices of ethnic and linguistic fractionalization, and measure poverty using the multidimensional poverty index (MPI), multidimensional poverty headcount (MPH), intensity of deprivation, poverty gap, and poverty headcount ratio. We find that ethnic and linguistic fractionalization contributes to poverty levels. Specifically, after controlling for endogeneity, we find that a standard deviation increase in ethnic fractionalization is associated with a 0.32-, 0.44- and 0.53-standard deviation increase in the MPI, MPH and the intensity of deprivation, respectively. Moreover, a standard deviation increase in ethnic fractionalization is associated with between a 0.34- and 0.63-standard deviation increase in the population living below $1.90 and $3.10, the poverty gap at $1.90 and $3.10 a day and the headcount ratio at $1.90 and $3.10 a day. Similar results are also observed for linguistic fractionalization with standardized coefficients between 0.53 and 0.93.

In this paper we explore differences in economic outcomes between return migrant households and non-migrant households using panel data from Burundi, a country which experienced large-scale conflict-led emigration and massive post-war refugee return. We use proximity to the border for identification purposes. The results indicate that returnee households have significantly lower levels of livestock, which is the main form of capital accumulation in Burundi. Returnee households also report lower values of subjective economic well-being relative to other households. The gap between returnee and non-migrant households is driven by more recent returnees, defined as those that returned less than 10 years ago. Our search for channels suggests that returnees are more likely to engage in economic activities that are generally correlated with lower levels of livestock. One possible explanation for this dynamic relates to the legal restrictions on economic activities faced by returnees while in displacement, which resulted in high levels of inactivity abroad and a potential loss/deterioration of skills.

Thereby, we explore the performance of different burden sharing rules being implemented either endogenously or exogenously. In case of an endogenously implemented burden sharing rule, subjects vote for different burden sharing schemes either by unanimity or majority vote. Despite the fact that preferences for the allocation schemes differ among agents, most groups agree upon a common scheme, and consequently avoid an uncoordinated action. Our results reveal both the opportunities and risks of burden sharing negotiations. We find average efficiency levels to increase in case an agreement is reached. If groups however fail to agree upon a common rule, cooperation collapses and efficiency levels decrease compared to a voluntary contribution mechanism being exogenously imposed. Most importantly, agents who face a voting decision on average receive higher payoffs than agents in an exogenously implemented voluntary contribution mechanism and do not earn less than participants in any externally determined burden sharing rule.","[Gallier, Carlo; Kesternich, Martin; Sturm, Bodo] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Sturm, Bodo] Leipzig Univ Appl Sci, D-04277 Leipzig, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Kesternich, M (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",gallier@zew.de; kesternich@zew.de; bodo.sturm@htwk-leipzig.de,,"Gallier, Carlo/0000-0001-9098-1807",,,,,40,20,21,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The first entails a survey to a sample of Portuguese voters, who are randomly presented with a text providing factual information about the public pension system. The second surveys a sample of Portuguese University students, randomly presented with an alternative order of questions. We show that more literacy on the pension system has a positive impact on the individual willingness to support reforms. Given that public opinion is usually seen as an important deterrent of effective action by politicians and that the level of voters' literacy can be influenced by policy action, this analysis may provide useful insights to policy makers faced with the challenge of reforming existent pension systems. Our analysis also suggests that priming effects should not be ignored, given their impact in individuals in the extremes of the political spectrum.","[Gouveia, Ana Fontoura] Portuguese Minist Finance, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gouveia, Ana Fontoura] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Gouveia, AF (通讯作者)，Portuguese Minist Finance, Lisbon, Portugal.;Gouveia, AF (通讯作者)，Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",ana.gouveia@gpeari.min-financas.pt,,,Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia,Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This research was partially funded by Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (2012/2013).,,16,5,7,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Neoliberal Reforms, the State and Agrarian Change in Bangladesh",JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,partial proletarianization; agrarian reform; capital accumulation; green Revolution; modern rice farming; the state; Bangladesh,QUESTION; POLARIZATION; AGRICULTURE; PERSISTENCE; PRICE,This paper focuses on three decades of agrarian reform policies and the resulting peculiarity of the development trajectory in Bangladesh. I interrogate the ways in which the reforms have led to a paradoxical situation consisting of partial protelarianization in attempting to promote a market-based economy. I contend that the particular positioning of the state is central to understanding this dialectic between proletarianization and the persistence of small peasants amid a huge rush towards the formation of a capitalist market economy. I conclude that the partial nature of agrarian transformation that we now experience in Bangladesh may not be resolved in favour of a complete proletarianization of small peasants in the foreseeable future.,"[Misra, Manoj] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept UPEACE, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Misra, M (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept UPEACE, Seoul, South Korea.",manoj.dhk@gmail.com,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,"This work was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund would like to thank Sourayan Mookerjea, Dip Kapoor, Ken Caine, Marcus Taylor and Rob Aitken for their helpful suggestions on earlier drafts of this paper.

Using a data set of largely exogenous legal changes, we find that certain takeover laws, such as poison pill and business combination laws, have no discernible impact on hostile activity, while others such as fair price laws have reduced hostile takeovers. We construct a Takeover Index from the laws and find that higher takeover protection is associated with lower firm value, consistent with entrenchment and agency costs. However, conditional on a bid, firms with more protection achieve higher premiums, consistent with increased bargaining power. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from Italian banks,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bank regulation; Interest rate risk; Monte Carlo simulations; Historical simulations; Backtesting,FINANCIAL STABILITY; MONETARY-POLICY,"This paper contributes to prior literature and to the current debate concerning recent revisions of the regulatory approach to measuring bank exposure to interest rate risk in the banking book by focusing on assessment of the appropriate amount of capital banks should set aside against this specific risk. We first discuss how banks might develop internal measurement systems to model changes in interest rates and measure their exposure to interest rate risk that are more refined and effective than are regulatory methodologies. We then develop a backtesting framework to test the consistency of methodology results with actual bank risk exposure. Using a representative sample of Italian banks between 2006 and 2013, our empirical analysis supports the need to improve the standardized shock currently enforced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It also provides useful insights for properly measuring the amount of capital to cover interest rate risk that is sufficient to ensure both financial system functioning and banking stability.

We simulate household wealth dynamics based on rich panel and experimental data. The bifurcated livestock dynamics associated with the poverty trap gives rise to insurance valuation that is highly nonlinear in herd size. Estimated willingness to pay among vulnerable groups who most need insurance is, on average, lower than commercially viable rates. Targeted premium subsidization nonetheless appears to offer more cost-effective poverty reduction than need-based direct transfers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome this limitation, one can use a non-concave metafrontier approach that is based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to calculate the techno-economic efficiency and Technological Gap Ratios (TGRs) with non-homogeneous technologies for airports across countries and with different ownerships. The previous studies mainly applied DEA to measure the operational efficiency of airports. Our results indicate that privately owned airports have better technical efficiency than public ones. In addition, our empirical analysis shows that public airports in the Asia-Pacific area have the lowest techno-economic efficiency.","[Chen, Ying-Hsiu] Yuanpei Univ Med Technol, Dept Food & Beverage Management, 306 Yuanpei St, Hsinchu 30015, Taiwan; [Lai, Po -Lin] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Logist, 84 Heuksuk Ro, Seoul 156756, South Korea; [Piboonrungroj, Pairach] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Econ, 239 HuayKaew Rd, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand",Chung Ang University; Chiang Mai University,"Lai, PL (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Logist, 84 Heuksuk Ro, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",yhchen@mail.ypu.edu.tw; Polin@cau.ac.kr; me@pairach.com,"Piboonrungroj, Pairach/B-4936-2012","Chen, Ying-Hsiu/0000-0002-2938-1500; Lai, Po-Lin/0000-0001-5940-864X",,,,,58,27,29,0,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

This paper is the first to study the impact of changing tax prices on local fiscal outcomes while allowing for local heterogeneity in tax incentives at the county level. Exploiting variation at the county level yields a more elastic relationship between tax price and local spending than using coarser units of observation. Simulations suggest that limiting the deduction for state and local taxes would not disproportionately hurt resource poor areas, making such limits potentially progressive policy options.","[Coyne, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Coyne, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dcoyne@ucsd.edu,,"Coyne, David/0000-0003-3652-7165",,,,,29,0,0,0,8,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

However, results accuracy crucially depends on methodological and empirical considerations such as: i) presence of spatial latent component (spatial autocorrelation); ii) temporal breaks related to different periods over which the infrastructure is built; and iii) heterogeneity of the effect along the line and stations. This paper aims to assess the impact of Montreal's metro extension to the suburb city of Laval (announced in 1998 and started operating in 2007). A spatial difference-in-difference (SDID) estimator based on a repeated sales approach is used to isolate the impact of the proximity to the new infrastructure on single-family house prices depending on the implementation phases and the stations. The results suggest that among the three new infrastructures, only one shows a positive impact of proximity after the first operation of the transit service. The study results tend to relativize the sometimes high expectations in terms of economic impacts of such a project, at least for residential properties.","[Devaux, Nicolas] Univ Quebec, Dept Soc Terr & Dev, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Dube, Jean] Univ Laval, Ecole Super Amenagement & Dev, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Apparicio, Philippe] INRS, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; Laval University; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS),"Devaux, N (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Soc Terr & Dev, Rimouski, PQ, Canada.",Nicolas.Devaux@uqar.ca; jean.dube@esad.ulaval.ca; Philippe.apparicio@ucs.inrs.ca,"Dubé, Jean/L-1751-2019; Apparicio, Philippe/K-6086-2013","Dubé, Jean/0000-0003-3445-3449; Apparicio, Philippe/0000-0001-6466-9342",,,,,75,31,34,3,58,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We postulate that the positive basis observed at maturity stems from the futures holder's timing options to exercise the shipping certificate delivery item and subsequently liquidate the physical grain. In our proposed approach, we incorporate stochastic spot price and storage cost, and solve an optimal double stopping problem to give the optimal strategies to exercise and liquidate the grain. Our new models for stochastic storage rates lead to explicit no-arbitrage prices for the shipping certificate and associated futures contract. We calibrate our models to empirical futures data during the periods of observed non-convergence, and illustrate the premium generated by the shipping certificate.","[Guo, Kevin] Columbia Univ, Ind Engn & Operat Res Dept, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Leung, Tim] Univ Washington, Dept Appl Math, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Columbia University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Leung, T (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Appl Math, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",klg2138@columbia.edu; timleung@uw.edu,"Leung, Tim/O-5649-2019","Leung, Tim/0000-0002-0023-6289",,,,,27,4,5,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

As an important piece of out-of-sample evidence, we document that investor sentiment in China is a reliable momentum signal at monthly frequency. The strong momentum predictability is robust under both single-and multi-regressor settings, and is statistically and economically significant both in and out of sample, enhancing portfolio performance as shown by our numerical examples. More importantly, we find a striking term structure that local sentiment shifts from a short-term momentum predictor to a contrarian predictor in the long run. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that sentiment is more of a small-firm effect. Finally, we confirm that global sentiment spills over to the local Chinese market, as it predicts negatively future returns over the longer horizons and in the cross section.","[Han, Xing] Univ Otago, Dept Accountancy & Finance, 60 Clyde St, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Han, Xing] Univ Ghent, Dept Financial Econ, Sint Pieterspl 5, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Li, Youwei] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, 185 Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland",University of Otago; Ghent University; Queens University Belfast,"Han, X (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Accountancy & Finance, 60 Clyde St, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand.;Han, X (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Financial Econ, Sint Pieterspl 5, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",xing.han@otago.ac.nz; y.li@qub.ac.uk,"Li, Youwei/K-1898-2014; Han, Xing/AAN-4618-2020","Li, Youwei/0000-0002-2142-7607; Han, Xing/0000-0002-9895-4026",Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO Research Fund Flanders); National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571197],Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO Research Fund Flanders); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are grateful to an anonymous referee, Peter Erdos, Gerdie Everaert, Daniel Ferreira (Editor), Michael Frommel, Xuezhong He, Kai Li, Alexander Mende, Dagfinn Rime, Lei Shi, Joris Wauters, and seminar participants at the 2015 annual conference of the European Economics and Finance Society (Brussels), the 2015 joint conference on Institutional Investors and Emerging Market Finance (Ghent), the 2016 annual conference of the Royal Economics Society (Brighton), the 2016 Spring Meeting of Young Economists (Lisbon), the 2016 workshop on Asia and Pacific Economies by Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University & Asian Development Bank Institute (Suzhou), the 2016 FMA annual conference (Las Vegas), the 2016 Auckland Finance Meeting (Auckland), the Inaugural Workshop on the Complex Information & Financial Market Dynamics by Tianjin University (Tianjin), IESEG School of Management (Lille), University of Technology Sydney (Sydney), and ShanghaiTech University (Shanghai) for their detailed comments and suggestions.

The recommendations recognize that SP results may be used and reused (benefit transfers) by governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations, and that all such applications must be considered. The intended result is a set of guidelines for SP studies that is more comprehensive than that of the original National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Blue Ribbon Panel on contingent valuation, is more germane to contemporary applications, and reflects the two decades of research since that time. We also distinguish between practices for which accumulated research is sufficient to support recommendations and those for which greater uncertainty remains. The goal of this article is to raise the quality of SP studies used to support decision making and promote research that will further enhance the practice of these studies worldwide.","[Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Boyle, Kevin J.] Virginia Tech Program Real Estate, 430A Bishop Favrao Hall 0715,1345 Perry St, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Adamowicz, Wiktor (Vic)] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G2H1, Canada; [Bennett, Jeff] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Brouwer, Roy] Univ Waterloo, Water Inst, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Cameron, Trudy Ann] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 435 Prince Lucien Campbell Hall,1285, Eugene, OR USA; [Hanemann, W.

Developing and making drought tolerant maize varieties available to farmers in the region has thus long been a key goal on the regional development agenda. Farm-level adoption of these varieties, however, depends on local perceptions of the value they add, along with willingness to pay (WTP) for it. Focusing on Zimbabwe, this research aimed at estimating the implicit prices farmers are willing to pay for drought tolerance in maize compared to other preferred traits. Using a choice experiment framework, we generated 12,600 observations from a random sample of 1,400 households in communal areas within 14 districts of Zimbabwe. Taste parameters and heterogeneities were estimated using the generalized multinomial logit model (G-MNL). The results reveal drought tolerance, grain yield, covered cob tip, cob size, and semi-flint texture to be the most preferred traits by farm households in Zimbabwe. The WTP estimates show that farmers are willing to pay a premium for drought tolerance equal to 2.56, 7, 3.2, and 5 times higher than for an additional ton of yield per acre, bigger cob size, larger grain size, and covered cob tip, respectively. We suggest designing and implementing innovative ways of promoting DT maize along with awareness-raising activities to enhance contextual understandings of drought and drought risk to speed adoption of new DT maize varieties by risk-prone farming communities. Given the high level of rural literacy and the high rate of adoption of improved maize, trait-based promotion and marketing of varieties constitutes the right strategy. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

In the 1990s, the enforcement of the policy became less stringent, and ultrasound technologies, which enable prenatal gender selection, became more available. This led us to believe that the girls who were born were wanted by parents. In addition, growing income and industrialization should also narrow the gender gap in health status. Our results showed that on average, being a female decreased height-for-age approximately by 0.08 z-score as well as having an additional male sibling decreased height-for-age roughly by 0.17 z-score for a child under age 8. These results were particularly strong in the rural area but were non-existent in urban areas and among only-children. Our argument is that the gender gap was due to son preference and not sibling rivalry. Additionally, we found that having only one brother appeared to have a positive effect on girls' health status, compared to boys with another brother who tended to become rivals for household resources.","[Kubo, Mayumi; Chaudhuri, Anoshua] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Econ, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Chaudhuri, A (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Dept Econ, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",anoshua@sfsu.edu,,,,,,,33,8,9,2,21,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Yet, voluntary demand from people has been low, shedding doubt on the viability of microinsurance as a useful risk management tool. To better understand this puzzle, this paper reviews both the theoretical and empirical literature on the demand for insurance. While people's lack of understanding of insurance does seem to limit the demand for it, several more fundamental factors, such as price, quality, limited trust in the insurer, and liquidity constraints also seem to have an important role in explaining the puzzle.

Predicting their welfare impacts before their establishment could help with the design of compensation schemes. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are increasingly used for ex ante evaluations but their validity is largely untested in low-income settings. Using a case study of a new REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) project in eastern Madagascar, we explore the validity of DCEs in two ways: (i) whether the estimates of welfare costs derived from DCE are affected by respondents' prior experience of conservation (ii) whether DCE results have high theoretical and content validity. We surveyed households who have varying degrees of experience of restrictions to swidden agriculture. We also qualitatively debriefed a sub-sample of respondents to better understand their thought processes. Latent class analysis shows that DCE outcomes vary with conservation experience. Households more experienced with forest protection are less willing to trade-off rights to clear forest for swidden agriculture with any compensatory interventions whereas less experienced households highly favor support for alternative agricultural techniques and a secure right to clear one hectare of forest. Although the results show apparent non-attendance to some attributes (e.g., cash payments), qualitative debriefings suggest that respondents infact do expect relatively low or no utility from the given attributes and hence have theoretically valid preferences. Similarly, the DCE has generally high content validity. Although DCE can elicit current preferences in this context, using ex ante DCE to estimate the welfare costs of such a long-term intervention requires caution. We conclude that it is difficult to robustly estimate compensation in advance of an intervention, there is therefore a need to rethink conservation approaches, and the feasibility of achieving fair compensations for conservation-imposed restrictions.

The empirical decomposition is based on a sample of 1530 banks operating in 88 countries over the period 1999-2011. We find that the net effect of financial liberalization on bank TFP growth is positive: the direct positive effect outweighs the negative one.

Using the 2013/14 nationally representative smallholder and commercial farm surveys, we find that (i) for most crops commercial farms' yields are higher than smallholders', with a peak in the 10-20-ha bracket; (ii) commercial farms create few permanent jobs (with just one permanent job per 20 ha) and use only 55% of the land transferred to them; and (iii) after a peak in 2008, formation of new commercial farms is down to the pre-2007 levels. These findings imply that having reliable data on commercial farms, collected on regular intervals, could generate feedback loops for policy formulation and also provide vital information to assess and take regulatory actions aimed at improving the performance and attracting higher levels of investment to the sector.

We analyze the effects of Hezbollah's massive surprise rocket attack against northern Israel during the 2006 Second Lebanon War and the continued threat posed by the organization's expanding rocket arsenal on the housing market, the labor market and patterns of migration flows and sorting. Relying on hedonic and repeat sales approaches and using a difference-in-differences identification strategy for 2000-2012, we show that the attack led to a 6-7% decline in house prices and rents in the most severely hit localities relative to other localities in northern Israel. These effects persisted until 2012, suggesting that the public continued to view the rocket threat as credible. In contrast, we find practically no effect on labor market conditions, migration flows and sorting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We begin by incorporating within and cross-industry spillovers into a dynamic spatial equilibrium model in order to obtain a panel data estimating equation. This gives us a framework for measuring a rich set of agglomeration forces while controlling for a variety of potentially confounding effects. We apply this estimation strategy to detailed new data describing the industry composition of 31 English cities from 1851 to 1911. Our results show that industries grew more rapidly in cities where they had more local suppliers or other occupationally similar industries. We find no evidence of dynamic within-industry effects, i.e., industries generally did not grow more rapidly in cities in which they were already large. Once we control for these agglomeration forces, we find evidence of strong dynamic congestion forces related to city size. We also show how to construct estimates of the combined strength of the many agglomeration forces in our model. These results suggest a lower bound estimate of the strength of agglomeration forces equivalent to a city-size divergence rate of 1.6-2.3% per decade. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Biopolitics is used as a theoretical framework to demonstrate how these programs can constitute tools of governance and forms of domination, independent of their success or failure. We explain why, in the case of Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta, access to sustainable WSS remains highly unequal and problematic. We draw on qualitative and quantitative social and health data collected during a ten-month fieldwork period. Our study identifies false narratives of WSS success based on portrayals of rurality and poverty as backward and miasmatic; misleading reporting tactics of local cadres; and misplaced faith in technical indicators. These success narratives legitimize the Vietnamese state as a triumphant bearer of high modernity while obscuring the needs and desires of those at risk of disease. We argue that interrogating power/knowledge imbalances on both micro and macro scales can help unravel the nature of persisting problems in WSS coverage. A focus on power/knowledge helps to dispel notions that improving WSS facilities is enough to prevent diarrhea. A health-promoting WSS sector, we conclude, needs to be context-specific, embracing local culture and having social equity at its core. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Results from partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) show these sophisticated types of usage are interrelated in such a way that routinization and infusion (a) fully mediate the effect of frequency of use on social integration; and (b) exert significant influences on social integration, as an active sense of belongingness to a social network site.

This has not only promoted the exports of capital and intermediate goods of other East Asian economies, but it has also deepened the regional production networks under the US-dominated global economic system. Currently, as China is entering an economic new normal, its economic structure and growth pattern will experience a period of transition. Thus, its role in the East Asian economy and the global economic system will change accordingly. China's new role as a main market for the final consumer goods in the region might increase. To facilitate its change in role, China should continue to reform its domestic economy, develop regional economic cooperation, and increase the qualities of its labour force and foreign direct investment inflows.

In a context of ambitious entrepreneurship, we consider three quality aspects of early-stage entrepreneurship referring to innovativeness, export orientation, and high-growth intentions of entrepreneurs. Using microlevel data retrieved from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) annual surveys, we investigate whether the role of gender, education, opportunity perception, and motives of early-stage entrepreneurs changes between crisis and noncrisis periods. Our results show that the perception of business opportunities has a particularly pronounced effect on high-quality entrepreneurship in adverse economic conditions. We also find that the beneficial effects of educational attainment on growth intentions strengthen in times of crisis. Finally, the gender effect on entrepreneurs' high-growth intentions and export orientation appears to be stronger in the crisis period, implying that ambitious female entrepreneurship suffers more in the midst of crisis.","[Giotopoulos, Ioannis] Univ Peloponnese, Sch Econ Management & Informat, Dept Econ, Tripoli 22100, Greece; [Kontolaimou, Alexandra] Ctr Planning & Econ Res KEPE, 11 Amerikis St, Athens 10672, Greece; [Tsakanikas, Aggelos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Ind & Energy Econ, Dept Chem Engn, 9 Heroon Polytech,Zografou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece",University of Peloponnese; National Technical University of Athens,"Tsakanikas, A (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Lab Ind & Energy Econ, Dept Chem Engn, 9 Heroon Polytech,Zografou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece.",giotopoulos@uop.gr; alexandra.kontolaimou@kepe.gr; atsaka@central.ntua.gr,"Kontolaimou, Alexandra/AAS-9110-2020; Giotopoulos, Ioannis/AAM-5607-2021","Giotopoulos, Ioannis/0000-0002-9491-5505; Tsakanikas, Aggelos/0000-0002-9734-3354",,,,,104,60,65,8,82,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This analysis can be performed for separate segments, for example, the market for transshipment service or the market for main-haulage service. However, due to the multistage characteristic of IFT service, the segmental analysis gives an incomplete view of the IFT market at the network level. In a previous paper (Saeedi et al., 2017), we present the Intermodal Freight Transport Market Structure (IFTMS) model to conduct a network-based study of the IFTMS in which distinctive actors (i.e., pre/post haulage operators, terminals, rail/barge operators, transport chains, and corridors) are competing at different levels inside distinctive markets to deliver an integrated IFT service. There are two main challenges in the application of IFTMS model in real cases, for example, the European IFT network. First, the definition of the geographical and spatial border of the transshipment market areas is needed to determine which actors are potentially competing for a specific service demand. The second challenge is the lack of disaggregated data and the consistency of existing data in nodes (i.e., the transshipment areas) and links (i.e., the rail and barge operators). To cope with these challenges, we develop a four-step methodology in which a model-based approach is used to define the geographic boundaries of the transshipment submarkets and provide detailed and consistent data for market analysis. We also apply the IFTMS model to study the market structure of European intermodal network. Our analysis shows that the majority of transshipment markets as well as main-haulage markets are highly concentrated markets. The corridor markets - which include the IFT chains - are unconcentrated markets. Furthermore, the majority of corridors in the European Union are inside highly concentrated origin-destination markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It uses a dataset of 65 crisis episodes since 1980 and considers both the direct budgetary cost of government intervention and the overall fiscal impact as proxied by changes in the public debt-to-GDP ratio. We find that both direct and overall fiscal impacts of banking crises are high when countries enter the crisis with large banking sectors, rely on excessive external funding, have highly leveraged non-financial private sectors, and resort to using government guarantees on bank liabilities during the crisis. Better quality of banking supervision and higher coverage of deposit insurance help, however, alleviate the direct fiscal costs. We also identify a policy trade-off: costly short-term interventions are not necessarily associated with larger increases in public debt, supporting the thesis that immediate intervention may actually be a more cost-effective solution over the long term.","[Amaglobeli, David; End, Nicolas; Jarmuzek, Mariusz; Palomba, Geremia] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"End, N (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",nend@imf.org,,,,,,,39,7,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Focusing on peripheral countries, we study how uncertainty over the consequences of a possible exit affects regime switches. Applying game theory and a cost-benefit analysis, we model a regime switch as the endogenous result of a two-stage policy game. We find that the effects of uncertainty are not trivial. Unilateral exits are less probable, but contagion is more likely to be observed. Our results are driven by two opposite forces: a traditional conservative effect induced by policy uncertainty in a single policymaker framework, which calls for more stability, and a strategic effect, arising from the strategic interaction, which may undermine the monetary union's foundation and strengthen incentives for contagion.

By employing an ordered scale of children's self-rated health, we found that children with international migrant parents who are divorced/separated are less likely than children in non-migrant families to have good health. The magnitude of the effects are higher in Nigeria, attesting for a greater vulnerability of Nigerian children in divorced migrant families.

The empirical analysis employs linear factor methodology with a factor structure including market return and macroeconomic factors. The results show that the risk premia on inflation, term spread, industrial production, and housing factors are significant. Further, business sales is a useful conditioning factor that drives variation in market betas. These extracted macroeconomic factors provide information that is not fully captured by Fama and French's (2015) investment and profitability factors.","[Lai, Ya-Wen] Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Finance, 64 Wunhua Rd, Huwei Township 632, Yunlin, Taiwan",National Formosa University,"Lai, YW (通讯作者)，Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Finance, 64 Wunhua Rd, Huwei Township 632, Yunlin, Taiwan.",yawenlai15@gmail.com,,"Lai, Ya-Wen/0000-0002-2480-0630",,,,,57,8,8,0,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

This paper estimates the corresponding income effect on maternal labor supply. December mothers have a lower probability of working, particularly in the third month after a childs birth, and we find some evidence that child-related tax benefits reduce maternal earnings.","[Wingender, Philippe] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [LaLumia, Sara] Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",International Monetary Fund; Williams College,"Wingender, P (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",PWingender@imf.org; Sara.Lalumia@williams.edu,,,,,,,48,4,10,1,13,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Using highly disaggregated 8-digit import data in a theoretically grounded gravity model framework, we define an explicit measure of preferential tariff margins and use that to estimate sector-specific elasticities. From the methodological point of view, we show that the assessment of these policies' impacts is very sensitive to the definition of the preferential tariff margin. An important by-product of our procedures is that they can be used to obtain estimates of trade elasticities of substitution, some of the most important parameters in the international trade empirical literature. Results show that actual preferential schemes or possible future policies, such as the transatlantic trade agreement between the USA and the EU (TTIP), have a significant impact on trade volumes, with large differences across sectors.","[Cipollina, Maria] Univ Molise, Dipartimento EGSI, Via De Sanctis, I-86100 Campobasso, Italy; [Debucquet, David Laborde] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Salvatici, Luca] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Econ, Rome, Italy; [Salvatici, Luca] Univ Roma Tre, Ctr Rossi Doria, Rome, Italy",University of Molise; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Roma Tre University; Roma Tre University,"Cipollina, M (通讯作者)，Univ Molise, Dipartimento EGSI, Via De Sanctis, I-86100 Campobasso, Italy.",cipollina@unimol.it; D.Laborde@cgiar.org; luca.salvatici@uniroma3.it,"Salvatici, Luca/H-4545-2019; Cipollina, Maria/A-9809-2016","Salvatici, Luca/0000-0003-1791-1663; Cipollina, Maria/0000-0002-1454-4039","European Union [290,693]",European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported by the European Union's Seventh Framework program FP7/2007-2011 [Grant Number 290,693] FOODSECURE-Exploring the Future of Global Food and Nutrition Security, the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM) led by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the AGRODEP Consortium.

While 50.41% of 1-share trades result from broken orders, 34.89% of 1-share trades are intentional. We provide substantial evidence that traders use 1-share trades to ping for hidden liquidity. In particular, our results indicate that 1-share trades are disproportionately aggressive and also execute against hidden liquidity more than any other odd lot trade size. We also find a relative increase in trading immediately following a 1-share trade. Our results are in line with Clark-Joseph (2014), who suggests that traders may use small, unprofitable trades to detect information from other traders. Specifically, 1-share trades represent the minimum cash outlay necessary to trade, while simultaneously producing the smallest possible effects on a market maker's inventory, and in turn, a security's price.

The empirical findings are based on 70 responses from agribusinesses in Slovak Republic. To measure the adopting of quality management approach the MBNQA model was used. The authors have used linear regression as an evaluation method. Based on the results it can be concluded the adopting of quality management approach is determined by ownership. The enterprises owned by the owner from abroad adopt the quality management approach more readily than the domestic ones. The size of the enterprise and type of production do not determine the adopting of quality management approach in the agricultural enterprises in the Slovak Republic.

The send-down program resettled over 16 million urban youths to the countryside to carry out hard manual labor over the years 1968-78. Most of them were allowed to return to urban areas when the Cultural Revolution ended. To estimate the long-term impacts of the send-down experience, we compare the outcomes of individuals with send-down experience to those of individuals without send-down experience but having similar characteristics and family backgrounds during the send down period. We conduct primarily OLS estimates with a careful sample selection. We find that those who had the send-down experience have worse marriage outcomes, lower-quality social networks, and a lower level of happiness than non-send-downs. The negative effects of the forced migration are robust against regression methods and various model specifications. Our study adds to the growing literature in economics that seeks to evaluate the impact of forced migration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The first generation of trade regulation scholars asked whether high levels of exports influenced regulatory standards of exporting countries, with inconclusive results. The second generation of scholarship focused not on how much a country exported but to whom it exported, identifying a California Effect by which firms and consumers in (mostly developed) importing countries projected their high regulatory standards on less developed export partners. Structural change especially the rise of China as a major importer poses a challenge to these optimistic findings. Drawing on insights from the analysis of compositional data, this paper introduces a third generation of trade regulation research, which suggests examining not only with whom a country trades, but also how the composition of markets in a country's export basket reshuffles over time. Specifically, we explore the possibility of a Shanghai Effect whereby African countries begin to reflect the lower labor standards of China, which has emerged as a major destination for their exports. We show that when a country increases exports to China, the net effect on domestic labor standards depends critically on the labor practices of other export destinations compositionally displaced by China exports. Our analysis of a panel of 49 African countries for the period 1985-2010 produces a small continent-wide estimate of China's negative influence on African labor practices. In-sample simulation at the country level uncovers a moderate Shanghai Effect for a handful of countries only. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper tests this hypothesis in urban Ethiopia. We exploit a unique panel of monthly price and wage data from 111 urban markets to first construct welfare-relevant measures of real wages, before employing various panel estimators to formally test wage-food price integration. We find moderate rates of long-run adjustment to increases in food prices, but that adjustment is very slow.

ECB/Eurosystem staff projections database is utilized in order to estimate the rule. The advantage of using this database is demonstrated by comparing the results of econometric estimation utilizing these data on projections with the results obtained by popular method of using future values as proxies for expectations. This popular method is shown to be inadequate in this paper not only by econometric verification of alternative forms of the estimated reaction function. Its inadequacy is demonstrated also by analyzing statistical properties of the time series and by showing that standard econometric assumptions do not hold when using future values as proxies for expectations. It is further shown that current values are more suitable proxies for expectations than values actually observed in the future. This fact provides an answer to the question analyzed recently by Arlt, Mandel (2012), (2014) who investigated how is it possible that simple backwardlooking rules perform extremely well when describing forward-looking behavior of central banks.","[Cizek, Ondrej] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cízek, O (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic.",ondrej.cizek@vse.cz,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

According to Massolution report, the global CF industry reached $34.4 billion in 2015. Crowdfunding involves the consumer in financially way and by doing so maximizes the involvement of consumers in the process of value co-creation. The literature confirms that the crowd participate in fundraising for reasons beyond the benefits they may accrue as individuals, therefore crowdfunding platforms can be seen as an authentic expression of community. So promoting active citizenship, strengthening of communities and meeting public need in service delivery, crowdfunding creates an opportunity to convert social capital into economic and/or political capital. Most of the literature investigate critical factors positively correlated to the success in crowdfunding as: the participation of the entrepreneurs' friends and family in fundraising, signals of quality, project duration etc. Surprisingly, few scholars analysed the importance of territory and relationship between territory and crowdfunding. Thus, the research question of this study is: can the territorial capital influence the co creation of value by crowdfunding? An exploratory research is performed in order to answer to such question. The empirical analysis is conducted on Produzioni dal Basso platform, which it is one of the first CF platforms born in Europe. We took into consideration projects over a time period 2011-2014. The results demonstrate a relationship between co creation of value through crowdfunding and some variables of territorial capital. The originality of our analysis is the exploration of the geographically bound determinants of successful crowdfunding in opposing to the major works of academic literature.","[Cucari, Nicola; Nuhu, Kejda] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Management, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Cucari, N (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Management, Rome, Italy.",nicola.cucari@uniroma1.it; kejda.nuhu@uniroma1.it,"CUCARI, Nicola/AGN-5756-2022; Cucari, Nicola/AAR-8306-2021","CUCARI, Nicola/0000-0002-8177-7764; Cucari, Nicola/0000-0002-8177-7764",,,,,50,4,4,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,71,79,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000010,0

This paper uses the Constant Market Share (CMS) methodology, which enables one to analyse export changes in order to quantify the competitiveness factor, and its separation into general or specified competitiveness. This analysis is performed for two periods - 2002-2007 and 2008-2013 - in order to test if the 2007-2008 global economic and financial crisis had a significant impact on the South African pear trade. Thus, the main objective of this work is to investigate if SA lost competitiveness during these years in relation to its competitors. The results show evidence that, before the global economic and financial crisis, the structural effect of the SA exports contributed most to the sales growth of pears to the EU, and a general competitiveness effect contributed to a lesser extent. After the crisis, exports continued to grow but at a slower rate, and that the composition of the contribution to the sales growth to the EU changed completely. From 2007 onwards, specified competitiveness was the main contributor to the export growth of SA pears, even counteracting the negative, post-crisis impact suffered by the the exports' structural effect.","[De Pablo Valenciano, Jaime] Univ Almeria, Econ, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Capobianco Uriarte, Maria Mercedes] Univ Almeria, Almeria, Spain; [Giacinti Battistuzzi, Miguel Angel] Gabinete MAG, Neuquen, Argentina",Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Almeria,"De Pablo Valenciano, J (通讯作者)，Univ Almeria, Econ, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain.",jdepablo@ual.es,"de Pablo Valenciano, Jaime/T-1455-2019; DE+PABLO+VALENCIANO, JAIME/ABA-6206-2021","de Pablo Valenciano, Jaime/0000-0002-9451-8956;",,,,,34,1,1,1,8,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,2,,,,,191,204,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1297723,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EW9IJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402831700008,0

Using coffee price data from 1998-2013 and applying a bounds test approach and Toda-Yamamoto Granger causality test, the study finds that the establishment of ECX has strengthened regional integration rather than a national harmony between producer markets. We also find evidence that, since the establishment of ECX, an opportunity was created for high quality coffee to dominate price formation while also allowing lower quality coffee producing areas to establish themselves.

Special emphasis is placed on participation rates by category of debt (the extensive margin), volume borrowed (the intensive margin), and default behavior. Key findings include that between 1999 and 2013 the fraction of individuals with only unsecured (e.g., credit card) debt decreased, as did their balances. In addition, most forms of private debt (mortgages, credit card debt, and auto loans) had significant boom-bust cycles, but the effects across generations have been very asymmetric.","[Garriga, Carlos; Noeth, Bryan; Schlagenhauf, Don E.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Garriga, C (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Garriga, Carlos/I-5744-2016","Garriga, Carlos/0000-0003-0961-1986",,,,,25,3,3,0,5,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

We applied random-effects probit and tobit models in our regression analysis which revealed that flows of Czech aid to individual developing countries are determined by variety of factors. Czech interests and mutual relations were mostly identified as statistically significant determinants, namely export: volumes, closer historical relations and geographical proximity. The presence of Czech embassy in a country was not confirmed as a significant factor. The reflection of recipients' needs in Czech aid selection and allocation is rather ambiguous. While Czech aid flows depend positively on total population and negatively on per capita income of recipient countries, they are positively influenced by the recipients' level of social development. Similarly, the Czech Republic tends to give (more) aid to more democratic and freer countries with lower institutional quality.","[Harmacek, Jaromir; Syrovatka, Miroslav; Oprsal, Zdenek] Univ Palackeho Olomouci, Prirodovedecka Fak, Olomouc, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,"Harmacek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Palackeho Olomouci, Prirodovedecka Fak, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",jaromir.harmacek@upol.cz; miroslay.syrovatka@upol.cz; zdenek.oprsal@upol.cz,"HARMÁČEK, Jaromír/IWV-3110-2023; Syrovátka, Miroslav/B-6427-2018","HARMÁČEK, Jaromír/0000-0002-3711-0663; Syrovátka, Miroslav/0000-0003-0409-4182; Oprsal, Zdenek/0000-0003-4716-2114",,,,,44,13,13,0,15,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We consider this reform to be very extensive and controversial. It was connected with a lot of problems, some of them were in policy making process, and others of them were during implementation of the reform. Currently, there is an intense debate on involvement of public employees into policy design and implementation. We assume that without their involvement they have difficulty in identifying with new policies, which can lead to policy failure. Therefore we concentrate on public professionals (their opinions, perceptions, feelings) using the concept of policy alienation. (Tummers et al., 2009 and 2012; Tummers, 2012 and 2013) Policy alienation consists of two major dimensions, policy powerlessness a policy meaninglessness that are further divided into five dimensions: strategic powerlessness, tactical powerlessness, operational powerlessness, societal meaninglessness and client meaninglessness. In this article we explore hypothesis that employees that had not been involved in the design and implementation of the reform might suffer display feelings of policy alienation. Our research is based on quantitative methodology and we use a reliable and validated policy alienation scale (Tummers, 2012). Because we assume that there is a relation between policy alienation and job satisfaction we use validated job satisfaction scale.

Therefore, technical indices of fossil raw materials, materials from nature, and waste deposits were evaluated in modified Boston Matrix. Repayment of investments into HVO technology is better than maintaining facilities producing FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) or purchase of diesel from global markets. FAME and diesel were considered as substitutes, while vegetable oil, biodimethyl ether, biodiethyleter and synthetic diesel as alternatives to HVO. HVO is saving GHG and producing protein for feed if nitrogen rich raw materials as oilseed rape are processed. The feed proteins are by-product of biofuel production as EU it is 80% dependent on import of soy meal. Negative EU feed protein balance and better fuel quality will stimulate investors to replace FAME by HVO technology.","[Honig, Vladimir] Univ Econ, Dept Strategy, Fac Business Adm, W Churchill Sq, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Linhart, Zdenek] Univ Econ & Management, Dept Mkt, Narozni 2600-9A, Prague 5, Czech Republic; [Prochazka, Petr] CULS Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hönig, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Strategy, Fac Business Adm, W Churchill Sq, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",vladimir.honig@vse.cz; zdenek.linhart@vsem.cz; pprochazka@pef.czu.cz,"Linhart, Zdeněk/AAG-6391-2020; Hönig, Vladimír/AAU-8253-2021; Prochazka, Petr/H-6918-2018","Hönig, Vladimír/0000-0003-1377-645X; Prochazka, Petr/0000-0002-3292-7930","project IGA University of Economics, Prague [F3/19/2016]","project IGA University of Economics, Prague","The paper was created with the grant support project IGA University of Economics, Prague F3/19/2016 - Economic efficiency of biofuels from waste materials",,16,2,2,1,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,109,115,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400014,0

Accordingly, the interest of clients in this crypto currency is growing around the world together with the domain of their application. It is the analysis of possibilities and limitations of the use of digital money, as potentially new currency of modern society that the subject of this research paper is based on. Bearing in mind that digital money is still not accepted as a relevant payment instrument, the basic problem of the paper is to determine the link between the development of the world countries and the speed of implementation of digital money in the payment system in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The aim is to discover the existing level, but also predict future spheres of digital money application. In order to obtain adequate research results, scientific methods of analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, and comparison were used in the research to predict the future domains of the use of crypto currencies. Subsequently, general conclusions about the potential of Serbia as an area for the application of digital currencies are drawn, based on the comparison of the use of these currencies on a global scale. The research results aim to raise awareness of the application of digital currencies, which define the frameworks of the new economy at the global level.

Ongoing discussions on procedures and consequences of secession from European integrations intensified especially during the Greek crisis in 2015 and after the referendum in United Kingdom in June 2016. The focus of the paper is on Eurosceptic attitudes in European Unions' new member states that are confronting the benefits of switching to euro and secession tendencies at the same time. Analyses in the paper are based on Eurobarometer reports on euro introduction in NMS, considering questions that reflect the fears of losing control over national economic policy and perception of euro introduction.

The digital economy has a substantial effect on our lifestyle: the costs of information dissemination, communication, and various other processes have vanished entirely, increasing the pressure on deflation. The digital technologies play a decisive role in the growth of the European economy. One of the goals of the European Union is to create a common digital market. Whereas at the beginning of 2000s it was considered that the digital economy consists mainly in e-business infrastructure (hardware, software, telecommunications, networks, human capital, etc.), e-business (form of entrepreneurship), and e-commerce (Mesenbourg, 2001), now their borders are blurred and the concept itself has acquired a more complex meaning (Imlah, 2013). The digital economy comprises all goods and services which include digital technologies as an essential component, which is in turn ensured by the information and communication technology (ICT) sector of economy. The study aims to analyze the main business activity indicators of ICT businesses in Latvia in comparison to other EU countries and in the EU for the period of 2008 to 2015.

As a starting point, the author offers an analogous comparison of changes within the concept of governance, which is built on a shift from a classical vertical hierarchy in institutions towards networking and asymmetric relationships. As well, the similar process, but with pathological consequences, is observed in systemic corruption environment. The aim of the paper is to show that the effect of systemic corruption environment leads to the failure of the public institution in favor of private interest as well as the deformation of the relations between actors, and explain that a public institution in such an environment can be transformed into the triangle of corrupt relations comprising allied actors from officials, political elites and businessmen. The paper is based on author's original research of systemic corruption (2012 - 2013), which has deepened the ongoing research of public procurement. As the present results of these research show, just in public procurement, the failure of the institution is manifested very significantly. The paper concerning mainly the Pandur and Rath's court affairs and their analysis confirms the same or similar signs of systemic corruption and therefore illustrates the failure of procurement authority which lost its control under the procurement process in favor of private interest, i. e. in favor of the accomplices in the triangle of corrupt relations, including moments in what the failure set in (i. e. in procurement procedure time phases T-0 and T-4). Methodology is conceived as a mixed research, using several methods: court cases analysis, analysis of documents of public administration, media discourse, quantitative data analysis, interviews.","[Langr, Ivan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Langr, I (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001, Czech Republic.",ivan.langr@volny.cz,"Langr, Ivan/AAE-9902-2019","Langr, Ivan/0000-0003-0792-5666","Specific Academic Research at Institute of Sociological Studies, Charles University in Prague [260462]","Specific Academic Research at Institute of Sociological Studies, Charles University in Prague","This paper was supported by the Specific Academic Research at Institute of Sociological Studies 2017, Charles University in Prague, No. 260462.",,30,1,1,0,4,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

With empirical study in 248 companies we found that knowledge management had significantly positive influence on enterprise innovation capability, and dynamic capabilities have full mediating effect in knowledge management on enterprise innovation relations. Under the dynamic capability framework, the influences of knowledge management on innovation capability need to be realized through the mediation role of dynamic capability.

It utilises cross sectional and qualitative survey data from randomly selected pig value chain actors in 4 districts. A multinomial logit model is applied to assess the determinants of vertical integration among pig traders. The findings indicate that most relationships at the pig production node of the value chain are based on spot market governance structures supported by personal relationships and trust. Live pig traders are mostly vertically integrated. High integration levels of the pig traders are positively influenced by access to market information, value of investments in the value chain, and dedicated asset specificity in terms of backyard slaughter premises. Upgrading opportunities in the value chain in the form of value addition strategies, policy implementation and promotion of business models that link producer organisations to quality inputs and service suppliers through contractual arrangements are identified.","[Ouma, Emily; Dione, Michel] Int Livestock Res Inst, Biovers Int POB 24384, Kampala, Uganda; [Ochieng, Justus] World Vegetable Ctr Eastern & Southern Africa, POB 10, Arusha, Tanzania; [Pezo, Danilo] Trop Agr Res & Higher Educ Ctr CATIE, Turrialba 30501, Costa Rica",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza,"Ouma, E (通讯作者)，Int Livestock Res Inst, Biovers Int POB 24384, Kampala, Uganda.",e.a.ouma@cgiar.org,"Pezo, Danilo/GOP-4014-2022","Wennert, Nadine/0000-0002-1948-0433; Justus, Ochieng/0000-0002-6326-1377",Livestock and Fish program of the CGIAR; Irish Aid; European Commission; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),Livestock and Fish program of the CGIAR(CGIAR); Irish Aid(CGIAR); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),"The authors are grateful to the Livestock and Fish program of the CGIAR, Irish Aid, and the European Commission and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) for funding support.

As a consequence, the concept of intellectual capital arises, and it considers that the knowledge assets are the more important resources for the development of competitive advantages of the companies and the raw material from which the financial results are obtained. But it is important to know how to evaluate the intellectual capital in practice and has therefore been several metrics for this, such as VAIC (TM) (Value Added Intellectual Coefficient). It emerged as a way of responding to the problems experienced so far for the measurement of intellectual potential performance or intellectual potential (IP). So, this theoretical study aims to review the literature on the most relevant studies on intellectual capital and performance, in particular those using the VAIC (TM) since the emergence of the metric in 1998 to the present day, highlighting the main authors of studies, application of countries and sectors activity, the main findings as well as the main limitations and contributions of the studies. For example, Pulic (1998) developed this model and tested it in a sample of 200 Austrian companies from 14 different industry sectors and 400 Croatian companies that had the highest revenue and concluded that the efficiency of intellectual capital can be measured and also managed, there is a strong dependency between borderline intellectual potential and added value. Also Bontis, Janosevic, and Dzenopoljac (2015) applied the VAIC (TM) in the hotel industry of Serbia and concluded that performance is influenced the human and structural capital, confirming that performance is primarily influenced by the efficient use of physical capital.

Financial health of individual regional capitals of the Czech Republic is expressed by one indicator into which partial indicators enter under both of the approaches. In case of INEKO methodology this concerns basic budget balance, debt service, total debt and cash position ratio. In the case of the composite financial health indicator, the following five groups of indicators are used to calculate the financial health of regional capitals: indebtedness, liquidity, financial management, tax and financial strength and degree of self-financing. The regional capitals with the lowest score of financial health according to both used methodologies are Olomouc regional capital and Liberec regional capital.

It is planning to introduce a common currency and a regional central bank by the year 2018. As advocated by the optimal currency area (OCA) theory, lower transaction costs, stable prices, efficient resource allocation and improved access to goods, labour and financial markets are some of the benefits accrued from monetary unions. Relinquishing monetary and exchange rate policies are cited as the main costs of joining such a union. It is argued that sufficient and sound economic bases should be in place for a monetary union to be effective and yield the desired result. The primary objective of this paper was to determine whether SADC constitute an OCA. The study employs the generalised purchasing power parity (GPPP) framework consistent with OCA theory on price (inflation rate) and exchange rate. The method included Johansen cointegration test, vector error correction model and Pedron's panel cointegration test. The findings of the study suggest that GPPP holds in SADC. This can be interpreted as existence of similarities of fundamental macroeconomic factors that drive real exchange rates in the region. This evidence suggests that bilateral real exchange rates in the SADC region share a common stochastic trend in the long-run. However, the differences in the size of coefficients of normalised long-run cointegrating equation suggest that the aggregate demand patterns in the region are dissimilar and indicate asymmetries in exchange rate adjustment process to disequilibrium in the region. Other economic concerns such as business cycle synchronisation, and convergence of key macroeconomic variables including budget deficit, government debt and foreign reserves cover should be thoroughly investigated before the said economic union is implemented.","[Redda, Ephrem Habtemichael] North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Muzindusti, Paul-Francious] Univ Kwazulu Natal, Durban, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Redda, EH (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",,"Redda, Ephrem Habtemichael/AAL-5689-2020","Redda, Ephrem Habtemichael/0000-0002-0233-1968",,,,,36,2,2,0,3,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-38-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,84,98,,10.20472/EFC.2017.008.007,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6OC,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426884200007,0

Electricity from existing biogas plants in Germany allows flexible energy output and is increasingly marketed on demand requiring technical modifications such as increased gas storage and engine capacity. In this study we investigate an alternative approach in which a reduced fermenter load provides additional gas storage and engine capacity with no additional investment. This reduces input use and digestate production, thereby decreasing environmental externalities in regions with high biogas and animal densities. We quantify the required increase in subsidies for two dairy farms in Germany to switch from guaranteed subsidies for continuous electricity production to different levels of flexible load. The farms are assumed to have invested in a biogas plant under the Renewable Energy Sources Act of 2009 and 2012. We simulate the reduced biomass demand and its implications on farm management with a focus on fermenter input composition. Thereto, we develop a bio-economic model of a biogas plant and integrate it in the dynamic single-farm model FarmDyn. We find that provision of electricity on demand reduces especially the demand for maize silage, a feedstock with high negative environmental externalities. Even a moderate input reduction of 30% requires a subsidy increase of 1.8 to 3.2 cents/kWh contingent on the initial RES. We conclude that despite the approach being able to provide electricity on demand and to reduce negative environmental impacts, a widespread application seems unrealistic due to high additional subsidies.","[Schaefer, David; Britz, Wolfgang; Kuhn, Till] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Schäfer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Chair Prod Econ, Nussallee 19, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",david.schaefer@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823; Kuhn, Till/0000-0002-2713-0652",German Science Foundation (DFG) [HO 3780/2-1],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, ideas and criticism.

It considers situations where constraints are imposed on the volumes of purchase and sale by economic agents. At the same time, it allows a certain range for price variability. Such approaches to studying economic processes are motivated by production, economical and political reasons, forming the so-called rationing schemes. Typically, and in this work in particular, rationing schemes, applied under natural conditions, allow allocating a subset of resources and guaranteeing a commodity distribution that is not too bad. In this article, both resource and price constraints are cone-shaped, which allows applying them to growing economies. The authors establish the existence of a rationed equilibrium under these circumstances. Unlike conventional rationing schemes, the authors also consider situations where certain consumer preferences are non-convex. The preference convexity condition is replaced with a weaker condition of convexity within the directional cone. At the same time, the proof of existence of a rationed equilibrium does not impose any significant additional constraints on the consumer.","[Sevodin, Mikhail; Pervadchuk, Vladimir; Osechkina, Tatiana] Perm Natl Res Polytech Univ, Fac Appl Math & Mech, Perm, Russia",Perm National Research Polytechnic University,"Sevodin, M (通讯作者)，Perm Natl Res Polytech Univ, Fac Appl Math & Mech, Perm, Russia.",m.sevodin@mail.ru; pervadchuk@mail.ru; mathschool_pstu@mail.ru,"Pervadchuk, Vladimir/I-4476-2018; Osechkina, Tatiana/Q-5726-2019",,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,619,624,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600101,0

Intellectual capital (IC) represents a special kind of capital. Intellectual assets form a potential source of company's value growth through the creation of new knowledge and its implementation in company's activities. The basis of IC is formed by speculative and cogitative power of persons, together with such factors as consumer relations, business processes, databases, brands, and IT systems. IC components shaping and developing require investments. Results measurability has always been a major problem when making investment decisions in relation to IC. For companies' financial managers, intellectual (intangible) assets are very often feebly measured up against financial results of the company. As the result of developing an analytical model, based on mathematical tools for fuzzy sets, fuzzy input information has been processed, and the results for making optimal investment decision have been obtained. The efficiency of the transfer to cloud-based computing is convincingly substantiated in the terms, interpretable by financial managers of a company.","[Tkachenko, Elena; Ganieva, Mariya] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises & Ind Complexe, St Petersburg, Russia; [Bodrunov, Sergey] Inst New Ind Dev, St Petersburg, Russia; [Rogova, Elena] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg Sch Econ & Management, St Petersburg, Russia; [Klimov, Vladislav] JT Int Ltd, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Tkachenko, E (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ Econ, Dept Econ & Management Enterprises & Ind Complexe, St Petersburg, Russia.",eletkachenko@ya.ru; erogova@hse.ru; inir@inir.ru; kw-vlad@list.ru; mariya_ganieva@mail.ru,"Rogova, Elena/K-2821-2015; Tkachenko, Elena A./G-9715-2014",,,,,,38,0,0,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,671,677,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600110,0

Comparative advantages distribution is analysed in relation to both groups of countries. Key indicators (export, import, balance and turnover) are analysed using basic and chain indices. The analysis takes into account not only value (in CZK) but also the volume (in tones) of individual commodities. Commodity structure (we applied HS system for more detailed analyses trade is divided into 24 aggregations) is analysed especially in relation to the unit value (unit price analysis) and in relation to comparative advantages or disadvantages distribution. The actual analysis of the comparative advantages distribution is based on Lafay index and the index of the trade balance (TBI).

In this paper we study the second decision: should a rural parent send their child to a public rural school or have him or her attend a private migrant school in the city. While there is an existing literature on the impact of this decision on student academic performance, one of the main shortcomings of current studies is that the data that are used to analyse this issue are not fully comparable. To fill the gap, we collected data on the educational performance of both migrant students who were born in and come from specific source communities (prefecture) in rural China and students who are in rural public schools in the same source communities. Specifically, the dataset facilitates our effort to measure and identity the academic gap between the students in private migrant schools in Shanghai and Suzhou and those in the public rural schools in Anhui. We also seek to identify different sources of the gap, including selection effects and observable school quality effects. According to the results of the analysis, there is a large gap. Students in public rural schools outperform students in private migrant schools by more than one standard deviation (SD). We found that selection effects only account for a small part of this gap. Both school facility effects and teacher effects explain the achievement gap of the students from the two types of schools, although these effects occur in opposite directions.","[Wang, Xiaobing; Luo, Renfu] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University","Zhang, LX (通讯作者)，Datun Rd 11a, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Rozelle, S (通讯作者)，616 Serra St,Encina Hall East, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; Rozelle@stanford.edu,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333013, 71373255, 71473239]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSZD-EW-Z-021-1]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333013, 71373255, 71473239]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSZD-EW-Z-021-1].",,22,40,46,6,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Although educators have been trying to change the inappropriate teaching and teaching methods, and have made great achievements, the improvement of English teaching still needs a long and hard road. English is a foreign language. In the context of Chinese, English teaching not only helps students learn English by means of Chinese context, but also helps students build an English language environment and individualized English teaching.","[Yin, Liwen] Hebei North Univ, Foreign Languages Sch, Zhangjiakou City 075000, Hebei, Peoples R China",Hebei North University,"Yin, LW (通讯作者)，Hebei North Univ, Foreign Languages Sch, Zhangjiakou City 075000, Hebei, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,449,452,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200089,0

The purchases of public and private securities started in March 2015 and are intended to be carried out until December 2017 or until the inflationary path is consistent with the inflation target. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the macroeconomic effects of the APP on the euro area output and price level and determine the channels through which the asset purchases are transmitted to the real economy. The empirical evidence on the macroeconomic effects of the APP is provided by Wieladek and Garcia Pascual (2016) and Zlobins (2016). These papers identify the QE shock from the asset purchase announcement variable and as a reduction in the long-term interest rate spread respectively. This paper expands the literature by identifying the QE shock from the quantity variable, i.e., securities held by the Eurosystem. In order to assess the macroeconomic effects of the APP, we estimate a structural Bayesian vector autoregression (VAR) with normal-Wishart prior. The model is then used to obtain impulse response functions to the QE shock which is identified from the quantity variable by using sign and zero restrictions. The results from the structural Bayesian VAR model suggest that the APP has had a significant positive impact both on output and price level. The evidence suggests that the APP was transmitted to the real economy through the portfolio rebalancing, signaling, credit easing and exchange rate channels, while the uncertainty channel had no significant effect.","[Zlobins, Andrejs] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Zlobins, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,736,746,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400073,0

A simple weighted mean centre approach is applied to a novel data set containing long-run estimates of household income at the provincial level. The analysis reveals that from 1926 to 2013, Canada's ECG shifted westward by a net distance of 204 kilometres. Concomitant with this broad geographical shift, we identify six distinct historical moments during which major spatial realignments occurred, including a significant west-to-east move during the Great Depression years and two important east-to-west shifts during the energy-driven resource booms of the 1970s and post-2000 period. Time series modeling confirms that the ups and downs of resource commodity prices are indeed strongly associated with historical movements of the ECG in Canada.","[Breau, Sebastien; Toy, Brian; Coomes, Oliver T.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Breau, Sebastien] Donald J Savoie Inst, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Brown, Mark; Macdonald, Ryan] Stat Canada, Econ Anal Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada",McGill University; Statistics Canada,"Breau, S (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Breau, S (通讯作者)，Donald J Savoie Inst, Moncton, NB, Canada.",,,"Breau, Sebastien/0000-0002-5594-2674; Coomes, Oliver T/0000-0002-8220-8758",,,,,47,5,7,2,10,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We consider the tradeoff between the governance enhancing effect and the moral hazard effect of D&O insurance and focus on the role of information in determining the optimal level of D&O insurance purchase. The model shows that when directors are well informed, the governance enhancing effect of D&O insurance dominates the moral hazard effect, and thus, D&O insurance adds value to the firm. When directors are under-informed, the best strategy for shareholders is not to provide D&O insurance for directors. The model further shows that the optimal level of D&O insurance, when it exists, increases in the quality of the information received by directors. These results imply cross-firm variations in D&O insurance purchase.

However, average at-the-money straddles from 3 days before an earnings announcement to the announcement date yield a highly significant 3.34% return. The positive returns on straddles indicate that investors underestimate the magnitude of uncertainty around earnings announcements. We find that positive straddle returns are more pronounced for smaller firms and firms with higher volatility, higher kurtosis, more volatile past earnings surprises, and less trading volume/higher transaction costs. This suggests that when firm signals are noisy, and/or when it is costlier to trade, investors underestimate the uncertainty associated with earnings announcements.","[Gao, Chao; Zhang, Xiaoyan] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Xing, Yuhang] Rice Univ, Jones Sch Business, Houston, TX 77251 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Rice University,"Xing, YH (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Jones Sch Business, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",gao202@purdue.edu; yxing@rice.edu; xiaoyan-zhang@purdue.edu,,,,,,,34,9,11,1,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

We confirm that in these countries, firms with higher credit ratings exhibit a greater issuance of public debt than that of equity.

The aim of this study is to show the possibility of using technical analysis indicators in forecasting prices in the food industry in comparison with classical methods, namely exponential smoothing. In the food industry, competitiveness is also a key element of business. Competitiveness, however, requires not only a thorough historical analysis not only of but also forecasting. Forecasting methods are very complex and are often prevented from wider application to increase competitiveness. The indicators of technical analysis meet the criteria of simplicity and can therefore be a good way to increase competitiveness through proper forecasting. In this manuscript, the use of simple forecasting tools is confirmed for the period of 2009-2018. The analysis was completed using data on the main raw materials of the food industry, namely wheat food, wheat forage, malting barley, milk, apples and potatoes, for which monthly data from January 2009 to February 2018 was collected. The data file has been analyzed and modified, with an analysis of indicators based on rolling averages selected. The indicators were compared using exponential smoothing forecasting. Accuracy RMSE and MAPE criteria were selected. The results show that, while the use of indicators as a default setting is inappropriate in business economics, their accuracy is not as strong as the accuracy provided by exponential smoothing. In the following section, the models were optimized. With these optimized parameters, technical indicators seem to be an appropriate tool.","[Kolkova, Andrea] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Kolkova, A (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",andrea.kolkova@vsb.cz,"Kolkova, Andrea/G-9036-2018","Kolkova, Andrea/0000-0002-4764-3164",,,,,38,15,16,1,13,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

To investigate this, we run several experiments where people bet on propositions (facts) that they cannot recall with certainty. We use betting preferences to infer subjects' revealed beliefs and their revealed confidence in these beliefs. Forgetting is induced via interference tasks and time delays (up to one year). We observe a natural memory decay pattern where beliefs become less accurate and confidence is reduced as well. Moreover, we find a form of comparative ignorance where subjects are more ambiguity averse when they cannot recall the truth rather than never having learnt it. In a different vein, we identify an overconfidence pattern: on average, subjects overpay for bets on propositions that they believe in, but underpay for the opposite bets. We formulate a two-signal behavioral model of forgetting that generates all of these patterns. It suggests new testable hypotheses that are confirmed by our data.","[Kopylov, Igor] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Miller, Joshua] Univ Alicante, FAE, Alicante, Spain",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Universitat d'Alacant,"Kopylov, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",ikopylov@uci.edu; Joshua.Benjamin.Miller@gmail.com,,"MILLER, JOSHUA BENJAMIN/0000-0001-8412-3689",,,,,39,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

A winner-loser portfolio approach shows that return seasonality is economically significant in advanced markets but not in emerging markets.

An analysis of the recent literature leads to the conclusion that these impacts depend on the characteristics of each tourist destination and the different pattern followed by domestic and foreign visitors. While studies focused on Asia show HSR to have a significant effect on tourism indicators, European case studies reveal a lower impact, mainly caused by foreign visitors. Nevertheless, a deeper analysis of foreign tourism and its relation with HSR is required. This paper empirically analyses how Spanish HSR (its existence and the growth of the network) conditions the number of foreign visitors, per country of origin, in the six regions linked by HSR. A fixed effects model has been applied to a new panel database (1997-2016) compiled with official statistics from surveys of tourists at borders, rather than through the traditional approach of considering hotel overstays. The results by country of origin show, for the main nationalities, that the influx of tourists is not dependent on the existence or expansion of HSR. However, the analysis at the regional level suggests that HSR benefits trips within mainland Spain to some coastal tourist destinations while its impact on visitor numbers in inland regions may be irrelevant or even negative. Finally, the enlargement of the HSR network may favour the regions in a central position in the network, encouraging further competition between the tourist destinations located at HSR network nodes.","[Luis Campa, Juan; Arce, Rosa; Eugenia Lopez-Lambas, Maria; Guirao, Begoria] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Civil Transportes & Terr, ETSI Caminos Canales & Puertos, Avda Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Campa, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Civil Transportes & Terr, ETSI Caminos Canales & Puertos, Avda Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",jldelacampa@alumnos.upm.es; rosa.arce.ruiz@upm.es; mariaeugenia.lopez@upm.es; begona.guirao@upm.es,"Arce-Ruiz, Rosa/K-3479-2019; Arce-Ruiz, Rosa/T-3491-2018; Lambas, María Eugenia/AAX-4652-2021; Guirao, Begoña/O-1570-2014; de la Campa, Juan Luis/AHC-5662-2022","Arce-Ruiz, Rosa/0000-0001-9897-509X; Guirao, Begoña/0000-0003-4138-0073; de la Campa, Juan Luis/0000-0003-3760-9592",,,,,68,24,25,3,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

While scholars commonly assert that the foundation is part of a new breed of philanthrocapitalists who apply business principles to their philanthropic activities, little is known about what this really means or how the Gates Foundation works on the inside. This article seeks to deepen our understanding of this new development actor by examining its organizational culture. I do this through a case study of the Gates Foundation's Agricultural Development program. Using in-depth interviews, materials from the BMGF's website, and a variety of other primary data sources, I explore the foundation's quotidian practices, workplace norms, and interactions with grantees as it tries to improve the lives of smallholder farmers in Africa. I argue that the Gates Foundation's heavy emphasis on strategic planning has produced an approach to agricultural development that abstracts away from smallholder farmers' sociocultural worlds and relies on a generalizable set of development solutions. My analysis also reveals another significant consequence of the BMGF's organizational culture: By immersing bright, high-achieving professionals in the competitive, intense environment that characterizes the foundation, staff have learned to manage up (toward Bill) rather than manage down (toward their intended beneficiaries). This insulates and distances foundation staff from the field, making it difficult for them to listen to smallholder farmers, even though many express a genuine desire to do so. As a result, farmers continue to be treated as passive objects of development rather than as complex social actors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We extend models of entrepreneurial intentions by drawing on action phase theory to better understand how entrepreneurial intentions translate into actions. Our study focuses on the effects of implementation intentions on taking entrepreneurial action. The analysis uses two waves of survey data on 422 individuals, from the Swedish general population, who had an explicit interest in starting a business and who reported on their actions 6 months later. We test and find support for a moderated mediation model in which implementation intentions mediate the effects of goal intentions on taking entrepreneurial action. We further find the mediated effect to be even stronger for those confirming a strong intention to start a new business.

This study for the first time examines this relationship by extending the occupational choice literature to eight entrepreneur types and four generational modification effects in the USA. Multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression models are estimated to examine the age effects in entrepreneur type propensities. Generational modification effects are compared for the same ages across neighboring generations by hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) models. We find that entrepreneurial propensity rises with age until around 80. The propensity of novice (versus non-novice) and unincorporated (versus incorporated) entrepreneurs has a U-shaped age trend dipping around age 60, while the propensity of full-time (versus part-time) declines since age 30s. The propensity of incorporated (versus unincorporated) entrepreneurs declines from ages 44 to 51 for Gen-Xers, but not for Boomers; this propensity also declines faster for Boomers than for Traditionalists from ages 63 to 70.","[Zhang, Ting] Univ Baltimore, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Acs, Zoltan] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Baltimore; George Mason University,"Zhang, T (通讯作者)，Univ Baltimore, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",tzhang@ubalt.edu; zacs@gmu.edu,"acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013","Zhang, Ting/0000-0001-8596-7488",Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation [20150528],Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation,The authors thank the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation for its generous grant support (Strategic Grant No. 20150528) for this study.,,70,48,56,10,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The paper aims to seek answers to the following questions: what determines technology trust (technology trust antecedents) and how to measure it in the case of the University Student Service System (USSS) technology? Design/methodology/approach In this study, the survey method was used to collect data. The online survey engaged 413 students representing one Polish technical university. The USSS was the technology of interest. The USSS web is an IT system for managing the course of higher education. The USSS web evolved into a multipurpose platform, which is used by university students for many different purposes. Findings Positive verification of three accepted hypotheses H1, H3 and H5 shows that the ease of use, general trust level of respondents and institutional trust have a statistically significant influence on USSS technology trust. The diversification of regression coefficients indicates that the ease of use determines USSS technology trust more than general trust and institutional trust. Research limitations/implications An important limitation of the conducted study was the reduction of the sample group of students representing one university - the Bialystok University of Technology. The relationships between variables, however, have made it possible to explain the reasons for the existing dependencies from the perspective of a single university, which constitutes an important cognitive value in the context of motivating and disseminating information and communication technology solutions. A good adjustment of the developed theoretical model indicates that it can be used to a wider degree. Practical implications From the practical point of view, achieved results showed that there are many factors that can be influenced by managers within an organisation to build up technology trust relations. Institutional trust is one example of such factors. Also, considering that building trust is a process, managers should take into account that different factors can affect technology trust in different stages of this process. At the beginning phase, the ease of use of a particular technology seems to be most important for its users, and then the usefulness of the technology becomes the factor which determines the technology trust. Despite the fact that the conducted research did not show statistically significant relations between technology trust and the intention of future system use, results explained main factors affecting such situations. Also, the frequency of system use seemed to be the most important variable that determines the intention of future system use. Originality/value The scientific value of the study is an attempt to build a measurement scales relating to trust in technology and constructs determining that trust. According to a very popular technology acceptance model, which explains the behaviour of technology users, the author expanded the acceptance model and finally proposed the model consisting of five input variables (the ease of use, usefulness, institutional trust, general trust, trust in technology and science) and one output variable - the intention to use the system in the future. The novelty of the research results from the fact that it was the first research conducted in Poland on the topic of technology trust topic.","[Ejdys, Joanna] Politech Bialostocka, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Ejdys, J (通讯作者)，Politech Bialostocka, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland.",j.ejdys@pb.edu.pl,"EJDYS, JOANNA/D-6654-2013","EJDYS, JOANNA/0000-0002-5132-166X",,,,,65,31,32,4,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Design/methodology/approach The study follows a two-pronged approach. First, it tests the corporate bond market sensitivity to interest rate, along with other determinants like commercial bank credit and government securities size using the autoregressive distributed lag approach. These are considered instrumental in the development of a long-term debt market. Second, it tests if the interest rate changes are fiscal deficit (FD) induced using Granger causality framework. Findings It finds evidence of both the interest rate sensitivity of the corporate bond market and the interest rates to be FD induced, thereby empirically validating the possibility of financial crowding out in the Indian debt market segment. Research limitations/implications Based on the results, it seems that any deviation from the path of fiscal prudence can prove dear in the development of the corporate bond market. Also, the banking sector is overexposed to the risks it is not geared to handle, given by the serious asset-liability mismatches and contraction it leads in the market debt, like the corporate bond market. The government securities market could be further developed, which would provide a cue to corporate segment further and also a benchmark yield curve. Originality/value The study adds to the very limited literature on the corporate bond market in India, especially in the empirical domain and possibly is the first attempt to empirically explore the aspect of financial crowding out with reference to corporate bond market.","[Hasnat, Tanzeem; Ashraf, Shahid] Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Econ, New Delhi, India",Jamia Millia Islamia,"Hasnat, T (通讯作者)，Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Econ, New Delhi, India.",tanzeem0504@gmail.com; sashraf@jmi.ac.in,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Land property rights are key determinants for reducing poverty through agricultural productivity, natural resource management, and socio-economic inequalities. Growing competition for land access increases the sensitivity in land socio-economic stakes and related policies in developing countries. This paper analyzes the impacts of land rights on land-related investment in rural Burkina Faso. We use rural representative panel data and appropriate methods. The Two-Stage Conditional Maximum Likelihood approach is used for dealing with endogeneity, while the Generalized Structural Equation Model allows us to control for random effects. We show that stronger land rights increase land-attached investment, and land investment has positive and negative effect on stronger and weaker land rights, respectively, in rural Burkina Faso. Our study also finds that women and immigrants have less land rights than men and natives, respectively. Our contribution to related literature includes the use of rigorous process of hierarchy in land rights. The close link of the results with land right strength is of great interest for cautious practitioners in land tenure and investment. Moreover, our results imply that a gain of efficiency can be achieved from combining practices in land tenure and investment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the consequences of the liberalization of air transport has been the development of the hub-and-spoke system, used by traditional airlines in order to be more efficient in a highly competitive environment. As air traffic significantly developed worldwide, hubs became highly connected places concentrating an increasing number of transit passengers. At the same time, the liberalization of the airline industry has stimulated both airline and airport competition, therefore, vertical partnerships have become an interesting option for airlines, as well as airports. Moreover, considering that transiting traffic represents a potential tourism market, tourism organizations have also started to get involved in the process. Stopover tourism is a new type of tourism based on the partnership between airlines, airports and tourism organizations, with the purpose to turn transiting passengers into stayover tourists. This paper focuses on building a better understanding of how stopover tourism type programs can enhance tourism development, identifying the characteristics of this form of tourism and the measures that need to be taken by the authorities in order to encourage its development and investigates the possibility of implementing it in Romania In order to achieve these objectives, the research was conducted using analysis of secondary data included in several scientific journals and publication, as well as primary data collection, through qualitative research, having as interviewees, experts from the airline industry and from tourism organizations in Romania.","[Tigu, Gabriela; Stoenescu, Cristina; Sabou, Gabriel Cristian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Garcia Sanchez, Antonio] Polytech Univ Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain; [Gheorghe, Camelia] Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Tigu, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",gabriela.tigu@ase.ro,"Tigu, Gabriela/AEV-2179-2022; Gheorghe, Camelia/GMW-5991-2022; Sabou, Gabriel Cristian/N-4633-2015","Tigu, Gabriela/0000-0001-6189-8027;",,,,,40,4,4,0,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,967,981,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/967,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700010,0

This is based on a unique panel dataset of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which combines information on all imported antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) from the World Health Organization's Global Price Reporting Mechanism, with measures of corruption, estimates of the HIV prevalence, and the number of AIDS deaths in each year and in each country. Countries with higher levels of corruption experience a significantly smaller drop in AIDS deaths as a result of the same quantity of ARVs imported. This is robust to different measures of corruption and to a measure of overall death rates as well as HIV-specific death rates as the outcome. A case-study analysis of the Kenyan experience illustrates one potential mechanism for the observed effect, demonstrating that disproportionately more clinics begin distributing ARVs in areas that are predominantly represented by the new leader's ethnic group.

We focus on contexts where the quality offered by the energy efficiency provider is imperfectly observable. We formalize underprovision of quality and compare two policy solutions: energy-savings insurance and minimum quality standards. We then provide empirical evidence of moral hazard in home energy retrofits in Florida. We find that for those measures, the quality of which is deemed hard to observe, realized energy savings are subject to day-of-the-week effects. Specifically, energy savings are significantly lower when those measures were installed on a Fridaya day particularly prone to negative shocks on workers' productivitythan on any other weekday. We finally specify a model to simulate the Floridian market and find that the deadweight loss from moral hazard is about twice as large as that due to associated carbon dioxide externalities.","[Giraudet, Louis-Gaetan] Ecole Ponts ParisTech, CIRED, Paris, France; [Houde, Sebastien] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Maher, Joseph] US Govt Accountabil Off GAO, Washington, DC USA",AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Giraudet, LG (通讯作者)，Ecole Ponts ParisTech, CIRED, Paris, France.",giraudet@centre-cired.fr; shoude@umd.edu; maherj@gao.gov,"Houde, Sebastien/HSG-6552-2023","Houde, Sebastien/0000-0003-1278-620X",PEEC,PEEC,"Louis-Gaetan Giraudet is at the Centre International de Recherche sur l'Environnement et le Developpement (CIRED), Ecole des Ponts ParisTech (giraudet@centre-cired.fr).

The major barriers to examining bargaining behavior include the large number of dimensions to these bargains and differences in capacity and strategies firms and governments. In this paper, I examine data from a unique economic development incentive program in the state of Texas that holds almost all elements of bargaining constant, leaving only the ability of firms to walk away from a given location during the bargaining process. Using original data on the bargaining outcome as well as elite opinions, I document the extent to which firms that chose to locate in Texas made their decisions independent of this special economic development program. My findings suggest that only 15% of the firms participating in the program would have invested in another state without this incentive. The majority of these projects, and incentive dollars, were allocated to firms already committed to investing in Texas. Case studies of over 80 projects reveal that in many cases it was an open secret that companies had already committed to their investment locations prior to receiving the incentive. This implies that structure of the program encourages the overuse of incentives.","[Jensen, Nathan M.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Jensen, NM (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",natemjensen@austin.utexas.edu,"Jensen, Nathan/J-3085-2019",,Laura and John Arnold Foundation,Laura and John Arnold Foundation,Thanks to Cam Powell and Lila Al-Kassem for excellent research assistance.

Drawing on social support theory, we hypothesize that the effectiveness of support depends on when, during the venture development process (number of gestation activities completed), it is provided. We also propose that the impact of social support depends on when during the entrepreneur's life stage (age) that support is made available. Testing our hypotheses using a longitudinal dataset of nascent entrepreneurs, we find that emotional support is most relevant earlier on during venture development, while instrumental support is most relevant for entrepreneurs who begin their businesses in earlier life stages.","[Klyver, Kim; Honig, Benson] Univ Southern Denmark, Univ Pk 1, DK-6000 Kolding, Denmark; [Honig, Benson] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada; [Steffens, Paul] Univ Adelaide, Entrepreneurship Commercialisat & Innovat Ctr, 10 Pulteney St, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Southern Denmark; McMaster University; University of Adelaide,"Klyver, K (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Univ Pk 1, DK-6000 Kolding, Denmark.",kkl@sam.sdu.dk; bhonig@mcmaster.ca; paul.steffens@adelaide.edu.au,"Klyver, Kim/AAC-9338-2021; Honig, Benson/F-8345-2013; Steffens, Paul/ABC-6607-2020","Klyver, Kim/0000-0003-4558-5527; Honig, Benson/0000-0003-0563-0899; Steffens, Paul/0000-0002-9945-7304",,,,,136,66,72,7,91,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We apply an overlapping generations model in its canonical form, where we consider endogenous fertility, endogenous growth and endogenous aging of the society. From the analysis, we conclude that with a child allowance, there is a consequent increase in the number of children and decrease in pension benefits and life expectancy. On the other hand, we note that with an educational subsidy, there is a decrease in the number of children, and an increase in the pension benefits and the life expectancy, respectively.

Buchanan; Monetary constitution; Monetary stability; Federal reserve; Rules versus discretion,FINANCIAL CRISIS; FEDERAL-RESERVE; UNITED-STATES; BEN BERNANKE; POLICY; UNEMPLOYMENT; BANKING; GROWTH; DISCRETION; POLITICS,"This paper explores James Buchanan's contributions to monetary economics and argues these contributions form the foundation of a robust monetary economics paradigm. While often not recognized for his contributions to monetary economics, Buchanan's scholarship offers important insights for current debates, especially the renewed interest in narrow banking in the wake of the financial crisis. We argue that the post-2007 crisis milieu creates a unique opportunity to recognize, as Buchanan did, the vital role that money plays in the market as the 'grammar of commerce.' That recognition makes the need for more fundamental reform of our monetary regimes at the constitutional level more apparent, making Buchanan's work on monetary constitutions more relevant than ever before. We then discuss how adopting Buchanan's monetary framework can improve both monetary scholarship and institutions.","[Boettke, Peter J.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Mason Hall D109, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Salter, Alexander W.] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, 703 Flint Ave, Lubbock, TX 79410 USA; [Smith, Daniel J.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Jennings A Jones Coll Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Box 27,1301 E Main St, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA",George Mason University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Middle Tennessee State University,"Salter, AW (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, 703 Flint Ave, Lubbock, TX 79410 USA.",pboettke@gmu.edu; alexander.w.salter@ttu.edu; daniel.smith@mtsu.edu,,,,,,,186,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2018,176.0,3-4,,,,,529,555,,10.1007/s11127-018-0580-y,0.0,,,27,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GQ5ZF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441775600009,0

To do so, we develop a general equilibrium model that accounts for the main channels of transmission of immigration shocks - the employment and wage effects, the fiscal effect and the market size effect - and for the interactions between them. We parameterize our model for 20 selected OECD member states. We find that the three waves induce positive effects on the real income of natives; however, the size of these gains varies considerably across countries and across skill groups. In relative terms, the post-crisis wave induces smaller welfare gains compared to the previous ones. This is due to the changing origin mix of immigrants, which translates into lower levels of human capital and smaller fiscal gains. With a few exceptions, differences across cohorts explain a tiny fraction of the highly persistent, cross-country heterogeneity in the economic benefits from immigration.","[Burzynski, Michal] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Docquier, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, FNRS, Off 232,3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Docquier, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Off 232,3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Rapoport, Hillel] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Rapoport, Hillel] CEPII, Paris, France",University of Luxembourg; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; Paris School of Economics,"Docquier, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, FNRS, Off 232,3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Docquier, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Off 232,3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",michal.burzynski@uni.lu; frederic.docquier@uclouvain.be; hillel.rapoport@psemail.eu,,"Docquier, Frederic/0000-0003-3581-6141; Burzynski, Michal/0000-0002-3937-0645",IMF,IMF,"This paper benefited from helpful comments from two anonymous referees.

Political strife leads to shifts in the balance of power among different factions. Our analysis shows that equity risk of firms connected to fractions encountering intense political rivalry and public discontent rose, without any compensating increase in return. Political tie that is neutral to regime changes exhibits lower risk. By examining agency-cost measures in different regimes, we find that political instability may exert disciplinary effects on connected shareholders' behavior.

In response to the lack of a sense of community in multi-unit rental structures, owners and managers of these properties have implemented planned programs to establish stronger community ties for residents. We examine the effect of one such program, the CARES (Community Activities and REsident Services) program, on the rental price of apartments using both a standard hedonic approach as well as matching techniques designed to limit unobservable differences between treated and comparison units. Our results using propensity score matching to identify comparison units, suggest that monthly rents are between 5.7 and 9.3 percent higher for apartment units that offer the CARES program. We also find the effect of the CARES program to be stronger in larger apartment complexes, suggesting that renters are willing to pay a premium for a sense of community rather than just the increased services from the program.","[Hanson, Andrew R.] Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Hawley, Zackary] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Econ, POB 298510, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Turnbull, Geoffrey] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Finance, 12744 Pegasus Dr, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",Marquette University; Texas Christian University; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Hawley, Z (通讯作者)，Texas Christian Univ, Dept Econ, POB 298510, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",andrew.r.hanson@marquette.edu; z.hawley@tcu.edu; Geoffrey.Turnbull@ucf.edu,,"Hawley, Zackary/0000-0002-4426-6172",,,,,24,2,3,0,6,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

This differential declines as average incomes rise, partly because agriculture becomes smaller as a share of the economy, and partly because agricultural productivity growth becomes less effective in reducing poverty. The source of the poverty reduction benefits from agricultural productivity growth changes as innovations are more widely adopted moving from increases in producer returns to reductions in consumer prices.

The version that forecasts inflation best implies that after the 2011 sovereign debt crisis, the output gap in the euro area has been much larger than the official estimates.

We argue that boards with an even number of directors are more likely to be weak monitors because of inefficient decision making and being captured by controlling shareholders. Consistent with this argument, we find that in China boards with an even number of directors have fewer meetings and are more likely to have board members absent from board meetings. Firms with an even number of directors have more tunnelling through intercorporate loans and related party transactions, lower financial reporting quality and higher incidence of accounting irregularities. This evidence is stronger in firms with weaker external monitoring and for directors with weaker incentives to monitor. Finally, we show that firms with an even number of directors are associated with lower market valuation of equity.

Such acquirers have lower announcement returns and make higher offers than those who do not. To avoid a shareholder vote, acquirers increase equity issuance and cut payouts to raise the portion of cash in mixed-payment deals. Employing a regression discontinuity design, we show a positive effect on acquirer announcement returns concentrated in acquirers with higher institutional ownership. We conclude that shareholder voting mitigates agency problems in corporate acquisitions.","[Li, Kai] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6S 2K8, Canada; [Liu, Tingting] Creighton Univ, Heider Coll Business, Omaha, NE 68178 USA; [Wu, Juan (Julie)] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of British Columbia; Creighton University; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Li, K (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6S 2K8, Canada.",kai.li@sauder.ubc.ca,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019; Liu, Tingting/JCE-9180-2023; Li, Kai/AAJ-8376-2021","Li, Kai/0000-0002-3845-3895; Wu, Julie/0000-0001-9113-6795",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2013-0023]; Sauder School of Business Bureau of Asset Management,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Sauder School of Business Bureau of Asset Management,"We are grateful for helpful comments from the editor Dave Denis; two anonymous referees; Vikas Agarwal, David Becher, Marco Becht, Antje Berndt, Christa Bouwman, Tolga Caskurlu, Ling Cen, Mark Chen, Vicente Cunat, Rui Dai, Alex Edmans, Joseph Fan, Yianni Floros, Stu Gillan, Mireia Gine, Todd Gormley, Daniel Greene, Yaniv Grinstein, Jarrad Harford, Iftekhar Hasan, Jack He, Zhaozhao He, Rob Heinkel, David Hirshleifer, Jerry Hoberg, Maggie Hu, Chong Huang, Ioanuis Ioannou, Dirk Jenter, Wei Jiang, Torsten Jochem, Boochun Jung, Omeshi Kini, Adam Kolasinski, Karthik Krishnan, Mattia Landoni, T.

This constraint may affect the capacity of dynamic factor models to summarize large amounts of information into latent factors that reflect macroeconomic performance. This paper addresses this issue by comparing the accuracy of two kinds of dynamic factor models at GDP forecasting for six Latin American countries. Each model is based on a dataset of different dimensions: a large dataset composed of series belonging to several macroeconomic categories (large scale dynamic factor model) and a small dataset with a few prescreened variables considered as the most representative ones (small scale dynamic factor model). Short-term pseudo real time out-of-sample forecast of GDP growth is carried out with both models reproducing the real time situation of data accessibility derived from the publication lags of the series in each country. Results (i) confirm the important role of the inclusion of latest released data in the forecast accuracy of both models, (ii) show better precision of predictions based on factors with respect to autoregressive models and (iii) identify the most adequate model for each country according to availability of the observed data.","[Lopez-Buenache, German] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Lopez-Buenache, G (通讯作者)，Inst Flores de Lemus, Dept Stat, Getafe 28903, Spain.",glbmerlin@gmail.com,"LOPEZ-BUENACHE, GERMAN/GRY-0315-2022","LOPEZ-BUENACHE, GERMAN/0000-0002-0921-3649",MINECO/FEDER [ECO2015-70331-C2-2-R],MINECO/FEDER,This work was supported by the MINECO/FEDER (Grant ECO2015-70331-C2-2-R).,,24,2,2,2,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

These adaptive strategies include decisions to plant different seed varieties, changes to the array of cultivated crops, and shifts in planting dates. Smallholder access to irrigation water is crucial to the adoption of such strategies, and uncertainty of water availability may prove to be a stimulating force in a smallholder's decision to adjust their on-farm practices. Within smallholder irrigation systems, attributes at multiple levels influence water availability and collective action, and in the process play a role in adaptation: community-level governance institutions may influence trust in others and the ability to overcome appropriation and provisioning dilemmas, and, at the household-level, the availability of irrigation water and socioeconomic and demographic factors may influence farmer willingness to take on the risk of altering their on-farm practices. In this study we investigate smallholder adaptation in Kenya from multiple levels. Specifically, we identify the role of household- and community-level characteristics in shaping smallholder experimentation with different seed varieties. Standard ordinary least squares and logistic regressions are constructed to assess the influence of these interactions on smallholder adaptation. We further discuss the ability of smallholders to respond to poor water provisioning. Among the study's findings is evidence that smallholders are more willing to employ adaptive measures if they have a limited capacity to irrigate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

I find information sharing reduces relationship switching costs, particularly for firms that are young, small, or have had no defaults. After sharing, lenders transition away from relationship contracting, in two ways: contract maturities in new relationships are shorter, and lenders are less willing to provide financing to their delinquent borrowers.

In response, some governments have shifted towards community-based, common property resource management policies. While there is emerging evidence that these policies can reduce deforestation, there has been less research assessing the effect of these concessions on rural livelihoods. This is surprising, since sustainable income generation is an important outcome that can influence the long-term success of concession policies. This study examines the effect of community-managed forest concessions on income in the context of the Maya Biosphere Reserve in northern Guatemala. In this region, forest concessions have been established in the past 20 years to give local residents access to the forests. Residents granted access to a forest concession are required to reduce overexploitation by abiding by a sustainable forest management plan and obtaining certification from the Forest Stewardship Council. In the Maya Biosphere Reserve, the characteristics of concession communities vary and the sustainable management plan is often tailored to meet the needs of the community. The results show that the effects of participating in a forest concession on income are generally positive, although there is significant heterogeneity among communities with different socioeconomic characteristics.

The overseas combustion of depleted resource stocks contributes to global warming, which impedes productivity growth in the small open economy. We find that the optimal resource depletion rate is independent of the social welfare function and discount rate. An export revenue tax rate need not fall over time to curb depletion if capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than interest income. The analysis is robust to installation costs of capital and transitional dynamics. The findings challenge conventional wisdom and suggest an array of tax policies for a small open economy seeking to curb extraction of resources for export.","[Day, Creina] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Day, Creina] Care of Day G, Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Day, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Day, C (通讯作者)，Care of Day G, Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",creina.day@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

In the last century in the Alt Urgell District (Spanish Pyrenees), many communities went from a production model based on subsistence farming and livestock breeding first to a specialization in milk production and later to tourism. The industrialization of milk production, the radical transformation of the scale of their operations, and the monetization of life transformed the identity and structure of these communities. The subsequent transformation of many of these farms to accommodate the leisure industry changed the shape of these households again.

Gravity model estimation suggests that income elasticity for airborne trade at country level is 1.1, whereas the values for the three major economic zones are significantly higher. More importantly, we found that for China's international trade by air, the composition of economy is a more important driver than the size of economy. These results suggest that the Chinese air cargo sector will outpace the overall economic growth, with leading airports in the economic zones well-positioned to grow into major freight gateways. Air cargo demand in China was not as high as past GDP numbers suggested in the past, but is likely to experience sustained growth in the years to come. Network analysis suggests that cargo traffic volumes are concentrated in the catchments of metropolitan regions, where passenger hubs also serve as air cargo bases. However, domestic air freights currently mainly flow through a relatively small point-to-point network, suggesting that the leading airports are yet to become cargo gateway hubs despite their significant growth potential.

Overall, we find that smaller, more profitable, and highly liquid Islamic banks are more highly capitalized. Additionally, improvements in the economic and financial environments and market discipline within a country correspond with higher Islamic bank capitalization. The results shed light on the impact that Sharia'a law restrictions have on Islamic banking capitalization. Our findings are most robust to banks that choose to hold capital well in excess of that required by regulators, consistent with traditional capital structure theory. Our results highlight the role that stable economic and political systems play in improving bank capitalization and reducing financial sector risk. By reducing political instability and corruption, improving legal systems, and encouraging access to capital markets, policymakers may incentivize managers to make financing decisions that increase the capitalization of the Islamic banking industry in developing countries.

Banning foreclosure procedures, often adopted by governments to mitigate the effects of the above conditions on loan defaulting, are found to positively influence the loan default probability, and thus they make efforts of banks to restructure (or refinance) mortgage loans a difficult task. Our results add support to the view that foreclosure moratorium may raise moral hazard incentives that borrowers will not maintain their payments in long run. The empirical analysis of the paper is based on an extension of the discrete-time survival analysis model which allows for a structural break in its baseline hazard function and a unique set of individual loan accounts. We also consider alternative specifications of the binary link function between default events and covariates. Asymmetric link functions are found to be more appropriate under financial distressed conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Yet our understanding of such processes is still incomplete. Many accounts rest on a perspective that focuses on the development of solitary knowledge ecologies, while neglecting the fact that cluster formation may be triggered when different places are connected and begin to influence each other in mutual beneficial ways. This article argues that conceptualizations of cluster emergence need to understand the crucial ways in which this process is from the very beginning associated with external linkages and trans-local pipelines. A model of cluster formation is presented that suggests how buzz generation is driven by the connections between different localities in four stages: (i) pioneering, (ii) expansion, (iii) off-shoot, and (iv) fusion. We use the case of the global diamond industry, in both inductive and deductive ways, as an example to show that transnational communities and tight networks play a crucial role in forming cross-local connections that can trigger cluster emergence.","[Henn, Sebastian] Univ Jena, Inst Geog, Lobdergraben 32, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Bathelt, Harald] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Bathelt, Harald] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Bathelt, Harald] East China Normal Univ, Inst Urban Dev, 3663 North Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; East China Normal University,"Bathelt, H (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.;Bathelt, H (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.;Bathelt, H (通讯作者)，East China Normal Univ, Inst Urban Dev, 3663 North Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",sebastian.henn@uni-jena.de; harald.bathelt@utoronto.ca,"Henn, Sebastian/AAB-6552-2019","Henn, Sebastian/0000-0001-8313-7931",German Research Foundation; Canada Research Chair in Innovation & Governance at the University of Toronto,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Canada Research Chair in Innovation & Governance at the University of Toronto,This research was funded by the German Research Foundation and the Canada Research Chair in Innovation & Governance at the University of Toronto.,,100,20,21,6,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

As there are no studies that investigate the influence of personality traits on risk attitude, risk perception, and return expectations in investment decisions simultaneously, we provide a meaningful contribution to existing literature. We use a unique data set that contains 342 undergraduate business students' questionnaire responses measuring the students' degree of extraversion and neuroticism as well as their risk attitude, risk perception, and return expectations. Therefore, we are able to identify which determinants of risk-taking are influenced by extraversion and neuroticism and induce individuals to take investment risks. We find that more extraverted individuals are less risk averse, whereas more neurotic subjects are more risk averse. Beside these results, we find that more conscientious individuals are more risk averse and perceive investments in assets as more risky. Further research should consider individuals' personality as an influence factor on the determinants of risk-taking behavior in investment decisions.","[Oehler, Andreas; Wedlich, Florian] Bamberg Univ, Dept Finance, Kaerntenstr 7, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Wedlich, F (通讯作者)，Bamberg Univ, Dept Finance, Kaerntenstr 7, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",florian.wedlich@uni-bamberg.de,"Oehler, Andreas/GQH-8718-2022","Oehler, Andreas/0000-0002-2858-3370",,,,,138,43,47,7,72,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

First, we argue that influences of organizational slack depend on whether we consider exploitative innovation or exploratory innovation. Further, absorbed slack and unabsorbed slack differ in their forms of relationship with innovation. The ways in which a certain type of innovation is enabled by organizational slack are conditioned by distinct modes of organizational search associated with alternative types of innovation, as well as by the extent to which effective shareholder monitoring is disturbed by different types of organizational slack. An empirical analysis of 37 Japanese pharmaceutical firms' new product developments over a 20-year period supports our argument.","[Suzuki, Osamu] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Inst Business & Accounting, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University,"Suzuki, O (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Inst Business & Accounting, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan.",suzuki@kwansei.ac.jp,,,,,,,94,18,21,15,82,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In previous research, this concept has been studied from the university perspective, but it has not yet been introduced in the field of entrepreneurial support. Additionally, the growing number of university business incubators has led to increasing research interest in the entrepreneurial support field. This research project seeks to develop a more robust understanding of sustainable university-based entrepreneurial ecosystems through an in-depth analysis of an essential entrepreneurial support element: the university business incubator. Our exploratory research study draws on 48 face-to-face interviews with key members of university-based entrepreneurial ecosystems to explore the operation of three cases through the lens of social capital theory. Our analysis suggests that all three social capital dimensions are relevant to the effective functioning of the university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem and contribute to its sustainability: applying the structural dimension of social capital enhances access to resources; addressing the cognitive dimension strengthens relationships among ecosystem members; and investing in the relational dimension enhances complementarity and trust while the ecosystem evolves. Thus, the interaction of these dimensions may further contribute to the sustainability of the university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem. Enhancing the development and application of the three social capital dimensions as an aspect of proactive management of the entrepreneurship ecosystem has the potential to improve outcomes for ecosystem members.","[Theodoraki, Christina; Messeghem, Karim] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier Management Inst, Vendemiaire St,CS 19519, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Rice, Mark P.] Worcester Polytech Inst, Foisie Business Sch, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",Universite de Montpellier; Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Theodoraki, C (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, Montpellier Management Inst, Vendemiaire St,CS 19519, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France.",christina.theodoraki@umontpellier.fr; karim.messeghem@umontpellier.fr; rice@wpi.edu,"Theodoraki, Christina/Q-8780-2018; Theodoraki, Christina/B-1031-2018","Theodoraki, Christina/0000-0002-1704-5630; Messeghem, Karim/0000-0002-7540-9914",LabEx Entreprendre; Agence Nationale de la Recherche under the Investissements d'Avenir program [ANR-10-LABX-11-01],LabEx Entreprendre; Agence Nationale de la Recherche under the Investissements d'Avenir program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),We are also grateful to LabEx Entreprendre for funding this study.

Value at risk (VaR) aggregates several components of asset risk into a single quantitative measurement and is commonly used in tail risk management. Due to realistic data limits, many practitioners might use the square-root-of-time rule (SRTR) to compute long-term VaR. However, serial dependence and heavy-tailedness can bias the SRTR. This paper addresses two deficiencies of the study by Wang et al. (2011), who propose the modified-SRTR (MSRTR) to partially correct the serial dependence and use subsampling estimation as the benchmark to verify the performance of MSRTR. First, we investigate the validity of the subsampling approach through numerical simulations. Second, to reduce the heavy-tailedness bias, we propose a new MSRTR approach (MSRTR*) in light of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). In the empirical study, 28 country-level exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from 2010 to 2015 are considered to estimate the 30-day VaR. After modifying both serial dependence and heavy-tailedness, our approach reduces the bias from 26.46% to 5.97%, on average, compared to the SRTR. We also provide a backtesting analysis to verify the robustness of the MSRTR*. This new approach should be considered when estimating long-term VaR using short-term VaR. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, according to China's latest national railway planning proposal - The Mid- and Long-term Railway Network Plan issued in 2016, the development prospects and impacting factors of future CHSRN from 2018 to 2030 are analyzed. The evolutionary process and regularity of CHSRN development is evaluated with various complex network measures. It is found that the degree and eccentricity of each Tier 1 city increase over time, but the pagerank of almost all Tier 1 cities decreases from 2007-2017 to 2018-2030, and that the contribution of the Tier 1 cities to the network connections decreases from 2007 to 2030. The Chinese government would be adopting an egalitarian model to construct the CHSRN in the long-term. Moreover, during the second period, the CHSRN would form increasingly more connections between more populated Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. From 2018-2030 the clustering coefficients of some Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities would be greater than those of Tier 1 cities. The HSR planners of China may have expected a larger share of passenger flows from the Tier 1 cities to Tiers 2 and 3 cities in the future.","[Xu, Wangtu (Ato)] Xiamen Univ, Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Dept Urban Planning, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jiangping] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Guo] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; University of Hong Kong; Beijing Jiaotong University,"Xu, WT (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Dept Urban Planning, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;Qiu, G (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",ato1981@xmu.edu.cn; zhoujp@hku.hk; 14114250@bjtu.edu.cn,"Zhou, Jiangping/AAA-9772-2020","Zhou, Jiangping/0000-0002-1623-5002; Xu, Ato/0000-0002-0790-821X",Humanity and Social Science Youth foundation of Ministry of Education of the Peoples Republic of China [12YJCZH237],Humanity and Social Science Youth foundation of Ministry of Education of the Peoples Republic of China,"We are particularly grateful to the three reviewers, for their valuable revision suggestions to this paper.

With a unique micro-level data from China, we construct a housing market sentiment index by applying the techniques in the finance literature. This index is significantly correlated with the confidence indexes from official sources. We find that housing market returns increase with contemporaneous sentiment, and high sentiment is followed by low returns. Tightening policies cannot reduce optimism, and high sentiment negatively impacts the effectiveness of tightening policies. This negative impact is especially significant in the zones where housing prices are sensitive to increasing sentiment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence that inequality in subjective well-being has an inverse-U relationship with per capita GDP, but it is monotonically decreasing with respect to mean subjective well-being.

Consumers' concerns about non-performance of the insurance provider have also been cited as a possible explanation for low demand of microinsurance. We provide a behavioral evaluation of the welfare effects of non-performance risk. We test the hypothesis that the presence of non-performance risk negatively impacts not just take-up of insurance but more importantly the welfare of the insured. We also test if violations of the reduction of compound lotteries axiom could drive this decrease in take-up and welfare. The results show that the compound risk characteristic of non-performance risk does not significantly decrease the welfare of insurance choices made by individuals. This counter-intuitive result is sensitive to the structural modeling of risk preferences. If one assumes the reduction of compound lotteries axiom does characterize behavior towards risk, one finds evidence that non-performance risk reduces welfare for the insured. But if one correctly allows for violations in that axiom in the representation of risk preferences, which is appropriate if one is going to test for the effect of compound risk from non-performance, then the counter-intuitive result is obtained. Take-up is not a reliable proxy for welfare, and the behavioral drivers of take-up are again not the same drivers of welfare. These results provide structural behavioral insight to inform normative policy design with respect to insurance regulation.","[Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Ng, Jia Min] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Cape Town,"Harrison, GW (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Harrison, GW (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Harrison, GW (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa.",gharrison@gsu.edu; jiamin.ng@outlook.com,,,,,,,55,11,14,0,6,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

The paper uses a framework drawn from the literature on institutional change to analyse the interplay between the formal governance structures and the other actors and organisations that have an influence on public transport, the formal and informal relationships between them, and how informal institutions emerge to increase the effectiveness with which public transport is delivered. By selecting countries with some similarities in institutional structure, it is possible to explore how relationships can differ even within a relatively similar overall framework for public transport. Drawing on qualitative research with actors in the different countries, the research explores how informal institutions help actors negotiate the constraints of formal, statutory institutions. Findings reveal that informal institutions smooth the critical interfaces where formal institutions were producing sub-optimal public transport, thus providing evidence that the two modes of governance are, in fact, highly complementary.","[Rye, Tom] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Transport Res Inst, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Monios, Jason] Kedge Business Sch, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Hrelja, Robert; Isaksson, Karolina] VTI Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Linkoping, Sweden; [Hrelja, Robert; Isaksson, Karolina] K2 Swedish Knowledge Ctr Publ Transport, Lund, Sweden",Edinburgh Napier University; Kedge Business School; VTI; Lund University,"Monios, J (通讯作者)，Kedge Business Sch, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13009 Marseille, France.",t.rye@napier.ac.uk; jason.monios@kedgebs.com; robert.hrelja@vti.se; karolina.isaksson@vti.se,"Hrelja, Robert/HGD-9302-2022; Hrelja, Robert D/E-6744-2011; Monios, Jason/U-4532-2018","Hrelja, Robert/0000-0002-9445-784X; Isaksson, Karolina/0000-0002-3613-7039",Swedish research funding organisation Vinnova [2013-03020]; Swedish National Public Transport Research Centre; Vinnova [2013-03020] Funding Source: Vinnova,Swedish research funding organisation Vinnova(Vinnova); Swedish National Public Transport Research Centre; Vinnova(Vinnova),"The work is part of a research project (Collaborative Models or Better Public Transport) funded by the Swedish research funding organisation Vinnova from 2013 to 2016 (Dnr 2013-03020) and carried out by researchers who are part of the Swedish National Public Transport Research Centre, K2 (www.k2centrum.se).

Conflicting interests and differing perceptions of the benefits of increased trade in EGs were reflected in different approaches proposed for determining EGs. Using import data of 34 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries and from a sample of 167 countries, from 1995 to 2012, we discuss the trade effect of reducing barriers on EGs. We analyze the lists of EGs proposed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and OECD using a Translog gravity model. We found that removing tariff barriers for EGs will have a modest impact because for the biggest importers and exporters, elasticities of trade costs are very low while for most trading relationships they are very high, making it difficult for exporters to maintain their markets. Overall, our results suggest that, because of their substantial effect on international trade, future negotiations on EGs should also address the issues of standards and nontariff barriers.","[Tamini, Lota D.] Laval Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Consumer Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Tamini, Lota D.; Sorgho, Zakaria] Laval Univ, CISITI, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Tamini, LD (通讯作者)，Laval Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Consumer Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.;Tamini, LD (通讯作者)，Laval Univ, CISITI, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",lota.tamini@eac.ulaval.ca; zakaria.sorgho@ecn.ulaval.ca,"Li, Wang/M-1612-2019; Sorgho, Zakaria/J-7934-2017","Tamini, Lota D./0000-0003-3423-3155; Sorgho, Zakaria/0000-0003-3211-2974",Fonds Quebecois de Recherche - Societe et Culture (FQRSC),Fonds Quebecois de Recherche - Societe et Culture (FQRSC),The authors wish to thank Vramah S.M.

Using generalized linear model estimation on state data from 1992 to 2012, we find evidence that fiscal decentralization improves infrastructure quality.

The performance gains are particularly stark when directors are geographically far from firm headquarters.

Our estimates suggest that these consequences are large, with fraternity membership lowering student grade point average by approximately 0.25 points on the traditional 4-point scale, but raising future income by approximately 36%, for those students whose decision about membership is affected by changes in the environment. These results suggest that fraternity membership causally produces large gains in social capital, which more than outweigh its negative effects on human capital for potential members. Alcohol-related behavior does not explain much of the effects of fraternity membership on either the human capital or social capital effects. These findings suggest that college administrators face significant trade-offs when crafting policies related to Greek life on campus.

For non-SOEs, we do not find such an adverse impact.

Exploiting variation in companies' marginal tax rates, we find a positive and substantial long-run tax effect on leverage. Leverage responds more to decreases in the marginal tax rate, and it responds to changes in the marginal rather than the average tax rate. Most importantly, we find that the marginal tax rate based on tax returns has greater explanatory power for companies' leverage than the marginal tax rate based on financial statements.

There was a fivefold increase in repo borrowing before the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Why? Did banks' dependence on non-resaleable debt precipitate the crisis? In this paper, we develop a model of bank lending with credit frictions. The key feature of the model is that debt claims are heterogenous in their resaleability. We find that decreasing credit market frictions leads to an increase in borrowing via non-resaleable debt. Such borrowing has a dark side: It causes credit chains to form, because, if a bank makes a loan via non resaleable debt and needs liquidity, it cannot sell the loan but must borrow via a new contract. These credit chains are a source of systemic risk, as one bank's default harms not only its creditors but also its creditors' creditors. Overall, our model suggests that reducing credit market frictions may have an adverse effect on the financial system and even lead to the failures of financial institutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike VC-backed IPO stocks, PE-backed IPO stocks do not experience a negative return or a trading volume jump on the lockup expiration date. PE investors do not reduce percentage ownership in the IPO firm as much as VC investors do after lockup expirations. Short selling in PE- and VC-backed IPO stocks prior to the lockup expiration date can predict PE and VC ownership reduction but not the stock returns after the lockup expires.

Further analysis shows that the impact of political uncertainty on tail risk is stronger in countries with poorer investor protection, fewer electoral checks and balances, more uncertain election outcomes and pro-business incumbent governments, in industries which are more politically sensitive, and in firms with larger information asymmetry.

We construct a dataset comprising all entrepreneurs/firms that have aired between August 2009 and May 2016. Our findings: (1) funding on the show seems to relax an internal financial constraint, rather than signal the quality of the venture to potential outside investors; (2) to the extent that the latter is occurring, there is plausible evidence that the signaling effect works in an unexpected direction for women entrepreneurs-it may crowd out attention from potential investors; (3) while it is fairly clear that this pitch competition is associated with longer-run existence of firms, it has no significant impacts on innovation; (4) there are no consistent differential impacts on racial/ethnic minorities.

This is done by understanding how discourses are simultaneously structured, disassembled and restructured according to power relations among stakeholders involved in the mining debate. Q methodology is used as a tool to assess the subjective perceptions of key stakeholders regarding mining projects in the country. Results highlight four distinct discourses: (1) responsible extractivism; (2) local self-determination; (3) national economic development; and (4) local economic development. Discursive analyses suggest that mining positions are constructed to contest power in: decision-making, the enactment of values and rights, and the uneven distribution of economic benefits and socio-environmental burdens associated with mining. The analysis also offers insights for enhancing conflict-resolution and depicting the political complexity associated with structural power inequalities among actors implicated in mining conflicts in the country.

This paper seeks to explore how a particular manufacturing SME in Kosovo organizes its processes on the daily basis and the challenges that currently faces in a fragile competition. This research embraces a qualitative single case study methodology in the context of manufacturing SMEs. The data collection comprises fourteen interviews. We also conducted observation within the organization supplemented by analysing different documents in order to have triangulation that could increase validity and reliability. This study helps theorists to emphasize more upon the criticality of manufacturing SMEs in building a strong case for future frameworks in order to demystify the overwhelming ideas that only managerial levels should be involved in the research domain for the case analysis especially in the manufacturing industry. Particularly in Kosovo where SMEs in the manufacturing sector are still struggling to recover and create a solid infrastructure for growth where the need for a broader integration in the analysis is indispensable in understanding the challenges and future alternatives of this sector. We intend helping managers, employees and wider practitioners to understand the importance of mutual task responsibilities; developing an integrated cooperation process; emphasizing the criticality of avoiding the orthodox approach of a managerial leading style, and transforming it into a new orthopraxy of ensuring that an internal employee involvement and participation is the key to articulating the necessary efforts of organizational success.","[Veliu, Liridon; Manxhari, Mimoza] Univ Tirana, Fac Econ, Sheshi NeneTereza 183, Tirana 10000, Albania; [Veliu, Liridon; Podvorica, Neshat; Hyesni, Valon] Univ Prishtina Hasan Prishtina, Fac Econ, Rr Agim Ramadani Pn, Prishtine 10000, Kosovo; [Fejza, Ejup] Universum Coll, Prishtina, Kosovo; [Fejza, Ejup] St NikPrelaj, Objektii Beni Dones Prishtine, Prishtine, Kosovo",University of Tirana (UT),"Podvorica, N (通讯作者)，Univ Prishtina Hasan Prishtina, Fac Econ, Rr Agim Ramadani Pn, Prishtine 10000, Kosovo.",liridon.veliu@uni-pr.edu; mmanxhari@yahoo.com; podvorica.neshat@gmail.com; ejup.fejza@universum-ks.org; valonhyseni@hotmail.com,"Veliu, Liridon/ABA-7554-2020","Veliu, Liridon/0009-0009-2841-1075; Manxhari, Mimoza/0009-0008-0450-9951",,,,,54,4,6,0,8,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

The results remain persistent for both the sub-period analysis and the analysis excluding crisis periods.

We pay particular attention to the role played by market potential and agglomeration economies as decisive factors in location. We also analyze whether, beyond the observed attributes, there are any significant differences across regions in terms of attracting foreign affiliates. With this aim, we estimate a mixed logit model, which allows us to endogenously consider the existence of complex substitution patterns among different destinations. Our results confirm that Spanish investment in developing and transition countries depends on market potential and agglomeration externalities. The intensity of these externalities, however, depends on the nationality of competitors, greater rivalry being observed among Spanish-owned affiliates. Furthermore, our findings show that the location of multinational firms responds both to factors related to the local business environment, including the cost and quality of labor and infrastructures, and to the existence of specific regional effects.","[Alguacil, Maite; Marti, Josep; Orts, Vicente] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Martí, J (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",arnauj@uji.es,"Alguacil, Maite/K-9815-2014; Alguacil, Maite/AAA-2338-2019; Orts, Vicente/K-5921-2014","Alguacil, Maite/0000-0002-6501-9170; Alguacil, Maite/0000-0002-6501-9170; Orts, Vicente/0000-0003-1708-9868",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-58975-P]; University Jaume I [UJI-B2016-53],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); University Jaume I,Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Grant No. ECO2014-58975-P; University Jaume I Grant No. UJI-B2016-53,,72,1,1,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We focus on three major episodes of reputational distress: the Enron/WorldCom scandals, the subprime crisis and the lawsuit against Standard&Poor's. We document a stronger response of stock investors to downgrades in the aftermath of reputational shocks, which is not, however, accompanied by an improvement in rating quality. Our results are consistent with a scenario where, following evidence of misrating, market investors conclude that ratings are generally overstated and infer greater negative information from downgrades. The effect is stronger for the investment-grade segment, where rating errors have a wider reputational impact. The introduction of new regulatory measures such the SOX Act, the CRA Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, seems instead to improve rating quality and soften investors' response. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A fundamental-based run imposes market discipline on insolvent banks, but a panic-based run closes banks that could have survived with better coordination among creditors. We augment a bank-run model with the bank's reporting choices. We show that banks with intermediate fundamentals have stronger incentive to misreport than those in the two tails. Moreover, reporting discretion reduces panic-based runs, but excessive discretion also reduces fundamental-based runs. The optimal amount of reporting discretion increases in the bank's vulnerability to panic-based runs. Finally, a given bank's opportunistic use of reporting discretion exerts a negative externality on other banks. Our paper answers the call by Armstrong et al. (2016) and Bushman (2016) to understand better the effects of banks' special features on their reporting choices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Excess co-movement appears when commodity prices remain correlated even after adjusting for the impact of fundamentals. We use recent developments in large approximate factor models to consider a richer information set and adequately model these fundamentals. We consider a set of eight unrelated commodities along with 184 real and nominal macroeconomic variables, from developed and emerging economies, from which nine factors are extracted over the 1993-2013 period. Our estimates provide evidence of time-varying excess co-movement which is particularly high after 2007. We further show that speculative intensity is a driver of the estimated excess comovement, as speculative trading is both correlated across the commodity futures markets and correlated with the futures prices. Our results can be taken as direct evidence of the significant impact of financialization on commodity-price crossmoments.

Under DAU, the objective function consists of total intergenerational well-being divided by the present discounted sum of population from the present to the future. It is shown that, in order for an economy to be on a sustainable path, inclusive wealth should grow at a rate higher than the difference between the discount rate and the share of current population of the discounted future population. Our application to the inclusive wealth index shows that, among other results, the DAU criterion changes sustainability assessments for some developing countries with future demographic change, implying that wealth does not accumulate sufficiently in light of DAU.

The Third Elementary Education Project (TEEP) intervention introduced a package of investments and management reforms at the school level, including classroom constructions, textbooks, teacher training, and school-based management in the period of 2000 to 2006. The impacts on subsequent schooling investments and labor market earnings differ between females and males. The intervention significantly increased earnings among females, which reduced the existing wage gap by gender. However, the findings on schooling outcomes are mixed; the gender gap tended to widen, enhancing females' existing relative advantage in schooling, though their impacts are insignificant for both females and males.","[Yamauchi, Futoshi] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Liu, Yanyan] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",The World Bank; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Yamauchi, F (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",fyamauchi@worldbank.org,,,,,,,36,3,3,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Some perspectives suggest that resource wealth is associated with political apathy, while others indicate that resource wealth fosters violent civil conflicts. We leverage these seemingly contradictory impacts of natural resources on society by expanding the scope of inquiry to explore different types of resource wealth (oil and minerals) as well as other dimensions of political life (protest). Utilising a global dataset for the period 1950-2006, we test the impact of resource wealth on mobilisation. We find that while oil wealth demobilises citizens in all regime types, mineral wealth strongly correlates with higher levels of mobilisation in democracies, though not in autocracies. In addition, using survey data, we examine individual-level attitudes toward protest participation in two resource-rich states, Peru and Ecuador. The results indicate that an individual living in a mineral-rich country like Peru is more likely to participate in a protest compared to an individual living in an oil-rich country like Ecuador. Our findings highlight the contributions of the resource activism framework for understanding the connection between natural resources and mobilisation.","[Arce, Moises; Miller, Rebecca E.; Patane, Christopher F.] Univ Missouri Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, 113 Profess Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Polizzi, Marc S.] Murray State Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, Murray, KY 42071 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Murray State University,"Arce, M (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, 113 Profess Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",arcem@missouri.edu,,"Patane, Christopher/0000-0002-2338-9675; Polizzi, Marc/0000-0001-7546-3788",,,,,72,6,7,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Our results highlights how bidding ROSCAs can be a versatile device that provide profitable savings while allowing for emergency credit.","[Bauchet, Jonathan; Larsen, Vance] Purdue Univ, Dept Consumer Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Bauchet, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, 812 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jbauchet@purdue.edu,,"Larsen, Vance/0000-0003-3918-2027; Bauchet, Jonathan/0000-0002-0583-5678",Clifford B.

Little is known, however, about the pros and cons of different approaches to define scale and zoning schemes in bikesharing evaluation. This research begins to address this challenge by juxtaposing station-level and community-level approaches to model and estimate the Annual Average Daily Bicyclist (AADB). We use the demand information from 459 Divvy stations in Chicago between June 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016 to assess the aggregation approaches concerning variable impacts, model specification, and prediction accuracy. Elasticity calculations, prediction error comparisons, and influence analysis reveal the importance of both built environment and sociodemographic variables in bikeshare modeling and the need to develop context-sensitive interventions. The detailed comparison of different levels of aggregation for analysis of bikeshare demand and user impact highlights that each level contributes insights to planners and policymakers. While the disaggregate approach provides the most information for planners in terms of improving bikeshare systems, there is value in adopting an aggregated approach for transport policy that accounts for potential neighborhood effects. In addition, the control for socio-demographic factors around stations highlights the variation in socio-spatial effects that planners need to account for when measuring outcomes and equity impacts.","[Biehl, Alec; Ermagun, Alireza; Stathopoulos, Amanda] Northwestern Univ, McCormick Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Stathopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, McCormick Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",alecbiehl2019@u.northwestern.edu; alireza.ermagun@northwestem.edu; a-stathopoulos@northwestem.edu,"Stathopoulos, Amanda/K-2386-2014; Stathopoulos, Amanda/GWM-4799-2022","Biehl, Alec/0000-0001-7913-4252",,,,,51,35,45,2,51,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our model shows that as long as the mortgage interest rate exceeds the risk-free rate: (i) mortgage debt diminishes the likelihood of entrepreneurship by amplifying risk aversion; and (ii) the negative relation between mortgage debt and entrepreneurship increases with income volatility. Our model also shows that the link between housing equity and entrepreneurship is ambiguously signed because of competing portfolio and wealth effects. We use the British Household Panel Survey to test and confirm the model predictions, and deal with unobservable heterogeneity employing three research designs individual fixed effects, housing-spell fixed effects, and instrumental variables. A one standard deviation increase in leverage reduces the probability of entrepreneurship by 10-20 percent.","[Bracke, Philippe] London Sch Econ, Bank England, London, England; [Bracke, Philippe; Hilber, Christian A.

The Fed was established to bring an end to the frequent crises that plagued the U.S. banking system, which reform proponents attributed to the nation's inelastic currency stock and dependence on interbank relationships to allocate liquidity and operate the payments system. Reform advocates noted that banking panics tended to occur at times of the year when the demands for currency and bank loans were normally at seasonal peaks and money markets were at their tightest. Moreover, they blamed the interbank system, upon which the banking system depended for seasonal accommodation and interregional payments, for transmitting shocks throughout the banking system. The article finds that after the Fed's founding, country national banks were much less dependent on correspondent banks for seasonal liquidity and that peaks in lending by individual Reserve Banks aligned with the liquidity needs of banks in their districts. Further, the article shows that after the Fed's founding, banks generally were less liquid and relied more heavily on deposits for funding, consistent with the idea that banks viewed the Fed as a reliable source of liquidity. The return of banking panics during the Great Depression, however, showed that the Fed was not, in fact, up to the challenge of serving as a full-fledged lender of last resort.","[Carlson, Mark] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Wheelock, David C.] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63106 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Carlson, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",,"Wheelock, David C/I-5757-2016","Carlson, Mark/0000-0002-9261-9702",,,,,33,1,2,0,1,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

This paper uses a theoretical framework of the game to analyze the welfare of a single country under different settlement mechanisms and the total welfare status of the world from the perspective of the difference between the state and the type of trade product market. As a result, it has been found that for large countries with market power, the fewer the participating countries are, the better the mechanism is for them, and for smaller countries that do not have market power, the more participating countries are, the more beneficial the mechanism is, and the mechanism for multinational participation is also more effectively beneficial for the world's total welfare. Therefore, when choosing a trade dispute resolution mechanism, China must make a reasonable choice based on the market competition of the disputed commodities and the price influence and control ability; from the perspective of the market characteristics of most of China's export commodities, and the mechanisms for more countries to participate may be more favorable.","[Chen, Ning] Fuzhou Univ Int Studies & Trade, Dept Econ & Trade, Fuzhou 350202, Fujian, Peoples R China",,"Chen, N (通讯作者)，Fuzhou Univ Int Studies & Trade, Dept Econ & Trade, Fuzhou 350202, Fujian, Peoples R China.",,"Chen, Ningyuan/A-8440-2017",,Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Science Research Fund Project: Socialist Core Values to Promote China Study on the Path of Inter-Discourse Rights [15YJA710002],Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Science Research Fund Project: Socialist Core Values to Promote China Study on the Path of Inter-Discourse Rights,Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Science Research Fund Project: Socialist Core Values to Promote China Study on the Path of Inter-Discourse Rights.; Project Number: 15YJA710002,,5,0,0,0,1,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-05-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,227,230,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450396400050,0

In order to accomplish this task, we examine the make-or-buy decision of juice-processing firms in procurement of inputs (fruits), through a 15-year panel of five firms (more than 90% of the market). Empirical results offer new theoretical insights on role of market power in vertical integration decision.

Findings A synthesis of the key literature reveals three broad analytical foci: the sources of political risk; the effects of political risk; and actors' (countries, industries, firms and projects) vulnerabilities, capabilities and responses to political risk. Research limitations/implications The authors propose a unifying conceptual framework for political risk research. Practical implications The paper provides managers with a tool kit to analyse political risk. Moreover, it aids policy-makers in addressing political risk in a comprehensive manner. Originality/value The paper represents the first systematic review of the political risk literature in over 30 years.

We set up the position of beverage industry in the industrial structure of the Czech Republic and subsequently and we look into used practices of non-financial reporting. Companies in our sample are predominantly SMEs, although some of them are linked with parent companies listed on international stock exchanges or are parts of bigger groupings. Using qualitative methodology we have assessed the narrative statements related to 11 non-financial characteristics of relevant companies and subsequently we have calculated the correlation of strength of non-financial reporting with several absolute indicators and financial ratios.

However, non-financial reporting is weakly positively linked with the size and age of the company, and it is weakly negatively associated with company indebtedness. At the same time, the non-financial reporting measures are independent on profitability indicators ROE and ROA.","[Jindrichovska, Irena] Angloamer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kubickova, Dana; Nulicek, Vladimir] Univ Finance & Adm, Prague, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University; University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Jindrichovská, I (通讯作者)，Angloamer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic.",irena.jindrichovska@aauni.edu; dana.kubickova@centrum.cz; vnulicek@gmail.com,"Nulícek, Vladimír/KCK-9802-2024; Kubickova, Dana/F-5098-2013","Nulícek, Vladimír/0000-0002-9245-1479;","Anglo-American University; Research project IGA VSFS Integrated reporting and its place in condition of business in CR - institutional support for long-term strategic development of research organization University of Finance and Administration, Prague","Anglo-American University; Research project IGA VSFS Integrated reporting and its place in condition of business in CR - institutional support for long-term strategic development of research organization University of Finance and Administration, Prague","This paper was prepared with the support of the Anglo-American University, z.u.

Nonetheless, it is well documented that the Euro/American psychology paradigm is challenged by its tendency to universalise its theories. This raises a challenge for development scholars trying to measure the psychological domain; especially regarding understanding what the psychological domain may mean to people outside the Western liberal tradition. We examine the use of theoretical measures of psychological agency against local concepts of psychological agency from a neighbourhood on the urban fringe of Bamako. We conclude that there is no clear association between local and theoretical measures of psychological agency and therefore there is a need to include local and theoretical measures in the study of agency.","[Klein, Elise] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Ballon, Paola] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",University of Melbourne; University of Oxford,"Klein, E (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",elise.klein@unimelb.edu.au,"Ballon, Paola/I-4851-2015","Ballon, Paola/0000-0002-0373-171X","Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative; Department of International Development, University of Oxford; [JEDC/2015-2]","Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative; Department of International Development, University of Oxford;","Paola Ballon acknowledges financial support from grant JEDC/2015-2 and Elise Klein acknowledges a fieldwork grant given by Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative and by the Department of International Development, University of Oxford.",,61,6,6,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This paper focuses on agricultural services used by farms specializing in horticultural production. The objective of the study was to identify the output of agricultural services used by farms specializing in horticultural production in European Union countries in 2004-2016. The study was based on a deductive and comparative method and relied on FADN data; also used were correlation indexes. In the group of farms covered by this study, the use of agricultural services may be found to depend on two basic factors. The first one is the farms' development level and the intensity and structure of production activities. The differences between EU-12 and EU-7 countries suggest that national specificities of horticultural production and local farming patterns are at least as important as the development level. Another significant factor is the availability of the farms' own machinery and the amount of labour engaged in production. However, own equipment and service use were not found to be substitutes, whereas companies with large resources of productive inputs usually incurred higher service costs. Also, as the demand for labour grows, so does the demand for services. This suggests that services are complementary rather than substitute to physical capital.","[Kolodziejczak, Malgorzata] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Kolodziejczak, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland.",,"Kołodziejczak, Małgorzata/ABE-9746-2020","Kołodziejczak, Małgorzata/0000-0001-5615-5560",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-77-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,234,242,,10.20472/EFC.2018.010.017,0.0,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505164900017,0

Our examination is divided into two stages. In the first stage, we use the M-score model developed by Beneish (1999) to calculate the extent to which earnings are manipulated by Thai construction companies listed in the SET during the past ten years. This will allow us to ascertain the level of earnings management engaged by these firms during several critical periods, e.g., the period before the US subprime mortgage crisis arose, during the crisis period, and the post-crisis period, and in addition, the period before the political crisis leading to an establishment of the military government and the period after. The second stage of our examination deals with potential macroeconomic factors that affect the probability of earnings manipulation revealed by construction companies. These variables include cement materials price index, steel material price index, fixed capital formation, gross domestic product. Our control variables include total accruals to total assets ratio, debt to equity ratio, market capitalization, and return on assets. Our preliminary results reveal that reveals that the level of earnings management in the construction sector of the SET exceeds the benchmark M-score value of -2.22 in the second and third quarters of 2009 (during the subprime crisis). This phenomenon is encouraging especially for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Thailand. It implies that the SEC's strict reporting regulations have resulted in the level of earnings manipulation in the construction sector of Thailand being low recently. Nevertheless, Thai construction firms have shown an incentive to conduct earnings manipulation activities during the global financial crisis period. Further analysis shows that debt to equity ratio, market capitalization, and steel materials price index are negatively related to the manipulation index at the 95% confidence level. Only the total accruals to total assets ratio is positively related to the manipulation index at the 95% confidence level. On the other hand, return on assets, cement materials price index, gross domestic product, gross domestic fixed capital formation, and the SET index are found to exert no significant influence over the manipulation index.","[Koowattanatianchai, Nattawoot] Kasetsart Univ, Bangkok, Thailand",Kasetsart University,"Koowattanatianchai, N (通讯作者)，Kasetsart Univ, Bangkok, Thailand.",,,,,,,,46,4,4,0,4,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-6044,,978-80-87927-53-3,PROC ECON FINAN CONF,,,2018,,,,,,,101,117,,10.20472/EFC.2018.009.008,0.0,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505163200008,0

One area not vigorously pursued in understanding the farmers' adoption process is the role that farmer classification of on-farm soils plays in adoption and impact of sustainable technologies such as the fertiliser trees. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate adoption rates and impact of fertiliser trees on heterogeneous soil types according to farmers' classifications. Using data randomly collected from 324 households in the 2011 farming season in Chongwe district of Zambia, it was found that farmers were able to classify the dominant soils on their farms into sandy, clay, sand loamy and loamy soils. Most of the farmers (60%) who perceived their soils to be sandy also indicated facing soil fertility challenges. Perception of being on sandy soils was significantly associated with adoption of the fertiliser trees. Propensity score estimates showed that the technology significantly increased maize productivity on soils perceived to be sandy and sand loamy. The non-significant impact results of the technology on relatively perceived high fertile loamy and clay soils could be indicative of diminishing marginal effect of the technology on already fertile soils. Although adoption of the technology on relatively fertile soils is important for fertility sustainability, its promotion on farms with degraded soils could ensure full expression of its potential, and hence, increase its adoptability chances. Targeting of farmers who receive fertiliser tree seedlings should embrace this condition.","[Kuntashula, Elias; Nhlane, Robert; Chisola, Fulayi] Univ Zambia, Sch Agr Sci, Agr Econ & Exten, POB 32379, Lusaka 10101, Zambia",University of Zambia,"Kuntashula, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zambia, Sch Agr Sci, Agr Econ & Exten, POB 32379, Lusaka 10101, Zambia.",ekuntashula@yahoo.com,"nhlane, robert/AAF-1965-2020",,,,,,30,3,3,1,7,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2018,57.0,2,,,,,137,151,,10.1080/03031853.2018.1471406,0.0,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,GO1JO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439707400005,0

The intent was finalised following a referendum in June 2016 with the activation of art. 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon governing the right of states to decide to withdraw from the EU. Thus, on March 29, 2017, the London government began the withdrawal procedures from the EU. There are numerous and complicated economic, social, and legal consequences if the UK maintains its withdrawal position, although until the end of the transitional period (ending on 31 of December, 2020) it is possible to abandon this position and remain in the European Union. The Eurosceptic current is present, escapes from the economic and social spheres to contaminate the level of political life, putting the British in the face of a new dilemma: to remain in the EU with the renegotiation of Britain's position or leaving the Union. The general perception was that the first solution is extremely difficult, so difficult to achieve practically. Therefore, the exit solution was preferred, with extremely serious consequences (some unpredictable) on social, economic and legal realities. The legal consequences are felt on two levels: the one of British modern law and the one derived from the ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights. Under British modern law, the legal sources are in increasing order of importance: common law and statute law. Britain's accession to community life structures had the greatest impact on the British legal order, which had to be harmonized with Community regulations, creating new sources of law. The present article insists on the major influences of Brexit on the rule of law in the UK.","[Larion, Alina-Paula] Univ Stefan Cel Mare, Law, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Larion, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Stefan Cel Mare, Law, Suceava, Romania.",lariona@seap.usv.ro,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"2, TEPES VODA STR, IASI, 700 714, ROMANIA",,,978-1-910129-18-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,40,48,,10.18662/lumproc.60,0.0,,,9,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM9BY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470307900005,0

Swarm intelligent algorithms are regarded as promising approach to complex port logistics optimization problems. Wolf pack algorithm (WPA) is a newly proposed algorithm, which has been widely applied in many fields such as automated container terminals, port logistics optimization, and regional economic planning. However, defects still exist in WPA. Aiming at the defects of WPA, such as fixed scouting direction and R artificial wolves with worst function values will directly be removed, an improved wolf pack algorithm named RHWPA is proposed based on random scouting direction and hunger value strategy. During each scouting, fixed directions h is selected randomly within a certain range. It can avoid the scout wolves falling into local optima, and improve the convergence speed and optimization precision.

Binary logistic regression and bivariate correlation analysis were used in this study. The results suggested that age, education level, vegetables cultivated area and membership in farmer groups/cooperatives were the key determinants that had significant effects on the smallholder farmers' decision about marketing channel participation. In addition, the income generated from vegetable farming was positively correlated to high value market participation.

The budget deficit has been kept under control and government debt is low relative to that of many other countries. Nevertheless, this sound macroeconomic performance is now under threat because the government's aversion to depreciation of the currency has led it to introduce unnecessary contractionary fiscal measuresincluding cutbacks of spending on infrastructure on which output growth depends. Along with many other currencies, the rupiah has depreciated significantly throughout much of 2018despite the attempts of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, to prevent thispartly because of rapidly growing imports, but also because of a reversal of portfolio capital inflow. This reversal reflects various factors, including Bank Indonesia's policy, until recently, of pushing interest rates down while global interest rates have been rising; fear that rapid depreciation in poorly managed economies such as Turkey and Argentina may prove contagious; market recognition that expansion of the current account deficit is likely to require depreciation beyond that desired by the central bank; and concern that the forthcoming presidential election creates conditions in which it will be difficult to pursue sound economic policies. This survey discusses the rather unexpected currency depreciation and associated selling pressure in the stock exchange in detail before going on to provide evaluations of, and suggestions in relation to, a range of microeconomic policies, including infrastructure development; the provision of subsidised loans to small businesses; the fiscal aspects of decentralisation; minimum wages; and management of the bureaucracy. To a large extent, most of these policies can be characterised as reflecting a distrust of market forces, including a reluctance to adopt market-mimicking processes in the public sectorspecifically, in relation to the funding of local governments, and to the staffing of the bureaucracy. From another perspective, the adoption of a wide variety of objectives for economic policy reflects the absence of any consistent analytical framework, making it highly likely that policies will turn out to be mutually inconsistent and, in particular, that they will conflict with the ultimate economic objective of increasing living standards, especially those of the poor.","[McLeod, Ross H.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Rosdaniah, Sitta] Indonesian Minist State Owned Enterprises, Jakarta, Indonesia",Australian National University,"McLeod, RH (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,28,5,5,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The increase in terrorist attacks in the world, migration problems in Europe and the more frequent targeting of tourist destinations has meant that the inhabitants of the European Union becoming more aware of terrorist threats in the tourism sector. For some people this may be the reason for avoiding tourist destinations that are considered dangerous, traveling rather to generally considered more secure places, while for others it is an opportunity to travel cheaper as prices to these less secure destinations are often discounted. The pilot survey, which was used to determine the declared preferences of tourists in Lithuania and Poland, indicated that they are different. In the context of the emerging new field of science, which is neurotourism, it was decided to use a scientific experiment using cognitive neuroscience methods to assess the preferences of tourists at the subconscious level. In addition, the chapter will indicate the reasons why such methods are recommended for this type of study (supported by the results of pilot surveys).","[Nagaj, Rafal] Univ Szczecin, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland; [Zuromskaite, Brigita] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Ateities 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Szczecin; Mykolas Romeris University,"Nagaj, R (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",rafal.nagaj@usz.edu.pl; brigitaz@mruni.eu,"Nagaj, Rafał/ABF-2791-2020; Žuromskaitė, Brigita/AAS-5581-2021","Nagaj, Rafał/0000-0002-9410-7663; Žuromskaitė, Brigita/0000-0002-6837-344X",,,,,45,1,1,4,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-99187-0; 978-3-319-99186-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,313,330,,10.1007/978-3-319-99187-0_23,0.0,,,18,Behavioral Sciences; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Behavioral Sciences; Business & Economics,BM1WR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000460629400023,0

In a culture of social media and fast spreading information, an adequate public reaction on crises in a firm is necessary and, in some cases, even vital for firms. One of such a reaction is an apology, which can calm the situation, provide some reassurance to stakeholders and prevent a possible escalation of conflicts and further cost risks. The general question of this paper is what apologies contain and how are crafted in a business context. Assumptions about the nature of apologies and its usage are made from speech act theory and theories of argumentation as well as from management theories, especially image, and crises management theory. These assumptions are compared with analyses of selected real examples of apologies made by organizations in last decade. The thesis is that the speech act theory gives a good account what any apology should contain, argumentation theory presents what tools are going to be used in an apology and management theories presents other goals which can be attached to an apology in a business context.","[Ondracek, Tomas] Masaryk Univ, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Ondrácek, T (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",ondracek.t@mail.muni.cz,"Ondracek, Tomas/AAB-9274-2020","Ondracek, Tomas/0000-0003-3026-0455",,,,,17,0,0,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-9164-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,167,174,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1EW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000495441500022,0

Depending on the type of campaign we're running, some of these channels will be more relevant than others. Thinking about which networks our target audience is most likely to be active on and start building an online presence in the appropriate spaces. Social media is one of the best ways to spread the word about campaign in advertising and promotion. Once we've created the accounts we want to use, we were regularly rotating content, such as news, blog posts, images, videos or quotes. Consistently posting interesting, relevant content helped engaging with our followers and starting to build an online community.

Otherwise, as the authors' research shows, the integration processes will be challenged by the locals and can cause disintegrating intentions.

We take advantage of data collected from a 17-month evaluation of a sample of households eligible to receive SCTP, which also provided information about inclusion into FISP. We estimate two types of synergies: i) the complementarity between SCTP and FISP, that is whether the impact of both interventions run together is larger than the sum of the impacts of these interventions when run separately, and ii) the incremental impact of receiving FISP when a household already receives SCTP, as well as the incremental impact of receiving SCTP when a household already receives FISP. The analysis shows that there are synergies between the two policy interventions, mainly in terms of incremental impacts of each programme over the other, in increasing expenditure, agricultural production and livestock.","[Pace, Noemi] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Pace, Noemi; Daidone, Silvio; Knowles, Marco] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Social Policies & Rural Inst Div ESP, Rome, Italy; [Davis, Benjamin] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Rome, Italy; [Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Pickmans, Robert] Univ Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA USA",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Pace, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",n.pace@unive.it,"Daidone, Silvio/AAJ-4490-2021; Daidone, Silvio/ABC-5526-2021","Daidone, Silvio/0000-0002-1789-5635",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD050924] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,47,12,12,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This paper presents a normative utility-efficient programming (UEP) approach, calculating optimal farm plans for apple growers in two different regions of Germany. It takes weather-related quality and yield risks, as well as price risks into account. It is based on risk attitude and risk perception collected from a sample of 134 apple growers. After combining subjective estimates of the apple growers with relevant historical data, input data for the UEP-model were derived from Monte-Carlo simulations. The UEP-model determines optimal portfolios, consisting of combinations of apple varieties and risk management instruments. The results indicate that the degrees of risk aversion affect optimum farming strategies only to a minor extent. They also provide evidence that farmers would benefit from a combined frost-hail insurance, whereas the absence of frost irrigation systems may cause high yield-losses in the northern part of Germany.","[Roehrig, Mann B.

Using a novel approach and nationwide sample survey, we measure various aspects of migrant networks such as size, diversity, efficiency and experience content and estimate their effect on probability of employment. Our findings suggest that migrant stock (having experience content) has an inverted-U relationship with the probability of finding a job for a migrant. The share of employed workers in a migrant network (efficiency) and different origin identity (diversity) positively affect the employment outcome through weak ties. Further, the migrant network effect is more active in larger cities as compared to smaller urban areas. The implications of this study indicate towards the importance of non-market informal channels in job searches and the need for integrating labour markets to harness the benefits of larger positive network externalities.","[Sharma, Ajay] Indian Inst Management, Dept Econ, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Das, Mousumi] Inst Financial Management & Res, Sri City, India; [Das, Mousumi] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Indore; KREA University; IFMR - Graduate School of Business (GSB),"Sharma, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Indore, J-206,Acad Block,Rau Pithampur Rd, Indore 453556, MP, India.",ajays@iimidr.ac.in,"Sharma, Ajay/AGL-1396-2022","Sharma, Ajay/0000-0001-5150-299X",Sir Dorabji Tata Trust; Allied Trusts,Sir Dorabji Tata Trust; Allied Trusts,This work was supported by the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Allied Trusts.,,21,3,4,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Reduced default risk helps the stock market rebound during the post-crisis period. Both internal governance variables, including institutional and insider ownership, board composition and CEO power, and external regulatory factors, are examined and they show significant effect on default risk. In addition, the impacts of various governance variables are continent-specific: they have a higher impact on default risk for Asian firms than for European firms. Regulatory factors are important moderators of the governance mechanisms for banks: higher Tier 1 capital ratios reduce both CDS and fundamental default risk; recipients of secret emergency loans from the US Federal Reserve System (the Fed) exhibit lower CDS spreads post-crisis but higher fundamental default probabilities.

Total orange production in the State of Florida during the 2015-16 season was the smallest crop since the 1960s due mainly to a disease known as citrus greening. Marketers were also facing consumers' concerns regarding high levels of calories and sugar in some juice categories. Furthermore, on May 2016, the Food and Drug Administration mandated a change in the nutrition facts label on packaged food, becoming effective in the summer of 2018, which may impact marketers in the sector.","[Trejo-Pech, Carlos Omar] Univ Tennessee, Inst Agr, Agribusiness Finance, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 2621 Morgan Circle Dr,308D Morgan Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Trejo-Pech, Carlos Omar] Univ Panamer Guadalajara, Escuela Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Calz Circ Pte 49, Zapopan 45010, Jalisco, Mexico; [Spreen, Thomas H.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [House, Lisa A.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ, 1083 MCCB,POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [House, Lisa A.] Univ Florida, Florida Agr Market Res Ctr, 1083 MCCB,POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Trejo-Pech, CO (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Inst Agr, Agribusiness Finance, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 2621 Morgan Circle Dr,308D Morgan Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.;Trejo-Pech, CO (通讯作者)，Univ Panamer Guadalajara, Escuela Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Calz Circ Pte 49, Zapopan 45010, Jalisco, Mexico.",ctrejope@utk.edu,"House, Lisa/V-5724-2017","House, Lisa/0000-0002-1901-6550; Trejo-Pech, Carlos/0000-0003-4888-2367","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Multi-State project [1012420]","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Multi-State project","Carlos Trejo-Pech acknowledges that this work was partially supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Multi-State project 1012420.",,24,2,2,1,11,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Companies being aware of the importance of personnel attendance to overcome the problems raised from manual attendance systems have started to take advantage of biometric systems. Particularly, fingerprint and facial recognition are the two most used forms for biometric identification, since it is considered as the most reliable and secure method in terms of its uniqueness. Because manual attendance systems are time-consuming and ineffective, companies review their control mechanisms for personnel attendance to integrate new technologies in their operations. This article proposes a new generation technological structure used to get effective results in personnel attendance systems. There are plenty of personnel attendance control systems in the market both for multinational companies or small companies. However, the number of web-based form of these systems is limited. Web-based personnel attendance control systems is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing technologies that enables instant data flow and reporting. According to the literature reviewed, more and more companies in Turkey have benefited over the time from web-based personnel attendance control systems. Nevertheless, there are not enough researches about it. The aim of this article is to design and implement a web-based attendance system for personnel in an organization by using biometric system (fingerprints and facial recognition combining with RFID card and password authentication) and support managers to make effective and efficient decision-making process. The proposed system has been implemented by following the steps of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). In the process of software development, a waterfall model was chosen that was used in many software projects and that composed of analysis, design, coding, test, version and maintenance phases. Since it is a linear sequential, progress is seen as flowing steadily downward (like a waterfall) through the phases of software implementation. Even though the waterfall approach is the earliest approach, it is still most widely known for software development. This research is expected to help managers in educational institutions in terms of effective personnel management, especially for institutions that have large number of employees. In addition, the developed system can also help educational institutions for adopting their personnel attendance system to new technologies. It was also known that private organizations use this kind of systems. However, educational institutions can also take advantage of biometric data in the web-based personnel management system.","[Unal, Ceyda; Tecim, Vahap] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Unal, C (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Izmir, Turkey.",ceyda.unal@deu.edu.tr,"Tecim, Vahap/AAC-4081-2019; Ünal, Ceyda/ABB-5754-2020",,,,,,13,3,3,0,3,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,221,232,,10.18502/kss.v3i10.3540,0.0,,,12,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7SJ,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455399000014,0

Although this scheme has come a long way in protecting the value embedded in the name 'Karoo', many challenges and loopholes for non-compliance still exist. These challenges include opportunistic behaviour on the farmers' side regarding the vulnerable free range claim as well as inconsistent supply and mismatched objectives of supply chain stakeholders. Because of these challenges the niche product has not yet come to its own. The purpose of this case study is threefold. Firstly, to understand the notion of Karoo Lamb as a geographical indication, and the subsequent establishment of the Karoo Meat of Origin certification scheme. Secondly, to identify and understand both the institutional and supply chain challenges that Karoo Lamb is faced with. Thirdly, to guide the certification scheme to evaluate their modus operandi for better regulation. Ultimately, the managerial decisions are expected to come full circle; if the certification scheme is better-managed consumers may be willing to pay higher premiums which might, in turn, convince farmers to become part of this prestigious certification scheme.","[van der Merwe, Melissa] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Lynnwood Rd, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Kirsten, Johann F.] Stellenbosch Univ, Bur Econ Res, Van Riebeeck St 10, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Trienekens, Jacques H.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Chain & Network Management Studies, Dept Management Studies & Social Sci, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Pretoria; Stellenbosch University; Wageningen University & Research,"van der Merwe, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Lynnwood Rd, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",melissa.vandermerwe@up.ac.za,"Kirsten, Johann/AAC-8055-2019; trienekens, jacques/JFA-0126-2023; van der Merwe, Melissa/J-9545-2019",,Red Meat Research and Development SA; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Red Meat Research and Development SA; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),The authors would like to extend their appreciation to the Karoo farmers for sharing their valuable insights about the Karoo Meat of Origin certification scheme and for sharing their Karoo Lamb production knowledge.

At the beginning of its activity, adult vocational training in Romania was developing on a superficial and small market. Demand was dominated by the small individual consumer with low solvency, generally influenced by costs and not by quality. Romania's accession to the European Union and the adoption of European documents in the field of lifelong learning have led to a certain development of the adult vocational training market. Economic changes have highlighted the fact that training is necessary for employed persons to be competent at the workplace.

Two alternative designs are presented: In the first one, bidders bid their true costs as a drop-out after being awarded would be penalised. The second one does not include a penalty. In that case, bidders are modelled with a cost function that includes a higher level of uncertainty. The model results show that low pre-qualifications and low or no penalties lead to an increased drop-out of agents after being awarded. For the policy-maker this implies a lower realisation rate for the auctions. Furthermore, the non-penalty case does not yield lower prices compared to a case with a stricter penalty/pre-qualification system in place.","[Welisch, Marijke] TU Wien, Energy Econ Grp, Gusshausstrasse 25-29-370-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Welisch, M (通讯作者)，TU Wien, Energy Econ Grp, Gusshausstrasse 25-29-370-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",welisch@eeg.tuwien.ac.at,,,European Commission [646172],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research was funded by the European Commission and contains results of the Horizon2020 Project AURES [grant number 646172].

Among them, the task density refers to the number of similar tasks in a certain period of time. The more similar tasks in a certain period of time, the greater the task density, indicating that there are more similar tasks to attract the solvers. Using the 2776 logo design task data on Taskcn.com from the year 2015 to 2018, we analyzed the impact of task density on the solvers' participation and the regulating effect of the two important factors of task setting, namely task rewards and task duration, on the task density. The results showed that the task density was negatively correlated with the quantity of the task solutions submitted; the task duration was positively adjusting the impact of task density on the quantity of solution submitted, that is, increasing the task duration could reduce the negative impact of the competitive environment on the quantity of solutions submitted. The regulating effect of the task rewards on the relationship between the task density and the amount of solutions submitted was not significant.
