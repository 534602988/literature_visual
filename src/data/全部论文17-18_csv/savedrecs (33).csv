Efficient price discovery with tiered information disclosure,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Early peek; Information disclosure; Price discovery; High frequency trading,US TREASURY MARKET; ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; LIQUIDITY; AUCTIONS,"From 2007 to June 2013, a small group of fee-paying, high-speed traders receive the Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment two seconds before its broader release. Within this early peek window, we find highly concentrated trading and a fast price discovery of less than 200 milliseconds. Outside this narrow window, general investors trade at fully adjusted prices. We further establish a causal relationship between the early peek mechanism and the fast price discovery by isolating the impact of the early peek arrangement along two dimensions. In cross section, we use other news releases without the early peek (as controls); in time series, we use the sudden suspension of the early peek arrangement in July 2013 (as the treatment). Our difference-in-difference tests directly connect the early peek arrangement to more efficient price discovery - it results in faster price discovery, lower volatility, and faster resolution of uncertainty. These results show that contrary to the common perception, tiered information release may help to reduce, rather than enhance, the informational advantage of faster traders and improve the efficiency of the price discovery process in financial markets.

At the same time, however, the level of indebtedness of rural households has increased, making households more vulnerable to shocks. One of the reasons for rising household debt is the ease of borrowing simultaneously from a growing number of lending institutions. This paper addresses two major questions. First, does borrowing from multiple sources increase rural households' risk of over-indebtedness? Second, do over-indebted rural households refinance their outstanding loans through multiple borrowing, running the risk of becoming trapped in a debt cycle? Employing a dynamic random effects bivariate probit model for a unique set of longitudinal household panel data from Northeast Thailand, this study examines the bidirectional relationship between over-indebtedness and multiple borrowing to determine to what extent rural households become trapped in debt cycles. On the one hand, the results indicate that households in Northeast Thailand take on multiple loans, which further increases their risk of becoming over indebted. On the other hand, our model results do not confirm the widespread notion that over-indebted rural households use multiple loans to refinance unpayable debts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To measure these effects, demand and cost expressions are developed to replicate standard decentralized budgeting frameworks for the University of Iowa and Iowa State University.

Combining data from before and after the policy change, from the regions that gain access to mother tongue schooling, along with the regions and ethnic groups that face no change in language policy, I estimate the effect of mother tongue instruction on human capital formation. The results show that access to mother tongue schooling increases the ability to read by 40%. Moreover, it increases the completed years of schooling by more than half a year, and the probability of completing primary schooling by five percentage points. The ability to read by permitting access to printed sources of information, increases newspaper readership by around 25% and makes it 17% points more likely that individuals report using pamphlets, posters or leaflets as a source of information about family planning. My preferred interpretation of the results is that provision of schooling in a language spoken at home, and used for social interactions, reduces the cost and increases the efficiency of learning. The result highlights the use of non-native languages, an almost ubiquitous practice in Sub-Saharan Africa, as a potentially important factor underlying the large educational failures in this part of the world.

The Effect of Early Term Birth on Maternal and Infant Health,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CESAREAN DELIVERY; LABOR; INDUCTION,"Early term birth is defined as birth at 37 or 38 weeks gestation. While infants born early term are not considered premature, the medical literature suggests that they have an increased risk of serious adverse health outcomes compared to infants born at term (39 or 40 weeks). Despite these known harms, we document a rise in early term births in the United States from 1989 to the mid-2000s, followed by a decline in recent years. We posit that the recent decline in early term births has been driven by changes in medical practice advocated by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, programs such as the March of Dimes' Worth the Wait campaign, and by Medicaid policy. We first show that this pattern cannot be attributed to changes in the demographic composition of mothers, and provide some evidence that efforts to reduce early term elective deliveries (EEDs) through Medicaid policy were effective. We next exploit county-level variation in the timing of these changes in medical practice to examine the effect of early term inductions (our proxy for EEDs) on infant and maternal health. We find that early term inductions lower birth weights and increase the risks of precipitous labor, birth injury, and required ventilation. Our results suggest that reductions in early term inductions can explain about one-third of the overall increase in birth weights between 2010 and 2013 for births at 37 weeks gestation and above.

We find that the responses of innovators are quite different from those of non-innovators, particularly in the domestic market. When import tariffs are reduced, innovators reduce their product scope but increase their average scale of production in the domestic market. By contrast, non-innovators do not change their domestic product scope significantly, but they experience a decrease in the average scale of production, leading to a significant reduction in domestic shipments. We do not find significantly different responses between innovators and non-innovators in the export market.","[Choi, Yong-Seok] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Hahn, Chin Hee] Gachon Univ, Dept Econ, Seongnam, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Gachon University,"Hahn, CH (通讯作者)，Gachon Univ, Dept Econ, 1342 Seongnam Daero, Seongnam Si 461701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",chhahn@gachon.ac.kr,"Choi, Yong-Seok/AAH-9264-2020","Choi, Yong-Seok/0000-0002-9689-2335",,,,,13,0,0,3,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

In particular, we examine the representative heuristic's impact on the demand for homeowners' insurance, which provides coverage for windstorm losses, in Florida (U.S.). Under this paradigm, individuals underweight prior probabilities and overweight posterior probabilities. This results in an over (under)weighting of the probability of a loss from a disaster in the event (absence) of a disaster. Using data for new homeowners' insurance, purchases in Florida's residual market between 2005 and 2007 (a period of high hurricane activity), we find, subsequent to losses, the demand for coverage limits and the number of policies sold both increase. Further, we find that this effect attenuates as the losses become further away in time. That is, more recent losses have a stronger effect on demand. This attenuation of the demand is also consistent with the representative heuristic.","[Dumm, Randy E.; Volkman-Wise, Jacqueline] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Eckles, David L.] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Nyce, Charles] Florida State Univ, Risk Management & Insurance, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Eckles, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Dept Insurance Legal Studies & Real Estate, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",deckles@uga.edu,,,,,,,32,9,9,1,21,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

A Taylor-type interest rate rule with a sufficiently high inflation coefficient emerges as an equilibrium relation in a Vector Error Correction model, and operates as a reaction function. The exchange rate enters significantly and the dynamics generated are consistent with the derived rule and the macroeconomic theory.

When the objectives of management and shareholders are more aligned, as proxied by the use of equity-based compensation, more value-maximizing acquisitions are expected. Whereas in widely-held firms the decision power is with the management, in firms with concentrated ownership the decision power may be with major blockholders. This may entail that ownership concentration and equity-based pay are substitutes. We find a strongly positive relation between equity-based compensation and cumulative abnormal announcement returns at takeovers, but this relation is eroded when dominant share blocks are held by corporations, which confirms the substitution effect. Powerful CEOs in companies with weak boards and without actively monitoring shareholders may set their own pay which could lead to excesses. We relate excess pay to how takeover decisions are received by the market, and demonstrate that excess compensation negatively affects the acquirer's stock valuation at a takeover announcement. The market is thus able to identify firms with agency problems and is cautious in its expectations about potential value creation by means of acquisitions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Groups with heterogeneous tastes create a leverage effect on competition: a large majority of firms may end up offering a product that corresponds to the taste of the minority. I illustrate this idea with smoking bans in bars and restaurants. When the first nonsmoking restaurants opened, there were few of them with little competition and high market power on nonsmokers. By extracting a large surplus from nonsmokers, nonsmoking restaurants became unattractive to other groups, while smoking restaurants were plenty and competitive, attracting both smokers and mixed groups.","[Foucart, Renaud] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Foucart, Renaud] Inst Econ Theory, Spandauer Str 1, Berlin, Germany; [Foucart, Renaud] Inst Management, Spandauer Str 1, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Foucart, R (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.;Foucart, R (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Theory, Spandauer Str 1, Berlin, Germany.;Foucart, R (通讯作者)，Inst Management, Spandauer Str 1, Berlin, Germany.",renaud.foucart@hu-berlin.de,,"Foucart, Renaud/0000-0003-0611-6146",,,,,26,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

The effects of revisions are captured by rerunning the estimation on a real-time data set compiled using the latest time series available each quarter from 1997 through 2015. Results show that estimates of the structural parameters are generally robust to changes in the data that have occurred over the past 20 years. By comparison, standard error estimates are more sensitive to revisions. The latter implies that judgments about the statistical significance of certain parameters depend on which data vintage is used for estimation.","[Givens, Gregory E.] Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Econ, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Givens, GE (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Econ, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",gegivens@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In contrast with previous studies, we do not use panel estimation techniques, but implement a time-series analysis for each country based on the growth literature. The results suggest that in all the countries but Belgium a debt increase begins to have detrimental effects on growth well before the SGP debt ceiling (a debt ratio of around 40% and 50% in central and peripheral countries, respectively) is reached. So, although austerity policies should be applied in EMU countries since according to our results debt reduction barely exerts any significant beneficial impact on EMU countries' growth they should be accompanied by structural reforms that can increase their potential GDP. Moreover, as our results suggest that the harmful impact of a debt change on growth does not occur beyond the same threshold and with the same intensity in all EMU countries, a focus on average ratios and impacts may be unsuitable for defining policies. Specifically, our findings suggest that the pace of fiscal adjustment should be lower in Greece and Spain than in the other countries.","[Gomez-Puig, Marta] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Gomez-Puig, Marta] Univ Barcelona, Riskctr, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon] Univ Complutense Madrid, Complutense Inst Int Studies, Madrid 28223, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Complutense University of Madrid,"Gómez-Puig, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Gómez-Puig, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Riskctr, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",marta.gomezpuig@ub.edu; sosvilla@ccee.ucm.es,"Gómez-Puig, Marta/E-4408-2016; Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/H-4163-2015","Gómez-Puig, Marta/0000-0001-8349-2829; Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/0000-0003-2084-0640","Instituto de Estudios Fiscales [IEF 015/2017]; Bank of Spain [PR71/15-20229]; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport [PRX16/00261]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-76203-C2-2-P]","Instituto de Estudios Fiscales; Bank of Spain; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","This paper is based upon work supported by the Instituto de Estudios Fiscales [grant IEF 015/2017], the Bank of Spain [grant PR71/15-20229], the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport [grant PRX16/00261] and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [grant ECO2016-76203-C2-2-P].",,92,19,21,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

In particular, the effects of reduction in output tariffs and input tariffs are separately explored. We focus on the apparel industry. By estimating the Berry-type demand function, we derive product quality indicators based on the Khandelwal methodology, which enables us to isolate changes in prices from quality upgrading. Our findings are as follows. First, a reduction in output tariffs does not affect product quality upgrading. Second, a reduction in input tariffs boosts quality upgrading in general. In particular, this impact is greater for import plants, as is consistent with our expectation that the source of the boost is the import of high-quality foreign inputs.","[Hayakawa, Kazunobu] JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan; [Matsuura, Toshiyuki] Keio Univ, Keio Econ Observ, Tokyo, Japan; [Matsuura, Toshiyuki] Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Leuven, Belgium; [Takii, Sadayuki] Seinan Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Fukuoka, Japan",Keio University; KU Leuven,"Matsuura, T (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Keio Econ Observ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",matsuura@sanken.keio.ac.jp,"Hayakawa, Kazunobu/T-9427-2019; Hayakawa, Kazunobu/HZM-4324-2023","Hayakawa, Kazunobu/0000-0003-0032-9060","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKENHI [JP26705002, JP26380311, JP16H02018]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H02018] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We appreciate the financial aid provided by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP26705002 (to Hayakawa), JP26380311 and JP16H02018 (to Matsuura).",,13,6,6,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Such local production spillovers highlight a new dimension of inequality arising through geographic remoteness and predicts divergent growth patterns among countries with poorly market-integrated households. The model is tested using an instrumental variables approach that takes advantage of the relationship between market accessibility and exogenous geographic features of the landscape as well as spatial data derived from a unique global dataset characterizing country-level market accessibility distributions. Our findings are consistent with production spillovers diminishing concavely across space before tapering off convexly in remote areas. This result suggests that the marginal household exhibiting production spillovers is located approximately five hours from the nearest market center. The policy implications are that governments could adopt pro-growth inequality-reducing policies using targeted infrastructural investments, relocation subsidies, or income redistribution mechanisms. Based on our spillover threshold estimates, these policies would be access-equality enhancing for 5.1 billion people globally and access-equality reducing for 825 million people globally. We also present findings that growth divergence occurs among countries with geographically less pervasive markets. This outcome may explain why wealthier nations exhibit divergent growth paths relative to poorer nations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Utilizing an exogenous shock to dividend taxation, we show that absent any frictions, dividend taxation has a large impact on payout. As agency issues and shareholder conflicts increase, owners' tax preferences have significantly smaller impact on payout. Three mechanisms reduce the dividend-tax sensitivity: Coordination among owners, heterogeneity in tax preferences, and diverging objectives between managers and owners. Altogether, taxation has a first-order impact on payout, but agency issues and shareholder conflicts mute its impact substantially.

Obstacles to the takeup of social assistance in industrialized countries include information costs, compliance costs, and psychological costs. Using qualitative field research and quantitative analysis of data from a nationwide survey in 2013-14, we explore the impact of these costs on the takeup of the Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH), a US $50 monthly cash transfer in Ecuador. Drawing on interviews with Ecuadorians whose households are eligible for the BDH, as well as on findings about social assistance takeup in industrialized countries, we hypothesize that particular information costs, compliance costs, and psychological costs, along with program design and household poverty, will influence the probability of BDH takeup. We then use probit regression to estimate the statistical effect of these factors on the probability of takeup, using data on 11,449 BDH-eligible households sampled by Ecuador's 2013-14 Encuesta Condiciones de Vida (Living Standards Measurement Survey). Controlling for program design and household poverty, we find that compliance costs and psychological costs each have a significant deterrent effect on BDH takeup. The purpose of social assistance is to help the poor, but if social assistance is to achieve this goal, the poor must actually receive it. This study helps to identify the forces and circumstances that influence the takeup of an important social assistance program in a middle-income Latin American country. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we apply a popular variable selection method, adaptive LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), to select a parsimonious set of default predictor variables. When different market infrastructures are presented, our empirical study demonstrates an advantage in forecasting defaults with the adaptively selected default predictor variables. Second, with selected default predictor covariates, we apply the discrete hazard model to examine the performance for the international market with time varying panel data over different prediction horizons. Our empirical study shows that for Japan market, three predictor variables, including Retained Earning/ Total Asset, Total Debt/Total Asset and Current Liability/Sales are selected by adaptive-LASSO method. Such selection results are strikingly consistent for different sampling periods over different prediction horizons. The model using those three financial ratios alone demonstrates strong predictability in forecasting corporate default. For Japan market, the model with adaptive-LASSO selected variables shows superior out-of-sample predictive power over the Altman's Z-score model. On the other hand, for some Europe countries including UK, Germany and France, the equity ratio variable, Equity/Total Liability, is consistently selected across different prediction horizons, whereas, the rest of selected variables are mixed.","[Tian, Shaonan] San Jose State Univ, Decis Sci, Lucas Coll, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Tian, Shaonan] San Jose State Univ, Grad Sch Business, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Yu, Yan] Univ Cincinnati, Carl H Lindner Coll Business, Business Analyt, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",California State University System; San Jose State University; California State University System; San Jose State University; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Tian, SN (通讯作者)，San Jose State Univ, Decis Sci, Lucas Coll, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.;Tian, SN (通讯作者)，San Jose State Univ, Grad Sch Business, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.",shaonan.tian@sjsu.edu; Yan.Yu@uc.edu,,,,,,,37,58,61,5,49,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

The theorem breaks down when the infrastructure is used by operators with market power, the case in point often being airlines at a congested airport. This paper proposes a regulatory scheme that restores self-financing in such cases; partially so in general, and perfectly so under specific circumstances that include (1) the satisfaction of a particular proportionality condition, and (2) either the isolation of budgets needed for subsidies to counter demand-related mark-ups, or perfectly elastic demands so that such mark-ups are zero. Moreover, exact self-financing applies in this scheme independent of the elasticity of the capacity cost function, and occurs for both parametric and manipulable congestion pricing.

Despite this, the empirical literature provides inconsistent evidence on the role of basic economic determinants of deforestation such as income and population. The authors suggest that one explanation for this inconsistency is a tendency to use incomplete or incorrect dynamic regression specifications. They derive three plausible dynamic empirical model specifications and compare their performance both with each other and with an ad hoc model typical of those used in the literature. Statistical tests support the use of more completely specified models which allow for dynamic adjustment of forest cover.","[Aisbett, Emma] Univ Hamburg, Fac Business and Econ, Welckerstr 8,R 2-20, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Doupe, Patrick; Tacconi, Luca] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Doupe, Patrick] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany",University of Hamburg; Australian National University; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Aisbett, E (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Fac Business and Econ, Welckerstr 8,R 2-20, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",Aisbett@wiso.uni-hamburg.de; Patrick.Doupe@anu.edu.au; Luca.Tacconi@anu.edu.au,"Aisbett, Emma/GZM-4333-2022; Aisbett, Emma/AAP-6896-2020","Aisbett, Emma/0000-0003-4649-3579; Aisbett, Emma/0000-0003-4649-3579",Australian Research Council [LP 0989909]; Australian Agency for International Development project [EFCC 082],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Agency for International Development project,"This paper has benefited from funding from the Australian Research Council (LP 0989909) and the Australian Agency for International Development (EFCC 082) project, and was written primarily while all authors were at The Australian National University.

We estimate the changes in technology, trade costs, and preferences accounting for the dynamics of China's gross and net trade flows, export participation, real exchange rate, and growth from 1990 to 2014. We find a large unanticipated decline in bilateral trade barriers with persistent, but not permanent, innovations that include an important gradual, phased-in component. Since the Great Recession, average bilateral barriers have stabilized at low levels even as barriers on Chinese imports have risen substantially relative to exports. Trade stagnation since 2011 largely reflects the completed transition to past trade reforms rather than an increase in trade barriers or reversal in the expected pace of future integration. Trade is forecast to decline almost 1 percent per year starting in 2017. Changes in trade barriers are an important determinant of China's trade balance and its accumulation of foreign assets, accounting for as much as 70 percent of the foreign assets accumulated by 2014. Shocks to trade barriers and in China are found to have increased ROW consumption by 11.9 percent and employment by 0.6 percent but lowered ROW output by less than 1 percent relative to 1990.","[Alessandria, George; Lu, Dan] Univ Rochester, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Alessandria, George] NBER, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Choi, Horag] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Rochester; National Bureau of Economic Research; Monash University,"Alessandria, G (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.;Alessandria, G (通讯作者)，NBER, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",George.Alessandria@gmail.com; Horag.Choi@gmail.com; DanLv27@gmail.com,,"Alessandria, George/0000-0003-4350-3727; Choi, Horag/0000-0002-8250-539X",,,,,52,13,13,1,18,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

NREGS guarantees up to a hundred days of employment in public works to rural households that demand work under the program. This is one of the first papers to analyze the impact of NREGS on household wellbeing by focusing on household consumption using national-level data. By focusing on consumption, I am able to assess whether and how household use the program to improve their living standards. I exploit the cross-district rollout of the program to analyze the causal effect on household consumption. Using the Consumption Expenditure Survey data from the National Sample Survey Organization, I conduct a difference-in-difference analysis where the treatment group consists of households in 184 early implementation districts and the control group consists of households in 209 late implementation districts. I find that the program significantly increased household per capita consumption between 6.5% and 10%. For the marginalized caste group, the program increased consumption by around 12%. Therefore, historical and ongoing, discrimination along with other barriers to entry have not prevented this group from benefiting from the program. I further assess the impact on household budget allocation by focusing on various consumption categories. I find that households move toward the higher caloric and more nutritional items, like protein. Finally, for households with children there was significantly greater spending on child goods like milk, while in households without children spending on alcohol increased. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This shift in the sectoral composition of saving was not accompanied by changes in the sectoral composition of investment, implying an improvement in the corporate net lending position. We characterize the behavior of corporate saving using both national income accounts and firm-level data and clarify its relationship with the global decline in labor share, the accumulation of corporate cash stocks, and the greater propensity for equity buybacks. We develop a general equilibrium model with product and capital market imperfections to explore quantitatively the determination of the flow of funds across sectors. Changes including declines in the real interest rate, the price of investment, and corporate income taxes generate increases in corporate profits and shifts in the supply of sectoral saving that are of similar magnitude to those observed in the data.

Our central hypothesis is that the exploitation of natural resources in a context of poor governance quality creates the conditions for rapid urbanization and urban concentration, and ultimately lowers living standards in primal cities. Using a large panel of African countries, our results show that an increase in the share of natural resources leads to a rapid increase in urbanization and urban concentration, even after taking into account endogeneity issues, or after using more exogenous measures of resource dependency. The paper also establishes a negative association between the resource abundance, the quality of life in large cities and the degree of informality via the increase in urbanization rate and urban concentration. Importantly, we have established that these results mostly hold in the context of bad governance. More specifically, the resource-led urbanization and concentration booms take place mainly in countries characterized by poor governance records. Furthermore, poor governance quality is associated with a more detrimental effect of urbanization and urban concentration on the quality of life in African cities. These results suggest that ongoing transformations experienced by these countries call for complementary policies to ensure a more balanced and efficient urbanization process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It assumes Bayesian investors who are uncertain about the degree to which fund returns are exposed to systematic risk.

Using an event study methodology with real-transaction data for a monthly panel of 73 districts, we find that DTI limits play important roles in stabilizing housing prices than LTV limits. The loosening of both DTI and LTV limits boosts house price growth whereas the tightening only of DTI limits reverses it. After factors other than implementation of these regulations are controlled for, the results are robust except for the cases of LTV loosening. Furthermore, we uncover that the levels of and extents of changes LTV limits are important factors that can amplify or reduce the regulation effects. Overall, the results suggest that macroprudential policies, especially DTI limits, can be useful tools for curbing excessive household debt and subsequent house price bubbles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a large sample of observations of non-financial firms, during the years 2009-2013, we empirically test for the presence of discrimination, comparing female-led and male-led firms. After controlling for a rich set of variables and addressing potential endogeneity, our results show that i) female-led enterprises are more likely to face worse price conditions for bank financing compared to their male-led counterparts and, ii) firms whose leadership changes from female to male are more likely to benefit from an improvement in interest rate levels. This evidence is robust to different model specifications and various methodological approaches. The existence of such bias in the credit markets highlights the need of policy measures addressing female-led businesses, thus reducing their bank financing burdens and enhancing their entrepreneurial opportunities.

This study uses the resource-based view and institutional economics as conceptual frameworks and focuses on the analysis of the resources and capabilities; entrepreneurial orientation (risk-taking, proactiveness and innovativeness); and legitimation affecting the entrepreneurial process. The literature points out that the specific characteristics of the sector (strong family links and institutional support) can condition the entrepreneurship process. Thus, hypotheses are developed to test these relationships. We use random effects models to test our hypotheses with the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) for 20 European countries. Results show that agri-entrepreneurs have weaker entrepreneurial capabilities than other sectors. However, new entrants into the agricultural sector are not less entrepreneurial in relation to other sectors. On the other hand, established agri-entrepreneurs are less proactive than other sectors. Results suggest that new entrants into agriculture are more entrepreneurially oriented than established ones. Our study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by contextualizing the entrepreneurship process and providing valuable insights for policy-makers to enhance farmers' entrepreneurial skills and entrepreneurial orientation.","[Pindado, Emilio; Sanchez, Mercedes] Univ Publ Navarra, Business Dept, Campus Arrosadia, Pamplona 31006, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Sánchez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Business Dept, Campus Arrosadia, Pamplona 31006, Spain.",emilio.pindado@unavarra.es; mersan@unavarra.es,"Pindado, Emilio/E-4957-2018; Sanchez, Mercedes/I-1325-2015","Pindado, Emilio/0000-0002-4262-3201; Sanchez, Mercedes/0000-0002-9959-5643","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2012-39793-C03-01, AGL2015-65897-C3-1]; FEDER",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

Intensive emigration of the Poles to the UK since 2004 negatively affected Poland's economic growth in the long run, but it also reduced tensions at the labour market by decreasing the unemployment rate. On the other hand, the increase in Polish immigrants in the UK did not significantly affect economic growth and unemployment rate in the destination country in the short run in the period 2004-2015. A significance influence was observed only in the long run, when the UK economic growth decreased, but the pressures on the labour market significantly reduced. From these empirical findings, some policy recommendations are required for both countries: for Poland, migration policies to promote the return of migrants and more efficient utilization of labour force, while for the UK - shaping a more flexible labour market.","[Simionescu, Mihaela] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania; [Bilan, Yuriy] Univ Szczecin, Dept Microecon, Szczecin, Poland; [Mentel, Grzegorz] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Dept Quantitat Methods, Rzeszow, Poland",Romanian Academy of Sciences; University of Szczecin; Rzeszow University of Technology,"Bilan, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Dept Microecon, Szczecin, Poland.",yuriy_bilan@yahoo.co.uk,"Simionescu, Mihaela/AAP-7639-2021; Bilan, Yuriy/B-3119-2012; Mentel, Grzegorz/T-1850-2018; Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021; Simionescu, Mihaela/L-1249-2016","Bilan, Yuriy/0000-0003-0268-009X; Mentel, Grzegorz/0000-0002-6371-1219; Simionescu, Mihaela/0000-0002-6124-2172",,,,,47,7,7,0,33,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2017,19.0,46,,,,,757,770,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413856000011,0

We find that the costs of delay could have been as high as $18.5 billion, or 37% of the FDIC's estimated costs of closure of $49.8 billion. We think that these findings call for a more aggressive stance by bank regulators with respect to the provisions for loan losses and write-downs of banks' non-performing assets. More aggressive (and earlier) provisions and write-downs, or adoption of a capital ratio that penalizes nonperforming loans, would allow the concept of prompt corrective action (PCA) to play the role that it was meant to play in reducing FDIC losses from insolvent banks.

While there are increasing calls to launch financial governance of these NGO MFIs, there are concerns as to whether frauds of this nature can damage MFIs' contributions to the credit market, particularly in the bank-linkage program where the NGO MFIs act as third party intermediary. The purpose of this study was to analyze the collusion decisions faced by MFIs and their impact on the bank-linkage program, which has been offered as a solution to help overcome adverse selection and moral hazard problems in the credit market by harnessing local information via MFIs. Our results show that even when there is a chance of collusion between MFI and the borrower, the linkage between MFI and bank can still increase the probability that the borrower puts in full effort, and therefore decreases the probabilities of both credit rationing and strategic default. Such linkage in financing viable projects can make micro-financing more effective in achieving inclusive financial development and thereby poverty reduction in rural areas.","[Ho, Shirley J.] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Mallick, Sushanta K.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London, England",National Chengchi University; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Ho, SJ (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 100-2410-H-004-022]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We gratefully acknowledge the constructive comments made by two anonymous referees and the editor of this journal.

Compared with a uniform delay, some argue that those who have entered precociously the labor market should be allowed to retire earlier. They assert that such a 'long career' exception is all the more justified that those unskilled workers live also less long due to heavier and potentially health-damaging jobs. In this paper, we then study macroeconomic and distributional consequences of global gain in life expectancy, with or without the postponement of the legal age of retirement and with or without a 'long career' exception. By considering a framework where individuals decide to acquire skills depending on economic incentives and differential mortality, we focus particularly on spillover effects possibly generated by education. We show in particular that introducing a 'long career' exception cannot be to the advantage of future unskilled workers unless education yields no spillover effects.","[Le Garrec, Gilles] Sci Po, OFCE, 69 Quai Orsay, F-75340 Paris 07, France; [Lhuissier, Stephane] CEPII, 113 Rue Grenelle, F-75007 Paris, France",,"Le Garrec, G (通讯作者)，Sci Po, OFCE, 69 Quai Orsay, F-75340 Paris 07, France.",gilles.legarrec@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,67,4,4,0,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

The number of top executives with regulatory experience per firm has increased 24% over 2001-15, and hiring is associated with positive average announcement returns and a salary premium. In the quarter after hire, market and balance sheet measures of firm risk decrease significantly and measures of risk management activity increase, especially for hires from prudential regulators, who directly monitor financial firm risk. The absence of this result for unregulated firms and for exogenous shocks to regulatory experience suggests that firms hire ex-employees of their regulators when they perceive a need to reduce risk, consistent with a schooling hypothesis.

It has caused immense human suffering, which continues to this day. The standard view attributes the economic crisis to an earlier buildup of public and private debt that was augmented by the imposition of austerity during the crisis. Although evidence exists of a relationship between the debt buildup, austerity measures, and economic growth during the crisis, that same evidence, on closer examination, points to eurozone countries' common monetary policy as the real culprit behind the area's sharp decline in economic activity. In particular, it seems that the European Central Bank's tightening of monetary policy in 2008 and again in 2010-2011 not only caused two recessions but also sparked the sovereign debt crisis and gave teeth to the austerity programs. Such findings point to the need for a new monetary policy regime in the eurozone. The case is made for the new regime to be a targeted growth path for total money spending.","[Beckworth, David] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, 3434 Washington Blvd, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Beckworth, D (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, 3434 Washington Blvd, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",dbeckworth@mercatus.gmu.edu,,,,,,,24,6,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We analyze the importance of the Basel III additional capital buffer requirements for credit union prudential regulation. Based on a sample of the 100 largest credit unions in Canada from 1996 to 2014, we find that Canadian credit union capital buffers behave countercyclically over the business cycle. Further, credit unions hold a capital buffer bigger than the maximum buffer advocated under Basel III which is 5% of risk-weighted assets (RWA). These results suggest that, unlike commercial banks worldwide, credit unions, by and large, are already in compliance with the new Basel III buffer requirements. However, there is evidence that the capital buffers of low-capitalized credit unions are procyclical. These credit unions increased their RWA during booms but failed to build up additional capital accordingly. Hence, weakly capitalized credit unions are more likely to adjust their capital buffers if they are subject to Basel III capital buffer regulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using nationally representative household surveys, this study exploits temporal and geographical variations of the 1999-2011 Ivorian political instability to identify its causal effect on children's schooling and child mortality. The results showed that individuals who lived in conflict areas and who reached the official age to be enrolled in school within the period of the instability had a 10 % lower probability of being enrolled in school. Students who spent their school years during the conflict and who lived in an affected area experienced a lag in schooling attainment of more than a year. Older students or those who were likely to be in high school during the conflict underwent a loss in schooling attainment of nearly 2 years. In addition, results showed that the Ivorian armed conflict increased the mortality of children under age five by at least 3 %. My results also suggest that the deterioration of living conditions and the limitation of health service use during the conflict contributed to the explaination of these adverse effects. Placebo tests suggested that the results were not driven by preexisting differences across conflict and non-conflict areas.","[Ouili, Idrissa] McGill Univ, Inst Hlth & Social Policy, Charles Meredith House 1130,Pine Ave, West Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada",McGill University,"Ouili, I (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Inst Hlth & Social Policy, Charles Meredith House 1130,Pine Ave, West Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada.",ouilidris@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,9,12,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

In this paper, we use data for 58 banks from 15 countries over the period 2004-2011 to assess whether country-level factors also explain variations in bank CDS spreads. In particular, we focus on financial structure indicators (namely, financial stability, depth, access and efficiency) and country risks (i.e. economic, financial and political rating risks) to explain why some banks experience higher levels of credit risk relative to others across countries. We find that while country-level financial instability is associated with higher credit risk; bank-level profitability, liquidity and improved asset quality are linked with lower credit risk. In addition, although country-level financial depth (as an indicator of credit bubble) contributes to higher CDS spreads, house price appreciation tends to dampen credit risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In spite of this, a method to asses a country's degree of connectivity to its international markets for freight is still missing. To close this gap, this paper proposes a multi layered network approach that enables the assessment of: (i) the different factors that influence connectivity to international markets; and (ii) the extent to which a country's connections matter for its international trade activities. The international trade network and its 'support network' are analysed using network theory. The approach proposed is applied to the Americas, a region the relevant literature has not specifically focused on yet. It is expected that a comprehensive understanding and assessment of the determinants of connectivity for freight will contribute to guide and design more effective policies to remove barriers to international trade flows.","[Calatayud, Agustina; Palacin, Roberto] Newcastle Univ, Sch Mech & Syst Engn, Newrail Ctr Railway Res, Stephenson Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Mangan, John] Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Armstrong Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Calatayud, A (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Mech & Syst Engn, Newrail Ctr Railway Res, Stephenson Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",mcalatayud@iadb.org; john.mangan@ncl.ac.uk; roberto.palacin@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,26,28,10,67,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Such reforms reflect the twin goals of encouraging greater responsiveness to local needs and promoting sustainability. This study illustrates how the aims of decentralization can be undermined in the absence of robust democratic competition, and how governments interpret demand by voters in such settings. Focusing on the Tanzanian water sector, the paper first traces the distribution of money for water from the central government to the district level. Next, I consider how district governments use these funds to distribute water infrastructure within their jurisdictions, using geo-referenced data on all 75,000 water points serving rural Tanzanians. I find that the central government's allocation of money to districts is fairly unresponsive to local needs. However, the pattern of distribution cannot primarily be explained by politics, with the exception of consistent favoritism of the Minister for Water's home district. Political favoritism is more pronounced at the local level. Within districts, the distribution of new water infrastructure is skewed to favor localities with higher demonstrated levels of support for the ruling party. In addition, wealthier and better-connected communities those with the resources to more effectively express their demands are significantly more likely to benefit from new construction. This suggests that demand-responsive approaches to water provision can entrench regressive patterns of distribution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that an exogenous removal of short-selling constraints causes firms to convexify compensation payoffs by granting relatively more stock options to their managers. We also find that treated firms adopt new antitakeover provisions. These results suggest that when firms face the threat of bear raids, they incentivize managers to take actions that mitigate the adverse effects of unrestrained short selling. Overall, this paper provides causal evidence that financial markets affect incentive contract design.","[De Angelis, David; Grullon, Gustavo] Rice Univ, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Michenaud, Sebastien] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Rice University; DePaul University,"De Angelis, D (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",deangelis@rice.edu,,,,,,,65,68,75,8,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The estimated model shows that the recent sluggishness in GDP growth can be explained by slow technology growth, and the decline in CPI inflation is affected by a falling markup in domestic homogeneous goods production and a negative intertemporal consumption preference. Although wages, unemployment, and total labor hours are influenced by various factors, households' weak bargaining power causes a slow recovery in wages, while pushing the unemployment rate down. There was also a spillover from non-big-5 to big-5 firms during the global financial crisis, while monetary and fiscal policy has been mostly conservative in the post-crisis period.","[Kang, Hyunju] Korea Capital Market Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Suh, Hyunduk] Inha Univ, Dept Econ, Incheon, South Korea",Korea Capital Market Institute; Inha University,"Suh, H (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Dept Econ, Incheon, South Korea.",hjkang326@gmail.com; hsuh@inha.ac.kr,,"Suh, Hyunduk/0000-0003-1761-6592; Kang, Hyunju/0000-0002-9999-4273",,,,,18,9,8,0,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Unlike the conventional unit root and cointegration methods, we test for the validity of the PPP hypothesis at both the quantile interval and the single quantile level. While conventional nonlinear models could also capture the regime switching behaviour, the quantile approach enables us to avoid choosing the appropriate form of nonlinearity, and therefore, avoid the misspecification risk. When conventional methods are used, the PPP hypothesis is not strongly supported for all three countries. However, when the quantile-based approach is used, the PPP hypothesis holds for China at some quantile levels when producer price index (PPI) is used as price variable, and it also holds for Japan over the lower and upper quantile levels.

The objectives of this paper were to examine the pathway of European cinema market and the relationship with its consumers along with their interests and attitudes towards European films and to research the most important measures taken by European Union institutions under their competition policy to support European films through state aid schemes. In order to give shape to these objectives, in-depth interviews with five elite specialists from the Romanian film industry were used, specialists who possess international expertise and recognition. The problems of the qualitative research are: the modification of consumer behaviour face to European cinema and support measures. The findings suggest that regarding its relationship with consumers and their interests in the seventh art, European cinema faces many different difficulties ranging from the competition with American films and insufficient funds, to the increased comfortableness or coziness of the movie consumers of our times. The paper concludes with examples of measures suggested by the respondents, to help European cinema become more attractive to consumers, measures which are already being implemented by the industry, making the results of our study useful for policy and decision makers within this cultural area.","[Nistoreanu, Puiu; Dinca, Violeta Mihaela; Schiopu, Andreea Fortuna] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dinca, VM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",violetamihaeladinca@yahoo.fr,"Dinca, Violeta Mihaela/A-7239-2016; Puiu, Nistoreanu/C-1021-2009; Schiopu, Andreea Fortuna/J-6678-2017","Dinca, Violeta Mihaela/0000-0002-2335-7649; Puiu, Nistoreanu/0000-0002-8369-7899; Schiopu, Andreea Fortuna/0000-0002-6524-0190",,,,,21,11,11,1,12,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2017,19.0,45,,,,,397,413,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404523800006,0

While much of the Fair Trade literature has analyzed the system's direct impacts on its beneficiaries, some strands have sought to determine its transformative potential vis-a-vis capitalist social relations. In an attempt to contribute to the latter debate, this paper introduces an analytical framework for the assessment of Fairtrade built on the basis of the French Regulation Approach. This perspective, which focuses on the specific ways in which Fairtrade structures and institutionalizes socioeconomic relations, seeks to examine this system from a holistic perspective, privileging the analysis of the qualitative changes it produces in economic institutions and structures. This article presents the main assumptions and concepts developed by the Regulation Approach and proposes a case-based research design that uses them to analyze how transformative Fairtrade proves to be and the impacts it produces on specific economic sectors. This methodological exposition is illustrated with examples from the case of Fairtrade wine produced in Argentina and consumed in the United Kingdom. (C)2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The focus is on both subjective and objective measures related to the level of consumer awareness and action in a fast-growing competition, potentiated by the digital economy. In order to investigate the relations between the aforementioned concepts, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted, using a sample of 257 students from three top Romanian universities. Based upon the theoretical directions presented in the literature review, a conceptual model was elaborated and tested by employing a partial least squares structural equation modeling technique. As the examination of the structural model indicated, online purchasing decision-making is indirectly influenced by the high competition in the digital economy, by means of consumer protection awareness and consumer protection behavior. At this level, the analyzed factors, namely the competition in the digital economy, the consumer protection awareness and the consumer behavior with respect to the consumer protection policies, explain over 16% in the variance of the online purchasing decision-making.","[Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina; Mitan, Andreea] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania; [Nistoreanu, Bogdan Gabriel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Vatamanescu, EM (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania.",madalina.vatamanescu@yahoo.com,"Nistoreanu, Bogdan - Gabriel/AFW-4556-2022; Puiu, Nistoreanu/C-1021-2009; Mitan, Andreea/AAP-8450-2021; Nistoreanu, Bogdan Gabriel/H-8566-2013; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/F-4872-2017","Nistoreanu, Bogdan - Gabriel/0000-0003-0079-9150; Puiu, Nistoreanu/0000-0002-8369-7899;",,,,,36,29,32,5,48,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2017,19.0,45,,,,,354,366,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404523800003,0

Non-HFTs' short selling improves liquidity, as measured by bid-ask spreads. HFTs' short selling has the opposite effect by adversely selecting limit orders, which can decrease liquidity supplier competition and reduce trading by non-HFTs.

These declines do not appear to be voluntary or driven by forced departures. Instead, they appear to be the results of labor market penalties.

We find that investment dynamics are more important in explaining the cash differences than financing frictions. More efficient internal capital markets increase cash differences and are especially valuable when a firm diversifies or refocuses. Contrary to static models, more diverse conglomerates have lower cash differences. Endogenous selection (diversifying firms are larger and have better growth opportunities) accounts for 68% of the cash difference, and the diversification event itself reduces cash holdings by 32%.

We link a conventional exchange rate modeling approach to the literature on the political economy of exchange rates and studies dealing with the role of policy announcements for financial market expectations by addressing the impact of policy uncertainty on exchange rate expectations and forecast errors of professionals. Our results show that expectations are not only affected by announcements but also by the degree of uncertainty regarding the future stance of economic policy. We find that forecast errors are strongly affected by policy uncertainty compared to expectations, suggesting that the effect of uncertainty is not efficiently accounted for in market expectations. Our main findings hold for economic policy uncertainty, fiscal policy uncertainty and monetary policy uncertainty. In addition, the estimates for the Japanese yen suggest a safe haven role of the yen since higher policy uncertainty in the US results in an expected appreciation of the yen. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recent empirical evidence suggests a differential negative effect of concentration in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to the rest of the world. This paper revisits the literature on urban concentration and economic growth to shed some light on these recent results. The main contribution of the paper is to show how differentiated effects of urban primacy on economic growth can be accounted for by considering a role for the quality of the urban environment (in terms of urban infrastructure). The role of urban infrastructure is found to be robust to a long list of controls, different specifications, different estimation techniques, and potential bias from simultaneity and measurement error.

However, very little is known about how ethnic heterogeneity affects entrepreneurship, and the institutional arrangements affecting entrepreneurship. This study attempts to fill the gap, and thus examines the effect of ethnic heterogeneity on various outcomes associated with entrepreneurship and the institutional environment for entrepreneurship. Using indices of ethnic and linguistic fractionalization, we show that ethnic heterogeneity negatively influences entrepreneurship. We argue that potential channels that can explain the negative effect of fractionalization on entrepreneurship include trust, social network, and innovation, among others. This study provides a new perspective on the existing debate that seeks to understand why the levels of entrepreneurial success vary across countries.","[Churchill, Sefa Awaworyi] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Wellington Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Churchill, SA (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Wellington Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",sefa.awaworyi@monash.edu,"Churchill, Sefa Awaworyi/AFR-0355-2022; wen, sen/Q-6113-2018","Churchill, Sefa Awaworyi/0000-0002-1930-9177;",,,,,104,47,50,4,79,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Baseline measures were compared with measures taken after 1, 6, and 16 conditioning procedures. The aim was to determine how the different measures are differently sensitive to EC effects. Although self-report indicated conditioning effects already after 1 conditioning procedure and in both directions, the authors believe this to be an artifact due to a regression to the mean effect and thus reject this finding. Similarly, HR and SC did not show any sensitivity to conditioning effects. However, SRM and the IAT revealed significant conditioning effects, but more than 1 conditioning procedure were needed to cause changes. Most importantly, SRM, the only implicit measure of raw affective processing (subcortical), did show a significant EC effect after six conditioning procedures, but only in case of disliked brands turning into more liked brands. Because implicit measures are assumed to be more sensitive to deep subcortical affective processing it is concluded that this level of affective processing is more easily influenced by evaluative conditioning than higher order (cortical) processing levels. The findings are discussed in terms of different aspects of brand attitude (affective and cognitive) that seem to be differently affected by EC. Implications for marketers and advertisers are suggested.","[Walla, Peter] Webster Vienna Private Univ, Dept Psychol, CanBeLab, Praterstr 23, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Walla, Peter; Bosshard, Shannon] Univ Newcastle, Sch Psychol, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Walla, Peter] Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Vienna, Austria; [Koller, Monika; Brenner, Gerhard] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Mkt, Vienna, Austria",Webster Vienna Private University; University of Newcastle; University of Vienna; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Walla, P (通讯作者)，Webster Vienna Private Univ, Dept Psychol, CanBeLab, Praterstr 23, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",peter.walla@newcastle.edu.au,,,,,,,55,15,18,0,14,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

In this paper, we quantify the added value in terms of yield changes and, as suggested by Stein (2013), call it HQLA premium. To do so, we exploit the introduction of the LCR in Switzerland as a unique quasi-natural experiment and we find evidence for the existence of an HQLA premium in the order of 4 basis points. Guided by theoretical considerations, we claim that the HQLA premium is state dependent and argue that our estimate is a lower bound measure. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of an economically significant HQLA premium. Thereby, we contribute to a better understanding of the LCR and its implications for financial markets.

The results show overall positive household welfare differences between participants of the investments and the respective counterfactual. However, there are large differences between arrangements and subsectors. Estimated effects for outgrowers are largest, yet for land-rich outgrowers more so than for land-poor. Effects for agro-industry workers in the sugar investment are significantly larger than for those in the rice investment, though in both investments land-poor workers seem to benefit. Hence, the study results suggest potential benefits of outgrower schemes and potentials of agro-industry wage employment for the land-poor to escape extreme poverty. Yet, it also stresses particularly the need to address the constraints of land-poor outgrowers. Qualitative interviews, for example, pointed to growing risks for land-poor outgrowers in the context of rising elite capture by larger outgrowers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The extant literature suggests that the main strategic role of colocated R&D units is to locally adapt existing products and processes. However, data from 146 foreign R&D units of Sweden's 17 largest manufacturing MNEs in 2013 show that they instead mainly develop new technology, not only for the local and regional markets, but to a large extent for the global market. A likely explanation is that colocation positively contributes to joint problem-solving and transfer of tacit knowledge between production and R&D personnel, all of which is necessary in new product development, especially in industries characterized by complex products and systems and rapid technological change. A theoretical implication is that depending on industry characteristics, internal cross-functional linkages between R&D and manufacturing can be more critical than external supply-and demand-side factors when it comes to influence where R&D units are located globally.","[Ivarsson, Inge; Alvstam, Claes; Vahlne, Jan-Erik] Univ Gotheburg, Ctr Int Business Studies, Sch Business Econ & Law, POB 610, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Ivarsson, I (通讯作者)，Univ Gotheburg, Ctr Int Business Studies, Sch Business Econ & Law, POB 610, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",inge.ivarsson@handels.gu.se; claes.alvstam@handels.gu.se; jan-erik.vahlne@handels.gu.se,,,,,,,111,21,21,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

The peculiar nature of environmental innovations, especially as regards the need of government intervention to create market opportunities, is likely to affect the way they are pursued and their effect on productivity. The analysis is based on an unbalanced panel sample of Italian manufacturing firms merged with data on patent applications and balance sheet information. When looking at the returns of innovations in terms of productivity, we observe that eco-innovations exhibit a generally lower return relative to other innovations, at least in the short run. This differential effect is more pronounced for polluting firms, which are likely to face higher compliance costs for environmental regulations than other firms.

The European Union policies and guidance, as well as market oriented policies, have had a great impact on tourism development in Central, East, and Southeast Europe. Schengen Agreement is one of the greatest advantages brought by the membership of the European Union, as it ensures market openings, visa policies harmonisation, easier border crossing procedures and free movement of persons. Besides, people's curiosity and tendency to explore new destinations, non-traditional and unique places, the lower prices compared to the West, the increasing global interest in tourism, the higher wages and standard of living or the more frequent business-related trips contributed to the 20.5% increase in the number of EU arrivals in the New Member States in the period 2007-2015. The topic of the tourism sector in the Old Member States has been intensively researched, but incomparably less study has been undertaken for the case of the New Member States. Therefore, this paper provides an examination of tourism in the New Member States of the European Union. Data such as the number of international arrivals or overnight stays, number of tourism establishments and bed places in tourism establishments are considered to be one of the most relevant indicators for measuring a country's competitiveness in tourism and will be the basis of our research. To capture various perspectives and create a comprehensive paper, the research methodology will be multi-method, including both secondary and primary sources of data.

The objective of the study is to analyze the degree of job satisfaction in agriculture of different social groups of rural population employed both in the formal and informal sectors of the economy. We consider the risks of job loss and the possibilities of finding a new job, depending on the age, gender and the field of previous employment. The information base of the study is the results of the 23rd wave the Russian Monitoring of the Economic Situation and Health of the Population (RLMS-HSE), conducted in October 2014 -February 2015. The sample is representative, N = 12 908 people. For the purposes of the study, we have formed a subsample consisting of 221 people employed in the agriculture. Our findings suggest that agricultural self-employment is more attractive for those aged 30-45 and 46-60 years and less attractive for young people. The share of the employed in the informal sector of the agriculture is higher compared to that in the manufacturing. Those employed in the informal sector are to the highest degree satisfied with the amount of their wages. Young people aged 16-29 years are not quite satisfied with being engaged in agriculture. Only 39.0% of the young people aged 16-29 years are satisfied with their professional growth opportunities, 56.1% -with the working conditions, and 31.7% -with the amount of their wages. The low level of satisfaction with various aspects of agricultural employment together with the low attractiveness of the sector in general for young people and skilled workers suggest there will be a  personnel shortage in the nearest future. We find that those employed in the agricultural sector are highly dissatisfied with their jobs irrespective of the age. Furthermore, they are more anxious about the possibility of losing their jobs compared to the workers of other sectors of the economy. Almost a half of the employed aged 30-45 years are worried that they will not be able to earn for the living for themselves and their dear ones in the near future. And only 7.7% of those employed in the agricultural sector believe they will find a tantamount job in case of losing the current one. There is a need to create more high-tech jobs in the agriculture, and the structure of the rural economy should be diversified through developing non-agricultural kinds of activity and the social infrastructure.","[Blinova, Tatiana; Vyalshina, Anna] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Agrarian Problems, Saratov, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Agrarian Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Blinova, T (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Agrarian Problems, Saratov, Russia.",ruandre@mail.ru; anvyal@mail.ru,"Vyalshina, Anna/V-5999-2018",,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,15,21,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400002,0

Further, the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) on and structural breaks in the degree of integration are explored. The paper, additionally, analyses the behaviour of the level and the rate of change of the degree of integration around the period of the GFC. Design/methodology/approach - The paper relies on the R-2 from a single factor world and the incremental R-2 from a two-factor world and emerging market models as proxies for the global and emerging markets degree of integration, respectively. Relying on the Quandt test for unknown structural breakdates, the paper examines structural breaks in the degree of integration. Findings - The degree of global integration of emerging markets exceeds their degree of integration with themselves, particularly in the recent period. Additionally, the GFC is a significant driver of the recent increase in world market integration. We observe significant structural shifts in both the degree of the world and emerging markets integration measures. The breaks in the world market integration largely coincide with the GFC, whereas that of the emerging market integration is dispersed. Also, the level of the world market degree of integration has reversed recently, although, the degree of world market integration remains above pre-crisis point. Practical implications - There exist high country-specific components in emerging market returns that are not accounted for by the world and emerging market factors despite the recent increase in global integration. Thusly, portfolios that diversify across emerging markets appear to have a high diversification potential. Additionally, substantial diversification gains may be realised with the inclusion of emerging market assets in global portfolios. Originality/value - The paper shows that the emerging markets respond similarly to common global, although, diversely to emerging markets events. Additionally, evidence of the impacts of the GFC on the degree of global integration of emerging markets is presented.","[Boamah, Nicholas Addai] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Real Estate & Land Management, Tamale, Ghana",University for Development Studies,"Boamah, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Dev Studies, Dept Real Estate & Land Management, Tamale, Ghana.",addaianas@yahoo.com,,"Boamah, Nicholas Addai/0000-0002-2410-9276",,,,,57,11,11,1,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

In this way the organization is to minimize its losses that appeared due to the discrepancy of established and real figures. In case of production output in accordance with the requirements, defined by the customer, the specific features of price formation do not allow disposing the product at a price and with the cost effectiveness value higher than one installed by the customer, overstate or understate production output costs. It is shown that existing calculation methods can not be applied by organizations that work with the directive contract. In the article, the backflush costing approach that corresponds to the normative legal acts regulating the economic components formation in the sphere of directive planning, is considered. If conditions, proved in this article, are met, the organization will reach maximum possible profit, operating revenue indicators and an optimum cost level that will provide the covering of all the production expenses. The developed method of the contract price formation in case of limitation of its cost has been successfully implemented in the system of research and industrial enterprises of military-industrial complex of the Russian Federation. This method provides the suitable combination of the contract price and the gross profit for both subjects of economic activity - the customer and the enterprise. The research provided by the authors of the article provides a scientific contribution to the evolution of the backflush calculation approach and calculation of production costs that has various limitations of its market price. Developed method allows also executing the actual cost accounting till the moment of the accounting reporting period and correction of financial results basing on customers' conclusions.","[Chernenko, A.

We consider traditional circumstances such as parental income and educational level, but improve on the previous literature including mother's cognitive skills in our assessment. Our results indicate that Chilean children do not exhibit significant differences in height or weight either as newborns or at two to four years old. Nevertheless, there is evidence of inequality of opportunities for vocabulary skills. Maternal cognitive ability is the greatest contributor. Finally, the evidence also suggests that inequality of opportunity on vocabulary skills increases with age.","[Contreras, Dante; Puentes, Esteban] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Business, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Of 1603, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Puentes, E (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Business, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Of 1603, Santiago, Chile.",epuentes@fen.uchile.cl,"Puentes, Esteban/P-2391-2017","Puentes, Esteban/0000-0001-7603-2197",Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [15130009],Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica,This work was supported by the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [15130009];,,25,7,10,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In contemporary context education has an important role based on intellectual capital. Thus, in higher education students are trained to meet the challenges of the labor market. So, it is therefore important the quality of the educational process. In this situation, professors are using interactive and modern teaching methods to develop different skills to each student. The purpose of the paper is to highlight the role of intellectual capital in education in a knowledge society where individual education is essential for social progress. Education is a complex component that must meet the challenges of contemporary society. Information technology has an important role because in the last decade is more and more used. Students use Internet like an important source of information and apply different teaching techniques in order to obtain performance in educational process. The paper is based on a qualitative research, conducted on a sample of 100 people aged between 19 and 25 years old (students at a university from Bucharest). The key question raised at this point is: What is the role of Intellectual Capital in the training-educational process? The main objectives of the study are: 1). mention the main components of intellectual capital, 2). highlighting the organizational knowledge and intelligence, 3). presenting the main educational strategies based on creativity and interactivity, 4). presenting the role of innovation in the context of knowledge-based society, 5). presenting the analysis of qualitative research results regarding the role of intellectual capital in education. The topic of the paper is popular and has potential for future research because, today, in the context of globalization society is continuously changing. So, education is facing with new challenges of the labor market being necessary to continuously adapt to the new requirements.","[Contu, Eleonora Gabriela] Univ Bucharest, Fac Adm & Business, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Contu, EG (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Fac Adm & Business, Bucharest, Romania.",eleonora.contu@faa.unibuc.ro,"Contu, Eleonora/IAQ-4209-2023",,,,,,9,3,3,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,66,70,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000009,0

In other words, when factors of production move from a sector with a low productivity to a sector with a high productivity or from a sector with slow growth in productivity to a sector with fast growth in productivity, it will promote the increasing of productivity. In this paper, we use the shift-share method to study the impact of labor mobility among the three industries on the growth of labor productivity. It is found that labor mobility has a positive effect on the growth of productivity, that is, the Structural-Bonus Hypothesis exists, but it does not always exist. Labor mobility sometimes inhibits the growth of productivity. The growth of labor productivity in China largely depends on industry internal effect, such as the progress of technology, the promotion of laborers' quality and so on. Therefore, the more reasonable distribution of factors of production among the three industries is, the more conducive it is to the growth of labor productivity.","[Dong, Kun; Men, Yu; Fan, Ru-Ling] 2nd Linggong Rd, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China",,"Men, Y (通讯作者)，2nd Linggong Rd, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",dongkun@dlut.edu.cn; menyu15@mail.dlut.edu.cn; fanruling@mail.dlut.edu.cn,"fan, ru/GYQ-7323-2022",,,,,,7,0,0,1,5,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-8868,,978-1-60595-502-5,DESTECH TRANS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426941400025,0

They can be formed both on the basis of information, received by state statistics bodies within the framework of the existing federal statistical observations, and on the basis of data, included in new forms of static reporting received from enterprises and organizations. In the opinion of the authors, the first of the above-mentioned modes of using the available information is more preferable, since it does not require additional financial and labor costs from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service. In turn, the second mode helps to fill the existing gap in the information required by the authorities and management on the various levels - federal, regional and local. The authors proposed new indicators of municipal statistics, formed using the information on the existing and new forms of federal statistical observation. The figures for calculating new indicators can be drawn from both administrative and census data. The proposed indicators cover three directions of the development of a municipal entity: the economic situation, the state of transport infrastructure and transport communication, the innovative activities of organizations operating in the municipality.","[Dvoryadkina, Elena B.; Kaibicheva, Catherine I.; Titovets, Alisa Yu.] Ural State Univ Econ, Dept Reg Municipal Econ & Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural State University of Economics,"Dvoryadkina, EB (通讯作者)，Ural State Univ Econ, Dept Reg Municipal Econ & Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",elena.dvoryadkina@yandex.ru,,,Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [17-32-00016],Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"The reported study was supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), research project No. 17-32-00016 Responses of peripheral urban districts to changes of the parameters of regional economy in conditions of the local government reform",,18,1,1,0,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,280,285,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600047,0

The article gives an overview of current management approaches to the development of university staff potential, based on the analysis of modern concepts, expert discourse, and universities' best practices. Special focus is given to describing the experience of organisational and functional changes in HR management of one of the biggest Russian universities, as well as to the results of the survey on the faculty members' motivation for professional development, an essential factor in its intellectual capital formation. The article emphasises the importance of building an effective system for managing university staff professional development taking into account the specifics of each staff category: faculty members, researchers and administrative staff. The survey methodology can provide relevant information for making pinpoint management decisions on measures for improving the quality of universities' human and intellectual capital. The results of the pilot study into academic staff well-being in the conditions of ongoing innovative changes are given as an example. Based on the synthesis of theory and practice, the authors developed a number of practical recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency of human resources and intellectual capital management at universities. The effectiveness of the implementation of a systemic approach to the development of university human potential depends, among other things, on the rational distribution of responsibilities and functions between its structural units. The main problem in this respect is the traditionally bureaucratic type of management that hinders essential innovations. The paper discusses possible solutions in university organisational design related to the aforementioned objectives.","[Fedorova, Alena; Ponomareva, Olga] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Fedorova, A (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",a.e.fedorova@urfu.ru; o.ya.ponomareva@urfu.ru,"Fedorova, Alena/E-5944-2013","Fedorova, Alena/0000-0002-4600-6489",,,,,8,5,5,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,97,105,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000013,0

This question has not been systematically studied. Using two new datasets, we find that when group size and status are analyzed at national levels smaller groups are generally worse off than larger groups. By contrast, when group size and status are analyzed at subnational (regional or district) levels, smaller groups are better off than larger groups. National minorities are disadvantaged while local minorities are advantaged.We theorize that two factors are at work in generating this surprisingly consistent relationship. First, a synergy exists at national levels among three features of ethnic groups: size, power, and status. The second factor is based on social dynamics. Specifically, insofar as internal migration is characterized by positive selection, then migrants and their descendants should form the basis of small, privileged groups within the region that they migrate to. Insofar as distance enhances positive selection, this explains why smaller migrations are associated with more privileged groups and larger migrations with somewhat less privileged groups.","[Gerring, John] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt, 158 W 21st ST STOP A1800,Batts Hall 2-116, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Thacker, Strom C.] Union Coll, Off Acad Affairs, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA; [Thacker, Strom C.] Union Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA; [Lu, Yuan] Yale Yale New Haven Hosp, CORE, New Haven, CT USA; [Oncel, Erzen] MEF Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Istanbul, Turkey",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Union College; Union College; MEF Universitesi,"Gerring, J (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt, 158 W 21st ST STOP A1800,Batts Hall 2-116, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",jgerring@austin.utexas.edu,"yang, qing/JBR-8440-2023; Oncel, Erzen/AAH-1139-2020; Library, MEF/O-1457-2019","Oncel, Erzen/0000-0001-9372-1090;",,,,,46,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The scientific and technological parks promote the economic development of regions and cities by: creating new business opportunities and adding value to existing companies, entrepreneurial supervision and incubation for newly established companies, creating jobs in the scientific field, increasing collaboration between universities and companies. The aim of this paper is to examine if Liberty Center Science Park located in Cluj Napoca, a city located in Romania, can be considered as a benchmark for technological developers. The methodology used is data collection, by examining the existing data in the form of databases (notably, public financial data), reports, newsletters, press releases, etc. regarding the science park Liberty Center Cluj.

The results showed that labor transfer has significant effect on farm households' adoption of farming techniques and channels, the high level of labor transfer is not conducive to the adoption of new techniques. Farm households with labor loss have little interest in advanced the techniques of Camellia oleifera cultivation and be more willing to engage in traditional productive activities. While Camellia oleifera growers with the high level of labor transfer tend to get new technology from various ways other than the technical service from government, there is less demand for new techniques in these households. Therefore, for agro-tech departments, it is necessary to pay attention to the technical choice of farmers when developing agro-technical popularization policies, meanwhile, it is needed to focus on the influence of roles differentiation, family characteristics, land scale and other aspects on farm households' adoption of farming techniques and channels, to improve China's forestry technology contribution rate to forestry economic growth more practically.","[Jiang, Xiaomin; Liu, Weiping] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China",Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University,"Jiang, XM (通讯作者)，Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.",415322759@qq.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-382-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,48.0,,,,,,291,294,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9GL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416078200062,0

It describes the personal identification process and it also discusses the potentials of usability of the facial recognition and other innovative personal identification approaches. The review highlights that, today, most tech services recommend or require hard, cryptic passwords with characters, capital letters, and numbers in them, but there is always a trade-off between simplicity and safety. Fortunately, as this paper shows, some new innovative forms of personal identification are on their way. Particularly, biometric technology seems to be the most promising. Of course, wearable biometric-based devices will also eventually play a central role in the future, as they will allow multifactor personal identification methods as a more stable and more secure way to control data access, to be developed.","[Jorga, Frank S.] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Ruscakova, Anna] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin Inst Finance Innovat & Digitalizat, Badensche Str 52, D-10825 Berlin, Germany",Technical University Kosice; Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Jorga, FS (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",frank.jorga@webid-solutions.de; anna.ruscakova@bifid.org,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,341,349,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700036,0

Agricultural trade is influenced by some economical and political factors. This paper presents gravity model identifying dependence of volume of 24 importedexported products from GDP EU, GDP RU with regard to distance between capitals of EU countries and Russia, common border, related language, common history, and availability of sea ports. The research includes the dataset with data about export and import of agricultural products (24 types of products) with each of 28 countries of EU for 16 years. Data source is UnComtrade database. Researched period is 2000-2015. Linear regression analysis was used to make predictions. Analysis of export trade flow from EU countries to Russia revealed 3 groups of products proved to be the most consistent by linear regression models: dairy products, eggs, honey, edible animal products; beverages, spirits and vinegar; meat and edible meat offal. These three groups take 34% of total volume of export into Russia. Linear regression model explains only 50% of results and the rest is explained by other factors out of the model. Analysis of import trade flows between EU countries and Russia proved inconsistency of used linear regression models. Chosen four groups of products: animal, vegetable fats and oils; beverages, spirits and vinegar; cereals; fish make 73% of imported agricultural products from Russia. These groups are hardly explained by models (R square less than 0.3). This fact might be explained by factors which are out of the model and it is quite difficult to estimate their influence. One of such factors is political decisions of the government. It should be concluded that suggested gravity model can be used to predict agricultural trade flow to Russia but not from Russia.","[Kontsevaya, Stanislava; Kharcheva, Irina] Russian Timiryazev State Agrarian Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Smutka, Lubos] CULS Prague, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kontsevaya, S (通讯作者)，Russian Timiryazev State Agrarian Univ, Moscow, Russia.",s.kontsevaya@mail.ru; doc_tasia_22@mail.ru; smutka@pef.czu.cz,"Kharcheva, Irina V/F-2357-2017; Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Kontsevaya, Stanislava/F-2088-2017","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Kontsevaya, Stanislava/0000-0002-1222-1682",,,,,15,0,0,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,151,158,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400020,0

Recent advances in data availability provide new opportunities to understand commuting patterns efficiently and effectively. This study develops a series of data mining methods to identify the spatiotemporal commuting patterns of Beijing public transit riders. Using one-month transit smart card data, we measure spatiotemporal regularity of individual commuters, including residence, workplace, and departure time. This data could be used to identify transit commuters by leveraging spatial clustering and multi-criteria decision analysis approaches. A disaggregated-level survey is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods with a commuter identification accuracy that reaches as high as 94.1%. By visualizing the spatial distribution of the homes and workplaces of transit commuters, we determine a clear disparity between commuters and noncommuters and confirm the existence of job-house imbalance in Beijing. The findings provide Useful insights for policymakers to shape a more balanced job-housing relationship by adjusting the monocentric urban structure of Beijing.

The study allowed to define problems of local communities which lived in areas with unstable occupational structure, vague prospects of development, characterized by duration rather than development. To collect the empirical data there were conducted twenty-eight in-depth and narrative interviews with farmers from the Cekcyn municipality with diverse profiles of farming. The study was supplemented with overt participant observation. Farming transformation in the Cekcyn municipality is progressing slowly. Farmers are tentatively developing their activities, being afraid of overinvestment. Some of them are planning to change their line of production. The respondents admitted that apart from the economic one they also need mental support. New information and alternative technologies are in high demand, especially in the areas of poor soil quality, and with scattered farms which lack investment.","[Marcysiak, Tomasz] WSB Univ Torun, Fac Finance & Management Bydgoszcz, Dept Social Sci, Torun, Poland; [Prus, Piotr] UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Fac Agr & Biotechnol, Dept Econ & Advising Agribusiness, Bydgoszcz, Poland",Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology,"Marcysiak, T (通讯作者)，WSB Univ Torun, Fac Finance & Management Bydgoszcz, Dept Social Sci, Torun, Poland.",tomasz.marcysiak@wsb.bydgoszcz.pl; piotr.prus@utp.edu.pl,"Prus, Piotr/L-6034-2019","Prus, Piotr/0000-0002-4447-4019",,,,,21,14,14,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,212,218,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400028,0

The author therefore analyzes the stock market's reaction to analyst forecasting decisions, and finds that investors overreact to forecasts that are exactly equal to the minimum or maximum of the guidance range, but do not overreact to other types of forecasts. The evidence presented is most consistent with overreaction driven by overconfident investors who trade too much in the face of information uncertainty.","[Michel, Jean-Sebastien] Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp, 100 Sheppard Ave E,Suite 300, Toronto, ON M2N 6Z1, Canada",,"Michel, JS (通讯作者)，Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp, 100 Sheppard Ave E,Suite 300, Toronto, ON M2N 6Z1, Canada.",jmichel@cmhc.ca,,,,,,,29,3,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

In the last two years, the US dollar has been experiencing an increase in its value, which is known as appreciation of the currency or can also be called revaluation of the dollar, there is no listing defined by economists or analysts about the causes that influence the appreciation of the dollar. Some of this causes are, a process of inflation that has a direct impact on the economies of Latin American countries, an increase in demand for US dollars by investors who leave aside Euros and yen, deterioration of the prices of raw materials or also called commodities, such as oil. gold. copper, coal, silver, coffee, and deceleration of the Chinese economy.

We estimate a multinomial endogenous switching regression model of farm household's choice of combinations of CF practices and their impacts on crop net revenue. Four primary results are found. First, several factors affect adoption of CF practices depending on the combinations in which they are adopted. Second, all CF practices significantly increase crop net revenue per hectare when practised either singly or jointly. Third, a joint adoption of crop residue retention and minimum soil disturbance yields the highest crop net revenue per hectare among all the possible combinations of CF practices. Thus a more comprehensive approach that focuses on joint adoption of all CF practices is not the best income yielding portfolio. Fourth, adoption of CF practices in combination generally results in more crop net revenue per hectare than adopting them in isolation. Therefore, results point towards the need for promotion of adoption of CF practices in combination while considering the influence from household, seed, plot level, agro-ecological, and miscellaneous factors to enable farmers in Zambia to realise most payoffs.","[Ng'ombe, John N.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Kalinda, Thomson H.; Tembo, Gelson] Univ Zambia, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, POB 32379, Lusaka, Zambia",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of Zambia,"Ng'ombe, JN (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.;Kalinda, TH; Tembo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Zambia, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, POB 32379, Lusaka, Zambia.",ngombe@okstate.edu; thkalinda@unza.zm; tembogel@unza.zm,"Ng'ombe, John N./GXA-1230-2022; Ng'ombe, John Nedson/I-2655-2019","Ng'ombe, John Nedson/0000-0002-1410-1350",,,,,47,42,45,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2017,56.0,2,,,,,205,221,,10.1080/03031853.2017.1312467,0.0,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EW9IJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402831700009,0

Using the panel regression model, we analysed data from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic and data from the National Health Information Center of the Slovak Republic. The results confirm the existence of the association between income inequalities and mortality from respiratory diseases. Income quintile ratio as a measure of income distribution inequality brings a reduction of the standardised mortality rate by 19.21 deaths each time it increases its value by one unit. Income expressed by mean equivalised net income per household performs as the least influencing indicator on the standardised mortality rate.

It is built for the principal companies of the Russian copper industry using the analysis of panel data for 87 companies. Further, this model is evaluated using the least square method; 3) interpretation of the results, obtained with the economic statistical model. The methodology of the work includes comparative analysis and generalization of information obtained from different sources. A content analysis of recent Russian and foreign analytical publications was undertaken. Statistical (panel) data were analyzed and a regression model was built, which uses the revenues of a copper industry company as a dependent variable, while direct investment, capital and material inventory at the company's premises served as independent variables. The model was further assessed with the least square method. The research allows concluding that the direct investment plays an important role in the company's business, but at the level of the industry, they are accompanied by negative internal effects due to existing volatile movements, including presence of major players in the market.","[Pridvizhkin, Stanislav Victorovich; Kozhevnikova, Margarita Karpovna] Ural Fed Univ, Dept Price Format Construct & Ind, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Bazhenov, Oleg Victorovich] Ural Fed Univ, Dept Accounting Anal & Audit, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Bayev, Denis Vitalyevich] Ural Fed Univ, Dept Int Econ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University; Ural Federal University; Ural Federal University,"Bazhenov, OV (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Dept Accounting Anal & Audit, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",6819@list.ru,"Bazhenov, Oleg V/C-3924-2015",,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,58,62,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600010,0

Our assumption was that Lower empathy in dangerous drivers have less empathy might result in lower cooperation in the Public Goods Game. We took two groups of subjects: group of safe drivers and dangerous drivers and we made them perform several tests in order to measure their empathy. We also compared behavior of the two groups in Public Goods Game without and with a possibility of punishment. The groups did not reveal different level of empathy in any of the tasks and their level of contribution did not differ on statistically significant level.

Complexity principally stems from the nature of the problems organizations face: the issues that constitute these problems are extensive and interconnected, and usually associated with high levels of uncertainty. Turbulence, on the other hand, arises when the organizations that share it do not share the knowledge in the right way. This condition thus makes it difficult for organizations to structure and solve the problems they face. This issue is of great importance nowadays specially in public sector where problems are to be structured and the policies are to be implemented in collaboration and the knowledge is to be aggregated since sustainable public management relies on a multi-faceted knowledge system in which techniques are continuously updated to reflect current understanding and public needs. The challenge is to minimize delay as ideas flow from intent through scientific capability and finally to implementation to achieve desired outcomes. The best way to do this is by setting the stage for the flow of knowledge between researchers, policy makers and managers. This research note explores the significance of the problem structuring methods in collaborative contexts. The underlying proposition is that the methods can be expected to contribute meaningfully to the collaboration and knowledge-sharing process principally by improving actors' sense-making of their problem and providing structure to the product of such sense-making, which can finally lead to higher level of knowledge in multi-level organizations specially in public sector. This research proposes a model to indicate the role of power, dialogue, shared meaning and implementation to reach collaboration. The proposition is considered here, first, from a theoretical-conceptual perspective and, thereafter, with reference to an action research project concerning industry-academic collaboration aimed at building a high value healthcare environment in ministry of health in Iran.","[Rouzbehani, Khadijeh] Univ Tehran, Management Fac, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran,"Rouzbehani, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Management Fac, Tehran, Iran.",rrouzbehani@ut.ac.ir,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,358,364,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000044,0

Because the amortization costs of transition amounts are cost attributed to the old deficits that appeared in the adoption year, they do not contain new additional information unless managers deliver private information through accountings choices. The data-set is from Japanese firms after the adoption of the postretirement accounting standard wherein recognition costs of transition amounts had a huge impact on the bottom-line earnings of sponsoring firms. We find that investors evaluate the amortization costs of transition amounts as though they hold new, value-relevant information.

The spatial typology is carried out on the basis of time series analysis for the last 25 years of the following four demographical indicators: the children ratio, the elderly ratio, the ageing index (AI) and the dynamic ageing index (DAI). The world's current ageing index is about 30 (stationary population pyramid). Only in Europe is more than 100 and in the European Union actually around 121 (constrictive population pyramid).

In such discourses, some scholars and policy-makers highlight non-agrarian pathways leading to prosperity, while others continue to emphasize the significance of land and farming for poverty reduction. However, such analyses tend not only to obscure strong linkages between agriculture, migration and rural labour, but also stay silent on how rural people interpret changes or continuities in their livelihoods. In this paper, I focus on the case of rural Nepal to unfold how some rural people, but not others, improve their livelihoods through international labour migration, farming and rural labour. This paper reveals that many poor people have experienced improved livelihoods pursuing a diverse portfolio of agricultural and non-agricultural activities including labour migration. However, the dispossession of poor people from land and their adverse incorporation into the local and international labour markets continue to perpetuate chronic poverty.","[Sunam, Ramesh] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Sunam, R (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",ramesh.sunam@anu.edu.au,"Sunam, Ramesh/AAI-5597-2020","Sunam, Ramesh/0000-0003-3020-4787",ANU Crawford School of Public Policy,ANU Crawford School of Public Policy,"I wish to thank the anonymous reviewers and Jens Lerche, Associate Editor of the Journal, for their helpful comments and suggestions.

In order to foster innovation performance in lagging regions, the European Commission has introduced a smart specialisation concept which has been adopted by many EU member countries. Lithuania is not an exception. However, the change is not as fast as it could be expected. Therefore, there is a motivation to investigate intellectual resources as the enabling factors of a faster transition. The aim of this contribution is to introduce a new national intellectual capital (NIC) identification approach which is intended for the initial evaluation of intangible resources in Lithuania's laser industry. The essence of the suggested approach is explained briefly and results of the empirical research are discussed in the paper. A qualitative research approach is applied in the empirical research. Lithuanian context study along with the interview technique is used for data collection. One of the nineteen priorities of Lithuanian smart specialization called photonic and laser technologies is selected for thorough investigation. Relevant intangible assets associated with the Lithuanian laser industry and their strengths and weaknesses in respect to value creation for industry are discussed. And finally, some practical insights and recommendations based on the results are provided. The main value and novelty of this paper lays in the demonstration that suggested a new identification approach of the key intangible resources reveal real life problems that cannot be identified through statistical data. At the same time, this approach leads to dialog and helps to create trust through a researcher as an intermediary. The experience from this study leads to the conclusion that effective initiatives must be based not just on quantitative but qualitative data as well.","[Uziene, Lina; Januskaite, Virginija] Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Uziene, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania.",Lina.uziene@ktu.lt; Virginija.januskaite@ktu.edu,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,389,398,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000047,0

It is argued that FOI laws increase transparency and fix accountability of the government. We provide quantitative evidence on the impact of FOI laws on perceived government corruption. Using panel data for 132 countries over the 1990-2011 period, we find that adopting FOI laws after controlling for self-section bias, is associated with an increase in perceived government corruption driven by an increase in detection of corrupt acts. In fact, FOI laws appear to increase the perception of government corruption if combined with a higher degree of media freedom, presence of NGO activism and political competition. However, the perception of government corruption tends to decline with the duration of FOI law adoption. These findings are robust to controlling for endogeneity using instrumental variables, alternative samples and estimation methods.","[Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway; [Cooray, Arusha] Univ Nottingham, Fac Social Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Nottingham Malaysia,"Vadlamannati, KC (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dragvoll 10, N-7079 Trondheim, Norway.",krishna.c.vadlamannati@svt.ntnu.no,"Cooray, Arusha/X-1507-2019","Cooray, Arusha/0000-0001-8809-9188; Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya/0000-0001-5999-1126",,,,,50,30,32,2,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In this paper I review the literature on price transmission and market integration, highlighting applications in an African setting. I begin by reviewing the basic methods that are commonly used in price transmission analysis, as well as several extensions that have gained prevalence in recent years.

Compared with catastrophe insurance and reinsurance, catastrophe bond is operated more efficiently, has lower trading cost and wider risk diversification channel. Researches of catastrophe bond are thorough, but most of the pricing researches are based on the whole country, the design of catastrophe bond in specific area is not well developed. As the main catastrophe in southeast costal in China, typhoon causes tremendous losses every year. Typhoon loss in Zhejiang Province, for example, has exceeded 100 billion. Considering the integrity of the data and the adequacy of the samples, this paper uses the historical data of typhoon loss in Zhejiang Province to design and price the single-risk catastrophe bond. This paper intends to provide instrument to mitigate the typhoon damage in Zhejiang Province. Firstly in theoretical part, this paper summarizes the classical pricing researches of catastrophe bond, analyzes the classical catastrophe pricing models and their applications both domestically and internationally. This paper emphasizes the necessity of catastrophe bond in Zhejiang Province according to the disadvantages of its existing catastrophe subsidies, and analyzes the feasibility by explaining the market environment and international cases. To price the catastrophe bond, this paper selects the data of typhoon loss in Zhejiang Province between 1949 and 2013, and deals data with Matlab. After setting the term and and trigger mechanism, we apply a binary tree model based on term structure of interest rates to estimate the forward rates, then combines the frequency and the losses caused by typhoon in Zhejiang Province. The discounted cash flow method is used to price the different kinds of typhoon bonds. Besides, the paper also analyzes the sensitivity of the price to the triggers. We hope the typhoon bond in Zhejiang Province, as a try of single-risk catastrophe bond pricing research, can promote the research on territory-oriented catastrophe risk securitization products, in order to enhance the catastrophe coping capability in different area.","[Wang Haiyan] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Finance, Room 816,1500 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Shi Yanjing] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",Tongji University; Tongji University,"Wang, HY (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Finance, Room 816,1500 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",wanghaiyan@tongji.edu.cn; 1630950@tongji.edu.cn; sxr1991@126.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,2,8,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,775,800,,,,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700053,0

However, it is the direct cause of deforestation; Uncontrolled burning of vegetation is also a major cause of forest fires. At present, Vietnam has about 50 ethnic groups making shifting cultivation. Each ethnic group has its own characteristics in shifting cultivation, which reflects their perceptions, experiences, traditions and religious beliefs. The cycle of cultivation takes place at various stages and follows a very strict cultivation schedule: the main stages of the shifting cultivation cycle are: (i) site selection (in principle, generally select old forests, good soil, few bushes, vines, (iii) clear, (iv) prune(v) care, weed (vi) harvest (vii) abandon. Therefore, the best approach to improving and preserving soil quality is through the use of ecological agricultural practices: reuse of residues of crops and animal derived organic fertilizers, reduced use of chemicals in agriculture, promotion of cover crops, especially legumes, to protect and rehabilitate land. Care should be taken to develop techniques for maximizing biomass, ground cover and continuity of the cover to prevent soil erosion, enhance biological activity, enhance reproductive nutrition, create basic soil properties such as soil texture, organic content, porosity, pH, etc. All these efforts are aimed at creating the best conditions for the growth and development of the crops. Studies show that management of shifting cultivation towards an agro-ecology approach is indispensable in the sustainable management and use of sloping land. This in fact has significantly increased yields on sloping crops, reduced erosion and income diversification for farmers while preserving resources and improving the environment, contributing to hunger elimination and poverty reduction and achievement of food security goals for the mountainous areas.","[Xuan Minh Tran; Lei, Guoping; Ngoc Dan Nguyen] Northeastern Univ, Inst Land Management, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China,"Tran, XM (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Inst Land Management, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,8,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-437-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,32.0,,,,,,351,356,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426689600072,0

Therefore the development of corn insurance is a way to protect the revenue of the peasant households and stabilize the production of corn. Jilin province is one of the most productive provinces for corn produce. Since 2008 corn insurance has been developed in Jilin Province. Even if the central and local government subsidized the premiums for the peasant households, the corn insurance has undergone a lot of issues existed in practice. This paper appraises the corn yield risks in 9 perfecture-level cities in Jilin Province (Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Liaoyuan, Tonghua, Baishan, Songyuan, Yanji and Baicheng) with area yield risk appraisal indicators. Then the premium rate is determined by the expected losses of the area over the yield protection level. The empirical results show that 9 perfecture-level cities in Jilin Province falls into 3 groups. In terms of the premium rating, Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Liaoyuan, Tonghua and Baishan are the higher premium rates areas, Songyuan and Yanji are of medium premium rates and the premium rate of Baicheng is the highest.","[Yan Yunxian; Wang Yiping] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Changchun 130118, Jilin, Peoples R China",Jilin Agricultural University,"Yan, YX (通讯作者)，Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Changchun 130118, Jilin, Peoples R China.",jlauyyx@126.com; 664083302@qq.com,"wang, yi/GVT-8516-2022",,,,,,8,1,1,1,2,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,105,111,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700008,0

Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) we are able to link adult earnings with parental and family characteristics (for example, parental income, education and house value). Using family background variables we preform classification exercise via clustering algorithm and group individuals into two groups based on family background and childhood environment. Using these distinctive groups and decomposition methods we separate the total earnings gap on the explained part (composition effect: the effect of individual-level covariates) and the unexplained (structure effect: the return on the individual-level covariates). Results indicate that there are significant mean and quantile gaps between two groups and that the total gap is increasing in percentile difference. The explained effect is around 70 percent across the quantiles, which implies that 30 percent of differences in wages cannot be explained by individual characteristics but group membership, i.e. childhood environment. Furthermore, running a detailed decomposition, we conclude that single most important covariate is education as differences in education across the groups can explain approximately 50 percent of total difference and 80 percent of explained difference. These results, using a novel approach, corroborate conclusions regarding substantial influence of early childhood environment on earnings.","[Zilic, Ivan] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Zilic, I (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.",izilic@eizg.hr,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,0,BC GRUP INC,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH, 2134 SOK, DERELI APT.

To do so, it uses a novel dataset of individual lending operations between Chilean banks and their foreign counterparties between 2008 and 2016. The paper finds that global banks that experienced the largest hikes in their funding costs and were based in countries with large increases in sovereign risk increased spreads to Chilean banks most in this period, and that global financial turbulences also spilled through to the funding cost of Chilean banks. After the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 the Chilean banking system underwent a significant change in its sources of funding, with a shift to new bank counterparties and a higher reliance on bond financing. The paper provides evidence that distance, as well as the intensity and age of banking relationships matter for the cost of cross border borrowing. Hence, this shift of sources of funding was initially a costly process. Over time as banking relationships developed with new counterparties, the cost of this shift decreased.

Those arguments emphasize the existence of higher involuntary underemployment among the poor and the fact that the type of work provided by these schemes gives disutility, deterring non-poor households from participating. To include these features, the consumption-based welfare metric used in past assessments of workfare schemes in underemployed developing countries is generalized to incorporate a welfare loss from casual manual work, while allowing the government to independently value the work done for other reasons. Using data for India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), the paper shows that the policy ranking switches in favor of a basic-income guarantee (BIG) over workfare. Allowing for a welfare loss from casual manual labor implies a more poor-poor targeting performance, but this is not sufficient to compensate for the direct welfare loss from the work requirement for plausible parameter values. A BIG dominates NREGS for a given total outlay on workfare wages. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This is the first empirical study to examine the effects of PFL on long-term care patterns. Multivariate difference-indifference estimates across alternative comparison groups provide consistent evidence that the implementation of PFL reduced the proportion of the elderly population in nursing homes by 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points. Our preferred estimate, employing an empirically-matched group of control states, finds that PFL reduced nursing home usage by about 0.65 percentage points.

The focus is participation in a voluntary recycling scheme, in the context of a European country (Malta) where two parties dominate the political landscape. A nationally-representative survey (n = 1037), yielded information on recycling participation rates and on environmental and political preferences. The survey was conducted shortly after a change in government and also gauged intent to participate in a new scheme with a split-sample manipulation in which the treatment group received a political prime. The results indicate that the initial uptake of the scheme launched by a Nationalist government was significantly lower among respondents close to the Labour Party. Five years later this effect had decayed. But intent to participate in the hypothetical scheme was lower among respondents close to the party in opposition (this time, the Nationalist Party), if primed with a cue that associates the new scheme with the Labour party. Formal modeling of scheme participation and intent (controlling for political and environmental ideology inter alia), yielded consistent results. These findings shed light on a new dimension which may be responsible for diverse rates of uptake of a public good schemes with practical implications for scheme promotion.","[Briguglio, Marie] Univ Malta, Fac Econ Management & Accountancy, Dept Econ, MSD-2080 Tal Qroqq, Malta; [Delaney, Liam] Univ Coll Dublin, Geary Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Briguglio, Marie; Delaney, Liam; Wood, Alex] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Behav Sci Ctr, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Malta; University College Dublin; University of Stirling,"Briguglio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Malta, Fac Econ Management & Accountancy, Dept Econ, MSD-2080 Tal Qroqq, Malta.;Briguglio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Behav Sci Ctr, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",marie.briguglio@um.edu.mt; liam.delaney@ucd.ie; alex.wood@stir.ac.uk,"Wood, Alex M/A-2371-2011; Briguglio, Marie/C-1921-2017","Briguglio, Marie/0000-0003-4018-795X; Wood, Alex/0000-0002-8010-1455",Early Career Engagement Grant - Scottish Institute for Research in Economics [ECR Engagement 08/2013]; University of Malta Bursary,Early Career Engagement Grant - Scottish Institute for Research in Economics; University of Malta Bursary,"The study was funded through an Early Career Engagement Grant awarded by the Scottish Institute for Research in Economics (ECR Engagement 08/2013) and was supported by a University of Malta Bursary.

From the point of view of policy makers, understanding the sources of these appreciations is crucial for designing efficient policy responses. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we determine the extent to which appreciation episodes were determined by changes in fundamentals or if they constitute exchange rate misalignments. Second, we assess the impact that non-fundamental variables have on the real exchange rate dynamics. Based on a reduced form model, we conclude that appreciation episodes, in the aftermath of the 2009 financial crisis, can be explained by two elements: (i) an improvement in fundamentals and (ii) a correction of past misalignments. Hence, the real appreciation observed since 2010 was driven, mostly, by fundamental elements. In terms of policy implications, our results suggest that appreciations in that period should have been tolerated by policy makers.","[Caputo, Rodrigo] Univ Santiago USACH, Santiago, Chile; [Caputo, Rodrigo] Univ Oxford, CESS, Oxford, England",Universidad de Santiago de Chile; University of Oxford,"Caputo, R (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago USACH, Santiago, Chile.;Caputo, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, CESS, Oxford, England.",rodrigo.caputo@cantab.net,,"Caputo Galarce, Rodrigo Ernesto/0000-0003-1658-2802",,,,,50,4,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

This paper develops path analysis models for one-and two-worker households in Great Britain, using data from the National Travel Survey (2005-2012), to study the effects of teleworking frequency on household-level weekly trips and travel distances by mode. The results indicate that among single-worker households, higher teleworking frequencies are associated with more travel by all modes, particularly by car, while there is no significant association for two worker households. In terms of policy implications, these results do not support the expectation that home-based telework reduces travel, although the methods used do not permit us to definitively conclude that it increases travel.","[de Abreu e Silva, Joao] Univ Lisbon, CESUR CEris, IST, Ave Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Melo, Patricia C.] Univ Lisbon, ISEG Sch Econ & Management, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal; [Melo, Patricia C.] REM UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Lisboa,"Silva, JDE (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, CESUR CEris, IST, Ave Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",jabreu@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Silva, Joao de Abreu e/HJH-7378-2023; Melo, Patricia/G-9132-2017","Silva, Joao de Abreu e/0000-0002-7893-2671; Melo, Patricia/0000-0001-6722-1914",COST Action Social Networks and Travel Behaviour [TU1305]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7,COST Action Social Networks and Travel Behaviour; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7(European Union (EU)),"Acknowledgments about the funding support.

Findings indicate that a main reason Hispanics engage in self-employment is they can earn more working for themselves than in wage/salary work. Immigrants appear to be pushed into self-employment as a result of limited opportunities in the wage work sector. Although low relative earnings in wage/salary work could push workers with limited English proficiency into self-employment, our findings indicate barriers to this. Results suggest that workers pulled into self-employment are those with more work experience and a college degree. Workers who originate from Southern South America and Colombia have relatively high self-employment rates, while Mexico-origin workers have relatively low self-employment rates. We also uncover differences across Hispanic origin groups in terms of the influence of gender, education, and personal wealth on self-employment participation.","[Fisher, Monica; Lewin, Paul A.] Univ Idaho, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, 875 Perimeter Dr MS 2334, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho,"Fisher, M (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, 875 Perimeter Dr MS 2334, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",monicaf@uidaho.edu; plewin@uidaho.edu,"Lewin, Paul/F-5872-2017","Lewin, Paul/0000-0002-2343-7059; Fisher, Monica/0000-0002-6669-6261",Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2016-69006-24831],Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,This work is supported by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) award No. 2016-69006-24831 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Sea level rise, ocean warming and acidification, and increased storminess threaten to alter or intensify biophysical coastal changes. Communities respond in ways that neither maximize total economic value nor apply the appropriate spatial scale of policy response. Focusing on coastline change, particularly in North Carolina, we synthesize modeling approaches and empirical studies to identify research that is needed to support coastal climate adaptation policy. Modeling coastlines as coupled human-natural systems explains historical patterns of coastline change, clarifies the need for empirical estimates, and provides a roadmap for interdisciplinary policy analysis. Despite the extensive literature on coastal amenities, hazards, and ex post policy evaluation, more empirical information is needed to parameterize coupled models of complex coastal environments facing climate change. Extending coupled models of coastal adaptation to incorporate spatial dynamics and market and nonmarket values highlights fundamental problems with current governance structures. We conclude that to maximize total economic value in the coastal zone, adaptation will require governance coordination across multiple levels, attention to intensive and extensive margins of adaptation, and trade-offs across market and nonmarket values. These findings echo recent advances in fisheries bioeconomics.","[Gopalakrishnan, Sathya] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Landry, Craig E.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 301 Conner Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Duke University,"Gopalakrishnan, S (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",gopalakrishnan.27@osu.edu; clandry@uga.edu; marsmith@duke.edu,"Gopalakrishnan, Sathya/K-4079-2012","Gopalakrishnan, Sathya/0000-0002-3593-0297","National Science Foundation Environment, Society, and the Economy [EAR 0951802]","National Science Foundation Environment, Society, and the Economy","Funding for S.

Actuarial independence is crucial in safeguarding accurate estimates, where this independence is self-regulated by actuarial professional institutions. However, professional conflicts of interest arise when appointed actuaries also hold an officer position within the same firm, as officer actuaries also face managerial incentives. Using a sample of U.S. insurers that employ in-house appointed actuaries from 2007 to 2014, we find evidence that officer actuaries have different reserving practices than nonofficer actuaries. This difference in reserving is associated with tax shielding and earnings management incentives.

Design/methodology/approach The analysis is carried out in three different steps. In the first part, the author analyzes the monthly stock returns and the important financial ratios - price-to-book (PB) ratio, price-earnings (PE) ratio and dividend yield (DY). Second, the author tests the sector-wise return predictability using Westerlund and Narayan (2012) flexible generalized least squares estimator. Third, the author compares the mean-variance-skewness (MVS) utility function with the mean-variance (MV) utility function. Findings The author forecasts the sectoral stock returns using three financial ratios - PB ratio, PE ratio and DY - as predictors. The results indicate that sectoral stock returns are significantly predicted by these financial ratios. The author then formulates trading strategies by including skewness in the utility function and finds that the investor utility is high when the utility function includes skewness as opposed to when the skewness is excluded. Originality/value The author extends the MV utility function to the MVS utility function and shows that the Indian stock market is more profitable when the investor uses a MVS utility function which highlights the main contribution to the literature.","[Kumar, Satish] Indian Inst Management Amritsar, Dept Finance, Amritsar, Punjab, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Amritsar,"Kumar, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Amritsar, Dept Finance, Amritsar, Punjab, India.",satishwar1985@gmail.com,"Kumar, Satish/AAJ-6596-2020","Kumar, Satish/0000-0001-5625-8877",,,,,39,0,0,0,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

J,"Napathorn, C",,,,"Napathorn, Chaturong",,,Contextual influences on HRM practices in social enterprises: the case of Thailand,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Human resource management; Recruitment; Cultural context,HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; PRODUCTIVITY; CULTURE; LABOR; GLOBALIZATION; STRATEGY,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the social enterprises and human resource management (HRM) literatures by examining how institutional and cultural contexts influence human resources (HR) practices, i.e., recruitment practices (specifically, recruitment channels) and employee relations (ER) practices that are adopted in social enterprises in the developing country of Thailand. Design/methodology/approach This paper applies an embedded cross-case analysis of four social enterprises in Thailand across a variety of industries. The case study evidence in this paper draws on semi-structured interviews with each social enterprise's representatives; field visits to each social enterprise in Bangkok and in other provinces in Thailand; and a review of archival documents and web-based reports and resources. This paper uses thematic analysis to pinpoint, examine and record the patterns or themes found in the data. Findings Based on these four case studies, this paper proposes that the deficiencies in the Thai skill formation system, especially skill shortages, are associated with the adoption of alternative or substream recruitment channels among social enterprises. Additionally, the weak and highly fragmented ER institution and the cultural context that favor conflict avoidance and unassertiveness among workers within the workplace are associated with the adoption of a paternalistic ER practice in these enterprises. Research limitations/implications This paper has only focused on the role of national skill formation system, ER system, and the cultural context that favor conflict avoidance and unassertiveness among workers within the workplace. Future research may explore how other institutional and cultural domains influence the adoption of HR practices in these enterprises in the context of emerging market economies. Additionally, because this research is based on the case studies of four social enterprises in a variety of industries in Thailand, the findings of this paper may not be generalizable to all social enterprises across countries. Another limitation of this research is that it did not include social enterprises in several other industries, including the entertainment and media industry and the printing and publishing industry, and it does not include other forms of social enterprises, such as community-led social ventures. Future research may explore how institutional and cultural contexts influence HR practices adopted in social enterprises in other industries or in other types of social enterprises. Moreover, quantitative studies using large samples of social enterprises across industries might be useful in deepening our understanding of a topic that is significant from the perspective of both social enterprises and HRM. Practical implications This paper provides practical implications for HR professionals, founders and top managers of social enterprises not only in Thailand but also in other countries that face the problem of a skill shortage in the labor market. Social implications This paper provides policy implications for the government of Thailand and the governments of several other emerging market economies in which the skill shortage is particularly severe. These governments should focus on solving this problem to alleviate severe competition among several types of organizations in the labor market. Furthermore, these governments should foster the implementation of a partnership model for employee-management relationships within the workplace. In this model, employees and management perceive each other as partners rather than enemies to sustain win-win solutions to any problems or disputes that may occur. Originality/value This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature regarding how social enterprises manage HR across contexts, especially in developing countries where institutional and cultural contexts might differ from those of developed countries. Batt and Banerjee (2012) suggested that the literature on HRM, including strategic human resource management (SHRM), should extend beyond the organizational context and examine how institutional contexts influence the adoption of organizations' HR practices. Additionally, Batt and Banerjee (2012) noted that the majority of studies in the HRM literature focus on profit-oriented firms in the private sector and ignore other types of organizations such as non-profits or social enterprises.","[Napathorn, Chaturong] Thammasat Univ, Thammasat Business Sch, Bangkok, Thailand",Thammasat University,"Napathorn, C (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Thammasat Business Sch, Bangkok, Thailand.",cn48@cornell.edu,,"Napathorn, Chaturong/0000-0001-6433-645X","Thammasat Business School at Thammasat University, Bangkok, Thailand","Thammasat Business School at Thammasat University, Bangkok, Thailand","This paper was financially supported by Thammasat Business School at Thammasat University, Bangkok, Thailand.",,103,11,13,2,50,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Originality/value The main contribution of this research lies in the clustering approach to segmenting retailers in terms of their own brands' positioning strategies and identifying clusters of retailers in the Polish market due to the retailer brands' positioning.","[Witek-Hajduk, Marzanna Katarzyna; Grudecka, Anna] Warsaw Sch Econ SGH Warszawie, Coll World Econ, Warsaw, Poland",,"Witek-Hajduk, MK (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ SGH Warszawie, Coll World Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",marzanna.witek-hajduk@sgh.waw.pl,"Grudecka, Anna/J-5514-2017; Witek-Hajduk, Marzanna Katarzyna/AAE-5978-2019; Witek-Hajduk, Marzanna/AAA-4099-2021","Grudecka, Anna/0000-0003-4349-3813; Witek-Hajduk, Marzanna/0000-0003-3670-3587",,,,,105,3,6,3,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Conservative households often prefer women to stay home, which correlates to female employment and decision-making autonomy, affecting female physical mobility and female nutrition. Finding a suitable indicator for conservative outlook is difficult as we typically lack household-level 'value survey'. In the fast modernizing context of rural Bangladesh, wearing burqa (veil) is often perceived as an indicator of socially conservative outlook. Using this insight, we process the data from the second wave of the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS) for 2015 to test the statistically robust association between household-level conservative outlook and gender-sensitive wellbeing indicators such as female employment, body mass index, and decision-making autonomy for the population of ever-married females aged 15-49 years old. After controlling for individual, household, and regional characteristics, and using sub-regional fixed effects, our findings suggest that living in conservative households is associated with lower probability of female employment. Females from conservative households are less likely to be in wage work or salaried jobs. The probability of being overweight is also higher for the females in conservative households as compared to non-conservative households. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Under a framework of institutional change proposed by the neoinstitutional economy, we assume however that the legalization of cannabis appears to be inevitable in France. Mainly, the organizational arrangements that have emerged in recent years and competing with the illicit market by reducing the risk and uncertainty of transactions can only disqualify the effectiveness of police repression in addition to increase violence on the illegal market. Coupled with the political agenda of harm reduction actions of drug use as well as the qualification of cannabis as a medicine, the perception of the actors evolves gradually and inevitably in favour of a legalization of this psychoactive substance. All the more so that leading moral entrepreneurs are now advocating for this reform.","[Ben Lakhdar, Christian] Univ Lille, CNRS, UMR 9221, LEM,Fac Sci Jurid Polit & Sociales, 1 Pl Deliot, F-59000 Lille, France",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Ben Lakhdar, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, CNRS, UMR 9221, LEM,Fac Sci Jurid Polit & Sociales, 1 Pl Deliot, F-59000 Lille, France.",christian.benlakhdar@univ-lille2.fr,,,,,,,53,0,0,2,9,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

However, its market value is largely unacknowledged. Objectives: This paper focuses on the US population aged 65 and over to explore the hidden economics of IHH and its association with use and expenditure for other healthcare services. Methods: Analyses are carried out on the 2000-2012 waves of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Use of healthcare services and associated expenditure is calculated using logistic regressions and generalized linear models. The substitution cost of IHH is calculated by applying the proxy good method and using regression-predicted expenditures. Results: Every year, about 680,000 individuals aged 65 and over are recipients of IHH. The expenditure to substitute IHH with formal home healthcare would be 17,367 USD per patient. Absence of IHH would be associated to an increased use of office-based visits (+1.70%) and outpatient visits (+13.03%). Each office-based visit would entail an additional expenditure of 12.70 USD. Discussion: The pivotal role that IHH plays in the US healthcare system is largely based on the assumption that IHH comes at no cost. Conversely, our analyses suggest that its substitution costs may be considerable. It is crucial for policy-makers to support the provision of informal care as an affordable alternative to formal care. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Wind generation displaces CO2 emissions, as expected, in line with the average system emissions. Over the whole period, wind generation avoided about 8.8 million tons of CO2, equivalent to about 12% of total system emissions. To understand what drives the level of abatement we evaluate the results by technology and determine that wind generation has similar effects on total emissions from CCGT and coal plants, due to the higher carbon content of coal. Each MWh of wind, however, replaces more generation from CCGTs than from coal plants, in proportion to their generation. We also test the hypothesis that as wind displaces baseload plants it pushes them to generate less efficiently, but find no evidence of a strong negative effect of wind on CCGT or coal plant efficiency. Finally wind displaces about 2.5% fewer emissions when the pumped storage plant is on outage, suggesting that wind is more effective when paired with a flexible system.","[Di Cosmo, Valeria; Valeri, Laura Malaguzzi] Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Di Cosmo, Valeria] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Valeri, LM (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland.",lauramava@gmail.com,,"Malaguzzi Valeri, Laura/0000-0001-6794-4346",ESRI Energy Policy Research Centre; Science Foundation Ireland [SFI/09/SRC/E1780],ESRI Energy Policy Research Centre; Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland),"Funding from the ESRI Energy Policy Research Centre is gratefully acknowledged.

A crucial shortcoming of this measure is the data requirements, particularly for data on imports classified by tariff schemes, which are not available in most countries. This study proposes another measure for preference utilization, termed the tariff exemption ratio. This measure is a good proxy for the value of offered preferences by each importing country to the rest of the world. Importantly, it can be computed by employing only publicly available data, such as those provided by the World Development Indicators, for its computations. We can thus calculate this measure for many countries for an international comparison.

This paper investigates the role crime policy plays in shaping the trajectory of neighborhoods. Much of the existing research on neighborhood crime was conducted in rising-crime environments, and the evidence was clear: high levels of crime have adverse effects on neighborhoods and resident quality of life, This study examines how private investment in neighborhoods in two cities Chicago and Los Angeles changed as the incidence of neighborhood crime changed during the 2000s, a period when crime was declining city-wide in both places. Using detailed blockface-level data on the location of crime and private investments between 2006 and 2011, the analysis answers the question: Do changes in crime affect private development decisions? The results show that private investment, as represented by building permits, decreases on blocks where crime increases in the past year. We also find that the relationship between crime and private investment is not symmetric private investment appears to only be sensitive to crime in rising crime contexts. The result is present in both cities, and robust to multiple definitions of crime and the elimination of outliers and the main commercial district.

In this paper, we revisit the aid-migration link using a substantially extended and adjusted econometric approach based on a gravity model of international migration. In contrast to the previous literature, we obtain evidence of a negative relationship between the total aid a country receives and emigration rates. This even holds for the poorer part of recipient countries, which suggests that the budgetary constraint channel does not play a significant role in shaping migration decisions. The most plausible explanation for these contrasting results is that, unlike in previous studies, we use migrant flows rather than migrant stocks as the dependent variable. In substantive terms, the limited importance of the budgetary constraint channel might reflect that positive welfare effects of foreign aid tend to manifest themselves in improved public services for the poor rather than higher incomes, which is in line with the reorientation of foreign aid towards social sectors under the Millennium Development Goals.

Child care tax credits are intended to relieve the financial burden of child care for working families, yet the benefit incidence may fall on child care providers if they increase prices in response to credit generosity. Using policy-induced variation in the Child and Dependent Care Credit, this paper presents evidence of substantial pass-through: over half of every dollar is passed through to providers in the form of higher prices and wages. Increased non-refundable credit generosity may have the unintended effect of making child care less affordable for low-income families, a result with distributional and spatial implications due to income sorting of families within an urban area.","[Rodgers, Luke P.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Rodgers, LP (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",lprodgers@fsu.edu,,"Rodgers, Luke/0000-0002-2471-2294",,,,,46,5,6,0,11,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

According to the UK Department for Transport, around a quarter of domestic carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to transport. Therefore, the UK Government has mandated reductions of 67% by 2050 over 2010 levels. This paper investigates car users' attitudes to and awareness of climate change to gain further understanding of how those attitudes relate to their travel behaviour. A comprehensive analysis of the British Social Attitude Survey (BSA) datasets of 2011 and 2014 was achieved by using a multi-faceted analytical approach which included Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), Hierarchical Cluster analysis (HCA) and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR). The dimension reduction process by means of the EFA has resulted in three main factors: traffic awareness, perceptions and actions, and environmentally sensitive. The HCA and MCA resulted in seven clusters that were based on car users socio-demographic and travel behaviour variables. The outcomes from the EFA, MCA and HCA were analysed further using MLR methods to investigate respondents' perceptions in greater depth and to relate them to their travel behaviour. These were used as main variables in the MLR analysis. Although 81% of respondents agreed that human actions are partly responsible for climate change impact as per the initial descriptive analysis, the MLR analysis revealed that the group described as 'middle-aged males and females in full time employment' and 'older-aged males in retirement' in 2014 exhibited an increased likelihood of holding a positive attitude towards perceptions and actions regarding climate change than the similarly described cohort in 2011. Intervention mechanisms to encourage mode shift to sustainable modes would be more likely to achieve success if tailored to this group.","[Ali, Fazilatulaili; Dissanayake, Dilum; Bell, Margaret] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Farrow, Malcolm] Newcastle Univ, Sch Math Stat & Phys, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK; Newcastle University - UK,"Dissanayake, D (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",F.B.Ali1@ncl.ac.uk; dilum.dissanayake@ncl.ac.uk; margaret.bell@ncl.ac.uk; Malcolm.farrow@ncl.ac.uk,,"Farrow, Malcolm/0000-0002-3078-7401; Dissanayake, Dilum/0000-0001-6166-5709",Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (KPT); National Defence University Malaysia (NDUM),"Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (KPT)(Ministry of Education, Malaysia); National Defence University Malaysia (NDUM)",This research was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (KPT) and National Defence University Malaysia (NDUM).,,52,26,27,0,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

A fall in trust, due to shocks or policy actions, increases the price that agents attach to future contingencies, amplifies fluctuations, and steepens the sacrifice ratio.

To assess the neighborhoods of urban areas it is essential to evaluate the behavioral attitudes of commuters. Existing studies have shown that behavioral attitudes influence residential selection and mode choice, which might result in a dissonance between individuals' preference and actuality in residence. Residential dissonance has become a critical issue that affects commuter mode choice in urban areas. Majority of studies on residential dissonance were conducted in developed countries. This research is still at the infancy stage in developing countries like India. The objective of this study is to fill this gap by evaluating the effect of residential dissonance on commuter mode choice behavior in National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. For this, 2633 individual responses from Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and non-TOD neighborhoods of NCT Delhi were considered. The actual neighborhood types were derived by using Two-step cluster analysis and the preferred neighborhood types were derived by using a binary logit model. The dissonance analysis shows that 23.25% of TOD residents were dissonant in NCT Delhi. The study findings suggest that an attitudinal change of 0.5 units might change an average of 26% of consonance/dissonance levels in TOD neighborhoods. Multinomial Logit (MNL) models were employed to understand the mode choice and dissonance connections. The MNL model results show that the presence of women commuters and their safety will enhance the choice of active transport in TODs and public transport in non-TODs in NCT Delhi.

In this paper, I analyze the impact of the U.S. monetary policy regime switches on the Eurozone. I construct a New Keynesian two-country model where foreign (U.S.) monetary policy switches regimes over time. I estimate the model for the U.S. and the Euro Area using quarterly data and find that the United States has switched between those two regimes, in line with existing evidence. I show that foreign regime switches affect home (Eurozone) inflation and output volatility and their responses to shocks, substantially, as long as the home central bank commits to a time-invariant interest rate rule reacting to domestic conditions only. Optimal policy in the home country instead requires that the home central bank reacts strongly to domestic producer-price inflation and to international variables, such as imported goods relative prices. In fact, I show that currency misalignments and relative prices play a crucial role in the transmission of foreign monetary policy regime switches internationally. Interestingly, I show that only marginal gains arise for the Euro Area when the European Central Bank (ECB) adjusts its policy according to the monetary regime in the United States. Thus, a simple time-invariant monetary policy rule with a strong reaction to Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation and relative prices is enough to counteract the effects of monetary policy switches in the United States.","[Mavromatis, Kostas] De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Mavromatis, Kostas] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; University of Amsterdam,"Mavromatis, K (通讯作者)，De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Mavromatis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.mavromatis@dnb.nl,,,,,,,53,2,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In designing the contingent scenarios for evacuation, we randomly assign varying levels of hurricane characteristics (wind speed, lead time for landfall and the height of storm surge) combined with different types of emergency management options (voluntary versus mandatory evacuation order and a voucher with varying amounts to cover evacuation expenses). Findings indicate that individual households respond, in a non-linear fashion, to the intensity of hurricanes when making evacuation decisions. Respondents are also more likely to evacuate when the storm surge reaches a certain threshold. In terms of policy interventions, mandatory evacuation orders are more effective to increase the likelihood of evacuation. The potential intervention in the form of providing evacuation vouchers to assist households to cover their expenses (e.g. for food, water, transportation and lodging) also seems effective.

At the same time, manual agriculture has been marginalized by massive cheap rice imports and remained very low in capital intensity. In this context, we show how low labour productivity curtails opportunities for long-term social and economic differentiation.

This dual economy perspective overlooks the heterogeneity within and synergies between these two broad sectors. Recent studies decompose agriculture into subsectors and find that agricultural growth led by smallholder farmers is even more effective at reducing poverty than larger-scale estate farms. In contrast, few studies estimate subsectoral growth-poverty linkages for non-agriculture. Yet we strongly expect, for example, that growth led by informal traders or foreign-owned mining companies will have quite different implications for poverty reduction. Different perspectives on what constitutes non-agriculture might therefore explain divergent views on its relative importance for poverty reduction. To address this gap in our understanding, we estimate sectoral poverty-growth elasticities using economy-wide models for five African countries. While our estimated elasticities are higher for agriculture than for non-agriculture as a whole, the extent to which this is true varies considerably across nonagricultural subsectors (and across countries). We find that the poverty-growth elasticities for trade and transport services and manufacturing, especially agro-processing, are often close to, and sometimes exceed, agriculture's. This means that growth led by these nonagricultural subsectors might be as effective as agriculture at reaching the poor. This confirms the need for a more nuanced treatment of non-agriculture in Africa's policy debate, and may explain conflicting perspectives on agriculture's role vis-a-vis non-agriculture.

The decision to buy was also influenced by the brand type (national brand or private label). Data from 21 participants were recorded during exposure to 20 fast-moving consumer goods. The electroencephalographic signal from the frontal lobe (13 and F4) served to calculate the frontal asymmetry index for alpha, beta, and gamma bands. Electromyographic electrodes were placed on the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscles, whereas the galvanic skin responses were gathered from the forefinger and ring finger of the nondominant hand. Eye tracking glasses were used to control for eye movements. After product exposure. participants filled in the Purchase Intentions Scale, which then served to assess the final binary decision.

Currently, Indonesian rice farmers have little financial protection from climate risk via catastrophic weather risk transfer tools. Done well, a weather index insurance (WII) program can not only provide resources that enable recovery, but can also facilitate the adoption of prevention and adaptation measures and incentivize risk reduction. However, implementations of WII programs have faced difficulties because of basis risk-among several other obstacles. Here, we quantify the applicability, viability, and likely cost of introducing a WII for droughts for rice production in Indonesia. To reduce basis risk, we construct district-specific indices that are based on the estimation of Panel Geographically Weighted Regressions models. With these spatial models, and detailed district level data on past agricultural productivity and weather conditions, we identify an algorithm that can generate an effective and actuarially sound WII in some districts but not in others. We then measure its effectiveness in reducing income volatility for farmers by reducing this basis risk, at the district level. We end by calculating an actuarially robust and welfare-enhancing price for this scheme and prioritize the districts in which it can be implemented.","[Kusuma, Aditya; Noy, Ilan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand; [Jackson, Bethanna] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington,"Noy, I (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",ilan.noy@vuw.ac.nz,,"Kusuma, Aditya/0000-0002-5313-1552; Noy, Ilan/0000-0003-3214-6568",,,,,67,5,5,0,18,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

We find that the distribution of per capita arrival has tightened over time, i.e., there was sigma-convergence in tourism. Countries at the lower tail of the per capita international tourist arrival distribution have improved their relative position. Tests of absolute (conditional) beta-convergence indicate that the average country's tourism catches up (approaches its steady-state) at a speed of 1.25% (10.56%) a year, supporting the tourism destinations convergence hypothesis. These findings are helpful for tourism enterprises when making multinational location decisions.

With this growth, there has been an increase in the number of liquidations. We find that the decision to liquidate an ETF is primarily based on ETF characteristics; however, we observe additional considerations related to fund family and investment objective characteristics. Failures are more likely to occur when an ETF is small and when it is launched by a struggling family or into a struggling investment objective. We find fund, family, and market characteristics at the time of creation greatly impact an ETF's likelihood of survival. Furthermore, we observe few, but significant, differences between the decision to close an ETF and the decision to close an actively managed mutual fund. Whereas ETFs show relatively greater dependence on the well-being of their investment objective, mutual funds show a greater dependence on their fund specific performance.","[Sherrill, D.

To date, the impact of institutions on (productive) entrepreneurship and the effects of entrepreneurship on economic growth have largely been investigated in isolation. In this paper, we bring together institutions, entrepreneurship, and economic growth using a parsimonious growth model in a 3SLS specification. In our first stage, we regress multiple measures of entrepreneurial activity on institutional proxies that are known to correlate with more productive forms of entrepreneurial activity. Using the fitted values of this first-stage regression as our proxy for productive entrepreneurship, we can then estimate a panel growth regression following Islam (1995) in a second stage. The third stage then optimizes the estimation of the two equations simultaneously. Our results show that productive entrepreneurship contributes to economic growth. In our set of proxies for institutional quality, financial stability, small government, and perceived start-up skills are the most important predictors of such productive entrepreneurship.","[Bosma, Niels; Content, Jeroen; Sanders, Mark; Stam, Erik] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Bosma, N (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands.",n.s.bosma@uu.nl; j.content@uu.nl; m.w.j.l.sanders@uu.nl; e.stam@uu.nl,"Stam, Erik/E-6605-2017; Content, Jeroen/ABD-5006-2020; Bosma, Niels/B-8187-2008","Bosma, Niels/0000-0003-1977-7680; Content, Jeroen/0000-0002-3952-0252; Stam, Erik/0000-0001-9827-0516",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [649378]; FIRES-project; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649378] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; FIRES-project; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 649378, the FIRES-project (http://www.projectfires.eu/).

While this new index addresses the main limitations of the existing indicators, it also appears particularly suited to assess the monetary experiences of a large sample of inflation-targeting emerging countries. Second, by means of EGARCH estimations, we formally prove the existence of a negative effect of credibility on the volatility of the short-term interest rate. In line with the expectations channel of monetary policy, the higher the credibility of the central bank, the lower the need to move its instruments to effectively fulfill its objective.","[Levieuge, Gregory] Banque France, DGEI DEMFI RECFIN 041 1391, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris 01, France; [Levieuge, Gregory; Lucotte, Yannick; Ringuede, Sebastien] Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, UMR 7322, F-45067 Orleans, France; [Lucotte, Yannick] PSB Paris Sch Business, Dept Econ, F-75013 Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Universite de Orleans; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Lucotte, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, UMR 7322, F-45067 Orleans, France.;Lucotte, Y (通讯作者)，PSB Paris Sch Business, Dept Econ, F-75013 Paris, France.",ylucotte@gmail.com,"Lucotte, Yannick/V-5518-2019","Lucotte, Yannick/0000-0001-8721-5845; Levieuge, Gregory/0000-0003-2152-0737",National Bank of Poland,National Bank of Poland,"We are grateful to Claudiu Albulescu, Jarko Fidrmuc, Benjamin Keddad, Aurelien Leroy, Tomasz Lysiak, Marjan Petreski, Jean-Paul Pollin, and Ewa Stanislawska for their useful comments and suggestions.

We find no significant effect of caregiving on family caregivers' planned retirement age if we do not take into account caregiving intensity but find a negative and significant effect on retirement plans for intensive caregivers, particularly among women. These findings suggest that relying on family members to provide elderly care can pose a serious challenge to the ongoing efforts of the government to promote the labor supply of women and the elderly as a way of addressing the shrinkage of the working-age population in Japan. The estimation results suggest that ensuring access to formal care services can help family members reconcile their paid work with caregiving requirements, thereby alleviating the adverse effect of caregiving on their retirement plans. The results also suggest that the financial burden of formal care services could require caregivers to postpone retirement in some cases.","[Niimi, Yoko] Asian Growth Res Inst, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan",,"Niimi, Y (通讯作者)，Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Ohtemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan.",niimi@agi.or.jp,,,"JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI [15H01950]; Asian Growth Research Institute; MEXT Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01950] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Asian Growth Research Institute; MEXT Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI Grant Number 15H01950, a project grant from the Asian Growth Research Institute, and a grant from the MEXT Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University.",,43,7,7,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In Congress, for example, within-party geographic cleavages have declined, roll-call voting has become more one-dimensional, and Democrats and Republicans have diverged along this main dimension of national partisan conflict. The existing literature finds that citizens have only weakly and belatedly mimicked elite trends. We show, however, that a different picture emerges if we focus not on individual citizens, but on the aggregate characteristics of geographic constituencies. Using biennial estimates of the economic, racial, and social policy liberalism of the average Democrat and Republican in each state over the past six decades, we demonstrate a surprisingly close correspondence between mass and elite trends. Specifically, we find that: (1) ideological divergence between Democrats and Republicans has widened dramatically within each domain, just as it has in Congress; (2) ideological variation across senators' partisan subconstituencies is now explained almost completely by party rather than state, closely tracking trends in the Senate; and (3) economic, racial, and social liberalism have become highly correlated across partisan subconstituencies, just as they have across members of Congress. Overall, our findings contradict the reigning consensus that polarization in Congress has proceeded much more rapidly and extensively than polarization in the mass public.","[Caughey, Devin; Dunham, James] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Warshaw, Christopher] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); George Washington University,"Warshaw, C (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",caughey@mit.edu; jdunham@mit.edu; warshaw@gwu.edu,"Warshaw, Christopher/AAM-4838-2021","Warshaw, Christopher/0000-0002-2769-4028; /0000-0001-8624-285X; Caughey, Devin/0000-0001-6419-6805",,,,,66,16,18,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176.0,1-2,,,SI,,133,151,,10.1007/s11127-018-0543-3,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438459400008,0

We also find that two events prior to the enactment that increase the likelihood of enacting the law have a similar effect.

To our knowledge, this is the first econometric study of the activities of agents in a country as underdeveloped as the DRC. More important than agents' personal characteristics, transactions are higher in low income, densely populated areas with high levels of commercial development, suggesting that the agent network has been best at supporting financial transactions among the urban poor. In addition, branding and effective liquidity management are strongly linked to agent activity. The results suggest that agents can be effective providers of basic financial services among the urban poor who lack suitable alternatives.

A novel feature of our NATO estimates is the spatial autoregressive (SAR) weighting of alliance spillovers of defense spending based on ally contiguity (augmented by US defense spending) and inverse distance between allies. The spatial models provide defense demand estimates that are amazingly consistent with those of the standard spillover model.

This type of data is regularly encountered in public opinion and expert surveys, legislative and judicial bodies where abstention is relevant, and measures of policy that are coded along ordinal scales. OC is nonparametric and requires only minimal assumptions about voters' utility functions and the error term. As such, Ordered Optimal Classification (OOC) provides a flexible modeling strategy to estimate latent ideological spaces from ordinal choice data. OOC is also easily estimated in multidimensional space without identifying restrictions. After describing the OOC procedure, we perform a series of Monte Carlo experiments and apply the method to analyze survey data from the 2015 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. We then conclude with a discussion of how scholars can utilize OOC in future work involving multidimensional spatial models of choice.","[Hare, Christopher; Liu, Tzu-Ping] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lupton, Robert N.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Polit Sci, Storrs, CT USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Connecticut,"Hare, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",cdhare@ucdavis.edu; tpliu@ucdavis.edu; robert.lupton@uconn.edu,"Liu, Tzu-Ping/AAU-9510-2020; Liu, Tzu-Ping/JGD-8032-2023; Hare, Christopher/AEY-9468-2022; Lupton, Robert N./AAX-6279-2021","Liu, Tzu-Ping/0000-0003-0474-9708; Hare, Christopher/0000-0003-4210-7845; Lupton, Robert N./0000-0002-2967-5015",University of Georgia; Albert B.

While they offer the promise of improved access to goods and reduced travel for consumers and delivery vehicles, the integration of these systems in cities, and their impact on access, generally and by mode are understudied. This paper explores the development, site characteristics and regional location characteristics of Parcel Lockers in five South East Queensland (SEQ) cities, Australia, and discusses implications for urban and transport planning in a car-oriented city. Micro level site analyses for 45 locker locations provide information on facilities (e.g. access by modes and universal accessibility, ground level, tenure type, safety). Hierarchical cluster analysis helps identify categories of locations. Suburb-level census and land use data as well as distance from transportation infrastructure and other Australia Post facilities were gathered and used to compare regional suburbs with and without Parcel Lockers. Logistic regression identifies the suburb level characteristics associated with the presence of a Parcel Locker (n = 273). Parcel Lockers in Brisbane are generally located at Australia Post locations, on commercial streets, shopping centres, suburban arterials and industrial parks. Automobile access and nearby parking is nearly ubiquitous, whereas alternative transport access is limited. Though site locations are constrained by commercial decisions, proximity to highways, to public transport, population density, a good balance of jobs and population, and higher rates of household Internet access are associated with the presence of a Parcel Locker. Documenting and assessing site characteristics and regional location of Parcel Lockers can help ensure its optimal and adequate integration and distribution across the region to satisfy city and transport planning goals. In its current state, Australia Post's Parcel Lockers partially meet the objectives of a sustainable city.","[Lachapelle, Ugo] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Etud Urbaines & Tourist, 315 St Catherine St E, Montreal, PQ H2X 3X2, Canada; [Burke, Matthew; Brotherton, Aiden; Leung, Abraham] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Griffith University,"Lachapelle, U (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Etud Urbaines & Tourist, 315 St Catherine St E, Montreal, PQ H2X 3X2, Canada.",lachapelle.ugo@uqam.ca; m.burke@griffith.edu.au,"Leung, Abraham/S-9823-2018; Burke, Matthew I/C-3587-2008","Leung, Abraham/0000-0002-3895-8762; Burke, Matthew I/0000-0002-9148-5917; Lachapelle, Ugo/0000-0003-2306-6021",Australian government; Transport Academic Partnership - Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads; Motor Accident and Insurance Commission,Australian government(Australian Government); Transport Academic Partnership - Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads; Motor Accident and Insurance Commission,We thank the Australian government for funding the Endeavour research fellowship that supported Lachapelle's stay at the Cities Research Institute for this project.

First, we assume that the dynamics of the underlying foreign asset price are affected by market liquidity and propose a liquidity-adjusted quanto model. This allows for the effects of market liquidity on European quanto option pricing. And then we denve the analytical pricing formulas for four different types of European quanto options. Finally, we empirically investigate the pricing performance of our proposed model with a European quanto construction involving the SSE 50 ETF, as the underlying asset, and the CNY/ HKD exchange rate. Empirical results demonstrate that the pricing accuracy of the proposed model is markedly superior to that of the Black-Scholes quanto model. In other words, allowing for liquidity risk in the framework of European quanto option pricing can make markedly improvements in fitting the real market data. Particularly, the improvement rate is high for medium-term and out-of-the-money options. Moreover, these results are robust for different liquidity measures.","[Li, Zhe; Zhang, Wei-Guo; Liu, Yong-Jun] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,"Zhang, WG; Liu, YJ (通讯作者)，South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",bmzheli@mail.scut.edu.cn; wgzhang@scut.edu.cn; bmyjliu@scut.edu.cn,"Li, Zhe/AAN-2371-2020","Li, Zhe/0000-0003-4947-2466; Liu, Yong-Jun/0000-0002-1728-480X; Li, Zhe/0000-0002-0809-6217; Li, Zhe/0000-0002-3266-3381","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71720107002, 71501076]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2017A030312001]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017ZD102]; Guangzhou Financial Service Innovation and Risk Management Research Base",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Guangzhou Financial Service Innovation and Risk Management Research Base,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71720107002 and 71501076); the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2017A030312001); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2017ZD102); and Guangzhou Financial Service Innovation and Risk Management Research Base.,,35,16,16,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

However, attempts to substitute or control nature through efficient bio-based technology have not lived up to expectations and much of the industry still relies on globally sourced biomass to drive the bioeconomy. This article examines the social and political economic relations surrounding small-scale production of the feedstock castor oil plant (castor, Ricinus communis) in the deep south of Madagascar. Theorizing the bioeconomy through the lens of a small-scale commodity frontier, it builds from recent injunctions by Jason Moore to show how the appropriation of cheap nature (including paid and unpaid labour) is both historically and geographically co-produced. The castor value chain is held up as a way to transform regional economies and a silver bullet to alleviate poverty and address food security in some of the most economically marginal areas of Madagascar. We adopt a regional and feminist political ecology approach to illustrate what is behind this discursive cloak of development imaginaries, making visible the social relations surrounding castor production and demonstrating the historical marginalization involved in producing the frontier.","[Neimark, Benjamin D.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Healy, Timothy M.] Aquaterre, BP 1541, Antananarivo, Madagascar",Lancaster University,"Neimark, BD (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",b.neimark@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Neimark, Benjamin/0000-0003-3229-0869",National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration [9222-12],National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration(National Geographic Society),The National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration funded the work on biofuels in Madagascar (The Human dimensions of Environmental Change and Biofuel Production).

The results reveal that the semi-log model and the Levenberg-Marquardt trained artificial neural networks (LMANNs) performed best in their respective categories. The best performing models were tested in terms of prediction accuracy within the 10% and 20% of the assessed values, performance, and reliability ranking, and explicit explainability ranking order. The LMANNs outperform the semi-log model in the first two tests, but fail the explainability ranking order test. The results demonstrate the semi-log model as the most preferred technique due to its simplicity, consistency, transparency, locational advantage, and ease of application within the mass appraisal environment. The black box nature of the ANNs inhibits the production of sufficiently transparent estimates that appraisers could use to explain the process in legal proceedings.","[Yacim, Joseph Awoamim; Boshoff, Douw Gert Brand] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Yacim, Joseph Awoamim] Fed Polytech, Nasarawa 962, Nasarawa, Nigeria",University of Pretoria,"Yacim, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.;Yacim, JA (通讯作者)，Fed Polytech, Nasarawa 962, Nasarawa, Nigeria.",Joseph.yacim@up.ac.za; drdgbboshoff@gmail.com,"Yacim, Joseph/AFN-6636-2022",,National Research Foundation (NRF); IRE/BS Foundation for African Real Estate Research,National Research Foundation (NRF); IRE/BS Foundation for African Real Estate Research,The opinions expressed in this study are those of the authors.

This paper evaluates the effect of the PFD to mitigate poverty among the state's rural Indigenous (Alaska Native) peoples: a population with historically high poverty rates living in a region with limited economic opportunities. Errors in recording PFD income in data used to calculate official poverty statistics cause them to misrepresent poverty in Alaska and understate the effect of the PFD. Estimating poverty rates with and without PFD income therefore requires reconstruction of family incomes from household-level data. Estimated poverty rates from reconstructed income show that the PFD has had a substantial, although diminishing mitigating effect on poverty for rural Indigenous families. The PFD has had a larger effect on poverty among children and elders than for the rural Alaska Native population as a whole. Alaska Native seniors, who receive additional sources of UBI derived primarily from resource rents besides the PFD, have seen a decline in poverty rates, while poverty rates for children have increased. Evidence has not appeared for commonly hypothesized potential adverse social and economic consequences of UBI. (C) 2018 The Author.

More precisely, for small firms, intraregional mobility of knowledge workers who have previously worked in a patenting firm (the learning-by-hiring effect) is shown to be statistically and economically highly significant, whereas only limited impact could be detected for firms losing knowledge workers (the learning-by-diaspora effect).","[Braunerhjelm, Pontus; Ding, Ding; Thulin, Per] KTH Royal Inst Technol, INDEK, Div Entrepreneurship & Innovat, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Braunerhjelm, Pontus; Thulin, Per] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Grevgatan 34, S-11453 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Braunerhjelm, P (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, INDEK, Div Entrepreneurship & Innovat, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",pontus.braunerhjelm@indek.kth.se,,"Thulin, Per/0000-0001-8377-1633",Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation,Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation,Financial support is gratefully acknowledged from Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation.,,69,46,58,5,118,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This parsimonious order-n representation of the most significant comovement in asset prices, filtered by common factors, allows tackling a large number of assets and unraveling their complex comovement structure. Flexibility in choosing explanatory factors to suit the specific objectives of a study makes this methodology useful for portfolio analysis, risk parity approaches, and risk management decisions. We illustrate the features of the methodology for a set of major industry equity indices and to blue chip stocks, where we analyze the dynamic relevance of Fama-French factors. Investigating the network for more than 20 years, including the dot-corn bust, global financial crisis, and European debt crisis, helps draw many insights. For instance, unexpected industries are seen to connect idiosyncratically through the dot-corn bust. We demonstrate that a network factor model based portfolio allocation performs better than a regular factor model based allocation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Pivotal in setting Rwanda on the path to universal health coverage (UHC) is the community-based health insurance (CBHI), which covers more than three-quarters of the population. The paper seeks to explain how Rwanda, one of the poorest countries in the world, managed to achieve such performance by understanding the political drivers behind the CBHI design and implementation. Using an analytical framework relying on political settlement and ideas, it engages in process-tracing of the critical policy choices of the CBHI development. The study finds that the commitment to expanding health insurance coverage was made possible by a dominant political settlement. CBHI is part of the broader efforts of the regime to foster its legitimacy based on rapid socio-economic development. Yet, CBHI was chosen over other potential solutions to expand access to healthcare because it was also the option the most compatible with the ruling coalition core ideology. The study shows that pursuing UHC is an eminently political process but explanations solely based on objective interests of rulers cannot fully account for the emergence and shape of social protection programme. Ideology matters as well. Programme design compatible with the political economy of a country but incompatible with ideas of the ruling coalition is likely to run into political obstructions. The study also questions the relevance for poor countries to reach UHC relying on pure CBHI models based on voluntary enrolment and community management. (C) 2018 The Author.

Using a model determined fair value, an automated trading strategy based on a newly determined risk ratio buys undervalued and sells overvalued CMBS. These strategies result in substantial trading profits between November 2007 and June 2015. Controlling for CMBS sector risk factors, we reject CMBS market efficiency over the entire sample period. When we split the sample into the Crisis and Recovery periods, we observe persistent abnormal returns over both subperiods, which is consistent with an inefficient CMBS market. Because the CMBS market appears to be inefficient, our results suggest that the approach presented in this paper may facilitate the increased financial stability of the CRE sector through the better pricing and risk management of CMBS.

The private pension system that was designed to complement public pension system demonstrated limited impact on savings rates. Thus, former tax incentives are replaced by matching contributions as of 2013. Our paper aims to assess the effectiveness of the recent incentives introduced to the private pension system in Turkey. We find that the state contribution has positive significant effect on the number of participants by using alternative asset returns and a dummy variable for state contribution in two samples covering different time periods. We analyze the dynamic time varying interaction between the state contribution and the number of participants in our second sample that focus on post reform period. The model estimated with the dynamic Kalman filter indicates that the positive effect of the state contribution on the number of participants tends to decline slightly in time. We conclude that the fund management in the private pension system should be improved in order to make use of the state incentive efficiently. Copyright (C) 2017, Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi.

Two errors were corrected: the specification of income splines, and the subtraction of capital gains income from the dependent variable.

We study the effect on evasion and government revenue of two policy instruments: a tax on cash withdrawals (TCW), which imposes a cost on the buyers who pay cash, and a tax rebate conditional on having the receipt. The tax rebate reduces evasion but it is costly if tax evasion is low. The TCW reduces evasion only if it is set at a sufficiently high rate, which must be higher the larger is the mass of cash users. We also show that the implementation of a TCW, which poses several challenges, is easier if the cost of cash hoarding is high.","[Immordino, Giovanni; Russo, Francesco Flaviano] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Immordino, G (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.",giovanni.immordino@unina.it; francescoflaviano.russo@unina.it,,"IMMORDINO, Giovanni/0000-0002-8352-973X",,,,,50,7,8,3,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

In this paper, we examine the predictive power of prospect theory in the U.S. corporate bond market. The empirical evidence shows that prospect theory has significant predictive power for corporate bond returns, especially for junk bond returns. Unlike the findings for the stock market, the loss aversion component plays the most important role in predicting corporate bond returns. The probability weighting component also plays a predictive role for junk bonds, but not for investment-grade bonds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We also evaluate how ownership structure affects the impact of bank diversification on cost efficiency. Using a stochastic frontier approach to estimate bank cost efficiency, we find evidence that increased diversification tends to improve bank efficiency but the benefits of diversification are offset by the increased exposure to volatile non interest activities. With respect to the impact of ownership, we find that state-owned banks with fewer volatile income sources are likely to be less efficient in terms of income diversification. Our results also reveal that more diversified foreign-owned banks tend to be less efficient in developed countries, while the increased foreign ownership of banks appears to improve the diversification benefits in developing countries after the financial crisis. Our findings highlight the implications of bank income diversification and ownership for efficiency and are relevant to bank regulators who are considering additional regulations on bank management.","[Anh-Tuan Doan] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Finance & Banking, Tan Phong Ward, 19 Nguyen Huu Tho St,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Lin, Kun-Li] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, 100 Wenhwa Rd, Taichung 407, Taiwan; [Doong, Shuh-Chyi] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, 145 Xinda Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan",Ton Duc Thang University; Feng Chia University; National Chung Hsing University,"Doong, SC (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, 145 Xinda Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan.",doananhtuan@tdt.edu.vn; kllin@fcu.edu.tw; scdoong@dragon.nchu.edu.tw,"Doan, Anh-Tuan/AAV-8466-2021; Doong, Shuh-Chyi/L-7156-2019; Doan, Anh-Tuan/Y-2829-2019","Doan, Anh-Tuan/0000-0003-2580-3507; Doong, Shuh-Chyi/0000-0002-1765-265X",,,,,69,65,67,0,45,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

We use a theoretical structure similar to locational sorting models, which characterize equilibria in terms of marginal individuals who are indifferent between locations. In our case, the 'locations' are binary, consisting of whether or not to take a discrete preventative action. Individual heterogeneity arises in this structure due to variation in the costs and disutility associated with prevention. We demonstrate application of this approach in the context of participation in insecticide-based indoor residual spraying programs for malaria control in northern Uganda. We identify the parameters of our theoretical model using a stated preference choice experiment combined with estimates from published epidemiological studies. The model implies that Pigovian subsidies for participation in this context should decrease household malaria risk by 19-25%. Our approach can be applied to other bioeconomic externalities with spillovers from discrete preventative actions, including agricultural pest management and the control of pest infestations and invasive species.","[Brown, Zachary S.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Brown, Zachary S.] North Carolina State Univ, Genet Engn & Soc Ctr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Kramer, Randall A.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Kramer, Randall A.] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; Duke University; Duke University,"Brown, ZS (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.;Brown, ZS (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Genet Engn & Soc Ctr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",zack_brown@ncsu.edu,,"Kramer, Randall/0000-0002-1325-7425; Brown, Zachary/0000-0003-1301-4420",,,,,52,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

However, the existence of complex tours could be a major barrier to the shift from drive-alone to public transport. This is particularly problematical for the non-worker segment of the population (most of whom are women and/or older adults). To better understand how socio-demographics, trip attributes, and land use pattern shape tour complexity and mode choices for individuals, this paper introduces a cluster-based approach to model tour complexity, trip chaining, and tour mode choice. Based on daily activity patterns and time-use, five non-worker clusters were identified from the Space-Time Activity Research (STAR) data for Halifax, Canada. Number of tours per day for all clusters was modeled using a Poisson regression model. Trip chaining was then modeled using an Ordered Probit model. Finally, tour mode choice was modeled using a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. This framework utilizes home based travel tours, the sequence of trips that begin and end at home, as the basic unit of analysis. Results show that socio-demographic characteristics and tour attributes are strong explanatory factors of travel behavior, consistent with existing literature. Also, urban form characteristics have significant influence on non-workers' travel behaviour and tour complexity. This paper also offers a typology of travel tours to account for different non-work travel purposes. The findings of this study will improve the future evaluation of transportation projects and land-use policymaking.","[Daisy, Naznin Sultana; Liu, Lei] Dalhousie Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil & Resource Engn, 1360 Barrington St, Halifax, NS B3H4R2, Canada; [Millward, Hugh] St Marys Univ, Sch Environm, Dept Civil & Resource Engn, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",Dalhousie University; Saint Marys University - Canada,"Liu, L (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil & Resource Engn, 1360 Barrington St, Halifax, NS B3H4R2, Canada.",naznin.daisy@dal.ca; hugh.millward@smu.ca; lei.liu@dal.ca,"Millward, Hugh/B-1053-2008","Millward, Hugh/0000-0003-0885-4660",Dalhousie University; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency [181930],Dalhousie University; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency,"This research was supported, in part, by grants from Dalhousie University.

We account for the endogeneity of schooling using quantile instrumental variable estimation as developed in Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val, and Kowalski (). We use pooled data from four cross-sectional Household Income Expenditure Surveys. The results show that an extra year of schooling on the part of the most educated adult member in the household can increase welfare (proxied by real per capita consumption expenditure) by 3.8 percent on average. However, the effect varies considerably across the welfare distribution: At the lower end, around the 20th and 25th quantiles, an extra year of education increases welfare by 6 and 5 percent, respectively, while at the median it is around 3.5 percent. At the higher, 90th quantile it is much less, at 1 percent. Thus the marginal effect of schooling on welfare is significant and positive at all levels of the welfare distribution, but highest at the lower and middle quartiles. This result is different from findings in the literature that tend to show larger effects at higher quantiles, when endogeneity is uncorrected.","[Himaz, Rozana] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Headington Rd, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Himaz, Rozana] Univ Oxford, CSAE, Econ Dept Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Aturupana, Harsha] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Oxford Brookes University; University of Oxford; The World Bank,"Himaz, R (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Headington Rd, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.;Himaz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, CSAE, Econ Dept Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",rhimaz@brookes.ac.uk,,"Himaz, Rozana/0000-0003-0895-8144",,,,,35,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

During recent years, however, the coalition strategy of foreign donors seems to have changed in favor of non-governmental allies in development cooperation, instead of state bureaucracies of the target countries. As a key foreign donor, for instance, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has introduced the forest co-management development concept, altering important policy and institutional settings in Bangladesh. The changes resulted from a combination of development inputs and politics, including funding, technical assistance and coalition with multiple, mostly non-state stakeholders. In this article, we use the concepts of development policy change, the global governance theorem of direct access to domestic policymaking process, and bureaucratic politics theory from development policy analysis for analyzing this new coalition strategy. A mixed qualitative-quantitative methods approach and the case of the USAID-induced forest co-management development model were employed to analyze the new coalition strategy based on the main interests of the donor. The results indicate that in the development process, USAID formed coalitions with non-state actors at all levels, thus circumventing national bureaucracies. The donor substantially involved non-state actors to (1) overcome the dominant information of state bureaucracies by eliciting data in the donors' informal interests, (2) gain control over the implementation process at multiple levels, and (3) enhance pressure on all levels of government for substantive policy changes. In contrast, the initial and very marginal coalitions with state agencies imply an initial cost for legitimately accessing a country's governance system. Furthermore, such detouring of state agencies poses the questions of operational authority and, concurrently, of ownership to sustain the changed practices. A broader implication based on the study findings is to especially consider the sovereignty issue in a development context in a recipient country. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We find evidence that executive directors possess significant insider knowledge about their firm's risk prior to the initiation of CDS trading. We also find that the profitability of insider trades are only reduced for non-executive directors after short selling is permitted, indicating that the executive directors possess more timely private information than short-sellers.

Since the development literature has firmly established the role of weather risk as a source of income volatility for the poor, and climate change is expected to increase this risk, we review the range of risk-coping mechanisms available to poorer households, with a focus on possible barriers to adaptation. We ask both how government interventions affect the set of options available for adaptation and risk coping, and also what these adaptive responses imply for the prospects of sustainable development. Support for adaptation can involve efforts to make existing locations, livelihoods and forms of production more resilient to climate risk (in-situ adaptation), or reductions in vulnerability through the geographical and sectoral mobility of the poor (transformational adaptation). Our review shows how successful adaptation will need to strike a balance between the two forms of adaptation, avoiding locking-in unsustainable practices in locations that are already marginal from an economic perspective, and taking account of broader socioeconomic trends already taking place in many developing countries (such as population growth and urbanisation). We also highlight important considerations for policy-makers, which to date have been relatively neglected in the literature, in particular related to the dynamic interaction between adaptation and sustainable development.

The main question is whether the gains from investments in ICT differ between developing, emerging and developed countries. The analysis is based on a high-quality sample of 59 countries for the period 1995-2010. Various panel data regressions confirm the previously reported positive relationship between ICT capital and GDP growth. For the combined sample of all 59 countries, the estimated output elasticity of ICT is larger than the ICT factor compensation share suggesting excess returns to ICT capital. The regressions for the subsamples of developing, emerging and developed countries do not reveal statistically significant differences in the output elasticity of ICT between these three groups of countries. Thus, the results indicate that developing and emerging countries are not gaining more from investments in ICT than developed economies, calling into question the argument that these countries are 'leapfrogging' through ICT.

A number of mechanisms could explain these features. However, we find evidence that lends support to the presence of the risk-taking channel. In particular, we find indications that unexpected changes in US monetary policy affect such dynamics, and that their effects seem to have grown with the size of the international investors' position in emerging market economies' bonds. The main results are robust to different measures of the US monetary policy stance, and to the use of macroeconomic and financial variables as controls. Our broader interest is the potential financial stability risks building up, which could materialize as US monetary policy normalizes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The growing stock of local currency government debt in the financial portfolios of foreign investors increases their diversification and exposure to fast growing economies. In this paper, we highlight some of the risks associated to this recent trend. First, we adopt the CoV aR risk-measure to estimate the vulnerability of individual countries to systemic risk in the market for local currency government debt. Second, we show that our country-level estimates of vulnerability increase with the share of local currency debt held by foreign investors.

We show that in a stress scenario, capital requirements may force the bank to shrink the size of its assets and we exhibit the bank's optimal strategy as a function of regulatory risk-weights, asset market liquidity, and shock size. When financial markets are perfectly competitive, we show that the bank is always able to restore its capital ratio above the required one. However, for banks constrained to sell their loans at a discount and/or with a positive price impact when selling their marketable assets (large banks) we exhibit situations in which the deleveraging process generates a death spiral. We then show how to calibrate our model using annual reports of banks and study in detail the case of the French bank BNP Paribas.

Firstly we construct cross-border ownership networks for banks located in European countries. We then exploit the 2010 European debt crisis as a natural experiment. The analysis shows that subsidiary banks located outside of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (GIIPS) but with ownership linkages to these countries have a lower loan growth rate during the crisis period. This suggests that the liquidity shock experienced by GIIPS countries was indeed transmitted to those banks through ownership linkages. Larger subsidiary banks and those subsidiaries that were more profitable are found to be more resilient to the shock. We also find that the parent bank's characteristics affect the transmission of the shock, supporting the notion of an internal capital market operating within these banks. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We build a simple model wherein voters differ in income and vote over a proportional tax whose proceeds are distributed lump-sum, and each voter has a probability of receiving the transfer that depends on his income. In progressive steps, we present intuitively appealing sufficient conditions on this probability function for the social program to be supported by majority voting. We also develop intuitive conditions for the emergence of the paradox of redistribution, whereby more focused targeting reduces the size of the transfer program chosen by the majority. We finally apply our framework to the French social housing program and obtain that our model is consistent with a majority of French voters supporting a positive size for that program.","[De Donder, Philippe] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Ecole Sci Gest, Dept Econ, Case Postale 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Peluso, Eugenio] DSE Univ Verona, Ex Panificio S Marta, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Verona,"De Donder, P (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Ecole Sci Gest, Dept Econ, Case Postale 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",de_donder.philippe@uqam.ca; eugenio.peluso@univr.it,,"PELUSO, Eugenio/0000-0002-4914-5310",,,,,25,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2018,174.0,3-4,,,,,301,313,,10.1007/s11127-018-0500-1,0.0,,,13,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FW2PM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425146200006,0

We argue that backtesting of the forecasting models used to derive ES can be based on a multinomial test of Value-at-Risk (VaR) exceptions at several levels. Using simulation experiments with heavy-tailed distributions and GARCH volatility models, we design a statistical procedure to show that at least four VaR levels are required to obtain tests for misspecified trading book models that are more powerful than single-level (or even two-level) binomial exception tests. A traffic-light system for model approval is proposed and illustrated with three real-data examples spanning the 2008 financial crisis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the out-of-sample benefits of relaxing the assumption of perfect correlation are unclear. We compare the performance of the two models from an investor's perspective. In the Bayesian setup, we allow for various distributions of R-2 to account for different degrees of optimism about predictability. We find that relaxing the assumption of perfect predictors does not pay off out-of-sample.

This has led many scholars to argue that financial crises are an important driver in explaining the evolution of the role of central banks as supervisors. We formally test this hypothesis employing a new database that captures the full set of supervisory reforms implemented during the period 1996-2013 in a large sample of countries. Our findings support the view that systemic banking crises are important drivers of reforms in supervisory structure. However, we also highlight an equally important peer effect, namely a tendency of countries to reform their financial supervisory architecture when others do so as well. We construct several measures of spatial spillover effects and show that they can explain institutional similarities among countries and impact the probability of reforming the role of the central bank in financial sector supervision.","[Masciandaro, Donato] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Masciandaro, Donato] SUERF, Milan, Italy; [Romelli, Davide] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Bocconi University; Trinity College Dublin,"Romelli, D (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",romellid@tcd.ie,"Romelli, Davide/C-6837-2017","Romelli, Davide/0000-0002-5405-6451",,,,,49,27,32,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

The data selection implications for hedge effectiveness are found to be substantial.

However, we also find that coverage can affect the outcome of proposed M&A deals in non-stateowned firms. We identify this effect using an exogenous shock to market-driven governance from the Split-Share Structure Reform of 2007. Negotiation coverage predicts long-term performance, consistent with information dissemination. Despite biased coverage, domestic media in developing countries can function as an alternative channel for corporate governance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find that these banks aim for an allowance of 49% of impaired loans. In the short run, however, the adjustment of the allowance is only 29% of the change in impaired loans. The deviation from the target is made up by (a) larger additions to allowances in subsequent quarters and (b) smaller reversals of allowances when loan losses do not materialize. After one quarter, the adjustment toward the target level is 32%, and after four quarters it is 79%.

Several empirical studies suggest that the systematic behavior of lending standards, with laxer (tighter) standards applied during expansions (recessions), is responsible for reverting trends in aggregate productivity. We build a dynamic model that rationalizes these findings. Adverse selection in credit markets emerges as a potential source of macroeconomic instability. The key idea modeled is that in order to effectively signal their type to financiers, productive entrepreneurs must suffer a cost. The effective cost of signaling rises with higher cash flow brought about by stronger economic fundamentals, because higher cash flow makes it easier for the unproductive type to mimic the productive type. Competition among the financiers then results in suboptimally lax lending standards. Low productivity entrepreneurs obtain financing, the producer composition effect inducing a recession. This, in turn, creates conditions - weak economic fundamentals and low cash flow - conducive to the emergence of tighter lending terms, the strong composition effect leading to an economic recovery.

Legal framework quality is related to success, but the effect varies with the deal type. First, the significant and positive relationship between legal framework quality and success is more pronounced for domestic deals than for international deals. Further investigations suggest that international venture capitalists often exit their portfolio companies abroad, particularly when these companies are located in countries with in efficient legal frameworks. In addition, the results lend support to the view that international venture capitalists have a greater experience and reputation. Second, legal framework quality seems to be more important for success in syndicated than in standalone deals. This finding supports the view that a sound legal framework may improve the benefit-cost balance of syndication, while an inefficient legal framework may tend to increase costs in syndicated deals.

The non-motorized accessibility to transit is determined by the connectivity and facilities of non motorized network. Using the data from 2009 to 2010 GPS-based Household Travel Survey in the Cincinnati metropolitan area, the study examines distance thresholds of such non-motorized transit access trips and identifies the spatial boundary and geographic area of transit catchment areas in the Geographic Information System environment. Results suggest that bicycle enables people to access the transit service. The bicycle-transit catchment area is estimated as 1.7 and 2.3 times of the size of pedestrian-transit catchment area at home and activity ends respectively. As a result, more households and employment can reach the transit service via bicycling than walking (52.45% vs. 36.72% for households and 47.82%. vs. 33.07% for employment in the study area). Suburbs, where near half of population and employment situate, are comparatively underserved. Especially, only 27.14% % of the disadvantaged population in suburbs, can access transit by walking, but the percent is increased to 50.96% if using a bicycle. Besides the distance threshold, the non-motorized accessibility to transit is found to be a significant factor determining transit catchment areas. The transit service area can be expanded if a safer and more comfortable bicycling environment is available. Those findings can also be further used as references in the transit-oriented development planning.","[Zuo, Ting; Wei, Heng] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn & Construct Manag, ART EngineS Transportat Res Lab, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Wei, Heng] Beijing Univ Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rohne, Andrew] Ohio Kentucky Indiana OKI Reg Council Govt, 720 E Pete Rose Way,Suite 420, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Wei, Heng] Shandong Jiaotong Coll, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wei, Heng] Changan Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; Beijing University of Technology; Shandong Jiaotong University; Chang'an University,"Wei, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cincinnati, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn & Construct Manag, ART EngineS Transportat Res Lab, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",zuotg@mail.uc.edu; heng.wei@uc.edu; arohne@oki.org,,,,,,,48,50,56,5,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The data in this research is obtained from Good Corporate Governance of syariah banking (BUS-UUS) period 2012-2016 using a quantitative approach. The result of research shows that the implementation of sharia corporate governance in syariah banking is categorized into three parts that are very good, good and good enough but from the implementation of sharia corporate governance is still not able to prevent fraud in sharia banking.

Financial situations of the future pensioners are relatively good due to the compulsory pension payments, which government can extort. The purpose of those contributions is to pay the minimal benefit when these people are unable to work because of their age. It is worth remembering that there are many possibilities for the individual to save money for old age. The purpose of this article is to indicate the country influence in shaping the benefits when the citizens are too old. This document could be helpful in creating future social policy in these countries, especially in terms of pensions. The comparative data analysis should indicate the best regulations for paying the contribution so that citizens do not live below the poverty line. Simultaneously the introduction of this system will result in smaller subsidies from the government budget. In addition, data on replacement rate and equivalence will be interpreted to determine the benefits received. In the article the critical analysis of the object was applied.

When carrying out the work, the normative methodology was used, with the involvement of specific scientific factors and verified economic results, methods were used: observation, collection of facts, scientific abstractions, comparison. As a result, the authors studied the publications of Russian and foreign authors on the use of outsourcing, its impact on the quality of accounting processes; data characterizing the scale of the market of accounting services in Russia; sites of consulting companies that accept various types of accounting operations for outsourcing. The results are useful for researchers and practitioners working in the field of development of the market of accounting services, as well as decision makers in the field of optimization of business processes of companies in Russia. The novelty of the study is to identify promising promising areas and limitations of the development of accounting services in Russia in the digital economy and specialization of intellectual labor. As a result of the study of outsourcing of accounting services in Russia, the authors made the following conclusions. The growth in the volume, species composition and quality of services occurs when they are provided to non-state small and medium-sized businesses through the use of Internet technologies. Transfer of accounting functions of state-owned companies and all types of large structures on the basis of outsourcing, in modern conditions is impractical, not fully legitimate, and virtually absent.","[Bondarchuk, Natalia; Shamshiev, Sergey; Kubasova, Elena] Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Lesman, Young] Prod Cooperat Machcowi Poland, Warsaw, Poland",Russian State Social University (RSSU),"Bondarchuk, N (通讯作者)，Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia.",BondarchukNV@rgsu.net; shamsheevsv@rgsu.net; kubasovei@rgsu.net; leszman.jan@wp.pl,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,618,626,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000068,0

Determining how close U.S. monetary policy has been to optimal in the past 20 years can give an idea of further gains that could be reaped by going beyond inflation targeting and committing to a Taylor-type rule, as favored by Meltzer. The author provides two examples: The flattening of the Phillips curve can be interpreted as a hallmark of optimal policy; the falling short of the 2 percent price level path established between 1995 and 2012 suggests room for improvement. Whether further gains from coordinating inflation expectations can be achieved is an important area of future research that surely will be influenced by Meltzer's work.","[Bullard, James] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Bullard, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Bullard, James B/L-8120-2016",,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique and a sample of 57 banks operating in BRICS countries over the period from 2006 to 2015. Findings - The results reveal that liquidity risk has a significant and negative effect on the bank risk-taking, indicating that a decrease in liquidity risk contributes to higher bank risk-taking. The study also reveals that funding liquidity risk has the substantial impact on bank risk-taking, suggesting lower funding liquidity risk results in higher bank risk-taking. These results are consistent with prior assumptions. Research limitations/implications - The implications of this study highlight the fact that liquidity risk is a risk factor which drives the potential bank default, of which banks tend to take more risks when higher funding liquidity exists. Practical implications - This study offers a number of valuable implications for the policy makers as well as practitioners. The policy makers should take into account better liquidity risk management framework aimed at preventing banks from taking excessive risks. Bank executives must pay more attention on how banks could hold more liquid securities and cash. Less risk-taking reduces higher borrowing costs undermining earnings through imposing taxes on corporate. Originality/value - This work uncovered that liquidity risk per se is an important and previously unidentified risk factor, specifically its effects on bank risk-taking and contributes to the view in support of holding more liquid securities than the past.","[Dahir, Ahmed Mohamed] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia; [Mahat, Fauziah Binti] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Accounting & Finance, Serdang, Malaysia; [Bin Ali, Noor Azman] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management & Mkt, Serdang, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Dahir, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia.",ahmedtall20@gmail.com,"Rahman, Mohammad Mizanur/AAN-7539-2020","Rahman, Mohammad Mizanur/0000-0002-7414-8281",,,,,51,33,34,6,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We aim to compare the normative properties of strict liability versus fault-based liability under such circumstances. The model demonstrates that only a negligence rule is efficient and that the optimal damages under strict liability is less than what is usually admitted in the literature, i.e. the expected fine, given the probability to escape the liability, should be less than the level of harm. Finally, the paper highlights the role played by the technologies of precaution and evasion in the results.","[Deffains, Bruno] Univ Pantheon Assas, Paris, France; [Deffains, Bruno] IUF, CRED, Paris, France; [Rouillon, Sebastien] Univ Bordeaux 4, GRAPE CEEP, Bordeaux, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Universite de Bordeaux,"Deffains, B (通讯作者)，Univ Pantheon Assas, Paris, France.;Deffains, B (通讯作者)，IUF, CRED, Paris, France.",bruno.deffains@u-paris2.fr; rouillon@u-bordeaux.fr,"Deffains, Bruno/F-2896-2018","Deffains, Bruno/0000-0001-9822-5272; Rouillon, Sebastien/0000-0003-3782-7979",,,,,29,0,0,0,1,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Values are the very thing based on which standards and criteria that stand for the selection and evaluation of specific individuals, events or procedures are constructed. This paper demonstrates that there is a relationship between the value ladder of members of the organization and the organization's value orientation. It also suggests that the level of identification with the organization, unlike the position of the individual in the organization, is an important factor in exploring the organization's own value orientation as well as its relation to the value orientation of its members. A multistep scale questionnaire based on the Schwartz Value Survey and his Portrait Value Questionnaire was used as the data gathering instrument. The data obtained from the questionnaire survey were statistically evaluated using multiple linear regression analyses. The way in which members of the organization arrange the value ladder provides a possible perspective for viewing the psychological link between the individual and the organization.

Economists already understood a great deal about default, both theoretically and empirically, when the crisis began, but new research has moved the frontier further by improving data sources, building dynamic optimizing models of default, and explicitly addressing reverse causality between rising foreclosures and falling house prices. Mortgage defaults also featured prominently in early papers that pointed to subprime and other privately securitized mortgages as fundamental drivers of the housing boom, although this research has been criticized recently. Going forward, improvements to data and models will allow researchers to make progress on the two central questions in this literature. First, what are the relative contributions of adverse life events and negative equity to mortgage default?

We find that ECB's conventional monetary policy (and Fed's monetary policy stance) has a positive and significant effect on economic expectations for Core Eurozone countries and a weak effect on Peripheral Eurozone countries. ECB's unconventional policy measures, however, have a negative short term effect on Core countries' economic expectations.

This teaching case provides an example of implementing the sustainable leather initiative in the global sourcing process at IKEA. The case demonstrates IKEA's sustainable leather initiative supported by its tailored GS strategy and GS structure and provides a benchmark of Sustainable GS for multinational companies and allows for a thorough discussion of how to implement a sustainability initiative while conducting GS.

This type of development has numerous exogenous determinants: global, economic, environmental, and endogenous, existing in agriculture. It results from the EU membership as well as greater links between European and world agriculture. We have also internal determinants both in the rural environment and production process.

Indonesia's inclusive wealth growth is considered positive. However, the dilution effect' on Indonesia's population has outpaced the country's wealth growth, so that its per capita inclusive wealth growth has been negative. This study implies that the GDP per capita growth in Indonesia does not necessarily indicate sustainability. The depreciation of both renewable and non-renewable natural capital is driving the decline in wealth per capita. Despite this, sustainability has been improving, although marginally, due to increases in the rates of produced and human capital growth. To return to a sustainable growth path, Indonesia must increase its investments to a net gain in the rate of wealth growth, and it must reduce its resource extraction to levels that its productive base can maintain.","[Kurniawan, Robi] Minist Energy & Mineral Resources, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Kurniawan, Robi] Tohoku Univ, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Fukuoka, Japan",Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources; Tohoku University; Kyushu University,"Kurniawan, R (通讯作者)，Minist Energy & Mineral Resources, Jakarta, Indonesia.;Kurniawan, R (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.",,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013; Kurniawan, Robi/AAD-8768-2020","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427; kurniawan, robi/0000-0002-8825-8123",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26000001]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26000001] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This paper was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Specially Promoted Research (26000001) by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

How it affects the low-frequency trading, however, is still unclear. Using NASDAQ order book data, the authors investigate this question by categorizing orders as either high or low frequency, and examining several measures. They find that high-frequency trading enhances liquidity by increasing the trade frequency and quantity of low-frequency orders. High-frequency trading also reduces the waiting time of low-frequency limit orders and improves their likelihood of execution. The results indicate that high-frequency trading has a liquidity provision effect and improves the execution quality of low-frequency orders.","[Li, Kun] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cooper, Rick; Van Vliet, Ben] IIT, Chicago, IL 60616 USA",Beijing Normal University; Illinois Institute of Technology,"Li, K (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Houzhulou Bldg,19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",kunli@bnu.edu.cn,"Li, Kun/AAM-3119-2020","Li, Kun/0000-0001-5862-1959",,,,,52,5,8,12,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Empirical studies based on regression analysis and correlation of the time series of daily returns sectoral indices quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Our results suggest that the relationships between classical and downside systematic risk measures depend on the basic parameters of the distribution of returns of market portfolio approximation. There are statistically significant correlations between the standard deviation, asymmetry and kurtosis of market portfolio and measures expressing the relation of beta coefficients. The arguments may be an indication of choosing a systematic risk measures and evaluation of the real beta coefficients.

The authors argue that in some cases there are differences in institutional shape between the shape that is actually demanded by an institution's institutional environment and the shape that the institution itself believes is demanded of its institutional framework. The authors observed a behavior specific to institutions that change their institutional shape in response to demands, irrespective of whether these demands are legitimate, and this behavior was primarily in response to demands from governments and SOEs. The authors call this situation institutional dysmorphia and contrast it with institutional isomorphism. Design/methodology/approach This study is characterized by the qualitative approach and descriptive form. It is also a documentary study employing the systematic review technique and critical appreciation in a research group. The case of the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) is analyzed to examine the different relationships between Brazilian SOEs and BNDES. It used secondary data provided by reports, papers and relevant magazines. The authors compare them with the conceptual purpose originated in the Medicine field. Findings The study is illustrated by the case of the BNDES and the various different relationships between Brazilian SOEs and BNDES are examined. This is a qualitative and descriptive documentary study, employing the systematic review technique. Specific behavior is observed in institutions that change their institutional shape in response to demands, irrespective of whether these demands are legitimate, and these demands mainly come from the government and from SOEs. Research limitations/implications The authors use of secondary data from only one country that was used to present these arguments. The focus was restricted to the institutional framework comprising one institution and SOEs. Private firms were not considered in this institutional framework, but they must be included in a macro-environment. Institutional pressures are dynamic and asymmetric. The dynamism of institutional change was not evaluated, and neither was the evolution of the relationships between government, SOEs and institutions. Finally, researchers need to understand not only top-down models of institutional effects but also the institutional process that incorporates both institutional influence and firm responses. Originality/value The term institutional dysmorphia is proposed through the contrast with concepts such institutional isomorphism, with reference to the institutional logics and institutional complexity of these institutions' and SOEs' environment. The situation described institutional dysmorphia happening in emerging countries context and might open new avenues for research.","[Monticelli, Jefferson Marlon] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Business & Management, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil; [Garrido, Ivan Lapuente; Vieira, Luciana Marques] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, PPGA, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil; [Curth, Marcelo] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil; [Dal-Soto, Fabio] Univ Cruz Alta, CCHS, Cruz Alta, Brazil",Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos); Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos); Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos); Universidade de Cruz Alta,"Monticelli, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Business & Management, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil.",jeffmarlon@hotmail.com; igarrido@unisinos.br; m.curth@ibest.com.br; lmvieira@unisinos.br; dalsoto.gel@terra.com.br,"Garrido, Ivan L/O-5467-2018; Curth, Marcelo/AFB-9282-2022; Vieira, Luciana m/GQH-9657-2022; Vieira, Luciana Marques/E-4342-2010; Dal-Soto, Fábio/V-2068-2018; Vieira, Luciana Marques/ABA-2328-2021; Monticelli, Jefferson Marlon/N-6048-2018","Curth, Marcelo/0000-0002-9361-8373; Vieira, Luciana m/0000-0002-3996-0901; Vieira, Luciana Marques/0000-0002-3996-0901; Garrido, Ivan Lapuente/0000-0003-3741-7961; Monticelli, Jefferson Marlon/0000-0002-1605-7090",,,,,110,9,9,1,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The literature highlighted a lack of pertinent research into the effects company acquisitions have on consumer-based brand equity (CBBE), especially what impact and consequences there may be on a brand that is acquired by another. This report investigated the overall acquisition process and proceeding effects the process had on an organisation's CBBE. In order to achieve an in depth understanding, a case study approach was used. Here Rapha Racing Limited (RRL), a UK based up market manufacturer of cycling clothing and accessories for road riders, was explored. RRL was cited as it had recently experienced a 200 pound million acquisition by two heirs of the Walmart family. Primary research within the case took the form of surveying RRL consumers, interviewing RRL employees and a senior professional, who has been involved in numerous, high value company acquisitions. This multiple perspective approach allowed an insight into how RRL managed their brand throughout the acquisition and whether RRL managed to match, misjudge or exceed consumer brand expectations. This report found how RRL steadied the ship through a clear internal communication strategy with complete transparency between leadership and staff. However, it was found that RRL failed to apply the principle of transparency in their communications with consumers. The paper concludes that careful consideration of the acquiring party, protection of current business culture and systems as well as transparency with existing customers are vital components in controlling an organisation's brand equity with an acquisition event.","[Morrison, Patrick D.; Atkinson, David] Pearson Business Sch, London, England",,"Morrison, PD (通讯作者)，Pearson Business Sch, London, England.",paddymorrison@gmx.co.uk; david.atkinson@pearson.com,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,221,232,,,,,,12,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000025,0

This study examines the influences of highway proximity and traffic on office values in Hong Kong using hedonic price analysis on 13,670 transactions around highway interchanges for 2002-2013. Our hedonic regressions, controlling for unobservable district effects and incorporating instrumental variables, reveal that the associations of highway proximity and traffic with office prices appear to exhibit mixed results across Hong Kong's three territorial divisions. The negative externalities generated by excess traffic cancel out the accessibility benefits of highway proximity on Hong Kong Island, where densely built-up office districts are suited for amenity-sensitive knowledge businesses that tend to create value-added services through face-to-face communications. By contrast, highway proximity uplifts the value of office properties with lower transportation costs and higher market accessibility in Kowloon and the New Territories, where spacious workplaces near hub-port and logistics facilities are advantageous for mobility-driven trade and transportation businesses that tend to increase value-added throughput in cross-border relations with mainland China. These territorial findings are of particular importance for progressive policymakers to deploy the strategic applications of underground bypasses, greenway creation, interchange improvement, congestion charges, and smart technology to manage mobility and alleviate disamenity, accompanied by supportive public transit services and adaptive land-use rezoning, in the dynamic and complex process of deindustrialization.","[Murakami, Jin] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, 6-F Yeung Kin Man Acad Bldg,Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [He, Yiming] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, 5-F Knowles Bldg,Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Murakami, J (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, 6-F Yeung Kin Man Acad Bldg,Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jin.m@cityu.edu.hk; yiminghe@hku.hk,"Murakami, Jin/AGT-2583-2022; Murakami, Jin/L-1622-2019","Murakami, Jin/0000-0002-9119-6453; He, Yiming/0000-0001-7742-3923","City University of Hong Kong [7200340, 7004634]",City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),"The work described in this paper was partially supported by two grants from City University of Hong Kong (Project No. 7200340 Megaprojects and Value Capture Opportunities under the Public Landholding System: Project Cases and Spatial Database Development and Project No. 7004634 Influences of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) with World-class Infrastructure on Business Agglomeration and Productivity in Hong Kong: A Panel Data Analysis, 2004-2014).",,84,6,6,1,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Design/methodology/approach The authors argue that state ownership leads Chinese firms to behave toward political risk in an unconventional way, and that government support makes them less dependent on their own and other Chinese firms' prior host country experience. The authors tested the hypotheses using data on outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) decisions made by 186 Chinese firms in 93 countries. Findings The authors found that Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), compared to non-SOEs, are more likely to move into countries with high political risk, and that they are less likely to be inertial and mimetic. Originality/value Building on the distinction between macro- and micro-political risk, The authors contribute to the political risk literature by developing several arguments that explains why political risk varies across investing firms in a given host country. Moreover, this is one of the first studies of its kind to investigate the moderating effect of state ownership on the relationship between inertial and mimetic behavior, and the location choice of Chinese MNEs.","[Quer, Diego; Claver, Enrique; Rienda, Laura] Univ Alicante, Dept Management, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Quer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Dept Management, Alicante, Spain.",diego.quer@ua.es; enrique.claver@ua.es; laura.rienda@ua.es,"Rienda, Laura/R-8699-2018; Claver-Cortés, Enrique/AAC-5901-2020; Quer, Diego/E-7418-2017","Rienda, Laura/0000-0002-1940-4035; Quer, Diego/0000-0002-5814-6411",,,,,96,25,26,2,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

By using a number of 34 banking issuers taken randomly from a number of 81 banking issuers listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2014 and 2016, and using one way ANOVA analysis method, for t-test, to see the effect of pre and post XBRL adoption on trading shares frequencies, and also added control variables ROA, SIZE and dividend ratios to the effect of pre XBRL adoption. The results revealed that when post XBRL adoption, the stock trading frequency and control Variable ROA (Return on Assets) did not have any significant changes during the implementation of XBRL, this was due to the sample of financial report data taken from post XBRL, i.e., the 2016 financial data, while the implementation of XBRL only started in 2015, so the implementation of XBRL had not an effective effect on investors, but the other control variable, i.e., SIZE had significant changes during the post XBRL adoption, this implies the effectiveness of XBRL adoption, the increase in the investor's turnover ratio in small companies is more pronounced and economically significant than the large companies.

In the Eastern and Central regions of the E.U there is not a tourist activity as high as in other regions of the Union. However, the tourism tends to concentrate in some areas: seaside, capital cities and mountainous ones. The poor promotion and the poor infrastructure are the main brakes for the tourism development in the Eastern and Central Europe regions. We observed insignificant increases of the net occupancy rates of bed places and a slowly decreasing trend of the average length of stay. These facts can change also by the diversification of the tourist offer. Our correlative analysis revealed that in most cases the regions registering a high net occupancy rates of bed places and a high average length of stay, also record a high tourism intensity. So, diversifying the offer will contribute to the increase of the length of stay and of the net occupancy rates of bed places, bringing more incomes in the economy of the area and efficientizing the use of resources.","[Scutariu, Adrian-Liviu] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Scutariu, AL (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Suceava, Romania.",livius@seap.usv.ro,"Scutariu, Adrian-Liviu/IAM-5594-2023",,,,,,7,1,1,0,0,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"2, TEPES VODA STR, IASI, 700 714, ROMANIA",,,978-1-910129-18-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,255,267,,10.18662/lumproc.78,0.0,,,13,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM9BY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470307900023,0

Bounds testing approach to cointegration used in the structure of Autoregressive Distributed Lag is employed for understanding the behavior of the different variables, applying Neo-Classical Investment theory. The results show the importance of tax expenditure policy, in the short run, through the cost of capital, as a determinant to boost private investment in the economy, under circumstances of low inflation. On the other hand, in high inflation periods, the direct expenditure is found to be more potent. The empirical evidence shows a strong role of direct expenditure in influencing both the short-run and the long-run behavior of investment in the economy.","[Shabbar, Shagufta] Inst Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Qazi Masood] IBA, Karachi, Pakistan; [Pasha, Farooq] State Bank Pakistan, Karachi, Pakistan","Institute of Business Administration, Karachi","Shabbar, S (通讯作者)，Inst Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan.",,"Shabbar, Shagufta/JGC-6864-2023",,,,,,36,0,0,0,1,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-6044,,978-80-87927-53-3,PROC ECON FINAN CONF,,,2018,,,,,,,198,216,,10.20472/EFC.2018.009.015,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505163200015,0

Design/methodology/approach A survey questionnaire was used to collect data on a sample of 254 firms from the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The target respondents included middle to senior managers working in logistics, operations, finance and general management positions. Findings The data revealed a positive relationship between learning organization (LO) initiatives and four measures of firm performance considered in the study: employee skills development, product/service innovation, cost-effectiveness and growth in revenues. This relationship was moderated by strategic orientation of the human resource management function and perceived organizational support. Effective HRM strategies and organizational support systems were identified as critical resources that can add substantial value to the performance outcomes of an LO culture. These findings suggest that investing in the development of an LO culture makes a good business sense. Research limitations/implications Use of perceptual measures was one of the major limitations of the present study. Practical implications The largely positive impact of LO-related programs underscores the strategic importance of the LO concept to maintain superior performance outcomes in the emerging knowledge economy of UAE. Originality/value The paper represents an initial effort at making a business case for the LO concept in a non-western context. It brings into focus the role of organizational support and strategically oriented human resource management initiatives in optimizing the performance impact an LO culture.","[Siddique, C.

Critical researchers have even proposed the term projectification to reflect the expansion of project management concepts. In higher education and the science system, project management was primarily the result of scientific and implementation projects, which are intentional organizational activities, closed by strictly defined time and budgetary frameworks. Reflections on the topic of project management in the higher education sector can be started by defining the management process itself It can be said that management is a process in which it is necessary to combine actions efficiently and effectively to set goals and strategies. The management of a university is partly different from the company management process, e.g. due to the nature and mission of the university. Processes, from the management point of view, constitute a set of actions, i.e. a planned sequence of activities that comprise specific actions. The process is a structured and organized sequence of activities from which unnecessary or ineffective activities should be eliminated. In addition, the activities carried out in the process must be directed towards achieving a common goal. The process itself can be defined as a set of activities that are interrelated or interact and transform inputs into organizational outputs. Universities use process management to achieve strategic goals. The problem is the measurement of both input and output effects in all three core processes, i.e. research, education and implementation. The system of measures is related to the accountability of the university and is based on performance indicators.","[Sulkowski, Lukasz; Wozniak, Andrzej; Seliga, Robert] Univ Social Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Social Sciences,"Sulkowski, L (通讯作者)，Univ Social Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",lsulkowski@san.edu.pl; awozniak@san.edu.pl; rseliga@san.edu.pl,"Seliga, Robert/KBP-8533-2024; Sułkowski, Łukasz/N-4878-2019","Seliga, Robert/0000-0003-3306-904X; Sułkowski, Łukasz/0000-0002-1248-2743",,,,,27,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,69,77,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000008,0

This paper aims at shedding some light on the differences between a marginal approach and a non-separable agricultural household model with behavioural responses. When behavioural adjustments are allowed, households can adapt their consumption and production patterns by resulting in lower deteriorations in household welfare. The second-order effects introduced in the approach with responses reduce the negative effects due to the first-order consumption effects, with significant differences across quintiles. On average, the second-order effects represent up to roughly 40 per cent of total first-order effects.","[Tiberti, Luca] Univ Laval, Partnership Econ Policy, Pavillon J-A DeSeve, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Tiberti, Marco] World Bank, Dev Data Grp, Rome, Italy",Laval University; The World Bank,"Tiberti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Partnership Econ Policy, Pavillon J-A DeSeve, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",luca.tiberti@ecn.ulaval.ca,,"Tiberti, Luca/0000-0003-2305-6704",Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP); Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom (or UK Aid); Government of Canada through the International Development Research Center (IDRC),Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP); Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom (or UK Aid); Government of Canada through the International Development Research Center (IDRC),"We are very grateful to John Cockburn, Richard Palmer-Jones and two anonymous referees for useful advice.

Based on literature review, we have posed the following research hypothesis (H1): income elasticity for health-care spending is lower than 1 in EU countries. We have analyzed the relationship between total health expenditure per capita (THCEPC) and income - represented by gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC). We have also incorporated other variables, characterizing society's structure: Gini coefficient, a percentage of population at risk of poverty, health state self-assessment, and healthy life years (HLY) indicator, separately for male and female population. We have found that (1) decline in the value of the Gini coefficient increased the level of THCEPC; (2) in the case of the female population, shortening of HLY stimulated the growth of THCEPC, while for male population the relationship was reversed; and (3) income elasticity of THCEPC is equal to 1.17, which means that health-care benefits are luxurious goods, with income elasticity higher than 1.

The population of this study is Islamic Banks registered in Bank Indonesia (BI) with a total sample of five Islamic Banks during three year period. The data was analyzed using panel data regression. The dependent variable used in this study is the corporate zakat expenditure. Furthermore, the independent variables are Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Firm Size. The results indicated that corporate zakat expenditure on Islamic Banks has increased every year, while ROA and ROE has fluctuating growth. ROA tends to icrease, but ROE tends to decrease. Based on the t-test results show that ROA does not have effect on the corporate zakat expenditure while ROE and Firm Size have a positive and significant effect on corporate zakat expenditure. Thus it can be concluded that when ROA increases, it does not affect the corporate zakat and when ROE and firm size increases, it will increase the corporate zakat on Islamic Banks.","[Utari, Rizky; Monoarfa, Hilda; Ninglasari, Sri Yayu] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Dept Islamic Econ & Finance, Jl Dr Setiabudhi 229, Kota Bandung, Indonesia",Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia,"Utari, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Dept Islamic Econ & Finance, Jl Dr Setiabudhi 229, Kota Bandung, Indonesia.",rizkyutari195@student.upi.edu,"Monoarfa, Hilda/GPK-1172-2022","Monoarfa, Hilda/0000-0002-1911-5815; Ninglasari, Sri Yayu/0000-0002-8626-6488",,,,,32,1,1,0,2,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,413,427,,10.18502/kss.v3i13.4220,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics; Religion,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Religion,BS3YS,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000716967900028,0

The study was conducted on a sample of young people who study and work in ecobiological centers that use the principles of the enriched educational environment (using as an example the educational project in Brazil center Recanto Maestro, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). Methods such as the Schwartz Portrait Values Questionnaire, the hardiness survey (by Salvatore Maddi), the author's questionnaire on work experience and the evaluation of cases from movies reflecting the relationship between the subordinate and the leader wereused. The comparative analysis showed that the study group of young people who received training through work in the Recanto Maestro is distinguished by the prevalence of the value of self-determination and power, demonstrates a higher level of vitality and this group also according to the evaluation of two excerpts from films has a more functional and constructive vision of relations leader-subordinate. The study showed that young people choose work that requires from them higher level of responsibility, find opportunities to master practical activities, development and self-realization. The results demonstrate that the creation of different types of enriched educational environment, in particular the model of learning through work, also stimulates in the young people certain value changes, the development of the ability for autonomous decision-making. The description of the experience of using the enriched educational environment (learning through work) in this educational project is possible for replication in the framework of other educational projects in different countries.

How important is the role played by institutional barriers with relation to technology adoption? Using cross-country analysis, we find that more-severe institutional barriers in several representative lag-behind countries actually hinder the process of structural transformation and economic development, causing these countries to fall below a representative group of fast-growing economies despite having similar or even better initial states five decades ago. We also find that institutional barriers have played the most important role, accounting for more than half the economic growth in fast-growing and trapped economies and for more than 100 percent of the economic growth in the lag-behind countries. By conducting country studies, we identify that unnecessary protectionism, government misallocation, corruption, and financial instability have been key institutional barriers causing countries to either fall into the poverty trap or lag behind without a sustainable growth engine.","[Wang, Ping] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Wang, Ping] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Wang, Ping] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wong, Tsz-Nga] Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Richmond, VA USA; [Yip, Chong K.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Washington University (WUSTL); National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Wang, P (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.;Wang, P (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Wang, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"YIP, Chong/AAU-7049-2020",,,,,,39,3,3,0,2,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

We exploit the unique variations in China's capital market integration to study the effect of capital market internationalization on the cost of equity financing. Using firm-level panel data from China, we measure capital market integration at the corporate level using the degree of co-movement between a company's share price and the international capital market. After controlling for year effects and industry effects, we find that the growing integration of the capital market is significantly increasing Chinese companies' equity financing costs. This surprising result still holds after controlling for the endogeneity problem. One possible explanation is the asymmetric approach of China's capital market internationalization, i.e. while the Chinese capital market is increasingly open to international investors, it remains difficult for Chinese investors to invest abroad. Consequently, while international investors bring more risk into the Chinese market, domestic investors in China lack effective ways to diversify the risk in the global market. This additional source of non-diversifiable risk demands a higher return to capital, which raises the equity financing costs in China.","[Wang, Zhongzhao; Liang, Quanxi; Yang, Wen] Guangxi Univ, Sch Business, Nanning, Peoples R China",Guangxi University,"Yang, W (通讯作者)，Guangxi Univ, Sch Business, Nanning, Peoples R China.",yangwen1126@mail.gxu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [16BJY175],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This work was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 16BJY175].,,61,1,1,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Base on the concept of brand hate, this research proposes that negative past experience, negative word of mouth, ideological incompatibility, negative brand-self relationship, and negative social self-connection may be the antecedents of brand hate.

This unusual organizational arrangement was an effort to accommodate a paradigmatic conflict about the kind of economic scholarship needed to lift the university in national rankings while, at the same time, maintaining its Catholic identity, a conflict that unfolded over three decades and that resulted, ultimately, in the closure of the heterodox department in July 2010 and a full embrace of mainstream economics. This article traces the history of this conflict and documents the kind of organizational, political, and personal issues that together influenced this extended, intense, and highly divisive case of paradigmatic warfare. Our analysis shows how the goal of becoming a major research university and the use of rankings to measure the performance of academic departments created contested terrain, where existing interests and commitments struggled to maintain legitimacy in the face of the emergence of new strategic priorities and set off a variety of conflicting moves and counter moves that engaged identity and power and that required forceful leadership to resolve.","[Bouchikhi, Hamid] ESSEC Business Sch, Dept Management, BP 105, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Kimberly, John R.] Univ Penn, Dept Management, 2109 SH DH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",ESSEC Business School; University of Pennsylvania,"Bouchikhi, H (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Dept Management, BP 105, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France.",Bouchikhi@essec.edu; kimberly@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Analysing trends in commuting activities, modes and gender differences in commute times, using hazard based duration modelling methods",JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Commuter travel; Males and females; Duration models; Travel behaviour,TRAVEL-TIME; AREAS; LYON,"This study uses Hazard-based duration modelling methods to investigate commute patterns of males and females, with the aim of exploring the variability of commute times and modes over a period of nine years beginning in 2003. Securing two major datasets of the UK National Travel Survey (NTS) and Tyne and Wear household travel survey, as well as the level of detail that the chosen datasets offer, made it possible to ascertain the complexity of commuter travel at its fundamental level. Duration models have been very popular when analysing duration related activities. However, duration modelling research in the context of transport so far has been restricted to cross sectional one-off datasets. This is the first study that investigates commuting durations at a disaggregate level over a sustained period of nine years using duration modelling methods to acquire a fundamental understanding of the changes in commute durations. Gender aspects as well as the transport modes, including non-motorised transport (NMT), car and public transport (PT), were also addressed in the analysis. Probability density functions (PDFs), survival functions (S(f)) and hazard functions (H(f) were employed when carrying out in-depth investigations into the patterns of commuting activities generated by males and females for the whole period of study over nine years, followed by year on year analysis. The descriptive analysis shows that commuting times are becoming longer as time goes by. Year on year analysis reveals that commute trips by car made by males are more likely to prevail in the system compared to PT, especially towards the end of the study period in 2010-11. The opposite is true for female commuting trips. NMT was an attractive mode for both males and females in 2009-10 even for longer commute trip durations of over 50 min. As the complexity of the activity travel patterns of males and females has not been given adequate attention in previous research) this study made a step forward in investigating the gender aspects, with specific attention being given to the differences in commute times.

Using a simple model, we find that the current design of CDS auctions leads to biased prices and inefficient allocations. This is because various restrictions imposed in CDS auctions prevent certain investors from participating in the price discovery and allocation process. The imposition of a price cap or floor also gives dealers large influence on the final auction price. We propose an alternative double auction design that delivers more efficient price discovery and allocations.","[Du, Songzi] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Zhu, Haoxiang] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhu, Haoxiang] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Simon Fraser University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Du, SZ (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",,,,,,,,20,5,6,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, results from a path analysis showed that, although parenting styles were not directly linked with college enrollment, they were indirectly associated with college enrollment via their prior associations with a number of variables, including young adults' subjective probability of completing college, time preferences, academic achievement, cognitive ability, and parental expectations. These findings suggest that although parents may be less directly involved with higher education choices of young adults, they still have an important indirect influence on these choices. Parenting style impacts the child's beliefs, expectations, and attitudes, all of which ultimately play a role in the decision of whether or not to enroll in college.","[Kimmes, Jonathan G.] Florida State Univ, Coll Human Sci, Sandels Bldg 218, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Heckman, Stuart J.] Kansas State Univ, Sch Family Studies & Human Serv, 319 Justin Hall,1324 Lovers Lane, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Kansas State University,"Kimmes, JG (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Coll Human Sci, Sandels Bldg 218, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",jkimmes@fsu.edu; sheckman@k-state.edu,"Kimmes, Jonathan G./D-5268-2017",,,,,,48,6,6,2,40,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Using data from the gasoline market in the Netherlands, we find, first, that markets with N competitors have price distributions that first-order stochastically dominate the price distributions in markets with N+1 firms. Second, the effect of competition is stronger for the medium to upper percentiles of the price distribution. Finally, consumer gains from competition are larger for relatively well-informed consumers. To account for these empirical patterns, we extend Varian's [1980] model by allowing for richer heterogeneity in consumer price information.","[Lach, Saul] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel; [Lach, Saul; Moraga-Gonzalez, Jose L.] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Moraga-Gonzalez, Jose L.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Moraga-Gonzalez, Jose L.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Groningen,"Lach, S (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Jerusalem, Israel.;Lach, S (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",saul.lach@mail.huji.ac.il; j.l.moragagonzalez@vu.nl,,"Moraga Gonzalez, J.L./0000-0002-1669-8402",Wolfson Family Charitable Trust; Marie Curie Excellence Grant [MEXT-CT-2006-042471],Wolfson Family Charitable Trust; Marie Curie Excellence Grant(European Union (EU)),"We thank the Editor, and two anonymous referees, from whom we received numerous comments that helped us improve the paper.

We analyze their effect on technological change in a case where several technologies could be developed and where R&D firms are granted patents with a finite lifetime. We show that R&D incentives are not only too low, as is well known, but incentives are also distorted across technologies, which is a new result. Compared to the social optimum, the best technology is developed in too few cases, whereas a less promising technology might be developed too often. This distortion is difficult to correct, as information about new technologies is usually missing. However, we show that combining a quota market with a simple tax-subsidy scheme can correct some of these distortions, even if the regulator has no information regarding the properties of new technologies.","[Lechthaler-Felber, Giulia; Krysiak, Frank C.] Univ Basel, Dept Econ & Business, Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Krysiak, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Dept Econ & Business, Basel, Switzerland.",Frank.Krysiak@unibas.ch,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Market depths were also significantly reduced with the occupation of the top of the order book by HFT's.

According to the dominant explanation in psychology and economics, self-deception is an intrapersonal process that fortifies and protects the self from threatening information. An alternative possibility is that self-deception evolved as an interpersonal strategy to persuade others. To investigate interpersonal aspects of self-deception, we gave people a persuasive task and measured their information processing biases and their persuasiveness. Results revealed that people who were financially motivated to persuade another person in a particular direction demonstrated a self-deceptive information processing bias consistent with their persuasive goals.

The study proposes that perceived multifocal support and self-efficacy have a direct relationship with deviant behavior, and that these two variables interact in their relationship with deviant workplace behavior. Using self- and peer-reported data from 225 academics, hypothesized relationships were investigated using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that two different forms of support (organizational and supervisory) strongly influenced two different forms of deviant behavior (organizational and interpersonal). Whereas perceived organizational support decreases organizationally relevant deviant behavior, supervisory support decreases deviant behavior toward colleagues. The results also showed that high self-efficacy moderates both the negative relationship between organizational support and deviant behavior toward the organization and that between supervisory support and deviant behavior toward colleagues. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for managers, along with recommendations for future research.","[Tuzun, Ipek Kalemci] Baskent Univ, Fac Commercial Sci, Ankara, Turkey; [Cetin, Fatih] Omer Halisdemir Univ, Fac Adm & Econ Sci, Nigde, Turkey; [Basim, H.

We apply a cross-sectional absolute deviation approach as well as Quantile Regression methods to capture the herding behavior in daily and monthly frequencies in US markets over several time-periods including the global financial crisis. In a novel attempt we modify the empirical CSAD herding modeling by introducing implied volatility as a measure of agent risk expectations. Our findings indicate that herding tends to be intense under extreme market conditions, as depicted in the upper high quantile range of the conditional distribution of returns. During crisis periods herding is observed at the beginning of the crisis and becomes insignificant towards the end. The US market herding behavior exhibits time-varying dynamic trading pattern that can be attributed e.g., to overconfidence or excessive flight to quality features, mostly observed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Moreover, implied volatility reveals asymmetric patterns and plays a key role in enforcing irrational behavior.

The model features non-homothetic preferences, Armington trade, proportional import tariffs and export subsidies, and is calibrated to match sectoral value added data on Korean production and trade. Korea's tariff liberalization increased imports and trade, especially agricultural imports, accelerating de-agriculturalization and intensifying industrialization. Korean subsidy liberalization lowered exports and trade, especially industrial exports, attenuating industrialization. Thus, while individually powerful agents for structural change, Korea's tariff and subsidy reforms offset each other. Subsidy reform dominated quantitatively; lower trade, higher agricultural and lower industrial employment shares, and slower industrialization were observed than in a counterfactual economy with no post-1963 policy reform.","[Betts, Caroline] Univ Southern Calif, Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Giri, Rahul] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Verma, Rubina] Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Business, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",University of Southern California; International Monetary Fund; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Betts, C (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",cbetts@usc.edu; rgiri@imf.org; rubina.verma@itam.mx,"Betts, Caroline/Q-8130-2019; Verma, Rubina/K-6683-2012",,"Department of Economics at the University of Southern California (USC); USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Faculty Development Program; USC Provost Advancing Scholarship in the Humanities and Social Sciences (ASHSS) Program","Department of Economics at the University of Southern California (USC); USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Faculty Development Program; USC Provost Advancing Scholarship in the Humanities and Social Sciences (ASHSS) Program","The authors wish to thank two anonymous referees and the editor for many helpful comments and suggestions.

We develop a multi-region model of tax competition and resource extraction to assess the fiscal incentive of imposing a tax on carbon rather than on capital. We explicitly model international capital and resource markets, as well as intertemporal capital accumulation and resource extraction. While fossil resources give rise to scarcity rents, capital does not. With carbon taxes, the rents can be captured and invested in infrastructure, which leads to higher welfare than under capital taxation. This result holds even without modeling environmental damages. It is robust under a variation of the behavioral assumptions of resource importers to coordinate their actions, and a resource exporter's ability to counteract carbon policies. Further, no green paradox occurs-instead, the carbon tax constitutes a viable green policy, since it postpones extraction and reduces cumulative emissions.","[Franks, Max; Edenhofer, Ottmar; Lessmann, Kai] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Franks, Max; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Berlin Inst Technol, Berlin, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Franks, M (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany.;Franks, M (通讯作者)，Berlin Inst Technol, Berlin, Germany.",franks@pik-potsdam.de; ottmar.edenhofer@pik-potsdam.de; lessmann@pik-potsdam.de,"Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013",,German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [01LA1121A],German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We thank Patrick Doupe, Beatriz Gaitan, Ulrike Kornek, Linus Mattauch, Warwick McKibben, Gregor Schwerhoff, Sjak Smulders, Iris Staub-Kaminski, the CREW project members, in particular Marco Runkel and Karl Zimmermann, the participants of the FEEM workshop on Climate Change and Public Goods 2014, the GGKP Annual Conference 2015, the Annual Conference of the Royal Economic Society 2015, as well as the RD3 PhD seminars at PIK, and two anonymous referees for useful comments and fruitful discussions.

We reinvestigate the impact of fragmentation in the context of growth, bureaucratic policy, and education, focusing on a number of conceptually different indicators of fragmentation, and paying attention to potentially heterogeneous effects across countries, sectors, and channels of influence. Our systematic and detailed reexamination of existing empirical studies shows that this differentiation is crucial. In some sectors such as primary education donor concentration or limiting donor numbers appear to be detrimental rather than beneficial for development outcomes. In other areas, we find the expected negative effect, but only when we conceptualize fragmentation as a lack of lead donors (too limited concentration), rather than in terms of donor numbers. In all cases, sufficient initial administrative capacity in recipient countries prevents the negative and reinforces the positive effects of fragmentation. This stresses the importance of questioning the sweeping conclusions drawn by much of the previous literature. Based on what we currently know, generalizing judgments about the effect of aid fragmentation may be misleading. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Used in corroboration with a differentiation strategy, it can yield an efficient tool for solving the funding problem, of achieving excellence (within higher education institutions) and also of obtaining sustainable convergence (at the EU level). The implementation of the model provides each higher education institution the possibility of customizing strategic measures conjointly with the freedom of focusing on the core of its competitive advantage. The strength of the differentiation strategy-model dyad consists in fostering the cultural-economic diversity and the enabling of authentic excellence.

We model a food-aid intervention as a dynamic game between a food-aid manager and the farmers in a context of asymmetrical information. The food-aid manager is motivated by a relief objective and targets farmers suffering the poverty trap. The food-aid manager uses a self-targeting mechanism by providing the aid through a food wage in exchange for participation in the intervention's activities. Guided by the relief objective and targeting constraint, he fixes the food wage equal to the reservation wage of the farmers not suffering the poverty trap. Dependency traps will then happen every time there is a considerable technological and nutritional gap between farmers who are in and out of the poverty trap. When there is a gap, poor farmers earn more working for the reservation wage of the well-off farmers than by working in their own farm. Dependency can be overcome only if the food-aid program allows farmers to upgrade their productive technologies and catch up with those farmers who are out of the poverty trap.","[Hurtubia Torres, Jaime] 315 Dingalan, Muntinlupa 1770, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Neitzel, Jutta] RCBC Savings Bank Corp Ctr, World Food Programme, 17th Floor,26th & 25th St, Taguig City 1634, Philippines",,"Torres, JH (通讯作者)，315 Dingalan, Muntinlupa 1770, Metro Manila, Philippines.;Neitzel, J (通讯作者)，RCBC Savings Bank Corp Ctr, World Food Programme, 17th Floor,26th & 25th St, Taguig City 1634, Philippines.",jhurtubia@yahoo.it; jutta.neitzel@wfp.org,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

While this is well known, little research has yet been conducted to examine the power of such programs to influence outcomes in times of conflict, especially in countries where anti-poverty programs are implemented amidst disputes against illegal armed groups. This paper focuses on the implementation of Familias en Accion, a flagship anti-poverty cash transfer program in Colombia, during the early 2000s when the country was still experiencing its long-lasting internal conflict. Impact evaluations have already shown the important effects of this program on household poverty levels and children's time allocation, including a higher incidence of school attendance and a lower incidence of child labor. Our hypothesis here is that such outcomes imply changes in the dynamics of the civil conflict, since 50% of the demobilised combatants are children mostly eligible for the transfers. We take advantage of a natural experiment that occurred during the first stage of implementation of the program in the period 2001-04 when the transfers were gradually rolled out across eligible municipalities. By setting out a difference-in-differences approach, our results indicate that the program had positive effects on the demobilisation of combatants. These findings are observed for a length of three years since the program started. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using an extensive dataset of messages posted on the microblogging platform StockTwits, we construct a lexicon of words used by online investors when they share opinions and ideas about the bullishness or the bearishness of the stock market. We demonstrate that a transparent and replicable approach significantly outperforms standard dictionary-based methods used in the literature while remaining competitive with more complex machine learning algorithms. Aggregating individual message sentiment at half-hour intervals, we provide empirical evidence that online investor sentiment helps forecast intraday stock index returns. After controlling for past market returns, we find that the first half-hour change in investor sentiment predicts the last half-hour S&P 500 index ETF return. Examining users' self-reported investment approach, holding period and experience level, we find that the intraday sentiment effect is driven by the shift in the sentiment of novice traders. Overall, our results provide direct empirical evidence of sentiment-driven noise trading at the intraday level. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The paper shows evidence for both supply-side and demand-side factors contributing to liquidity commonality. However, the results are more supportive towards supply-side rationale for liquidity commonality among the firms where regulators and banks play an important source of commonality in liquidity, especially during market turmoil. Results are partially driven by the fact that the Indian stick exchange is an order-driven market. Economic activities like cheap exports and undervalued currency, rather than correlated trading by the institutional investors determine the demand for liquidity. These findings endorse the effect of high firm value, market return, liquidity, volatility, turnover, and alternate proxies of commonality in liquidity estimation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Using instrumental variables and panel-data methods for a sample of high R&D spenders in the UK, we examine whether R&D is reduced in cases of imminent departure of the CEO. Results show evidence for this but only for the sample above the median in intensity of stock and options in the compensation package. This suggests that opportunism is enhanced by inappropriately strong incentives.

We focus on a situation where dishonest behavior pays off at somebody else's cost. In which case, distributional preferences might matter for the willingness to act honestly. To examine this link we conduct a laboratory experiment where we first elicit SVO to measure distributional preferences. Afterwards, we implement a die rolling game to elicit, dishonest behavior at an individual level. We detect a positive correlation between subjects' SVO angle and honest behavior.

Methods: Effects are assessed by analysing data from automatic counting stations during 35 months to measure the changes in bicycle volumes on the investigated routes. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey repeated three times - before, and one and two years after opening the improved routes - is used. Findings are supported by a control survey at a nearby facility, which was not influenced by the infrastructure improvements. Results: The investments related to the two investigated cases of infrastructure improvements resulted in a significant increase in the volume of bicyclist two years after the improvements. On one of the routes, the Albertslund Route, on weekdays during the rush hour in daylight, an increase from 126 to 203 bicyclists/h was recorded, whereas an increase from 24 to 32 bicyclists/h was recorded at Vestvolden for the same period. Most of the increase could be attributed to relocation of bicyclists from other routes. Induced cycling trips - trips that were not previously made by bicycle - were estimated to account for only 4-5% of the bicyclists two years after improvements. Bicyclists using the improved route express an increase in satisfaction with the quality of the facilities, which is significantly higher than at the control site. Conclusion: Data from the counting stations provides useful information if measured over a long period. This is necessary to correct for factors such as climate effects and temporal variation. Investments in cycle infrastructure in the investigated case led to a higher number of bicyclists who were mainly relocated from other routes. A minor increase in the modal share of cyclists was observed two years after the infrastructure improvements. Furthermore, the investments resulted in a higher degree of satisfaction among active bicyclists. If measured over a longer period, this could lead to a higher modal share due to a potential social advertising effect.","[Hans, Skov-Petersen] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Bredahl, Jacobsen Jette; Elizabeth, Vedel Suzanne] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ IFRO, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick] Danish Rd Directorate, Niels Juels Gade 13, DK-1022 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Simon, Rask] Danish Heart Fdn, Vognmagergade 7,3 Sal, DK-1120 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Hans, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",hsp@ign.ku.dk,"Vedel, Suzanne Elizabeth/HJI-0637-2023; Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick/F-1701-2016; Skov-Petersen, Hans/C-8932-2015; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/C-9354-2015","Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick/0000-0002-6679-4515; Skov-Petersen, Hans/0000-0003-3383-7221; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/0000-0002-1313-6228; Vedel, Suzanne Elizabeth/0000-0001-6001-6846",Copenhagen Fortification project; Danish Cancer Society; Realdania Foundation; Danish Forest Nature Agency; Heritage Agency of Denmark; Danish Council for Strategic Research [09-067197],Copenhagen Fortification project; Danish Cancer Society(Danish Cancer Society); Realdania Foundation; Danish Forest Nature Agency; Heritage Agency of Denmark; Danish Council for Strategic Research(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)),"The study presented in the article was part of the Bikeability project (www.bikeability.dk 2013), which was funded by the Danish Council for Strategic Research (file 09-067197), and the Copenhagen Fortification project, which was funded by the Danish Cancer Society, the Realdania Foundation, the Danish Forest & Nature Agency, and the Heritage Agency of Denmark.",,28,27,30,6,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Following this stream of research, this study analyses how the values of prior inventions used to develop a subsequent invention influence the value of the new invention. Building on evolutionary theory and research on technological search and technological paradigms, this article proposes a positive relationship between prior inventions' value and subsequent invention value. The analysis of a large-scale patent data set of pharmaceutical and semiconductor firms largely confirms this notion; however, it also shows that the effect weakens when prior inventions are of higher value. Valuable prior inventions are also positively related to the likelihood that subsequent inventions are breakthroughs; however, while this effect also decreases when prior inventions hold higher values, the decreasing effect occurs only at particularly high levels of prior invention value. In contrast, combining valuable inventions limits the likelihood of generating poor invention outcomes value. In summary, while the results lend support to theories of evolutionary and cumulative technological progress, they also show that despite the recombination potential of technical knowledge, there are practical limits to the benefits of valuable inputs.","[Hohberger, Jan] Univ Technol Sydney, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Hohberger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",Jan.Hohberger@uts.edu.au,,,,,,,86,5,6,2,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Examining the highly variable effects of congestion on travel and accessibility,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Accessibility; Congestion; Travel behavior,INDIVIDUAL ACCESSIBILITY; TIME; MODEL; TRIP,"Congestion is universally unpopular, but is it always a problem? Are some places more congestion-adapted than others? Using data for Los Angeles, we examine whether the geographies of congestion and accessibility are distinct by mapping and describing them across neighborhoods. We then estimate a series of regression models of trip-making to test the net effects of traffic delays on behavior. We find that there are places where people make many trips and engage in many activities despite lots of congestion, which tend to be more central, built-up areas that host many short trips; in other places, high congestion and low activity coincide. Why the variance? While congestion can constrain mobility and reduce accessibility, traffic is also associated with agglomerations of activity and is thus a by product of proximity-based accessibility. Whether agglomeration and congestion have net positive or negative impacts on activity participation thus varies substantially over space. Controlling for factors such as income and working at home, we find that the effects of congestion on access depend on whether congestion-adaptive travel choices (such as walking and making shorter trips to nearby destinations) are viable. Because congestion-adapted places tend to host more trip-making, planners may be justified in creating more such places in order to increase accessibility, even if doing so makes absolute levels of congestion worse in the process.","[Mondschein, Andrew] Univ Virginia, Sch Architecture, Dept Urban & Environm Planning, Campbell Hall,POB 400122, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Taylor, Brian D.] UCLA, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Inst Transportat Studies, 3250 Publ Policy Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of Virginia; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Mondschein, A (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Sch Architecture, Dept Urban & Environm Planning, Campbell Hall,POB 400122, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",mondschein@virginia.edu; btaylor@g.ucla.edu,"Mondschein, Andrew/AAE-1996-2021","Mondschein, Andrew/0000-0002-8454-0463",U.S. Department of Transportation; California Department of Transportation through the University of California Transportation Center,U.S. Department of Transportation; California Department of Transportation through the University of California Transportation Center,The authors are grateful for funding support from the U.S. Department of Transportation and the California Department of Transportation through the University of California Transportation Center.

Here, using new survey data on a thousand micro-enterprises, we explore the determinants of new-to-the-market innovation, the basis for the Schumpeterian creative destruction (CD) process. Our results provide strong support for the interactive nature of micro-enterprise innovation and suggest the potential value of a model of interactive creative destruction (ICD). Contrary to some other recent evidence, market-based and supplier-based collaboration both prove important for new-to-the-market innovation.

The Sustainable Livelihoods Approach, popularized in development programs, frequently targets farmer capacities to cope with and recover from loss and damage by (i) enhancing tangible capitals (e.g., ecological, financial) and/or by (ii) reducing socio-institutional constraints on entitlements and opportunities to access those capitals. While this two-pronged approach can reduce damage to production or expand the range of livelihood activities available to farmers, it often positions tangible capitals themselves as the central and objective means for building resilience. The recent social turn is a call to theorize resilience's intangible and non-material dimensions (e.g., subjective, emotive, and relational forms) as emergent from specific local social-cultural-ecological contexts. Drawing on in-depth field research with rice-farmers in a region of the Philippines experiencing water-related risks, we analyzed several situated intangible narrations of resilience, with a focus on emotive and affective indicators. Farmers narrated their courage to get back up following loss and damage as well as their optimism, faith, and hope for brighter futures in farming and in life. These emotions flowed from their affective relationships with the cosmos (naturalizing life's hardships as cyclical), themselves (strong belief in their own capabilities to persist in times of hardship), and the Divine (faith in God's power to protect hard-working families). Our results contribute to the social turn in resilience literature in two ways. First, we highlight affect and emotion as indicators of farm livelihood resilience. Second, we suggest narrations of resilience are constituted through farmers' particular worldings, or constructions of reality where knowledge, belief systems, and relations, are lived and enacted on an everyday basis. Situating oneself in local contexts can illuminate sources of intangible resilience otherwise hidden from top-down approaches, while engaging worldings can help render these intangible sources intelligible within their contexts.

State agencies promote land accumulation not only through coercive paths, but also by combining political and market mechanisms. Each mechanism may link the state with different actors and coalitions. We illustrate how this worked in Tibu, a Colombian municipality in which violence against civilians and land accumulation took place in more or less distinct phases. The case highlights the fact that land accumulation during war is not only achieved through coercion. At the same time, it shows the importance of identifying the specific coalitions through which states establish their presence in contested territories during war. We explain such variation as resulting from the types of alliances and coalitions that the state establishes with different sets of stakeholders, and the aims pursued by coalition actors.","[Vargas, Jenniffer] FLACSO Mexico, Ajusco 377, Mexico City 14200, DF, Mexico; [Vargas, Jenniffer; Uribe, Sonia] Observ Restituc & Regulac Derechos Propiedad Agr, Bogota, Colombia",FLACSO Mexico,"Vargas, J (通讯作者)，Calle 24 51C-04, Bogota, Colombia.",jenniffervr@gmail.com,"Reina, Jenniffer Vargas/V-9178-2019","Reina, Jenniffer Vargas/0000-0003-2879-5100",Colciencias,"Colciencias(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias)","This paper presents research results from the Observatorio de Restitucion y Regulacion de Derechos de Propiedad Agraria, which is a research project funded by Colciencias.

Using the Markov-switching model, it is found that there are two regimes. The extent of the pass-through is incomplete and is found to be significantly lower in stable regime states. Domestic prices are sensitive to external factors when inflation uncertainty is higher. Essentially, the pass-through estimates exhibit some variation across countries and regimes. Central banks are credible, but the exchange rate is ineffective as a shock absorber during the unstable regime. We find that the output gap has more influence on inflation when the level of inflation exhibits large and erratic variations. Policymakers need to pay attention during periods of high inflation because consumer prices respond differently when the economy is in a high compared to a low inflation regime.","[Baharumshah, Ahmad Zubaidi] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Financial Econ Res Ctr, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Baharumshah, Ahmad Zubaidi; Soon, Siew-Voon] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Soon, Siew-Voon] Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Persiaran Multimedia, Cybajaya 63100, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Universiti Putra Malaysia; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Baharumshah, AZ (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",baharumshah@yahoo.com,"Soon, Siew-Voon/V-3715-2017; Soon, Siew-Voon/AAL-4245-2020","Soon, Siew-Voon/0000-0002-4103-3779; Baharumshah, Ahmad Zubaidi/0000-0002-2725-6546",Universiti Putra Malaysia [GP-IPB/2014/9440900],Universiti Putra Malaysia,"The authors are grateful for the useful and insightful comments provided by Editor, Professor Hamid Beladi, and the anonymous referee of this journal.

With no fare or a uniform fare, ridership is too concentrated on timely trains. Marginal-cost-pricing calls for time-dependent fares that smooth train loads and generate more revenue than an optimal uniform fare. The welfare gains from time-dependent fares are unlikely to increase as ridership grows. However, imposing time-dependent fares raises the benefits of expanding capacity by either adding trains or increasing train capacity. We illustrate these results by calibrating the model to the Paris RER A transit system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Further, we present cross-country evidence that output losses after financial crises are smaller where renting is more prevalent. To understand these findings, we build a general equilibrium model with borrowing constraints and with the option to rent or buy capital. The countercyclicality of rentals occurs because their supply increases, as renting serves as an additional means of savings when credit markets malfunction. Moreover, demand also shifts toward rentals as they become relatively cheaper. By absorbing excess savings, renting mitigates financial crises.","[Gal, Peter N.] OECD, Paris, France; [Pinter, Gabor] Bank England, London, England",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Bank of England,"Gal, PN (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",gal.peter@gmail.com; gabor.pinter@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,44,2,2,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We argue that changes in household electricity access are a complex and changing outcome of two key time-varying processes: (1) net connections (new connections less disconnections) and (2) household formation and dissolution dynamics. In particular, we show that migration can occur in ways which either improves or worsens access. Even for households that stay in place we observe many disconnections. Therefore, in their efforts to improve access to electricity, governments in developing countries may in fact be aiming for a moving target if the infrastructure is provided in places from which people are migrating, if many new households are being formed in un-serviced areas, or if existing connections are being lost.

In this paper we analyze the interaction between gasoline prices and the redesigned and tightened federal fuel economy standards. Tightened standards tend to reduce the effect of gasoline prices on market shares. Furthermore, under the standards a vehicle's fuel economy requirement depends on its size. Lower gasoline prices incentivize consumers to purchase new vehicles with lower fuel economy, which are typically larger and therefore face lower fuel economy requirements. Using monthly data from 1996 to 2015, we find that fuel prices have had a smaller effect on market shares in recent years than previously. This result appears to be driven by a stronger response to rising than falling or stable prices. We construct two proxies for the stringency of the standards, and we find limited evidence that the standards affect the relationship between fuel prices and market shares. Using the estimated responsiveness to fuel costs from the 200815 period, the estimates imply that the 25% gasoline price decrease between 2014 and 2015 had a modest effect on average fuel economy and the average fuel economy required by the standards.","[Leard, Benjamin; Linn, Joshua; McConnell, Virginia] RFF, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Leard, B (通讯作者)，RFF, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",leard@rff.org; linn@rff.org; mcconnell@rff.org,"Linn, Joshua/AAT-6768-2021",,,,,,19,17,20,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

If total output (and consumer welfare) is weakly increased under differential pricing as opposed to uniform pricing, as is true for weakly convex final market demand functions, social welfare is strictly improved.

Many indicators of heterogeneity were considered in the previous research, and all of them were proved to have a great impact on housing prices and time on the market. However, the gap exists in evaluating sellers' pricing strategies in dynamics mostly because of unavailable data. Current study clears out the effect of time on price using data on asking price dynamics. We employ semiparametric sample selection estimation procedure which accounts for the unobserved property characteristics and non-random selection of objects out of the sample. We consider two main types of sellers: real estate agents and property owners, and show that real estate agents appear to be more impatient compared to property owners. Specifically, they set a lower asking price initially and are more likely to revise it over time if the object is not sold.

In my model, investors' desire to diversify their portfolios and investment frictions generate a mean-reverting dynamics of Tobin's q consistent with the probabilities of migration found in the data, and a non-linear pattern in the conditional volatility of Tobin's q. In addition, since firms' market-to-book ratios are function of the state of the economy and contain information about stock returns, stock prices inherit these properties, yielding asset-pricing implications in line with the empirical evidence, namely the value premium and a non-monotone relationship between the volatility of stock returns and the Tobin's q.","[Puopolo, Giovanni W.] Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Puopolo, Giovanni W.] CSEF, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Puopolo, GW (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy.;Puopolo, GW (通讯作者)，CSEF, Naples, Italy.",,,,Swiss National Center for Competence in Research FinRisk,Swiss National Center for Competence in Research FinRisk,"I would like to thank Franklin Allen (the editor) and an anonymous referee for their thoughtful suggestions and comments.

We adopt a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and flexibly test each discontinuity separately. Our finding that ozone levels actually increased with ethanol penetration on each of the four occasions is consistent with a recent empirical study that used different identifying variation and contrasts with a modeling study of Sao Paulo's atmosphere that predicted significant ozone abatement from hypothetical ethanol use. We find no significant relationship between ethanol versus gasoline use and PM2.5 levels. Current tailpipe emissions standards prescribe the exclusion of the mass of unburned ethanol that is emitted-our results suggest that this standard be reviewed. Following decades of VOC emissions control, urban areas in the United States and elsewhere that are currently VOC-limited may see ozone levels rise if and when they adopt mid-level ethanol gasoline blends, whether to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard or Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to abating fossil fuel emissions agreed upon at COP21 in Paris.","[Salvo, Alberto; Wang, Yi] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Salvo, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",albertosalvo@nus.edu.sg; w.yi@u.nus.edu,"Salvo, Alberto/R-6286-2019","Salvo, Alberto/0000-0002-0293-1410",,,,,57,12,19,0,29,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

For intermediate entry costs, markets yield inefficient production and inefficient entry. A mix of three popular regulatory instruments-polluter taxation, feed-in subsidies for renewables, and consumption taxation-cannot correct these market failures for larger entry costs. The instruments are imperfect because they affect marginal incentives, whereas entry is a lumpy fixed cost problem. Whenever the first best is implementable, feed-in subsidies and consumption taxes are redundant. The second best requires feed-in subsidies or consumption taxes in addition to a pollution tax and overshoots first best levels. Given production levels, the instruments do not affect the regulator's budget.","[Antoniou, Fabio; Strausz, Roland] Humboldt Univ, Inst Econ Theory 1, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Strausz, R (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Econ Theory 1, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",fabio.antoniou@wiwi.hu-berlin.de; strauszr@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,"Antoniou, Fabio/ABH-5736-2020","Strausz, Roland/0000-0001-7111-1486; ANTONIOU, FABIO/0000-0002-6943-8057",German Research Foundation [SFB/TR 15]; BMBF,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We thank Stefan Ambec, Panos Hatzipanayotou, Carsten Helm, Matti Liski, Marco Runkel, Ronnie Schob, Anastasios Xepapadeas, and two anonymous referees.

Using French administrative data, the determinants of these wage differentials are analysed. This investigation is carried out across all industries and is then repeated for the banking industry. Taking all industries into account, conventional firms offer lower wages than cooperatives. Most of this pay gap is explained by differences in the characteristics of the employees, jobs and companies. If the focus is narrowed to firms in the banking industry only, it becomes clear that conventional firms pay higher wages than cooperatives but that this gap is explained solely by differences in characteristics. However, their impact is weakened somewhat by differences in the value attributed to these characteristics, which work in favour of employees in cooperatives.","[Bailly, Franck; Chapelle, Karine] Univ Rouen, Rouen, France; [Prouteau, Lionel] Univ Nantes, Nantes, France",Universite de Rouen Normandie; Nantes Universite,"Bailly, F (通讯作者)，Univ Rouen, Dept Econ, UFR Droit & Econ, 3 Ave Pasteur, F-76000 Rouen, France.",franck.bailly@univ-rouen.fr,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche under the future investment program (Programme d'Investissements d'avenir) [ANR-10-EQPX-17],Agence Nationale de la Recherche under the future investment program (Programme d'Investissements d'avenir)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research has benefited from a government support managed by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche under the future investment program (Programme d'Investissements d'avenir) with reference ANR-10-EQPX-17 (Centre d'acces securise aux donnees - CASD).",,55,5,6,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Whereas direct sales maintain a firm's unique product characteristics, or 'brand equity', trade through an intermediary often takes the form of 'private label' sales, under which multiple firms' output is pooled and re-sold under a new private label brand created by the intermediary. This paper shows that these private label arrangements result in greater total export and import volumes and lower average prices for consumers, but fewer independent varieties available to consumers in equilibrium. Normative implications are mixed: consumers trade variety for volume, independent exporters face greater competition from the new private label products, and intermediary firms can capture more of the gains from trade. We explore the implications of competition at the intermediary level and trade costs for the equilibrium pattern of private label and direct exporting and importing activities.","[Blanchard, Emily] Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Chesnokova, Tatyana] Waseda Univ, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Willmann, Gerald] Bielefeld Univ, Bielefeld, Germany; [Willmann, Gerald] IfW Kiel, Kiel, Germany",Dartmouth College; Waseda University; University of Bielefeld; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Blanchard, E (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",emily.blanchard@tuck.dartmouth.edu; chesnokova.tatyana@gmail.com; gwillmann@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,,,,,,,32,1,1,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Thus, in most of the cases, the emissions series display orders of integration equal to or higher than 1, implying that there are permanent effects of shocks for emissions. The only exceptions are Germany, the US and the UK, where shocks will have transitory effects. With respect to the non-linearities, more evidence of non-linear behaviour was obtained for the G7 countries, especially in the cases of the US, the UK, Germany and France.

Increasingly however, these agencies sit within donor governments that are strongly committed to upholding the national interest through their development commitments. This paper is concerned with how bilateral aid agencies manage this tension and how they might continue to serve the altruistic aims of development. The main research question asks if autonomy or a combination of autonomies can improve a development agency's ability to defend the humanitarian imperative of development against normative pressures privileging the national interest? By drawing on theories of autonomy within public management literatures, it is possible to identify points of leverage for development agencies where spaces for autonomous preferences and actions remain, as well as sources of limitation where such opportunities are considerably reduced. Six types of autonomy are examined across three nations widely perceived as strong performers as donors Norway, the UK, and Sweden. The paper suggests that while structural autonomy is critical for preserving humanitarian motivations, there are also unexplored opportunities within other autonomous spheres. A multi-dimensional examination of autonomy highlights the varying capacity that development agencies have to resist pressures to strongly nationalize the global development project.

Empirical results indicate that the World Bank delivers loans with significantly fewer conditions to recipient countries which are assisted by China. In fact these receive 15% fewer conditions for every percentage-point increase in Chinese aid. Less stringent conditionality is also observed in better off borrowers that are in addition funded by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, but this effect vanishes after the start of the new millennium. In contrast, World Bank conditionality is rarely affected by aid inflows from DAC donors, and when it is, conditionality is revised upward. These findings suggest that new donors might be perceived as an attractive financial option to which the World Bank reacts by offering credits less restrictively in order to remain competitive in the loan-giving market and thereby cope with excesses in the supply of development resources.

We suggest a non-parametric causality-in-quantiles test to study whether (relative) terror attacks affect exchange-rate returns and volatility. Using data on the dollar-pound exchange rate to illustrate the test, we show that terror attacks mainly affect the lower and upper quantiles of the conditional distribution of exchange-rate returns, while misspecified (due to nonlinearity and structural breaks) linear Granger causality test show no evidence of predictability. Terror attacks also affect almost all quantiles of the conditional distribution of exchange-rate volatility (except the extreme upper-end), with the significance of the effect being particularly strong for the lower quantiles. The importance of terror attacks is shown to hold also under an alternative measure of volatility and for an important emerging-market exchange rate as well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We focus mainly on allocation rules that in some sense generalize the Shapley value to settings with restricted communication but also present some other important allocation rules. To better understand the properties of various allocation rules, we present and compare the axiomatic properties that characterize each of them. Finally we present some areas of application of this theory: evaluating voters' power as a function of their place in an ideological landscape, estimating an individual's centrality and influence in a network, deriving rankings of the contenders in a competition based on their past performance, and finally the problem of sharing a common natural ressource, the so called river-sharing problem.","[Caulier, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Caulier, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",jean-francois.caulier@univ-paris1.fr; alexandre.skoda@univ-paris1.fr; emily.tanimura@univ-paris1.fr,,,"French National Research Agency, through DynaMITE [ANR-13-BSH1-0010-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-13-BSH1-0010] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","French National Research Agency, through DynaMITE(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","The support of the French National Research Agency, through DynaMITE project (Reference: ANR-13-BSH1-0010-01), is gratefully acknowledged.",,73,4,4,2,13,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We examine situations, not studied by Coase [1960], which give rise to new conditions under which the core of a 3-player game is (non)empty. Precisely, we put forward three main results. First, we demonstrate that the nonemptiness of the core depends on the liability rules and the allocation of rights. Second, we show that when the externality is non transferable, the core is nonempty if the polluter is not liable. We also establish that the core is always nonempty when negotiations between the polluter and the victims require unanimity. We provide a counterexample of the nonemptiness of the core in all other situations. Third, we show that, if the externality is non transferable, then an agent who does not negotiate can nevertheless influence the outcome of the negociation.","[Gonzalez, Stephane] Univ Lyon, UJM St Etienne, CNRS, GATE LSE UMR 5824, Lyon, France; [Marciano, Alain] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, INRA, LAMETA,UMR 5474, Montpellier, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Gonzalez, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, UJM St Etienne, CNRS, GATE LSE UMR 5824, Lyon, France.",stephane.gonzalez@univ-st-etienne.fr; alain.marciano@umontpellier.fr,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,6,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We use data from a cross-sectional farm-household survey and different propensity score matching estimations to reveal how participation in a contract-farming scheme affects smallholder rice production. We find that contract-farming results in expansion of the rice area, intensification of rice production, increased commercialization of rice, and higher farm-gate prices, and ultimately contributes to rice output growth and increased income. Our findings imply that contract-farming can contribute to upgrading the rice supply chain and the development of the rice sector in Benin. Promoting and supporting the spread of contract-farming schemes in the sector might be an effective way to contribute to reaching the government goals of expanding rice production to become self-sufficient and improving rice quality to compete with imported rice. While there is a large empirical literature on contract-farming in high-value and commodity export sectors, studies on contract-farming in staple food sectors are very scarce. Our results document that contract-farming for staple food crops can be sustainable and benefit smallholder farmers; which is against theoretical expectations that contracting for staple food crops is not feasible because of contract-enforcement problems that stem from a low value of produce, low storage and transport costs, and a larger number of buyers in the chain. Our study contributes to understanding the role that contract-farming might play in the much needed upgrading of domestic and staple food crop sectors in developing countries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a spatial impacts model for the trans-strait fixed links in the Pearl River Delta, China. To verify the rationality of the model, four quantitative indicators, including weighted average travel time, the economic linkage intensity, the economic linkage membership grade, and the fractal index are used to investigate the effect by construction of Humen Bridge, Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge and Shenzhen Zhongshan Bridge. The results show that the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge and Shenzhen Zhongshan Bridge greatly improve the regional accessibility with a maximum decrease weighted average travel time of 1.38 h and 0.4 h. The central part of the Delta has greatest impacts. The links increase the economic linkage of cities of each side. The cities directly connected to the fixed links (Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Macao and Zhongshan) experience the highest increasing economic linkage. The regional spatial pattern evolves from unipolarity to multi-polarity and integrates a more advanced and sophisticated spatial network.

The most common inference approaches in RD designs employ flexible parametric and nonparametric local polynomial methods, which rely on extrapolation and large-sample approximations of conditional expectations using observations somewhat near the cutoff that determines treatment assignment. An alternative inference approach employs the idea of local randomization, where the very few units closest to the cutoff are regarded as randomly assigned to treatment and finite-sample exact inference methods are used. In this paper, we contrast these approaches empirically by re-analyzing the influential findings of Ludwig and Miller (), who studied the effect of Head Start assistance on child mortality employing parametric RD methods. We first review methods based on approximations of conditional expectations, which are relatively well developed in the literature, and then present new methods based on randomization inference. In particular, we extend the local randomization framework to allow for parametric adjustments of the potential outcomes; our extended framework substantially relaxes strong assumptions in prior literature and better resembles other RD inference methods. We compare all these methods formally, focusing on both estimands and inference properties. In addition, we develop new approaches for randomization-based sensitivity analysis specifically tailored to RD designs. Applying all these methods to the Head Start data, we find that the original RD treatment effect reported in the literature is quite stable and robust, an empirical finding that enhances the credibility of the original result. All the empirical methods we discuss are readily available in general purpose software in R and Stata; we also provide the dataset and software code needed to replicate all our results.","[Cattaneo, Matias D.; Vazquez-Bare, Gonzalo] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 238 Lorch Hall,611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cattaneo, Matias D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, 238 Lorch Hall,611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Titiunik, Rocio] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, 5700 Haven Hall,505 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Cattaneo, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 238 Lorch Hall,611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Cattaneo, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, 238 Lorch Hall,611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",cattaneo@umich.edu; titiunik@umich.edu; gvazquez@umich.edu,"Cattaneo, Matias/JOZ-2333-2023","Cattaneo, Matias/0000-0003-0493-7506",National Science Foundation [SES 1357561],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Martha Bailey, Jake Bowers, Sebastian Calonico, Max Farrell, Xinwei Ma, Doug Miller, Ariel Pihl, Tomas Rau, and Elizabeth Stuart for comments and suggestions.

Brazil is an interesting case study because of its rapid population aging, large public pension system and early retirement trends. More specifically, we examine how social security incentives and personal characteristics affect one's own and spouses' labor force participation and retirement decisions. Our results suggest that couples synchronize retirement and that they respond similarly to their own characteristics. We also find that wives are more responsive to husbands' incentives than vice versa. Based on the estimates, we simulate different rules to the pension system and their impacts on retirement trends. We observe that setting a minimum retirement age would increase the probability of both being in the labor force for longer periods of time.

In this study, a community opportunity index (COI) is computed for Columbus, Ohio, using a set of socioeconomic factors. An ordinary regression and GWR model are estimated to account for the global and local effects of land uses and capital investments respectively, while controlling for socio-demographical characteristics. The global results indicate that the community opportunity increases as the distance from the city center increases, while The Ohio State University (OSU) has higher positive spillover-effect on near communities than on distant ones. However, the local results appear a local spatially inverse relationship in the areas adjacent to the international airport (CMH), indicating the existence of negative externalities. With the advantage of visualizing spatial variations, the GWR results suggest that the most effective location for allocating future developments is in eastern Columbus, where shows a clustering of higher COI premiums of a percentage change in residential and commercial uses. A variety of spatial variations is found among different capital-investment effects. Therefore, local characteristics require consideration when allocating additional public facilities. Finally, the GWR results reveal the existence of spatial mismatch that socially disadvantaged groups (e.g. black population, other minorities, single-parent families, and zero-vehicle households) tend to reside in vulnerable communities. These local results provide a new perspective on land-use and transportation planning to help shape a fair community opportunity framework for the future.","[Wang, Chih-Hao] Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Geog & City & Reg Planning, 2555 E San Ramon M-S SB69, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Chen, Na] Ohio State Univ, City & Reg Planning, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Wang, CH (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Geog & City & Reg Planning, 2555 E San Ramon M-S SB69, Fresno, CA 93740 USA.",cwang@csufresno.edu; chen.2572@osu.edu,,,,,,,69,41,48,3,57,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

If (1) Ricardian Equivalence holds, and (2) households do not borrow risklessly while holding positive gross positions in other riskless assets, the crowding-out coefficient equals the fraction of the aggregate tax cut that accrues to households that borrow. In the conventional case in which all households receive equal tax cuts, the crowding-out coefficient equals the fraction of households that borrow; in the United States, about 75% of households borrow, so the crowding-out coefficient is predicted to be 0.75.

In the context of these multiple challenges, this paper explores how seasonal hunger is related to smallholder organizational affiliation, farm and farmer characteristics, and post-hazard household-level coping strategies. The study integrates qualitative research, hydro-climatic data analysis, and a survey of 368 households completed in 2014. A number of household capacities correlate significantly with shorter periods of seasonal hunger: households with larger farms, with off-farm employment, and that produce more than half of their food, maintain more fruit trees, and harvest more coffee reported fewer lean months. We find evidence consistent with path dependence in how households cope with a sequence of environmental hazards, as the reported use of less preferred coping responses to past events (e.g., Hurricane Mitch and the 2009 drought) tended to correlate with their continued use after subsequent hazards. A comparison of coping responses of households affiliated with a farmer-to-farmer institution promoting subsistence-oriented production with those affiliated with cooperatives prioritizing sustainable coffee exports shows that farmer institutions were not strongly correlated with the number of lean months or coping mechanisms.

Specifically, we generalize the standard constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) utility specification for manufactured goods and environmental services, by adding a subsistence requirement for environmental services. We find that the Hicksian elasticity of substitution strictly monotonically increases with the consumption of environmental services above the subsistence requirement, and approaches the standard CES value as consumption becomes very large. Whether the two goods are market substitutes depends on the level of income. We further show that the subsistence requirement may jeopardize the existence of an intertemporally optimal and sustainable consumption path. Our results have important implications for growth, development and environmental policy.","[Baumgaertner, Stefan] Univ Freiburg, Dept Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Baumgaertner, Stefan] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainabil Sci, Luneburg, Germany; [Baumgaertner, Stefan] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Econ, Luneburg, Germany; [Drupp, Moritz A.; Quaas, Martin F.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Drupp, Moritz A.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Quaas, Martin F.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Freiburg; Leuphana University Luneburg; Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Kiel; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Baumgärtner, S (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Dept Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.;Baumgärtner, S (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainabil Sci, Luneburg, Germany.;Baumgärtner, S (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Dept Econ, Luneburg, Germany.",stefan.baumgaertner@ere.uni-freiburg.de,"Baumgärtner, Stefan/A-9597-2012; Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012","Baumgärtner, Stefan/0000-0001-8314-8462; Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829; Drupp, Moritz/0000-0001-8981-0496",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LA1104C]; German National Academic Foundation; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German National Academic Foundation; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"We are grateful to Wolfgang Buchholz, Eli Fenichel, Reyer Gerlagh, Thomas Sterner, Christian Traeger, Rintaro Yamaguchi, two anonymous reviewers, as well as participants at the 2014 BIOECON and the 2015 EAERE conferences for helpful comments.

We first develop a theory to price variance swaps and show that the realized variance can be perfectly replicated by a static position in Treasury futures options and a dynamic position in the underlying. Pricing and hedging is robust even in the underlying jumps. Using a large options panel data set on Treasury futures with different tenors, we report the following findings: First, the term structure of implied variances is downward sloping across maturities and increases in tenors. Moreover, the slope of the term structure is strongly linked to economic activity. Second, returns to the Treasury variance swap are negative and economically large. Shorting a variance swap produces an annualized Sharpe ratio of almost two and the associated returns cannot be explained by standard risk factors. Finally, the returns remain highly statistically significant even when accounting for transaction costs and margin requirements.","[Choi, Hoyong] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Mueller, Philippe; Vedolin, Andrea] London Sch Econ, London, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Choi, H (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,"Choi, Hoyong/HPG-6056-2023",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,41,36,41,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Furthermore, we find differences across the quantiles of the overtime hours distribution and these differences between quantiles also vary between employees of establishment with and without works councils. By considering contracted working time effects and comparing conditional quantiles we find in some quantiles that employees of establishments with a works council have a higher amount of overtime hours if an employee regularly works 35hours per week. This effect diminishes with increasing quantiles of the distribution of overtime hours. If an employee of a codetermined establishment regularly works 40hours per week, overtime hours are reduced.

Efforts have been taken to understand the role of women in decision making and in farm operations. Recommendations for best practices in eliciting information on women's roles have emphasized the importance of sex-disaggregated data collection and analysis. Collection of sex-disaggregated data is not straightforward and careful attention to context is needed. In Ecuador's highlands, chemical use in agriculture is widespread, and outreach and training programs to reduce this use are essential. These programs should target the appropriate decision makers. This paper presents results from a field experiment conducted in the Ecuador highlands where responding farm households are randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: (i) a male respondent, (ii) a female respondent, and (iii) both adult male and female respondents (interviewed separately, but with knowledge that the other would also be interviewed). We assess whether treatment assignment affects responses to questions about decision making and responsibility for agricultural activities. Perceptions about household decision making and who is responsible for agricultural activities vary substantially by type of respondent. Men are more likely to claim sole responsibility; women are more likely to claim responsibility or that decisions are jointly made. In households where both man and woman were interviewed (separately) we found stark differences in responses about responsibilities, with men claiming sole responsibility at higher rates. Interviewing both members led to less divergence in responses, but large differences in perceptions about responsibilities remain when both are interviewed. Best interviewing practices depend on the type of information needed: for precise quantification of gender roles, complex methods may be necessary, but where qualitative information is sufficient, single-member interviews may be sufficient.

The net effect of exchange speed depends on a security's news-to-liquidity-trader ratio.","[Menkveld, Albert J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Menkveld, Albert J.] Tinbergen Inst Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Zoican, Marius A.] Univ Paris 09, Paris, France",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Menkveld, AJ (通讯作者)，VU Univ Amsterdam FEWEB, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",albertjmenkveld@gmail.com,,"Zoican, Marius/0000-0002-5322-7554; Menkveld, Albert/0000-0002-9913-9242",NWO; Fondation du Risque: Quantitative Management Initiative (QMI),NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Fondation du Risque: Quantitative Management Initiative (QMI),"The paper received the Outstanding Paper in Investments award at the Eastern Finance Association 2014.

This paper investigates the relationship between business diversification and corporate social performance (CSP) in an industrial setting, in Indonesia. CSP is measured with an index constructed from content and disclosure analysis of annual company reports in line with global reporting initiative standards. A sample of 107 listed manufacturing companies from the Indonesian Stock Exchange is used to estimate a lagged multiple regression model to show that industry-level diversification does not have an effect on CSP. However, distinguishing between related and unrelated diversification produces a different outcome whereby, related diversification is negatively and statistically significantly correlated with CSP. Unrelated diversification, on the other hand, shows a positive and statistically significant relationship. It means the relationship between unrelated diversification and CSP is more positive than the relationship between related diversification and CSP. The findings offer a unique insight into industrial diversification and CSP in Indonesia's expanding manufacturing sector.","[Patrisia, Dina; Dastgir, Shabbir] Univ Huddersfield, Dept Strategy Mkt & Econ, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England; [Patrisia, Dina] State Univ Padang, Dept Management, Padang, Indonesia",University of Huddersfield; Universitas Negeri Padang,"Patrisia, D (通讯作者)，Univ Huddersfield, Dept Strategy Mkt & Econ, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England.;Patrisia, D (通讯作者)，State Univ Padang, Dept Management, Padang, Indonesia.",Dina.Patrisia@hud.ac.uk; s.dastgir@hud.ac.uk,"Patrisia, Dina/AAC-1800-2019","Patrisia, Dina/0000-0002-5529-7804",,,,,84,16,20,2,36,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

This is motivated by the often markedly different results from these decompositionsdifferent decompositions have broad implications for the relative importance of real versus nominal shocks in explaining variations in output. Using U.S. quarterly real GDP, we find that the overall best model is an unobserved components model with two features: (i) a nonzero correlation between trend and cycle innovations and (ii) a break in trend output growth in 2007. The annualized trend output growth decreases from about 3.4% to 1.2%-1.5% after the break. The results also indicate that real shocks are more important than nominal shocks. The slowdown in trend output growth is robust when we expand the set of models to include bivariate unobserved components models.","[Grant, Angelia L.; Chan, Joshua C.

We study the role of personality characteristics and age-appropriate entrepreneurial competencies (leadership, self-esteem, creativity, and proactivity motivation) in the prediction of entrepreneurial alertness and career intention. Using two-wave longitudinal data from high schools in Helsinki, Finland (N = 523), we tested a mediation model with competencies as mediators between personality and entrepreneurial alertness and intention. The findings suggest that entrepreneurial alertness and career intention (a) are rather independent career development constructs of the emerging entrepreneurial mind-set, (b) are both an expression of an entrepreneurial personality structure, and (c) are predicted by different underlying competencies: leadership and self-esteem mediated the personality-entrepreneurial intention link, and leadership, creativity, and proactivity motivation the personality-entrepreneurial alertness link. Consistent with the balanced skill approach to entrepreneurship, the intraindividual variety of these competencies was also a valid mediator; it did not show incremental predictive power though.

Perceptions of organization are shown through managers and consultants perceptions survey in southeast Europe region. From the other side as an empirical base of real managerial behaviours there is a database of companies which had been proactively asking for consultancy services in southeast Europe region. This research is based on Adizes Institute database, which is the reason we have introduced the Adizes Corporate Lifecycle model theory.

To manipulate fast and slow decisions, subjects were randomly allocated to responding within 7 seconds (time pressure) or waiting for at least 7 or 20 seconds (time delay) before responding. To control for different effects of time pressure and time delay on measurement noise, we estimate separate parameters for noise and risk preferences within a random utility framework. We find that time pressure increases risk aversion for gains and risk taking for losses compared to time delay, implying that time pressure increases the reflection effect of Prospect Theory. The results for gains are weaker and less robust than the results for losses. We find no significant difference between time pressure and time delay for loss aversion (tested in only one of the experiments). Time delay also leads to less measurement noise than time pressure and unconstrained decisions, and appears to be an effective way of decreasing noise in experiments.","[Kirchler, Michael; Bonn, Caroline; Stefan, Matthias] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Banking & Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Kirchler, Michael] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Ctr Finance, Box 600, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Andersson, David; Johannesson, Magnus; Tinghog, Gustav] Linkoping Univ, Div Econ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Johannesson, Magnus] Stockholm Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Box 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sorensen, Erik O.] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helleveien 30, NO-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Tinghog, Gustav] Linkoping Univ, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Natl Ctr Prior Setting Hlth Care, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Vastfjall, Daniel] Linkoping Univ, Dept Behav Sci & Learning, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Vastfjall, Daniel] Decis Res, 1201 Oak St,Suite 200, Eugene, OR 97401 USA",University of Innsbruck; University of Gothenburg; Linkoping University; Stockholm School of Economics; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Kirchler, M (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Banking & Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.;Kirchler, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Ctr Finance, Box 600, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",michael.kirchler@uibk.ac.at,"Västfjäll, Daniel/F-9629-2014; Tinghög, Gustav/K-2961-2012; Johannesson, Magnus/E-9680-2011","Tinghög, Gustav/0000-0002-8159-1249; Johannesson, Magnus/0000-0001-8759-6393; Vastfjall, Daniel/0000-0003-2873-4500; Sorensen, Erik O./0000-0002-7155-4188","Austrian Science Fund FWF (START-grant) [ZFP220400, Y617-G11, SFB F63]; Ragnar Soderberg, Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research","Austrian Science Fund FWF (START-grant)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Ragnar Soderberg, Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte))","Open access funding provided by University of Innsbruck and Medical University of Innsbruck.

The evidence is consistent with this hypothesis, but the challenge is to solve the reflection problem', i.e. is the apparent effect of neighbours' happiness on own happiness a causal one or merely a reflection?

Design/methodology/approach - Quarterly data of six years (2006-2011) are obtained from 30 banks, consisting of 25 conventional and five Islamic banks. The short-run as well as long-run relationships among these variables are examined by utilizing advanced time series approach. Bounds testing and autoregressive distributed lag have been used to examine cointegration and error correction framework for short-run dynamics. Findings - The empirical results reveal that variables such as interest rate of conventional banks, profit of Islamic banks, consumer prices, M3, and BLR have different impact on conventional and Islamic bank deposits. Depositors of conventional and Islamic banks are sensitive to the returns received on deposits. A boost in interest rate increases the deposits of conventional banks but decreases those of Islamic banks. Originality/value - This study signifies that customers of Islamic banks are motivated by profit. This indicates the normal behavior of customers, hence endures the substitution effect in conventional system. The study has important implications for Islamic banks to offer more competitive rates of profit with respect to the interest rate of conventional banks in order to collect more deposits. It also identifies relevant policy implication for the central bank of the country.","[Akhtar, Beenish; Shahbaz, Muhammad] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Lahore, Pakistan; [Akhter, Waheed] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Ctr Islamic Finance, Dept Management Sci, Lahore, Pakistan; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); Montpellier Business School,"Akhter, W (通讯作者)，COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Ctr Islamic Finance, Dept Management Sci, Lahore, Pakistan.",drwaheed@ciitlahore.edu.pk,"Akhter, Waheed/P-1466-2018; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019","Akhter, Waheed/0000-0002-8653-2213;",,,,,53,18,18,0,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the asymmetric volatility and the risk-return tradeoff at the sector level in the emerging stock market of Jordan. Design/methodology/approach - Data consist of daily prices for 22 sub-sectors spanning from August 1, 2006, to September 30, 2015, covering the periods of pre, during, and after the global financial crisis. The EGARCH-M model is used to document the patterns of asymmetric volatility of sub-sector returns and the risk-return tradeoff during the non-overlapping three sub-sample periods. Findings - The major findings of this study are as follows. In the pre-crisis period, the results suggest some evidence of a positive relationship between risk and return. The results also reveal that good news has more effect than bad news during the same period. In the crisis period, there is a negative but insignificant risk-return relationship and negative shocks have more impact than positive ones. In the post-crisis period, the authors find positive but insignificant risk-return tradeoff with weak evidence of volatility asymmetry. Practical implications - The results have major implications for investors willing to engage their investment decisions in the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) and for policymakers who seek to attract and retain regional and international investors. Since the empirical investigation is conducted at the sector level, the study may aid investors to target specific sub-sectors with positive and significant risk-return tradeoff. In addition, investors need to monitor the asymmetric patterns which make the level of risk-aversion more susceptible to coming news. For policymakers, the latest infrastructure reforms are crucial to achieving the potential for growth but the ASE market authority needs to undergo further reforms and provide various promotional incentives. Originality/value - Although there are numerous studies on asymmetric volatility and risk-return tradeoff, there is a lack of parallel studies at the sector level for both developed and emerging stock markets. Such assessment at the sector level is crucial for international investors after their choice of countries or markets for better choice of portfolio diversification and allocation of financial resources.","[Al Refai, Hisham; Eissa, Mohamed Abdelaziz; Zeitun, Rami] Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Doha, Qatar",Qatar University,"Eissa, MA (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Doha, Qatar.",m.eissa@qu.edu.qa,,", Rami/0000-0003-4765-2121",,,,,54,9,9,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Consuming such products and services contradicts the modern paradigm of sustainable consumption. However, luxury vendors are frequently introducing new technologies and better working conditions on a large scale, including natural colors and fair treatment of labor in the fashion industry, as well as fully electric-fueled cars, which Tesla has been producing. Previous research suggests that luxury and sustainability are incompatible. The values underlying sustainability are altruism, restraint, and moderation, whereas the main components of luxury are hedonism, aestheticism, uniqueness, affluence, and surplus. The motives of luxury consumers are likely to vary with their cultural framing. Compared with individualists, members of collectivistic cultures have been known to behave more prosocially. However, they are also more prone to buying luxury goods to enhance their status. This study examines whether the motives of dominance or prestige status encourage individuals from collectivistic societies to choose more luxurious or sustainable products, respectively. This study provides evidence from more than 200 experiments with collectivists and individualists, and it introduces distinctiveness between dominance-and prestige-seeking behaviors via underlying status motives in prosocial or luxury-product choices that previous research has not differentiated. Our results underline the association of status motives with individualistic and collectivistic cultures. Previous research shows that ethical issues are not considered in luxury-buying decisions, even though many luxury companies have developed corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs and offer new sustainable luxury products. Additionally, they increasingly inform the public about their prosocial activities. This is most likely the result of the positioning of conspicuousness that negatively influences purchase intentions of sustainable luxury products. Therefore, avoiding conspicuous strategies in marketing is one of the managerial implications of this study.","[Aliyev, Farhad; Wagner, Ralf] Univ Kassel, Moncheberg St, D-34125 Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Aliyev, F (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Moncheberg St, D-34125 Kassel, Germany.",aliyev@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de; rwagner@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de,"Wagner, Ralf/D-1389-2010",,,,,,43,2,2,0,23,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,585,594,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800045,0

As to Anhalt [1], the most significant brand communicator is tourism and, on the other hand, tourism is the sector that benefits the most from a good branding campaign and a positive image. The image of countries is often represented with touristic landscape, which proves the power of tourism in influencing a country image. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to disclose how tourism can build a national identity and how this national identity can become a nation brand. In order to achieve this objective, the case of Croatia will be studied more in depth, as the service sector has a 70% share of Croatia's GDP, with tourism accounting for roughly 20%, meaning that tourism plays a significant role in Croatia's development [2].","[Ana, Maria-Irina; Andrei, Anca-Georgiana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ana, MI (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ana.mariairina@yahoo.com; anca.georgiana.andrei@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,4,FILODIRITTO PUBLISHER,BOLOGNA,"INFOROMATICA SRL, VIA CASTIGLIONE, 81, BOLOGNA, 40124, ITALY",,,978-88-95922-97-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,15,20,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6KN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426793600002,0

Our Green Sentiment Index, based on online search activities, reflects societal environmental awareness in various regions of the United States over time. Using Google Trends data and a count regression approach, we identify a significant positive influence of both green sentiment and green policies on the registration of LEED properties. The findings suggest that increased green sentiment softens governmental policy and procurement, as well as corporate investment decisions. This approach can aid corporate actors and policymakers to meet both social demand and political objectives for increasing the prevalence of green buildings.","[Braun, Thomas; Cajias, Marcelo; Hohenstatt, Ralf] Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Braun, T (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",thomas.braun@irebs.de; marcelo.cajias@irebs.de; ralf.hohenstatt@irebs.de,"Cajias, Marcelo/J-4937-2014",,,,,,67,16,16,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0896-5803,2691-1175,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

We find that share repurchases make prices more efficient and reduce idiosyncratic risk. Further analyses reveal that the effects are primarily driven by repurchases in down markets. We conclude that share repurchases help to maintain accurate stock prices by providing price support at fundamental values. We find no evidence that managers use share repurchases to manipulate stock prices when selling their equity holdings or exercising stock options.,"[Busch, Pascal; Obernberger, Stefan] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Obernberger, S (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",obernberger@ese.eur.nl,,,Rudolph von Bennigsen-Foerder-Foundation; Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Mannheim,Rudolph von Bennigsen-Foerder-Foundation; Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Mannheim,"We thank Jacopo Bizzotto, Dion Bongaerts, Thomas Boulton, Philipp Geiler, Alexander Hillert, Thomas Keusch, Olga Lebedeva, Mike Mao, Stefan Ruenzi, Christoph Schneider, Michael Ungeheuer, and Patrick Verwijmeren for advice on this project and seminar participants at the 12th Corporate Finance Day, 12th International Paris Finance Meeting, Copenhagen Business School, Erasmus University Rotterdam, German Finance Association Conference 2014, Georgia State University, IFABS Oxford Corporate Finance Conference 2015, and University of Mannheim for fruitful discussions and helpful comments.

If ordoliberalism fought against Marxism and historicism, it also inherits some of their research agenda: for instance, in their historical reading of liberalism, which stresses the irrepressible rent-seeking behaviour of private agents as a driven force for institutional change. Ordoliberalism nevertheless reinvests the issue of power through a liberal response that finally comes close to the Walrasian neoclassical tradition. In doing so, the ordoliberal thought emphasizes the defence of the competitive order, leading them to a particular meaning of competition mechanism as a disempowerment tool of economic power.","[Fevre, Raphael] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Etud Interdisciplinaires Walras Pareto, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Fevre, Raphael] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France",University of Lausanne; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Fèvre, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Ctr Etud Interdisciplinaires Walras Pareto, Lausanne, Switzerland.;Fèvre, R (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France.",raphael.fevre@gmail.com,,,,,,,120,2,2,0,3,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We made this determination through the use of a semi-endogenous research and development growth model that reflects international trade, footloose capital, and local knowledge spillover. Regional income inequality -defined here as differences in per-capita expenditure relative to the price index-decreases in the former scenario following globalization, as the northern share of expenditure does not change. This lack of change stems from there being a constant and exogenous growth rate. Additionally, the northern price index does not change, even as the southern price index decreases.","[Fukuda, Katsufumi] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Higashihiroshima, Japan; [Fukuda, Katsufumi] Kobe Univ, RIEB, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Hiroshima University; Kobe University,"Fukuda, K (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Higashihiroshima, Japan.;Fukuda, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, RIEB, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",katsuhi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Fukuda, Katsufumi/AAF-8667-2019; fukuda, katsufumi/I-2507-2016","fukuda, katsufumi/0000-0002-6624-5233",,,,,19,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

It has been proven that Internet has become an important tool to provide information during consumer purchase decision journey. Part of it is a so-called electronic word of mouth (eWOM) communication which allows consumers to access and exchange information, to share opinions through different networks, social groups and other tools. This information which consumers spread by the help of social networks, recommendation systems and other eWOM communication tools is one from many factors which influence consumer purchase decision. Research done in other countries does show that the influence of eWOM communication is increasing fast. Still, the authors' experience has shown that companies in Latvia are not yet utilising the full potential of available eWOM communication tools and there is also limited research done on consumers' attitude towards eWOM in Latvia. Therefore, the aim of the paper is - to evaluate different eWOM communication factors' influence on consumer purchase decision, to understand an importance and specifics of those factors in Latvia. To achieve the aim, the authors have defined following tasks for the paper: 1) to explore what does so far realised scientific research has found out about eWOM communication influence on consumer purchase decision process; 2) to assess how eWOM is perceived by consumers in Latvia by measuring customer perceived eWOM credibility, eWOM experience, susceptibility to interpersonal influence (CSII) and eWOM effects. Research methods used are consumer survey gathering primary data and examining user attitudes towards eWOM and secondary data analysis which reviews scientific research results in this specific field. Research results contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the eWOM effect in Latvia. Results provide suggestions for entrepreneurs and marketing specialists in Latvia.","[Gaitniece, Elina; Batraga, Anda; Viksne, Kaspars] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Gaitniece, E (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,36,2,2,0,14,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,215,223,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400022,0

We argue that Delaware corporate law attracts firms with particular financial and governance characteristics. We find that Delaware attracts growth firms in industries with more takeover activity. Delaware firms have smaller boards, and their directors are paid more and serve on more boards. In addition, Delaware firms attract greater institutional ownership. We also provide a bottom-line test of the race-to-the-bottom hypothesis by examining forced CEO turnover. After controlling for differences in firm characteristics, we find that firms incorporated in Delaware are more likely to terminate CEOs. We also find that that termination decision is less sensitive to poor performance. Overall, we see no clear pattern supporting the race to the bottom hypothesis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While human resources investment is important in improving audit quality, few studies have examined this association mainly because public data about human resources investment and financial statements of audit firms are unavailable. Using two proxies for audit quality (i.e. discretionary accruals and accounting conservatism), we provide evidence that higher compensation in audit firms improves audit quality. In addition, we find higher audit quality in audit firms with higher education expenses, when audit quality is measured by the level of conservatism of clients' financial statements. These results support regulators' stance that quality control through human resources investment in audit firms can effectively improve audit quality and therefore the quality of clients' financial reporting. However, we find no association between education expenses and the average absolute value of discretionary accruals of audit clients. These results generally suggest that direct investment in human capital (i.e. compensation) is more effective in improving audit quality than indirect investment in human capital (i.e. education expenses).","[Kang, Minjung] Incheon Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Incheon, South Korea; [Lee, Ho-Young] Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Son, Myungsoo] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Stein, Michael] Old Dominion Univ, Strome Coll Business, Norfolk, VA USA",Incheon National University; Yonsei University; California State University System; California State University Fullerton; Old Dominion University,"Lee, HY (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea.",hylee@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Incheon National University,Incheon National University,This work was supported by the Incheon National University Research Grant in 2015.,,59,10,10,3,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The authors set two main tasks: to construct a theoretical model, describing the tax benefit effect on financial contribution to the charitable sector, and to find the optimal limit for charitable spending, as a part of expenses reducing the taxable profit of the company. The authors concluded that there is the hypothetical possibility of increasing charitable donations as the result of introducing preferential taxation. The optimal limit of charitable expenses for tax purposes is up to 5% of the taxable profit.

As a result, Tencent targets on payment sector, and penetrates into this sector through forming subsidiaries, and pays significant efforts in deposits and lending markets through investments. Meanwhile, Tencent positions the remaining Internet finance sectors as supportive services, thus initiating a series of trials though different levels and types of cooperation with traditional financial institutes.

Moreover, there is persistent concern that biofuels compete with food production and that increasing biofuels prices lead to an increase of the agricultural commodity prices. Therefore, the main goal of the paper is to assess the links between biofuel production and food-commodity prices in Brazilian market. Brazil is the world's largest sugarcane ethanol producer and a pioneer in using ethanol as a motor fuel. In particular, we focus on assessing the links between ethanol and selected food-commodity prices (sugar, corn, wheat) serving as ethanol feedstock. Methodological approach, based on co-integration analysis and estimation of a vector error correction model, is applied in order to analyse the relationship between the time series. Our results suggest that corn and wheat prices drive ethanol prices not vice versa; however, there is an evidence of simultaneous relationship between ethanol and sugar prices.","[Lajdova, Zuzana; Kapusta, Jaroslav; Bielik, Peter; Ceryova, Dominika; Dobosova, Ludmila] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Lajdová, Z (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",zuzana.lajdova@gmail.com; 2kapustaspu@gmail.com; peter.bielik@uniag.sk; d.ceryova@gmail.com; DobosovaL@gmail.com,"Bielik, Peter/AAL-5561-2020; Čeryová, Dominika/AAL-5526-2020; Bullová, Tatiana/AAL-6756-2020",,Grant Agency SUA in Nitra [04-GA SPU-16],Grant Agency SUA in Nitra,This work was supported by Grant Agency SUA in Nitra under project no. 04-GA SPU-16.,,19,0,0,2,7,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,182,189,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400024,0

An important reason for such problems is a lack of corresponding standards in the industry.

Therefore, in the submitted paper, we address this actual topic, monitored for several years in the conditions of the Slovak Republic. However, the truth is that the political representatives do not give the local self-administration and especially the problems accompanied with it, an appropriate amount of attention. In this context, we aim our attention mainly at limits of the local self-administration that we see mostly in the excessive fragmentation of the settlement structure of the country. An inappropriate settlement structure is, however, only one of the determiners of an incorrectly functioning self-administration, considering our inability to find a universal key to solving the problems of cities and municipalities. Generally, we can state that an efficient and relatively well-functioning local self-administration is a result of a correct setting of size structure of a territorial unit and also willingness of the political elite to accede to a change of the current situation. The goal of the submitted paper is to point out an acute need to hold a professional and public discussion about (non)current problems of local self-administrations in individual regions of Slovakia through a qualitative analysis of an optimal structure of local self-administration.","[Machyniak, Jan; Horvath, Peter] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Social Sci, Bucianska 4-A, Trnava 91701, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Machyniak, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Social Sci, Bucianska 4-A, Trnava 91701, Slovakia.",jan.machyniak@ucm.sk; peter.horvath@ucm.sk,"Horváth, Peter/AAS-6828-2020","Horváth, Peter/0000-0001-9117-7247; Machyniak, Jan/0000-0003-0747-0286",[KEGA 017UCM-4/2017],,This paper was created within the project: KEGA 017UCM-4/2017 - Dynamika premien politickeho systemu SR,,16,0,0,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

The research subjects are not leaders considered as flesh-and-blood human beings, but rather the images of people perceived as leaders and their impact in the process of societal sensemaking. The paper addresses the role of the process of image construction and re-construction, as it then allows the individual to define what was noticed, categorize it within interpretative schemes, and understand reality as a distinct reflection of events. The image is studied using qualitative methods and techniques. The results indicate that although the literature on image management mostly emphasizes the role of impression management, the image of a leader is determined by social expectations. Therefore, the dynamics within the environment do not simply force the maintenance of the adapted perception of organizational identity, but rather the active management and development of identities throughout image process creation. Finally, it is argued the concept of a leader is masculinized and there is no universal scheme for building a leader's image.","[Majczyk, Julita] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Majczyk, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Majczyk, Julita/AAA-8170-2021","Majczyk, Julita/0000-0003-4166-4981",,,,,64,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-405-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,37.0,,,,,,49,67,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ9PC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429699600003,0

First, government long-term spending plans are based on domestic sources, treating aid as an additional source of revenue. Second, both grants and loans are positively related to tax revenue. Third, aid is positively associated with spending, with a particularly strong relation between capital expenditure and grants.

They use it as a tool for organizational learning, betting in knowledge acquisition as a continuous improvement process. A learning organization is an organization that can incorporate new knowledge and skills in its own structures and processes. This means that a learning organization is also an organization that is continuously increasing its intellectual capital (IC). An increase in IC is generally acknowledged as a cause for an increase of innovation capabilities. So, learning organizations are expected to increase its innovation capabilities either directly or indirectly through IC. The purpose of this paper is to investigate possible relationships between learning capability, innovation capability and intellectual capital increasing in learning organizations. The data used in this paper expresses the perceptions from 60 Portuguese SME's innovation managers, collected from a sample of SME's, analysed with multivariate data analysis techniques, as biplots and PLS to estimate structural equations models. Although the results are encouraging, suggesting causal relationships between organizational learning, innovation and intellectual capital, it should not be forgotten that the conclusions are based not in the measurement of physical and economic variables but in opinions and perceptions of specialists that may suffer from eventual biases due to their functions as innovation managers.

We estimate income poverty using imputed household income relative to the adjusted poverty line and asset poverty using a regression-based asset index and tropical livestock units (TLU) per capita. Our results indicate that keeping livestock is still the pastoralists' main source of livelihood, although there is a notable trend of increasing livelihood diversification, especially among livestock-poor households. The majority of households (over 70%) are both income and livestock-poor with few having escaped poverty within the five-year study period. Disaggregating income and asset poverty also reveals an increasing trend of both structurally poor and stochastically nonpoor households. The findings show that the TLU-based asset poverty is a more appropriate measure of asset poverty in a pastoral setting.","[Mburu, Samuel; Otterbach, Steffen; Sousa-Poza, Alfonso] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Hlth Care & Publ Management, Stuttgart, Germany; [Mburu, Samuel; Mude, Andrew] ILRI, Index Based Livestock Insurance IBLI Project, Nairobi, Kenya",University Hohenheim; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Mburu, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Hlth Care & Publ Management, Stuttgart, Germany.;Mburu, S (通讯作者)，ILRI, Index Based Livestock Insurance IBLI Project, Nairobi, Kenya.",mburusam@yahoo.com,,"Sousa-Poza, Alfonso/0000-0002-6524-9654",DFID [202619-101]; United States Agency for International Development [EDH-A-00-06-0003-00]; World Bank Group [7156906],DFID; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); World Bank Group,This work was supported by the DFID [202619-101]; United States Agency for International Development [EDH-A-00-06-0003-00]; World Bank Group [7156906].,,30,11,11,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The article considers the changes in such macro-indicators as benchmark interest rates, the curve of zero-coupon yield, government stock rates spread and inflation-adjusted money supply. In so doing, the article compares these indicators with their American analogues. The main point was to study the way the indicators were changing, the accuracy of their reflecting the economic situation and whether they should be applied to the Russian economy on the basis of foreign experience (for example, the Index of Leading Indicators published by the Conference Board). This issue has been in the focus of Russian and foreign authors as they try to construct the system of economic forecasting. The revealing of these forecasting instruments is a difficult process allowing for the significant number of various indicators and differing market conditions. As a result of the study, the authors uncovered that some of the proposed indicators reflect basic changes in economy as well they have significant forecasting abilities and can be 1-2 quarters ahead of the general situation on the market.","[Mikhailovna, Grigorieva Elena; Sergeevich, Valkov Dmitry] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Dept Finance & Credit, Moscow, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Mikhailovna, GE (通讯作者)，Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Dept Finance & Credit, Moscow, Russia.",Grigoryeva_Elena@rudn.university; dm.valkov91@gmail.com,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [02.A03.21.0008],"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)",The publication was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (Agreement No 02.A03.21.0008).,,14,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,234,240,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600040,0

This essay broadens the debate by arguing that states' latent fiscal weakness is an important source of enduring rebellious grievance in the Arab World. The essay makes this claim through a comparison of fiscal decline and policy response in Jordan and Egypt. Both states have endured fiscal crises and periodic revolt starting in the late 1970s. Both regimes attempted to manage deepening fiscal weakness through similar coping policies, searching for new sources of revenue and revising public spending. These measures failed to reverse the decline. Instead, new sources of revenue and shifts in spending deepened inequality in new ways, lowered capacities to curtail public-private corruption, and entrenched labour insecurity. In other words, it is the politics of fiscal weakness which explain the prominence of socio-economic grievance voiced before, during, and after 2011.","[Moore, Pete W.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 11201 Euclid Ave,Room 111, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Moore, PW (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 11201 Euclid Ave,Room 111, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",pwm10@case.edu,,,,,,,83,7,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The results show that the legal assurance of slum residents' occupancy of their lands could benefit them. Previous studies have discussed the legal and non-legal factors that substantially influence the tenure security of residents in informal settlements; however, it remains unclear how and to what extent the assignment of legal property rights through the formalization of land tenure improves the tenure security of residents in informal settlements and living conditions, even in the presence of other legal and non-legal factors that also contribute to their tenure security. To address this question, this study focuses on the city of Pune, India, where government agencies have formalized slums by legally ensuring the occupancy of the residents under the slum declaration. Applying a hedonic price model to an original household survey, this paper investigates how slum residents evaluate formalized land tenure. A spatial econometrics method is also applied to account for spatial dependence and spatially autocorrelated unobserved errors. The spatial hedonic analysis shows that the premium of slum declaration is worth 19.2% of the average housing rent in slums. The associated marginal willingness to pay is equivalent to 6.7% of the average household expenditure, although it is heterogeneous depending on a household's caste and other legal conditions. This finding suggests that the assurance of occupancy rights is a vital component of land-tenure formalization policy even if it does not directly provide full property rights. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Pardede, R; Zahro, S",,,,"Pardede, Raden; Zahro, Shirin",,,Saving not spending: Indonesia's domestic demand problem,BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,economic growth; domestic saving; private consumption,,"Indonesian income per capita has risen rapidly in the past 10 years. The growth in income, combined with an expanding middle class, has corresponded with strong growth in retail sales. Recently, however, this trend has started to change. Consumption growth has been relatively stable, but retail sales are growing more slowly than in the past. In order to develop a clearer picture of consumer spending in Indonesia, we discuss differences in spending behaviour across two income groupslower-middle income and upper-high income. Consumption varies across income groups, so saving and investment patterns may also vary. We find that the upper-high income group, despite having more income than in the past, is less willing to invest and borrow than previously, and that the lower-middle income group continues to suffer from a lack of purchasing power. Meanwhile, investors are simply postponing investments, preferring to take a wait and see' approach. Excess saving can be economically problematic. If effective demand is too weak, it can have negative consequences for long-term economic growth. We begin, however, by surveying recent economic developments in Indonesia, focusing on the third quarter of 2017. Indonesia's current rate of economic growth (5.1% year on year) places it among the world's fastest-growing large economies, but the lack of acceleration is a concern: growth has not exceeded 6.0% since the second quarter of 2012. Despite this lack of acceleration, Indonesia has achieved macroeconomic and financial stability. The balance of payments has been improving since early 2016, with a narrow current account deficitwell below 3.0% of GDPand a surplus trade balance. Exports grew by 17.3% in the third quarter of 2017, owing to rising commodity prices (which boosted export growth in both value and volume), while imports grew by 15.1%, although the impact on economic growth has so far been more moderate than in the commodity boom of 2000-2011. The growth in commodity exports has also benefited Kalimantan, Sumatra, and other commodity-rich regions. However, rising commodity prices come with some caveats. They might boost growth for a short period, but they raise the challenge of making this growth sustainable. We have seen this many times in the past. Increasing institutional capacity to better implement policy initiatives, for one, will help to deliver sustainable, high-quality economic growth. Pendapatan per kapita Indonesia telah naik pesat selama 10 tahun terakhir. Peningkatan pendapatan yang diiringi bertambah besarnya kelas menengah mendorong pertumbuhan yang kuat di sektor penjualan ritel. Namun demikian, belakangan ini tren tersebut mulai berubah. Pertumbuhan konsumsi berjalan cukup stabil, namun penjualan ritel berjalan lebih lambat dibandingkan sebelumnya. Untuk memberi gambaran yang lebih jelas mengenai belanja konsumsi di Indonesia, penulis membahas perbedaan pola belanja dua kelompok pendapatan, yakni kelas menengah bawah dan kelas menengah atas. Karena konsumsi bervariasi antarkelompok pendapatan, maka pola tabungan dan investasi juga memiliki perbedaan. Kami menemukan bahwa kelompok pendapatan menengah atas, sekalipun memiliki lebih banyak pendapatan dibandingkan di masa lampau, lebih resisten untuk berinvestasi dan mengambil kredit pinjaman dibandingkan sebelumnya; sementara kelompok menengah bawah mengalami penurunan daya beli. Di lain pihak, investor menunda penanaman modalnya, sembari memilih untuk menunggu dan melihat arah dan perkembangan situasi. Kelebihan tabungan ini dapat menjadi problematik secara ekonomi: apabila permintaan efektif terlalu lemah, ia dapat membawa konsekuensi negatif bagi pertumbuhan ekonomi jangka panjang di Indonesia. Penulis terlebih dahulu melakukan observasi atas perkembangan terkini di Indonesia, berfokus pada triwulan ketiga tahun 2017. Tingkat pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia saat ini (5,1% yoy) menempatkannya di tengah-tengah negara besar dengan pertumbuhan ekonomi tercepat. Sekalipun demikian, tingkat akselerasinya tetap menjadi tantangan tersendiri: pertumbuhan ekonomi tak kunjung melampaui 6% sejak kuartal kedua tahun 2012. Namun terlepas dari kurangnya percepatan, Indonesia telah mencapai stabilitas makroekonomi dan keuangan. Neraca pembayaran menunjukkan defisit transaksi berjalan jauh di bawah 3% PDB disertai surplus dalam neraca perdagangan. Ekspor bertumbuh sebesar 17,3% pada triwulan ketiga tahun 2017 berkat naiknya harga-harga komoditas yang menaikkan pertumbuhan ekspor dari sisi nilai maupun volume, sedangkan impor bertumbuh 15,1%, meski dampaknya pada pertumbuhan ekonomi cenderung moderat jika dibandingkan dengan masa ledakan komoditas pada 2000-2011. Pertumbuhan pada ekspor komoditas telah berdampak baik bagi Kalimantan, Sumatera, dan daerah-daerah lain yang berlimpah komoditas. Namun demikian, naiknya harga-harga komoditas ini juga membawa tantangan: ia dapat menaikkan pertumbuhan untuk jangka pendek, namun perlu upaya keras untuk membuatnya berkelanjutan, seperti yang telah kita alami beberapa kali di masa lampau. Menambah kapasitas institusi untuk memperbaiki implementasi dari beberapa inisiatif kebijakan, adalah salah satu cara untuk menjadikan pertumbuhan ekonomi lebih berkualitas dan berkelanjutan.","[Pardede, Raden; Zahro, Shirin] CReco Res Inst, Jakarta, Indonesia",,"Pardede, R (通讯作者)，CReco Res Inst, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,15,7,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Using 199.516 firm year observations from 11 Euro zone and 8 Asian countries over the period 2000-2014, the findings confirm all research hypotheses. The results show that the cost of capital is lower in years after the adoption of IFRS as compared to the period before the adoption in Euro zone and Asian countries. A significant negative association has been found between the cost of equity capital and earnings quality in Euro zone and Asian countries. However, earnings quality is negatively correlated with cost of debt only in Euro zone countries. Similarly, the findings indicate that there is a significantly negative relationship between the cost of capital and most investor protection indexes in Euro zone and Asian countries. With regard to the joint effects of investor protection, earnings quality and IFRS adoption on the cost of capital, the results are controversial.

The majority of victims in the riot were Muslim labourers from the lower-caste groups, and the alleged perpetrators were members of the relatively prosperous Hindu Jat households. This paper deals with how the leadership and membership of a new farmers' movement' - the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) - actively internalized, and helped entrench, a communal discourse that preceded the riots. It argues that the reasons for why the identity of a Hindu' prevailed over the class-neutral identity of a farmer' during the riots can be traced to the ways in which the BKU has historically sought to culturally construct the identity of a farmer'. The political intermediation of the traditional institution of khaps is highlighted as central to this process. Khaps played a major role in spreading and sustaining a communal discourse and preparing the ground for the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013.","[Ramakumar, R.] Tata Inst Social Sci, Sch Dev Studies, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",Tata Institute of Social Sciences,"Ramakumar, R (通讯作者)，Tata Inst Social Sci, Sch Dev Studies, Bombay, Maharashtra, India.",rr@tiss.edu,"R, Ramakumar/AGE-3501-2022",,"National Centre for Competence for Research (NCCR North-South), Switzerland","National Centre for Competence for Research (NCCR North-South), Switzerland","For reading and commenting on a first draft of the paper, acknowledgements are due to Subhashini Ali, Urs Geiser, John Harriss, Ritambhara Hebbar, Andrea Iff, Divya Singh Kohli, Staffan Lindberg, Stig Toft Madsen and two anonymous referees of this Journal.

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the asymmetric effects of CZK/EUR exchange rate on the most important segment of Czechia's foreign trade. The results of the study shows, that exchange rate co-movement with partial trade balances is mostly proved by employment both applied approaches. However, the asymmetry cointegration approach, which introduces nonlinearity into the model specification, reveals a more significant impact of the exchange rate on commodity trade between Czechia and its most important trading partner than a more standard model that imposes symmetry.","[Simakova, Jana] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Simáková, J (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",simakova@opf.slu.cz,"Šimáková, Jana/ABF-8573-2020","Šimáková, Jana/0000-0002-4194-9971","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization","Publication of this paper was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2016.

The former prescribed in seismic design codes and prevention counter plans, played a great role in earthquake disaster reduction of China in decades. In the latter, the economy, finance, society are very active in market system, and must be paid more attention. The systemof seismic risk management in China is summarized in this paper. Nowadays, it is on the transition stage, from the planned economy system to the market system. The status of earthquake insurance is briefly introduced and catastrophe insurance derivatives are suggested as supplements. The important issue in the pricing of financial instruments is how to integrate with engineering seismic risk assessment. Seismic risk assessment in general consists of two parts: seismic hazard assessment and vulnerability evaluation. Seismic hazard has many sectors such as on ground motion, surface faulting, liquefaction, landslides, remained deformation. Vulnerability evaluation is to infer a conditional probability of the potential damage of engineering structure given various earthquake intensities. Other financial instruments can also be used for reference in the management system, for example, mitigation loans and tax rebate. Banks and financial institutions can provide financial support to the property owners who have adopted cost-effective engineering mitigation measures. To encourage the adoption, a homeowner can get a rebate on taxes if he has adopted an engineering measure against earthquake damage.","[Tao Zhengru] China Earthquake Adm, Inst Engn Mech, Key Lab Earthquake Engn & Engn Vibrat, Harbin 150080, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Tao Xiaxin] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","China Earthquake Administration; Institute of Engineering Mechanics, CEA; Harbin Institute of Technology","Tao, ZR (通讯作者)，China Earthquake Adm, Inst Engn Mech, Key Lab Earthquake Engn & Engn Vibrat, Harbin 150080, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",taozr@foxmail.com; taoxiaxin@aliyun.com,"Tao, Zhengru/AAF-4428-2019","Tao, Zhengru/0000-0001-6580-0015",,,,,9,0,0,0,2,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,301,307,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700021,0

Most guerrilla activity, armed confrontations and civilian fatalities occurred in Andean rural districts. The intensity of violence declined following the detention of PCP-SL General Secretary Abimael Guzman and other leading cadres in 1992-3, which resulted in the dismantling of a substantial component of the organization's military apparatus and support networks. This paper examines how surviving PCP-SL militants attempted to regroup and respond strategically and tactically to such a devastating setback, focusing on its dealings with the civilian population, particularly coca-producing smallholders. Counter-insurgency measures pursued by the Peruvian state are also analysed. The paper concludes with an assessment of the current disposition of guerrilla - rural population - state relations in the main areas of conflict.","[Taylor, Lewis] Univ Liverpool, Sch Hist Languages & Cultures, Chatham St, Liverpool L69 7ZR, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Taylor, L (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Hist Languages & Cultures, Chatham St, Liverpool L69 7ZR, Merseyside, England.",ltaylor@liv.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,18,21,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Design/methodology/approach - In the understanding that greater attention to different institutional settings and their diversity has much to offer theory-building in the IB area, this panel study examines the influence of institutional distance on the return on assets (ROA) of 399 foreign subsidiaries in a previously understudied host market, that of Brazil during the period from 2008 to 2011. Regression analysis was carried out on panel data using weighted least squares as estimator. Findings - Similar to research conducted in other national contexts, results revealed significant correlation between institutional distance and firm performance measured by ROA. Unlike previous research, however, these correlations were positive: the greater the institutional distance, the better the performance. Both normative distance and regulatory distance positively influenced ROA, raising questions with regard to the concept of institutional distance, its operationalization and influence. Originality/value - The paper is of value in showing the institutional distance and the performance of foreign subsidiaries with a positive relationship in an emerging market (Brazil) using a panel perspective rather than the more usual sectional perspective.","[Thome, Karim Marini; Medeiros, Janann Joslin] Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Thome, Karim Marini] Handelshogskolan Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden; [Hearn, Bruce A.] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Universidade de Brasilia; University of Sussex,"Thome, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.;Thome, KM (通讯作者)，Handelshogskolan Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden.",thome@unb.br,"Thomé, Karim Marini/AAK-6709-2021; Medeiros, Janann J/E-5105-2013; Hearn, Bruce/IXD-8027-2023","Thomé, Karim Marini/0000-0003-2701-5643; Hearn, Bruce/0000-0001-9767-0198",,,,,74,15,15,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Related indices are first calculated to examine whether investor sentiments are contagious among stock investors. Next, optimistic and pessimistic sentiments are differentiated to examine how each of them diffuses in the market. Finally, an index of dynamic sentiment spillover is estimated to investigate the diffusion effect of institutional investor sentiment under varying market performance. The results of this study confirm that, under favorable market performance when institutional investors are optimistic, the diffusion effect of investor sentiment is nonsignificant. By contrast, the diffusion effect of pessimistic sentiment is significant, indicating that investor sentiment contagion is asymmetric.","[Tsai, I-Chun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung,"Tsai, IC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",ictsai@nuk.edu.tw,"Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018","Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327",,,,,31,23,25,19,135,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

There are different ways to build an intelligent organization. This article focuses on risk analysis as one of the pillars of raising the intelligence of an enterprise. The purpose of this paper is to show how risk analysis can be the basis for building and developing a smart organization model within an enterprise. The basic research method is an in-depth personal interview, based on case study of UniGlass Polska Sp. z o.o. The choice of the enterprise for the study was deliberate - the selection criterion was the company's intelligence level and the availability of data and the ability to conduct an in-depth interview with the management staff of the company. The interview was conducted during May and June 2017 period using a standardized questionnaire. The study indicated that building and improving the intelligent organization model should be systemic and include both the business model and its relationship with the wider environment. The systemic approach gives rise to the deployment and development of integrated risk management in the enterprise, which enables a holistic perception of the risk factors that influence the building and improvement of the intelligent organization model. The case study used a risk map tool to identify the key risk areas for a company's business (both the opportunities to be strengthened and the risk factors to be weakened), ranging from least impacted areas to areas with the greatest impact.","[Wereda, Wioletta; Wozniak, Jacek] Mil Univ Technol, 2 Kaliskiego St, PL-00908 Warsaw, Poland",Military University of Technology in Warsaw,"Wereda, W (通讯作者)，Mil Univ Technol, 2 Kaliskiego St, PL-00908 Warsaw, Poland.",wioletta.wereda@wat.edu.pl; jacekj.wozniak@wat.edu.pl,"Woźniak, Jacek/ABB-2430-2020; Wereda, Wioletta/ABC-1459-2020","Woźniak, Jacek/0000-0001-7592-0109; Wereda, Wioletta/0000-0002-6948-0239",,,,,41,0,0,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,477,495,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800037,0

Simulation has been used as a methodology to analyse the impact of batching on bullwhip in rice industry of Pakistan. Two cases of the rice industry have been chosen as a sample. The contribution of this research is two-fold. Firstly, the current research is an extension of a study by Hussain and Drake (2011) that analyses the relationship between batch size and bullwhip effect as non-monotonic, whereby the size of the remainder of quotient determines the value of bullwhip effect. Secondly, the batch size has less frequently been studied in the context of bullwhip effect; hence the researcher has extended strength to the existing supply chain model. It has been found that the relationship between batch size and demand amplification is non linear. It cannot be said that reducing the batch size will minimize the bullwhip effect. Batch size larger than average demand does not result in bullwhip effect. In other words, variance of the order quantity is smaller than the variance of demand, which leads to anti-bullwhip or dewhips effect. This study will help the practitioners and supply chain managers to control the bullwhip produced by batching effect across multi-echelon supply chains. However, this study has been based on two tier supply chain while in reality supply chain has got many tiers. Hence, this study can be extended across more than two tier supply chains.","[Yousaf, Shoaib] Int Islamic Univ, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Hussain, Matloub] Abu Dhabi Univ, POB 59911, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","International Islamic University, Pakistan; Abu Dhabi University","Yousaf, S (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ, Islamabad, Pakistan.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-405-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,37.0,,,,,,162,171,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ9PC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429699600010,0

This economic relationship, which we termed 'Chimerica' in 2007, seemed likely to end as a result of the global financial crisis. Yet this did not happen. In this paper, we examine the evolution of Chimerica in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and explain how the stimulus policies of both the U.S. and China have contributed to its survival. We show how stimulus policies helped change Chimerica from a marriage of opposites to a marriage of equals. We then explain why this marriage is now destined for strife, in the form of a trade war between the U.S. and China. The consequences of such a trade war would deeply impact the global economy. We believe constructive negotiations on trade rebalancing and policy coordination are therefore needed to avoid a disruptive end to Chimerica.","[Ferguson, Niall] Hoover Inst War Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xu, Xiang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Xu, X (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",seanxuxiang@126.com,,"Xu, Xiang/0000-0003-2566-5933",,,,,11,1,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

There has been a recent push for conservation organizations to adopt project selection optimization approaches such as binary linear programming. The metrics used to measure the benefits of a project however, are often poorly defined in that they do not directly compute a value. These scores represent normalized measurements of underlying values that are likely log-normally distributed. Applying such metrics in optimization will tend to undervalue high-benefit projects and select a suboptimal portfolio of projects relative to simpler approaches. This suboptimal performance can lead to losses in efficiency as high as 30%. We propose a hybrid optimization heuristic that can improve performance and, additionally, provide conservation professionals with more flexibility and freedom to select conservation projects at their discretionpotentially overcoming a substantial real-world adaptation hurdle.","[Fooks, Jacob R.] Econ Res Serv, Conservat & Environm Branch, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave,SW Mail Stop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Messer, Kent D.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE USA; [Kecinski, Maik] Univ Alberta, Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Delaware; University of Alberta,"Fooks, JR (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, Conservat & Environm Branch, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave,SW Mail Stop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",jacob.fooks@ers.usda.gov; messer@udel.edu; kecinski@ualberta.ca,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020",,,,,,66,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We estimate loadings in the U.S. banking system over the course of the last 36 years; we find that they have considerably increased over time and identify four major regimes. Our measure shows that systemic risk became critical in the last of our four regimes, covering the most recent time period from 05/2007 to 09/2016.

The analysis is based on a newly created index of structural modernisation. For each country, the index calculates the productivity gap with respect to the world frontier in activities that typically represent the modern sector of the economy, and weights this relative productivity by the employment share of those activities in the total labour force. The index is calculated for 114 countries from 1960 to 2014. A country is defined as trapped if it takes longer than a benchmark period to move from one income category to another. The analysis shows that expansion of the size of the modern sector without a process of absorption of technology for reducing the technology gap is not enough to ensure steady growth. Inversely, reducing the technology gap in just few sectors will produce an enclave economy that is doomed to stagnate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis delivers some new results on the role of guarantees in the bank sovereign nexus. First, guarantees emerge as a key channel linking banks' and sovereign stability, even in the absence of banks' holdings of sovereign bonds. Second, depending on the specific characteristics of the economy and the nature of banking crises, an increase in the size of guarantees can be beneficial for the bank-sovereign nexus in that it enhances financial stability without undermining sovereign solvency.

The thesis of the present article is that increasing regulation along with the development of ecological sustainability will lead to higher competitiveness in the Balkan states of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Croatia and Serbia. The effect of basic ecological regulations and management will be shown and analysed both in the region as a whole as well as on a state-by-state basis in terms of national competitiveness, with the correlation between the ecological regulation and competitiveness measured. The time frame reflected is from 2013 to 2017, and a Pearson linear correlation will be applied. In a summary and conclusion, we shall show that regulation plays a prominent role both in reaching ecological sustainability, as well as in the positive development of the Balkan states' competitiveness.","[Marikina, Maria A.] Univ Natl & World Econ, Fac Gen Econ, Dept Econ, Sofia, Bulgaria",University of National & World Economics - Bulgaria,"Marikina, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Natl & World Econ, Fac Gen Econ, Dept Econ, Sofia, Bulgaria.",mmarikina@unwe.eu,,,,,,,26,18,19,0,9,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Rather, it can choose a constrained discretionary regime that has rule-like attributes. To make monetary policy discretion more rule-like, it can be improved by (1) adopting a nominal anchor such as an inflation target, a monetary-policy strategy that has proved to be very successful in recent years, and (2) communication of a monetary-policy reaction process, especially through data-based forward guidance, in which the monetary-policy authorities describe how the future policy path will change as economic circumstances change.","[Mishkin, Frederic S.] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,"Mishkin, FS (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA.",fsm3@columbia.edu,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We take a fresh look at the issue by considering the sale of private as well as social rental housing, allow for differing time trends within the municipality, controlling for area fixed effects, distinguishing between short and long-term impacts and addressing endogeneity of the sale of rental housing.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the moderating effect of social networking relationships on the association between innovative capability (IC) and firm performance in Ghana's hotel industry. Design/methodology/approach Data are collected from managers of 200 registered hotels in the northern region of Ghana. Data were collected by means of a structured questionnaire, with variables measured on a seven-point Likert scale. Findings The findings reveal a mixture of confirmation for the relationships hypothesized in this study. IC influences the financial as well as the operational performance of hotels and guesthouses in Ghana. Social network relationships have a slight tendency to positively impact on business performance. Network relationships with the community leaders enable hotels to gain knowledge from local communities to build its IC. Social networking with political leaders does not moderate the relationship between IC and performance. Originality/value The findings provide empirical support for the viability and performance benefits of developing IC, so as to inform management interventions. It is focused on Sub-Saharan Africa specifically, where managers in the hospitality industry need to find new approaches to develop IC in order to remain competitive. The potential contribution of this study lies in the moderating role that IC plays in the relationship between different types of social networking relationship and performance of hotels.","[Agyapong, Ahmed; Ayuuni, Anastasia Mma] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt & Corp Strategy, Sch Business, Kumasi, Ghana; [Mensah, Henry Kofi] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Dept Human Resources & Org Dev, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Agyapong, A (通讯作者)，Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt & Corp Strategy, Sch Business, Kumasi, Ghana.",deedat31@yahoo.co.uk; hkmensah@knust.edu.gh; mayuuni88@gmail.com,"AGYAPONG, AHMED/AGZ-8178-2022; Mensah, Henry Kofi/M-7986-2015","Mensah, Henry Kofi/0000-0001-7580-8125",,,,,76,16,16,0,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The data do not only contain information on the general feeling to prepare for old age and on specific preparation activities in various domains, but also on risk and time attitudes, family and social altruism, and expected disability and longevity. Half of the sample reports preparing for old age. Future orientation emerges as an important predictor of preparation. While risk attitudes and altruism also matter for preparation, their effect may be less systematic across outcomes than that of general future orientation. Individuals who expect to become disabled or to live longer are more likely to prepare for old age. Policies promoting healthy aging should include messages targeting present-oriented individuals and try to make people more future-oriented.","[Apouey, Benedicte H.] CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Apouey, BH (通讯作者)，CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",benedicte.apouey@psemail.eu,"Apouey, Bénédicte/S-8030-2019","Apouey, Bénédicte/0000-0003-1575-8423","Chaire Transitions Demographiques, Transitions Economiques (TDTE); Harmonie Mutuelle (HM)","Chaire Transitions Demographiques, Transitions Economiques (TDTE); Harmonie Mutuelle (HM)","This work was supported by Chaire Transitions Demographiques, Transitions Economiques (TDTE) hosted by Fondation du Risque.

Assessing quality of employment, beyond the perspective of income, to include other fundamental aspects of jobs - such as whether jobs are secure, provide benefits, or are satisfying - can shed light on the sustainability of these achievements. This is particularly pertinent given the region's current economic slowdown. Using harmonized data for 15 countries in Latin America, this paper connects the role of job quality with the recent process of inclusive growth across the region, and particularly with how individuals worked their way out of poverty. The paper first proposes a multi-dimensional measure for job quality, and then uses this measure to compare job quality across countries and over time. The paper also studies correlates of job quality and the relationship between job quality and poverty. One main finding is that job quality across the region began to increase in 2003. The best predictors of job quality are age, gender, firm size, formal employment, and union membership. Benefits and job satisfaction are the dimensions of job quality that are best correlated with not living in poverty.","[Brummund, Peter] Univ Alabama, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Mann, Christopher] Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Rodriguez-Castelan, Carlos] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; The World Bank,"Brummund, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",pbrummund@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,44,3,4,3,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

However, the gender income gap and the difference in labor force participation persist. Other authors introduced the concept of identity from sociology and social psychology at the economic analysis and, based on this, we search less traditional factors for understanding this persistence. Extending analysis of others, we analyze the impact of gender social norms, focusing on the prescription that a man should earn more than his wife on social and economic results. Based on the Censuses for 1991, 2000, and 2010 we observed that for only 7 percent of married couples does the wife earn more than her husband. We found evidence that the wives with greater probability of earning more than their husbands are less likely to participate in the labor force.

This paper therefore examines whether impacts of health insurance depend on households' access to informal insurance, as proxied for by mobile money usage. Based on high-frequency financial diaries data collected in rural Kenya, we find that households with weaker access to informal insurance cope with uninsured health shocks by lowering subsequent non-health expenditures by approximately 25 percent. These same households are able to smooth consumption when health shocks are insured, due to lower out-of-pocket health expenditures. In contrast, households with access to informal insurance are able to smooth consumption even in the absence of formal health insurance.

Heterogeneity in interest rate pricing also emerged within countries, suggesting that macroeconomic differences were not the only driver of dispersion. Using individual bank data for twelve euro area countries covering almost a decade since the start of the crisis, we identify the balance sheet characteristics that contributed to this fragmentation and document the share of the deviation in interest rates from policy rates that is accounted for by each characteristic. Interest rate pass-through heterogeneity is estimated using an error correction framework that accounts for macroeconomic variation and market structure, and includes standard bank characteristics, such as size, capital and liquidity, as well as variables that capture banks' funding access, risk and asset quality. Results show incomplete pass-through of changes in money market rates targeted by the central bank to firms' lending rates. Sovereign bond yields are shown to affect the cost of finance for firms, particularly in stressed countries and market concentration is associated with smaller reductions in lending rates. With regard to bank characteristics, asset impairment leads to a significant decrease in pass-though. Bank size, as a proxy for market power, and reliance on central bank funding affect pass-through for smaller loans, while capital is more significant for larger loans. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

What is the effect of such trend on the market power of the domestic banks and on competition between them? How do the M&As and bank liquidations affect the banking sector competition? Finally, do the financial crises, and the resultant change in the banking structure increase the power of domestic institutions? We test these questions on a sample of 226 foreign banks' withdrawals, which occurred between 1996 and 2014 in 54 countries. We find that the impact of bank exits on the market power of other banks is non-linear, shaped like a U-curve. We document that the largest increase in market power is when a divested bank accounts for around 10% of market share. After this threshold, the effect diminishes, and banking sector competition increases. In addition, we find that financial crises create opportunities for banks that are probably financially stronger to increase their market power; however, in normal times, all banks participate in a horserace.","[Hryckiewicz, Aneta] Kozminski Univ, Ctr Anal Financial Syst, Econ Inst Empir Anal, Jagiellonska St 57-59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland; [Kozlowski, Lukasz] Kozminski Univ, Dept Banking & Insurance, Jagiellonska St 57-59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University; Kozminski University,"Hryckiewicz, A (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Ctr Anal Financial Syst, Econ Inst Empir Anal, Jagiellonska St 57-59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland.",ahryckiewicz@alk.edu.pl; lkozkowski@alk.edu.pl,"Kozłowski, Łukasz/I-6015-2015; Hryckiewicz, Aneta/AAB-1586-2020","Kozłowski, Łukasz/0000-0002-2887-9067; Hryckiewicz, Aneta/0000-0002-2546-1829",National Science Center [DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/03747],"National Science Center(National Science Centre, Poland)",The project has been funded from National Science Center based on the decision: DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/03747.,,85,5,5,1,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

We find causal evidence that regulators delay interventions before elections. The extent of the delay is larger for elected regulators than regulators appointed by the governor. Interventions by appointed regulators are less likely before competitive gubernatorial elections.

Others are specific i.e. independent from the price: automobile bonus and energy efficiency certificates. We review the arguments for each subsidy type. Compared to specific subsidies, ad valorem ones suffer from four drawbacks: they cause more public spending for a given impact, they distort goods' quality, they benefit more to wealthier households and they encourage more fraud. However, specific subsidy are not without drawbacks either: the fiscal basis must be defined for every type of good and in case of an unexpected drop in the production cost of the subsidised good, the price of the latter risks becoming virtually zero.","[Quirion, Philippe] CIRED, CNRS, Paris, France; [Giraudet, Louis-Gaetan] CIRED, Ecole Ponts ParisTech, Paris, France",Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech,"Quirion, P (通讯作者)，CIRED, CNRS, Paris, France.",quirion@centre-cired.fr; giraudet@centre-cired.fr,"Quirion, Philippe/E-9686-2011",,,,,,13,1,1,1,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We demonstrate that this relationship is moderated by the generational involvement that inverts it in later generations.","[Bacci, Silvia] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Cirillo, Alessandro] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Via R Caggese 1, I-71121 Foggia, Italy; [Mussolino, Donata] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Business Econ, Via Cinthia, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Terzani, Simone] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia; University of Foggia; University of Naples Federico II; University of Perugia,"Cirillo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Via R Caggese 1, I-71121 Foggia, Italy.",silvia.bacci@unipg.it; alessandro.cirillo@unifg.it; donata.mussolino@unina.it; simone.terzani@unipg.it,"CIRILLO, ALESSANDRO/AAF-5984-2021; CIRILLO, ALESSANDRO/AAZ-3520-2020","CIRILLO, ALESSANDRO/0000-0001-5735-0368; BACCI, Silvia/0000-0001-8097-3870",,,,,70,18,18,1,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Many school districts are now considering delaying high school start times to accommodate the sleep schedules of teens. This paper explores whether such policy changes can have an unexpected impact on teen car accident rates. This impact could function both through a direct effect on teen sleep deprivation and indirectly through changes to the driving environment, that is, shifting the lime and conditions under which teens commute to school. By focusing on late-night accidents and employing a difference-in-differences strategy using adult drivers as a control group, I find evidence of a persistent sleep deprivation mechanism. A 15-minute delay in school start time causes a significant decrease in late-night teen accidents of approximately 23%. However, I also find evidence of an opposing mechanism that is present during the morning commuting hours. A 15-minute delay in high school start time leads to a 21% increase in morning teen car accidents.","[Bostwick, Valerie K.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Bostwick, VK (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",vkbostwick@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,2,4,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Before the crisis, banks' local financial conditions did not influence credit availability irrespective of the functional distance (i.e., the distance between bank branch and bank headquarters). However, during the crisis, we find that SMEs with banks within their vicinity that have stronger financial conditions faced greater credit availability when the functional distance is close.

The resulting tension is reflected in Brazilian government policy. The national agrarian reform program has settled farm families in the Amazon region since the 1970s, with the expectation that they will clear forests in order to farm the land. On the other hand, recent Brazilian policy initiatives seek to reduce deforestation to mitigate climate change. We contribute to the policy debate that surrounds these dual goals for the Amazon by estimating the marginal effects of new agricultural land on the full income and assets of farm settlers over a 13-year period from 1996 to 2009. Using micro panel data from agrarian settlements where forest was being rapidly cleared, and controlling for factors that would otherwise confound the relationship, we estimate the effect of converting forest to agriculture on total household income to estimate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our measure of income reflects any re-allocation of resources by utility maximizing households and any productivity effects due to loss of forest ecosystem services. The estimated effect of new agricultural land on income is positive, but small relative to the income per hectare of previously cleared land. However, we show that income increases investment in physical assets, which raises households' income generating capacity and future accumulation of assets. Thus, while there is only a small immediate income gain from clearing more forest, the long-term effects on wealth are still substantial. This demonstrates that given the right conditions, conversion of forest to agricultural land can be an impetus for asset accumulation by smallholders. It also highlights the importance of considering the indirect and long-term welfare benefits of new agricultural land when assessing the opportunity costs of forest conservation.","[Mullan, Katrina] Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Sills, Erin] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27701 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill] Salisbury Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, Salisbury, MD 21804 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill] Salisbury Univ, Environm Studies Dept, Salisbury, MD 21804 USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana; North Carolina State University; Duke University; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University,"Mullan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",katrina.mullan@umontana.edu; sills@nscu.edu; subhrendu.pattanayak@duke.edu; jlcaviglia-harris@salisbury.edu,,"Sills, Erin/0000-0001-8289-0489; Caviglia-Harris, Jill/0000-0001-7860-4857","National Science Foundation [SES-0752936, SES-0452852, SES-0076549]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was funded by the National Science Foundation, under Grants SES-0752936, SES-0452852, SES-0076549.

Within the framework of this study, young adults were asked to respond to a questionnaire dealing with their time preferences in light of changing amounts and delay durations. Some were asked to do a Stroop task beforehand, whereas others performed a similar but simpler task. This research assumes that because the Stroop task requires that the individual reach a decision while overcoming an automatic tendency and an ingrained habit, his or her self-control resources are depleted. As such, when an individual is filling out the questionnaire dealing with time preferences after a Stroop task, his or her ability to avoid automatic tendencies is depleted, making it difficult for him/her to reject the receipt of money in the present. The study found that, in general, individuals having good executive cognitive abilities, namely, those who got the highest scores on the Stroop task, were characterized by a lower rate of subjective discounting. In addition, the research showed a marked difference between those individuals who had experienced depletion and those who had not, in that the depleted individuals tended to demand higher discount rates for having postponed the payment. This means that the depletion of executive-ability resources caused a behavior similar to that of those having the lowest executive abilities. This outcome may attest to the fact that a depletion in the available level of executive abilities in an individual reduces the ability of that individual to overcome his or her natural tendency to prefer the present, thus influencing his or her intertemporal choices.","[Bayer, Ya'akov M.] Beer Sheva Mental Hlth Ctr, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Bayer, Ya'akov M.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Heath Sci, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Osher, Yamima] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva Mental Hlth Ctr, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Osher, Yamima] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, Div Psychiat, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University,"Bayer, YM (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Meath Sci, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Beer Sheva Mental Hlth Ctr, POB 653, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel.",ymebayer@gmail.com,"Bayer, Ya'akov/U-7529-2019; OSHER, YAMIMA/F-1359-2012","Bayer, Yaakov M./0000-0002-3096-261X",,,,,20,6,6,1,27,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

In this paper, we propose an ordinal approach to using data on assets when estimating the wealth of a household (or individual). Using Correspondence Analysis, we derive a ranking of the correlations between the various assets and the first factor, a latent variable assumed to represent the standard of living. We then use this correlation ranking of the assets to derive indices of ordinal inequality that have been recently proposed in the literature. We also use the information on the proportion of individuals holding each type of assets to derive again ordinal measures of inequality in asset ownership. Our empirical analysis, based on data covering the various states of Mexico in 2000 and 2010, shows that the correlation between measures of ordinal inequality in asset ownership derived from correspondence analysis and traditional Gini indices of household income is high, and even higher than that between these Gini indices and ordinal inequality indices based on the percentage ownership of the different assets.","[Berenger, Valerie] Univ Toulon & Var, LEAD, Toulon, France; [Berenger, Valerie] Univ Cote Azur, GREDEG, CNRS, Nice, France; [Deutsch, Joseph; Silber, Jacques] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Silber, Jacques] LISER, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Silber, Jacques] Ctr Camilo Dagum, Tuscan Interuniv Ctr, Adv Stat Equitable & Sustainable Dev, Pisa, Italy; [Soloaga, Isidro] Univ Iberoamer Ciudad Mexico, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universite de Toulon; Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Bar Ilan University; Universidad Iberoamericana Ciudad de Mexico,"Bérenger, V (通讯作者)，Univ Toulon & Var, LEAD, Toulon, France.;Bérenger, V (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur, GREDEG, CNRS, Nice, France.",berenger@univ-tln.fr; jdeutsch@biu.ac.il; jsilber_2000@yahoo.com; isidro.soloaga@ibero.mx,"Soloaga, Isidro/HPF-5745-2023",,,,,,45,1,1,1,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

This contribution is the first to systematically inquire into the factors determining such declarations. We find that constitutions matter and that descriptive statistics indicate that countries without constitutionalized emergency provisions declare states of emergency significantly more often than countries with such provisions. Further analysis shows that it is crucial to distinguish between states of emergency declared as a consequence of a natural disaster from those declared as a consequence of political turmoil. Distinguishing between the costs of declaring an emergency and its benefits, we find that the less costly it is to declare an emergency, the more emergencies will be called on the grounds of natural disasters but not on the grounds of political turmoil. This is, hence, more evidence that constitutions matter. Finally, emergencies based on political turmoil are more likely to be declared if an economic crisis is hitting the country, large natural disasters are more likely to lead to an SOE when more powers are allocated to the legislature, and results suggest that even military coup governments are subject to constitutional constraints.","[Bjornskov, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Bjornskov, Christian] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Voigt, Stefan] Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Johnsallee 35, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Voigt, Stefan] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany",Aarhus University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); University of Hamburg; Ifo Institut,"Bjornskov, C (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",chbj@econ.au.dk; Stefan.Voigt@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,28,23,24,3,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Piped water services in India are generally in the former category, but efforts are underway in some cities to shift to continuous supply. We use a matched-cohort research design to evaluate one such effort: an upgrade to continuous water service in a pilot zone of Hubli-Dharwad, India, while the rest of the city remained on intermittent services. We conducted a survey of similar to 4000 households with four rounds of data collection over 15 months. We evaluated the household-level net benefits, the equity of their distribution, and the affordability of water access under continuous supply. We also evaluated the project at the system-level (household and utility), estimating the net present value of the upgrade and the feasibility of scale-up to the entire city. We found positive net benefits for households overall, but uneven distribution of these benefits across socioeconomic strata. We also found that the costs of supply augmentation, a necessary step for scale-up, significantly reduced the project net present value. The potential for scale-up is thus unclear.

However, institutions are not always binding, and the degree of institutional bindingness varies across contexts. This article examines the bindingness of village elections in China. Through the lens of land expropriation in pe-urban villages and using survey data, we find that institutional bindingness operationalized in terms of the power structure within village leadership strongly shapes the processes and outcomes of land expropriations and therefore the quality of village governance. Moreover, village power structure depends on political bargaining between ordinary villagers and local states. Our findings contribute to the understanding of quasi-democratic institutions in authoritarian regimes by explicitly examining how institutional bindingness affects governance outcomes and how bindingness is endogenously determined.

The study used data from a novel survey, conducted in Mexico, that recorded cognitive and non-cognitive skills and social preferences of both parents and children. It analyzed the relationship between the SES of parents and their children's skills, and found that children's skills were consistently related to parental skills, and that intergenerational persistence of skills was higher for cognitive than for non-cognitive skills or social preferences. It also found that the cognitive skills gap between the first and fifth quintile of SES was related mainly to characteristics like parents' own skills, years of schooling, and aspirations for their children, but that these parental characteristics were less important in explaining non-cognitive skills and preferences.","[Campos-Vazquez, Raymundo M.] El Colegio Mexico, Dept Econ, Camino Ajusco 20,Col Pedregal Santa Teresa, Ciudad De Mexico 10740, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Campos-Vazquez, RM (通讯作者)，El Colegio Mexico, Dept Econ, Camino Ajusco 20,Col Pedregal Santa Teresa, Ciudad De Mexico 10740, Mexico.",rmcampos@colmex.mx,,"Campos-Vazquez, Raymundo M./0000-0003-0251-5051",Sectorial Fund for Research on Social Development of the Mexican National Council on Science and Technology (CONACyT); Secretary of Social Development (SEDESOL) [217909]; Espinosa Yglesias Research Center,Sectorial Fund for Research on Social Development of the Mexican National Council on Science and Technology (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Secretary of Social Development (SEDESOL); Espinosa Yglesias Research Center,This work was supported by the Sectorial Fund for Research on Social Development of the Mexican National Council on Science and Technology (CONACyT) and the Secretary of Social Development (SEDESOL) (Project No. 217909).

The empirical evidence, derived from the application of ordered and bivariate probit regressions (with the use of instruments to address the endogeneity question), suggests that education is positively and significantly related to the self-reported health status of newly arrived immigrants. The probability of reporting excellent, very good, or good health was 37 percent higher for immigrants who had more than high school education than for those with only high school education or less. This study goes one step further to investigate the role of education in changes in health status in the first four years after arrival. In that regard, the study finds that those with post-secondary education were more likely to maintain the state of health reported on entry if it was good, very good, or excellent and more likely to improve it if it was poor or fair. In short, education was found to play a role in both amplifying the healthy immigrant effect and in dampening the attenuation of that effect.","[Chowdhury, Murshed] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Econ, Fredericton, NB, Canada; [Serieux, John] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of New Brunswick; University of Manitoba,"Chowdhury, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Brunswick, Dept Econ, Fredericton, NB, Canada.",,"Serieux, John/AAF-8966-2021","Serieux, John/0000-0002-1606-6042; Chowdhury, Murshed/0000-0003-4459-9484",Social Science and Humanities research Council; Canadian Institute for Health Research; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Statistics Canada,Social Science and Humanities research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canadian Institute for Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Statistics Canada,"This research was supported by funds to the Canadian Research Data Centre Network from the Social Science and Humanities research Council, the Canadian Institute for Health Research, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and Statistics Canada.

Over the same period, the share of hired labor in agriculture decreased from 19.4% to 15.5%. A focus of this paper is to understand if the observed changes in wages and hired labor are in part due to agricultural productivity growth as reflected in increasing rice yield. To estimate the effects of agricultural productivity, we take advantage of an Upazila (subdistrict)-level panel data set from Bangladesh and exploit variations in rainfall across Upazilas and over time. We find that a positive rainfall shock has a significant positive effect on crop yields, wages, per capita household expenditure and labor supplied to market activities (including own farming). The effect on hired labor is, in contrast, negative and statistically significant. In a standard neoclassical model, higher agricultural productivity affects wages and hired labor through labor demand; a rightward (leftward) shift increases (reduces) both wages and the amount of hired labor. The finding of a negative hired labor response to agricultural productivity growth with a higher wage thus appears puzzling. We develop a model where heterogeneity in labor supply response due to differences in productivity in home goods production can lead to a decline in hired labor when agricultural productivity increases, even though the equilibrium wage increases. Since the poor in rural areas depend disproportionately on wage labor, a decline in hired labor may be interpreted by some as evidence of adverse effects on poverty and inequality. The theoretical analysis, however, shows that the poor benefit from agricultural productivity growth even when the labor supply responses result in a decline in hired labor.

Based on this, the literature aims to determine the factors affecting tourism demand behavior. In this paper, we analyze the effect of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on both total and personal outbound travel expenditures in the panel data of 17 developed and developing countries. This is the first paper to examine the impact of EPU on travel expenditures within a tourism demand framework. By using the fixed-effects and the Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) estimation techniques, we find that an increase in the level of uncertainty decreases travel expenditures. Our findings imply that when people experience an increase in uncertainty-related economic policies, they tend to decrease their expenditures abroad. On average, a one standard deviation rise in EPU leads to a 3% and a 6% decrease in the total and personal travel expenditures. We also find that the effect of EPU on travel expenditures is higher in developing economies compared to developed countries. The empirical results in this paper suggest that governments should realize the suppressing effect of uncertainties about their economic policies on tourism demand.","[Gozgor, Giray] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Int Relat, Istanbul, Turkey; [Demir, Ender] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Tourism, Tourism Management, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Medeniyet University; Istanbul Medeniyet University,"Gozgor, G (通讯作者)，Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Int Relat, Istanbul, Turkey.",giray.gozgor@medeniyet.edu.tr; ender.demir@medeniyet.edu.tr,"Demir, Ender/J-8808-2017; Gozgor, Giray/K-1372-2017","Demir, Ender/0000-0003-4034-269X; Gozgor, Giray/0000-0003-1238-8105",,,,,19,39,39,4,15,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Housing shortfalls and continued slum growth are consistently forecast. But what kinds of housing do current residents occupy? Do owners have better quality housing than tenants? How much do tenants pay and what features do they value? This study builds a demand-side understanding of housing using survey data from over 14,000 households in 15 Kenyan cities. Kenya's urban housing market is characterized by renting and sharing. Approximately 86 percent of residents are tenants; they outnumber owners in 14 of 15 cities. Sharing is ubiquitous households share houses, rooms, and/or facilities such as toilets and taps. In contrast to standard notions of an acceptable housing unit, only 18 percent of urban Kenyans live in a self-contained unit with a toilet, kitchen, electricity, and private water connection.The market is delivering two under-studied housing categories compounds and dormitories explicitly designed for sharing. These house 40 percent of urban households in individual rooms, but require sharing of toilets and water connections. Rents represent a significant share of household income, but indicate low ability to achieve ownership, if viewed as monthly mortgage payments. Hedonic regression analyses reveal the relative value of house features with electricity, kitchens and number of rooms emerging as important drivers of rent. Neighborhood conditions, such as lack of flooding and perceived safety, and neighborhood level infrastructure and services, such as garbage collection and access to transport, also have positive impacts upon rents. Our analysis urges a rethinking of housing policies, including reevaluation of what type of housing is deemed acceptable and affordable for very low income urban residents. It underscores the need to develop more and better-quality rental housing and calls for a reassessment of housing and infrastructure investment programs, as well as more creative approaches for expanding home ownership.

We study four types of city-destination-specific export spillovers: domestic, foreign, inter- and infra-industry spillovers. Using a matched dataset of China's firm level trade and survey data over the period of 2000 to 2006, we run conditional logit model and conclude that neighbor's export activities significantly matter for a firm's entry to new markets. In particular, we find: (1) The probability of local exporters entering a particular destination responds positively to neighboring exporters; (2) Intra-industry spillovers are stronger than inter-industry spillovers; (3) For both intra- and inter-industry, domestic firms generate stronger spillovers than their multinational counterparts; (4) More productive firms rely less on export spillovers when entering less favored destinations; and (5) Ordinary trade activities facilitate stronger spillovers than processing trade regime. These findings remain robust after we control for demand side and supply side shocks.","[Hong Chang] ERS, USDA, 355 St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Wu Haoyu] Clark Univ, Dept Econ, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Clark University,"Hong, C (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, 355 St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",chang.hong@ers.usgda.gov,,"Wu, Haoyu/0009-0002-4943-0936",,,,,41,4,6,1,13,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0889-1583,1095-8681,,J JPN INT ECON,J.

Our empirical findings suggest that leader traders are more susceptible to the disposition effect than investors who are not being followed by any other trader. Using a differencein-differences approach, we show that becoming a first-time financial advisor increases the disposition effect. This finding holds for investors who engage in foreign exchange trading and for investors who trade stocks and stock market indices. The increased behavioral bias may be explained by leaders feeling responsible to their followers, by a fear of losing followers when admitting a poor investment decision, or by an attempt by newly appointed leaders to manage their social image and self-image.

Using data from a 2010 survey of married pre-retirees ages 35-70 in Michigan, US, we created a General Linear Model to predict expected retirement age. The model incorporated the effect of spousal and family variables on expected retirement age, and because the work/family interface is highly gendered, we explored interactions with gender. The study used a life course perspective in its framing and analysis, and found that expected retirement age was related to both personal and family characteristics and that the relationship of spousal and family factors were gendered and complex.","[Whitaker, Elizabeth Ann] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Sociol Anthropol & Social Work, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Bokemeier, Janet L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Central Michigan University; Michigan State University,"Whitaker, EA (通讯作者)，Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Sociol Anthropol & Social Work, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",whita1ea@cmich.edu,,,Michigan Applied Public Policy Initiative,Michigan Applied Public Policy Initiative,Funding was provided by Michigan Applied Public Policy Initiative.,,48,13,16,0,16,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Empirical insights from India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Group farming; Women's groups; Small family farms; Agricultural productivity and profitability; Asia; India,AGRICULTURE; COLLECTIVIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY; TRANSITION; STRATEGY; VIETNAM,"Is there an alternative model to small family farming that could provide sustainable livelihoods to millions of resource-constrained and often non-viable smallholders in developing countries? Could group farming constitute such an alternative, wherein smallholders voluntarily pool land, labour and capital to create larger farms that they manage collectively? In South Asia, for instance, over 85% of farmers are small and increasingly female. Potentially, group farming could provide them economies of scale, a dependable labour force, more investible funds and skills, and greater bargaining power with governments and markets. But can this potential be realised in practice? In particular, can group farms economically outperform small family farms? A rare opportunity to test this is provided by two experiments begun in the 2000s in the Indian states of Kerala and Telangana. Constituted only of women, the groups lease in land to farm collectively, sharing labour, the cost of inputs, and the returns. But the states differ in several respects, including the technical support the groups receive, and their institutional base, composition, land access and cropping patterns. Based on the author's primary sample surveys in both states, this paper compares the productivity and profitability of group farms with that of small individual family farms in the same state. Kerala's groups perform strikingly better than the predominantly male-managed individual farms, both in their annual value of output per hectare and annual net returns per farm, while in Telangana group farms perform much worse than individual farms in annual output, but are equivalent in net returns. In both states, groups do much better in commercial crops than in traditional foodgrains, where the largely male-managed individual farms, owning good quality land and with longer farm management experience, have an advantage. The factors underlying the differential performances of Kerala and Telangana, and the lessons learnt for possible replication, are also discussed. Overall, the paper demonstrates that group farming can provide an effective alternative, subject to specified conditions and adaptation of the model to the local context. (C) 2018 The Author.

Policymakers require objective evidence to base decisions on which public policies or investments to pursue. In this paper we develop an economy-wide approach to assessing public investments in tourism. The approach is powerful in that it considers all intersectoral linkages that are critical for tourism-sector analysis. This framework is linked to a microsimulation module that enables estimation of household-level and destination-specific impacts and the distribution of benefits. To illustrate the framework and the insights it can generate, we apply it to a public investment in Belize's Cayo District. Our findings show that the overall level of economic activity increases while an appreciation of the real regional exchange rate results in slower growth in traditional nontourism exports. Greater availability of capital and labor to meet increased demand would reduce this effect. The investment results in a reduction in the poverty headcount on the order of 0.7 percentage points, though there is a small increase in inequality that is a function of the skill requirements of the new positions created as a result of the investment.","[Banerjee, Onil; Moreda, Adela] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Cicowiez, Martin] Univ Nacl La Plata, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Morris, Emily J.] UCL, London, England",Inter-American Development Bank; National University of La Plata; University of London; University College London,"Banerjee, O (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Environm Rural Dev Environm & Disaster Risk Manag, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",onilb@iadb.org,"Morris, Emily/JRY-8556-2023; Morris, Emily/HZJ-5380-2023","Morris, Emily/0000-0002-9171-1080; Cicowiez, Martin/0000-0001-6616-7370",Inter-American Development Bank,Inter-American Development Bank,This study was funded by the Inter-American Development Bank.,,44,6,6,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Our proposed occupation pension plan for public employees is one of the important components in transiting from a dual-track pension system to a sustainable and unified system. We aim at providing a pension design, that is, the defined benefit (DB) underpin pension with estimates of the costs and benefits. We have used a financial engineering approach to calculate the hedge contribution for a DB underpin hybrid pension plan benefit. We also treat pension benefit and salaries in aggregate. Therefore, we propose a stochastic and exogenous salary model. Employees' total benefits can be determined by multiple factors, such as inflation, economic environment, and employer's preference. However, the expectation of employees' total benefits should not be affected by the change of salary and pension benefits. Our results could facilitate the ongoing pension reform in the People's Republic of China, providing a rigorous benchmark with public policy implications as to plan design, cost estimation, as well as risk management approach.","[Chen, Kai] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Chen, K (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Sch Econ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",chen.kai@pku.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71503016]; Ministry of Education [14JZD027],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Young Scholar Grant No. 71503016 and Ministry of Education Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research Grant No. 14JZD027.,,13,0,0,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

It offers opportunities for research application but also raises concerns over potentially negative consequences for academic research and its dissemination. For a sample of social, natural, and engineering science academics in Germany, and controlling for the selection into consulting, we investigate the effect of consulting with public and private sector organizations on research performance. While previous research suggested that consulting activities might come at the cost of reduced research output, our analysis provides a more nuanced picture. Public sector consulting comes with lower average citations, particularly for junior researchers. Moreover, engagement in consulting increases the probability to cease publishing research altogether, particularly for private sector consulting. The probability of exit from academic research increases with the intensity of consulting engagement for those at the start or towards the end of their academic career and in fields for which the public-private wage gap and opportunities for engagement in duties outside academia are higher. We draw lessons for research institutions and policy about the promotion of academic consulting.","[Fudickar, Roman; Hottenrott, Hanna] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Hottenrott, Hanna] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Hottenrott, Hanna] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Lawson, Cornelia] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",Technical University of Munich; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); KU Leuven; University of Bath,"Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, D-80333 Munich, Germany.;Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.;Hottenrott, H (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",roman.fudickar@tum.de; hanna.hottenrott@tum.de; c.lawson@bath.ac.uk,"Hottenrott, Hanna/H-4014-2018; Hottenrott, Hanna/AAE-7037-2021","Hottenrott, Hanna/0000-0002-1584-8106; Lawson, Cornelia/0000-0002-1262-5142; Fudickar, Roman/0000-0001-9613-668X",DFG [HO-5390/1-1],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors thank the ZEW for providing the survey data and particularly Maikel Pellens for his support.

We show that the dynamics of arbitrage capital are self-correcting: following a shock that depletes capital, returns increase, which allows capital to be gradually replenished. Spreads increase more for trades with volatile fundamentals or more time to convergence. Arbitrageurs cut their positions more in those trades, except when volatility concerns the hedgeable component. Financial constraints yield a positive cross-sectional relationship between spreads/returns and betas with respect to arbitrage capital. Diversification of arbitrageurs across markets induces contagion, but generally lowers arbitrageurs' risk and price volatility.","[Gromb, Denis] HEC Paris, Dept Finance, Jouy En Josas, France; [Vayanos, Dimitri] London Sch Econ, Dept Finance, London, England",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gromb, D (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, Dept Finance, Jouy En Josas, France.",,"Vayanos, Dimitri/AAW-9373-2021","Vayanos, Dimitri/0000-0002-0944-4914","Paul Woolley Centre at the LSE; Fondation Banque de France; Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Labex ECODEC [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047]; ESRC [ES/R009724/1, ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Paul Woolley Centre at the LSE; Fondation Banque de France; Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Labex ECODEC; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Philippe Bacchetta; Bruno Biais (the Editor); Patrick Bolton; Darrell Duffie; Vito Gala; Jennifer Huang; Dong Lou; Henri Pages; Anna Pavlova; Christopher Polk; Matti Suominen; an anonymous associate editor; and three referees; as well as seminar participants in Amsterdam, Bergen, Bordeaux, the Bank of Italy, la Banque de France, BI Oslo, Bocconi University, Boston University, CEMFI Madrid, Columbia, Copenhagen, Dartmouth College, Duke, Durham University, ESC Paris, ESC Toulouse, the HEC-INSEAD-PSE workshop, HEC Lausanne, Helsinki, the ICSTE-Nova seminar in Lisbon, INSEAD, Imperial College, Institut Henri Poincare, LSE, McGill, MIT, Naples, NYU, Paris School of Economics, University of Piraeus, Porto, Queen's University, Stanford, Toulouse, Universite Paris Dauphine, Science Po-Paris, the joint THEMA-ESSEC seminar, Vienna, and Wharton for comments.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of conservatism on an important investment decision that has been overlooked, namely, investment in labor. We find that conservatism is negatively associated with labor investment inefficiency; more specifically, conservatism reduces inefficient investment practices on the labor market, including over-hiring, under-firing, under-hiring, and over-firing.

This is despite the fact that many European countries have deep financial markets, strong legal institutions, and high R&D spending. We point to the tax treatment of employee stock options as an explanation for the stronger growth of the US VC sector. As a response to high uncertainty and transaction costs, VC financiers have developed a model in which founders and key recruitments are compensated with stock options under complex contracts. Low tax rates on employee stock options further raise the relative returns of working and investing in innovative entrepreneurial firms, and shift financial capital and talent to that sector. We measure the effective tax on stock options in VC-backed entrepreneurial firms in a number of developed economies. Countries with lower stock option taxation have higher VC activity and more high-growth expectation entrepreneurial activity. Based on these associations and the theoretical and empirical literature, we argue that more lenient taxation of gains on employee stock options can be a strategy for European countries to catch up in entrepreneurial finance. This tax policy would narrowly target entrepreneurial startups without requiring broad tax cuts. The favorable tax treatment of stock options allows the state to promote firms that rely on entrepreneurial finance and make use of these types of contracts without lowering taxes for other sectors of the economy.","[Henrekson, Magnus] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sanandaji, Tino] Stockholm Sch Econ, Inst Econ & Business Hist Res EHFF, POB 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Stockholm School of Economics,"Henrekson, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",magnus.henrekson@ifn.se; tino.sanandaji@hhs.se,"Henrekson, Magnus/JXL-1358-2024","Henrekson, Magnus/0000-0002-1640-7126",EU project Financial and Institutional Reforms for the Entrepreneurial Society (FIRES) [949378]; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation,EU project Financial and Institutional Reforms for the Entrepreneurial Society (FIRES); Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation,"We are grateful for the useful comments and suggestions from Victor Ahlqvist, Simon Ek, Saul Estrin, Steven Kaplan, Vesa Kanniainen, Werner Liebregts, and David Schizer and two anonymous referees.

While the government is considering series of market and nonmarket measures to achieve its target, this study assesses the economic consequences if the target were to meet through a market mechanism, carbon tax. We used a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of China for the analysis. The study shows that the level of carbon tax to achieve the NDC target would be different depending on its design features. An increasing carbon tax that starts at a small rate in 2015 and rises to a level to meet the NDC target in 2030 would cause smaller GDP loss than the carbon tax with a constant rate would do. The GDP loss due to the carbon tax would be smaller when the tax revenue is utilized to cut existing distortionary taxes than when it is transferred to households as a lump-sum rebate.","[Timilsina, Govinda R.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Cao, Jing] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ho, Mun] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank; Tsinghua University; Harvard University,"Timilsina, GR (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gtimilsina@worldbank.org; caojing@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; HO@rff.org,"Ho, Mun/ABI-4730-2020",,World Bank's Knowledge for Change (KCP) Trust Fund; Harvard Global Institute; National Key R&D Program of China; National Science Foundation of China; Tsinghua University Research Center for Green Economy and Sustainable Development,World Bank's Knowledge for Change (KCP) Trust Fund; Harvard Global Institute; National Key R&D Program of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua University Research Center for Green Economy and Sustainable Development,"The authors would like to thank an anonymous referee; Mike Toman, Bert Hofman, Todd Johnson, Garo Batmanian, Karlis Smits, Ying Fan and participants of the 2017 International Energy Workshop (IEW 2017) held on 12-14 July, 2017 at College Park, Maryland, USA for their valuable comments and suggestions.

I argue that local development spillovers are an important, albeit previously understudied, dimension by which to evaluate the effects of special economic zones. I then present the first systematic analysis of the developmental effects of India's SEZs, leveraging an original dataset on their locations, together with 2001 and 2011 census data containing a host of social and economic developmental variables. The findings show these SEZs have failed to bring about local socioeconomic development. To explain this absence of developmental spillovers, I provide a theoretical framework based on the crucial role of political economy incentive structures facing local politicians. I outline the mechanism through which Indian state politicians use state-owned development corporations for rent capture, undermining the potential effectiveness of SEZs and leading to their developmental failures. The combination of available means for extracting rents and the limited political constraints on such rent extraction leads to a lack of developmental spillovers. This framework can also help to explain the difference in the effects of SEZs in India and in China. These findings have theoretical importance for understanding the conditions under which subnational polities can use export zones and other export policies to catalyze development, and practical implications for understanding the mixed pattern of SEZ success across the world.

We conduct an investigation of party-supporter congruence in Europe with emphasis on the measurement of ideology and focusing on the role of party system polarization, both as a direct factor in explaining congruence and in modifying the effects of voter sophistication. Understanding this relationship depends in part on how the ideology of parties and supporters is measured. We use Poole's Blackbox scaling to derive a measure of latent ideology from voter and expert responses to issue scale questions and compare this to a measure based on left-right perceptions. We then examine how variation in the proximity between parties ideological positions and those of their supporters is affected by the polarization of the party system and how this relationship interacts with political sophistication. With the latent ideology measure, we find that polarization decreases party-supporter congruence but increases the effects of respondent education level on congruence. However, we do not find these relationships using the left-right perceptual measure. Our findings underscore important differences between perceptions of left-right labels and the ideological constraint underlying issue positions.","[Carroll, Royce] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England; [Kubo, Hiroki] Meijigakuin Univ, Tokyo, Japan",University of Essex,"Carroll, R (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England.",r.carroll@essex.ac.uk; hkubo@law.meijigakuin.ac.jp,"Carroll, Royce/AAA-1721-2020; Carroll, Royce/GVT-6628-2022","Carroll, Royce/0000-0002-3185-0329;",,,,,88,3,4,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176.0,1-2,,,SI,,247,265,,10.1007/s11127-018-0562-0,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438459400014,0

Unlike the standard spatial voting model, the explanation herein recognizes that extremists are distinguished not only by their political positions, but also by the intensity with which they hold them. The paper uses an extension of Aumann and Kurz's (Econometrica 45(5):1137-1161, 1977) bargaining model to endogenize moderation and extremism in the context of democratic voting. The extension shows that low-income voters tend to be bolder in their redistributive demands and high-income voters tend to be more tenacious in defending them.

Yet little research measures change in the policy preferences of primary electorates to evaluate the connection directly. We create the first explicit measures of the preferences of primary voters over the last 60 years using a Bayesian item-response theory model. Although the overall distribution of population preferences has changed little, the preferences of primary voters are now much more related to the party of the primary that they attend. We show that liberals are much more likely to turn out in Democratic primaries and conservatives are much more likely to turn out in Republican primaries. We estimate that the divergence of primary from general electorates is six times larger in 2012 than in 1958 owing to this primary sorting. This trend began with the emergence of the Southern Republicans. As the Republican party became viable, conservative Southerners switched to Republican primaries leading to a leftward shift in Democratic primary electorates. Nationwide, primary sorting began sometime after it began in the South. We speculate that Southern realignment played a clarifying role that contributed to subsequent sorting of primary electorates nationwide.","[Hill, Seth J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr 0521, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tausanovitch, Chris] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, POB 951472, Los Angeles, CA 90065 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Tausanovitch, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Polit Sci, POB 951472, Los Angeles, CA 90065 USA.",sjhill@ucsd.edu; ctausanovitch@ucla.edu,"Tausanovitch, Chris/KBB-2894-2024","Tausanovitch, Chris/0000-0003-3401-3427",,,,,42,8,13,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176.0,1-2,,,SI,,107,132,,10.1007/s11127-017-0478-0,0.0,,,26,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438459400007,0

In our model, the first and second countries specialize in producing (country-specific) intermediate goods and face financial constraints. The third country produces the final goods by using its own labor and intermediate goods purchased from the first and second countries. The financial markets of these countries are perfectly separated from each other, and the interest rates differ across countries. Our finding is that if the elasticity of substitution between the two intermediate goods is sufficiently high, the relaxation of financial constraints in the first (second) country decreases the second (first) country's income, whereas if the elasticity of substitution is sufficiently low, the relaxation of financial constraints in the first (second) country increases the second (first) country's income. We also find that the income inequality across the three countries is widened by the further relaxation of financial constraints in the country with higher financial development, regardless of the ranking of the per capita income between the first and second countries. Furthermore, the income inequality within the first or second country is reduced as the financial constraints in that country are relaxed.","[Kunieda, Takuma] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, 1-155 Uegahara Ichiban Cho, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan; [Nishimura, Kazuo] Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodaicho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Shibata, Akihisa] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University; Kobe University; Kyoto University,"Nishimura, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodaicho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",tkunieda@kwansei.ac.jp; nishimura@rieb.kobe-u.ac.jp; shibata@kier.icyoto-u.ac.jp,"Kunieda, Takuma/AAU-9001-2021; Shibata, Akihisa/AEV-7703-2022; Shibata, Akihisa/F-1214-2010; Kunieda, Takuma/R-9259-2019","Shibata, Akihisa/0000-0002-2284-1332; Shibata, Akihisa/0000-0002-2284-1332; Kunieda, Takuma/0000-0002-3205-3284","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H05729, 16H02026, 16H03598, 16K03685, 17H02516]; KIER; Hong Kong RGC-IDS project [UGC/IDS13/16]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H02516, 16K03685, 16H03598] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); KIER; Hong Kong RGC-IDS project; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work is financially supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (Nos. 15H05729, 16H02026, 16H03598, 16K03685, 17H02516) and the joint research program of KIER.

However, measuring livelihood resilience is a difficult task, and practical methods to measure livelihood resilience, as well as analyze and visualize the data are needed. In this paper, I introduce the Household Livelihood Resilience Approach (HLRA), which draws from the sustainable livelihoods approach and it's five capital assets to measure resilience. However, unlike other approaches that use the five capital assets such as utilized by Zurich Insurance Group, Ltd and the IFRC, the HLRA goes farther to help visualize the results and identify specific actions to build resilience. This paper illustrates the effectiveness of the HLRA through an empirical case study where this approach was used to measure livelihood resilience in Isiolo County, Kenya, and the effectiveness of agroforestry in building livelihood resilience for agricultural households. Drawing from this case study, I suggest five ways that the HLRA improves upon previous frameworks, including 1) providing practical methods and tools, not just a theoretical framework, 2) integrating 'subjective' measures of livelihood resilience, 3) focusing on the household-scale instead of community-scale or larger, 4) providing methods to analyze, visualize, and interpret results of livelihood resilience measures, and 5) highlighting the importance of human agency, power, and access to assets. The HLRA has the potential to help organizations identify specific interventions that could help build livelihood resilience for the most vulnerable groups of people within a community.

We argue in this paper that the financialization of land and consequent spurt of agricultural land sales are central to what scholars have termed land grab. Recent literature on land grabs has focused primarily on processes of accumulation by dispossession and the coercive role of the state. Our contention is that land grabs more commonly occur due to the state underinvesting in agriculture, resulting in dispossession by neglect of especially marginal and small farmers. Dispossession by neglect better captures the fluid boundary between the coercive and voluntary in contemporary land grabs.","[Vijayabaskar, M.; Menon, Ajit] Madras Inst Dev Studies, 79,2 Main, Madras 600020, Tamil Nadu, India",,"Vijayabaskar, M; Menon, A (通讯作者)，Madras Inst Dev Studies, 79,2 Main, Madras 600020, Tamil Nadu, India.",vijaybas@gmail.com; ajit1112@gmail.com,"Menon, Ajit/AAA-1231-2020",,State Planning Commission,State Planning Commission,State Planning Commission,,67,30,31,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In comparison, the decrease in credit is only one-fourth as large. Negative credit information also causes an increase in self-employment and a decrease in mobility.

To establish causality, we use a regression discontinuity approach that relies on locally exogenous variation generated by shareholder proposal votes. We find a positive, causal effect of ATPs on innovation. This positive effect is more pronounced in firms that are subject to a larger degree of information asymmetry and operate in more competitive product markets. The evidence suggests that ATPs help nurture innovation by insulating managers from short-term pressures arising from equity markets. Finally, the number of ATPs contributes positively to firm value for firms involved in intensive innovation activities.","[Chemmanur, Thomas J.] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Tian, Xuan] Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Boston College; Tsinghua University,"Chemmanur, TJ (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",chemmanu@bc.edu; tianx@pbcsf.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Tian, Xuan/JOZ-0963-2023",,Boston College; Hillenbrand Distinguished Fellowship; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71790591]; Tsinghua University Research Grant [20151080451],Boston College; Hillenbrand Distinguished Fellowship; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua University Research Grant,"We are grateful for comments and suggestions from Julian Atanassov, Ramin Baghai, Martijn Cremers, Jack He, Josh Lerner, Megan MacGarvie, Amit Seru, Jun Yang, seminar participants at Boston College and Indiana University, and conference participants at the 2012 American Finance Association annual meetings, the 2012 European Finance Association annual meetings, the 2011 Financial Intermediation Research Society conference, the 2011 conference on Economics of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and the 2011 North American Econometric Society Winter Meetings.

In many cities, however, development of planned sites around transit stations has been close to non-existent, due to, among other reasons, a lack of coordination between transit investments and land use at a broader spatial scale. Furthermore, while TOD considers access to transit, it often neglects the access to destinations that is provided by transit. We contend that accessibility-oriented development (AOD) can overcome these drawbacks of transit-oriented development. The AOD strategy fosters an environment conducive to development by balancing access to both jobs and workers. As such, AOD explicitly considers the connections between TOD locations and destinations that matter, both locally and regionally. Where markets are free to take advantage of accessibility levels, AOD is a naturally occurring process. Planners could therefore use the various tools at their disposal to influence accessibility levels (to jobs and workers) in order to attract urban development in potential AOD areas. To test the assumptions that guide AOD strategies, access to jobs and workers are calculated in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, Canada in 2001 and 2011. Cross-sectional and temporal regressions are then performed to analyze average commute times and urban development occurring across the region. Results show that residents in neighborhoods with high access to jobs and low access to competing workers experience the shortest commute times in the region, while the relationship also holds for changes in average commute times between the studied time periods. In addition, both access to jobs and access to workers are associated with changes in residential, commercial and industrial development: high labor force accessibility is associated with increases in job density, and high access to jobs is related to increases in population density between 2001 and 2011. Planners can thus leverage accessibility as a tool to direct development in their cities and to strategically adjust commute times, thereby realizing the full benefits of planned transit investments.","[Deboosere, Robbin; El-Geneidy, Ahmed M.] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Levinson, David] Univ Sydney, Sch Civil Engn, Sydney, NS, Canada",McGill University; University of Sydney,"El-Geneidy, AM (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",ahmed.elgeneidy@mcgill.ca,"Levinson, David Matthew/A-8554-2012; El-Geneidy, Ahmed/N-3904-2013","Levinson, David Matthew/0000-0002-4563-2963; El-Geneidy, Ahmed/0000-0002-0942-4016",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"This research was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

We find that the incentive to increase apparent loan-underwriting quality dominates on average. We further find that this incentive is stronger in counties with a higher proportion of heterogeneous loans, while the other incentive dominates in counties with both low heterogeneous loans and highly volatile economic conditions.","[Dou, Yiwei; Ryan, Stephen G.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Zou, Youli] George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Washington, DC 20052 USA",New York University; George Washington University,"Dou, YW (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA.",ydou@stern.nyu.edu; sryan@stern.nyu.edu; yzou@gwu.edu,"Ryan, Stephen G/HIR-3827-2022; Dou, Yiwei/F-2424-2018","Ryan, Stephen G/0000-0002-7578-452X; Dou, Yiwei/0000-0002-3231-3074",,,,,100,25,26,2,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Results suggest that all three types of their spouses' problems were related to respondents' higher FWC, with their spouses' poor mental health having the strongest association. These associations were not significant after controlling for respondents' role overload, financial strain, and relationship strain. There were few variations by respondents' gender and parental status in these associations. Relationship strain played the primary role as a mediator, which was stronger for men than women. These findings support the idea of stress proliferation, suggesting that one's problems can be linked to a series of other stressors including one's spouse's FWC.","[Fettro, Marshal Neal; Nomaguchi, Kei] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Sociol, Williams Hall, Bowling Green, OH 43043 USA; [Fettro, Marshal Neal; Nomaguchi, Kei] Bowling Green State Univ, Ctr Family & Demog Res, Williams Hall, Bowling Green, OH 43043 USA",University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University,"Fettro, MN (通讯作者)，Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Sociol, Williams Hall, Bowling Green, OH 43043 USA.;Fettro, MN (通讯作者)，Bowling Green State Univ, Ctr Family & Demog Res, Williams Hall, Bowling Green, OH 43043 USA.",mfettro@bgsu.edu; knomagu@bgsu.edu,,,"Center for Family and Demographic Research, Bowling Green State University from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development [P2CHD050959]","Center for Family and Demographic Research, Bowling Green State University from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development","This research is supported by the Center for Family and Demographic Research, Bowling Green State University, which has core funding from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (P2CHD050959).

However, this effort is partially undone in equilibrium, as markets rationally react more to a given move when the central bank moves more gradually.

For businesses to become more competitive and improving their performance, they must constantly develop new products as well as strategies. This paper is based on the research of areas of marketing in the context of Industry 4.0 and its impacts. The implications of digitization are the content of the research presented here. On the basis of the research, a pilot research was carried out among 50 enterprises that present themselves using Industry 4.0. A list of 15 basic tools of marketing innovation was compiled through an evaluation using the content analysis method. Eleven main impacts of marketing innovation which the respondents consider to be important were then generated. These impacts were described and subsequently evaluated using descriptive statistics methods, on the basis of which their importance was empirically verified. The impacts that businesses classed as being most important were: increasing the competitiveness of the company, increasing work productivity and changing the corporate culture. The results of the research showed that there are differences in how impacts are seen by SMEs and by large enterprises. The impacts are rated as most important by enterprises from the automotive industry with a European corporate culture. The research has empirically confirmed that businesses consider the greatest impact of innovative marketing in the context of Industry 4.0 to be the increase in enterprise competitiveness, which was the highest rated impact of the research.

We had work with a pea culture, seated in a rotation of 4 years the type pea, wheat-rape, maize, and we watched at three parameters of the symbiotic fixation between peas with species Rhizobium leguminosarum. The experiments were carried out in two locations in southern Romania (Burnas Plain - on the Plateau of Alexandria, and in the Southern Plain - Modelu, Calarasi) and the results were: in dynamics the nodosities begin to form at 22-24 days after sowing, their number increases accentuated until the 37 days of life, after which it decreases slightly until the 70th day. The maximum number of nodosities on roots reaches a number of 57-58 per plant. The life of a nodosity is not longer than 10 days; the weight of dry nodosities is on the peak of biological activity higher at Modelu (5.8 g/m(2)) at 38 days after sowing, and less in Alexandria (4.1 g/m(2)) at 37 days after sowing (Figure no. 2 in-text); starting from the weight of the nodosites and using their transformation coefficient in the N (nitrogen) active substance (which is 4.6), and using the functional analysis of the correlations and integral calculations, the dynamics of nitrogen accumulation in the form of a high precision polynomial function (order 14) was obtained (figure no. 3 in-text), which tells us that: the highest amount of nitrogen is obtained on day 41 after sowing in the amount of 6.52 Kg N active substance/ha.

In order to achieve these objectives, data related to the activity of SMEs in Romania regarding circular economy, gathered within Flash Eurobarometer 441 coordinated by the European Commission during April 2016, were analysed. Although the European Union supports the green initiatives of small and medium-sized enterprises and encourages Member States to have similar behaviour, this paper concludes that national policies need to pay more attention to the training of workers and to support the development of the knowledge and professionalism, and concomitantly to reduce the degree of bureaucracy in assessing compliance of the activities carried out by SMEs in the field.","[Ghenta, Mihaela; Matei, Aniela] Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect INCSMPS, Bucharest, Romania",,"Ghenta, M (通讯作者)，Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect INCSMPS, Bucharest, Romania.",ghenta@incsmps.ro,"Ghenta, Mihaela/KCK-7220-2024; Matei, Aniela/B-5695-2011; Matei, Aniela/GXV-5304-2022","Ghenta, Mihaela/0000-0002-6629-4676; Matei, Aniela/0000-0002-6645-6209;",,,,,34,23,26,4,41,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,294,309,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/294,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN9XV,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439567500005,0

Furthermore, while much attention has been paid to country-level effects of aid, there is a clear knowledge gap in the literature when it comes to systematic studies of aid effectiveness below the country level. Addressing this gap, we undertake what we believe is the first systematic attempt to study how ODA affects infant mortality at the subnational level. We match new geographic aid data from the AidData on the precise location, type, and time frame of bilateral and multilateral aid projects in Nigeria with available georeferenced survey data from five Nigerian Demographic and Health Surveys. Using quasi-experimental approaches, with mother fixed-effects, we are able to control for a vast number of unobserved factors that may otherwise be spuriously correlated with both infant mortality and ODA. The results indicate very clearly that geographical proximity to active aid projects reduces infant mortality. Moreover, aid contributes to reduce systematic inter-group, or horizontal, inequalities in a setting where such differences loom large. In particular, we find that aid more effectively reduces infant mortality in less privileged groups like children of Muslim women, and children living in rural, and in Muslim dominated areas. Finally, there is evidence that aid projects are established in areas that on average have lower infant mortality than non-aid locations, suggesting that there are biases resulting in aid not necessarily reaching those populations in greatest need.

However, since it is prohibitively expensive to provide direct training to all the farmers in SSA, it is critically important to examine the extent to which technologies taught to a small number of farmers disseminate to non-trained farmers. This paper investigates the technology dissemination pathways among smallholder rice producers within a rural irrigation scheme in Tanzania. As an innovative feature, we compare the performance of three categories of farmers: key farmers, who receive intensive pre-season training at a local training center; intermediate farmers, who are trained by the key farmers; and other ordinary farmers. By collecting and analyzing a unique five-year household-level panel data set, we estimate difference-in-differences models to assess how the gap in performance evolve as the technologies spill over from the trained farmers to the ordinary farmers. To disentangle the technology spillover process, we also examine the extent to which social and geographical network with the key and intermediate farmers influences the adoption of technologies by the ordinary farmers, by incorporating social relationship variables into spatial econometric models. We found that the ordinary farmers who were a relative or residential neighbor of a key or intermediate farmer were more likely to adopt new technologies than those who were not. As a result, while the key farmers' technology adoption rates rose immediately after the training, those of the non-trained ordinary farmers caught up belatedly. As the technologies disseminated, the paddy yield of the key farmers increased from 3.1 to 5.3 tons per hectare, while the yield of the ordinary farmers increased from 2.6 to 3.7 tons per hectare. Our results suggest the effectiveness and practical potential of farmer-to-farmer extension programs for smallholders in SSA as a cost effective alternative to the conventional farmer training approach.

We explore the use of the Delphi Method in contingent valuation (CV) by asking a panel of 49 European environmental valuation experts in two rounds what they think would be the result if a European CV survey of Amazon Rainforest protection plans was conducted. The experts' best guess for the mean willingness-to-pay (WTP) by European households for preserving the current Amazon Rainforest, and thus avoiding a predicted loss in forest area by 2050 from currently 85% to 60% of the original forest in the 1970s, was 28 a,notsign per household annually as an additional income tax. Aggregated over all European households this amounts to about 8.4 billion a,notsign annually. This preliminary estimate indicate that WTP of distant beneficiaries is substantial, and could justify preservation of global ecosystem services where aggregated benefits of the local population often do not exceed the opportunity costs of preservation in terms of lost income from commercial activities. The income elasticity of WTP with respect to per-capita income in the European countries is 0.5-0.6. Recognizing the limitations and assumptions of the Delphi CV method, it could still be a time saving and cost-effective benefit transfer tool for providing international donors with much needed order-of-magnitude estimates of the non-use value of ecosystem services of global significance.","[Navrud, Stale] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Strand, Jon] World Bank, Environm & Energy Team, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; The World Bank,"Navrud, S (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",stale.navrud@nmbu.no,,"Navrud, Stale/0000-0002-6627-4595; Strand, Jon/0000-0001-8620-8504",,,,,33,20,22,1,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This review also aimed to provide an initial understanding on route choice decision making factors and to contribute to the literature by providing suggestions for future research and methodological considerations. The competitiveness of Arctic routes is evaluated from both economic and environmental perspectives. Research themes and methodological characteristics are analysed in order to establish an evidence base in Arctic shipping literature. It is identified that analytical research methods and transport cost models are mainly employed. The results indicate that although Arctic routes can be more cost-effective and energy efficient compared to traditional ones, especially in the long-term, they can mainly serve as seasonal alternatives for bulk and specialised shipping in the short-term.","[Theocharis, Dimitrios; Pettit, Stephen; Rodrigues, Vasco Sanchez; Haider, Jane] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Rd, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Theocharis, D (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Rd, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",theocharisd@cardiff.ac.uk; pettit@cardiff.ac.uk; sanchezrodriguesva1@cardiff.ac.uk; haider@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Pettit, Stephen/0000-0001-7265-4079; Theocharis, Dimitrios/0000-0002-6068-7479; Haider, Jane/0000-0002-5550-1342",Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC] Wales Doctoral Training Partnership Studentship [T90363D],Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC] Wales Doctoral Training Partnership Studentship,This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC] Wales Doctoral Training Partnership Studentship No. T90363D,,93,75,82,20,137,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Although there is no known link between the consumption of CWD affected meat and human health, hunters are advised to have animals from CWD affected areas tested and are advised against consuming meat from CWD infected animals (Government of Alberta 2010). We model hunter response to the knowledge that deer in a wildlife management unit have been found to have CWD in Alberta, Canada. We examine hunter site choice over two hunting seasons using revealed and stated preference data in models that incorporate preferences, choice set formation, and scale. We compare a fully endogenous choice set model using the independent availability logit model (Swait in Probabilistic choice set formation in transportation demand models.

We conduct a series of laboratory experiments to test this view. We find that when there is no competition and no eminent domain, land assembly suffers from costly delay and failed assembly: participants lose 18.8% of the available surplus on average. Much of the inefficiency is due to low offers from the buyers (buyer holdout) rather than strategic holdout among sellers. When buyers can exercise eminent domain the participants lose 19.4% of the surplus on average. This loss comes from spending money to influence the fair market price and forcing sellers to sell even when the sellers value the property more than the buyer. Introducing weak competition in the form of a less valuable substitute parcel of land reduces delay by 35.7% and virtually eliminates assembly failure, so that only 10.1% of the surplus is lost on average.","[Winn, Abel M.] Chapman Univ, Argyros Sch Business & Econ, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [McCarter, Matthew W.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, San Antonio, TX USA",Chapman University System; Chapman University; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Winn, AM (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Argyros Sch Business & Econ, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",winn@chapman.edu,"McCarter, Matthew W/I-6429-2013",,International Foundation of Research in Experimental Economics (IFREE Grant) [121],International Foundation of Research in Experimental Economics (IFREE Grant),Portions of this research were completed while the second author was Visiting John Angus Erskine Fellow at University of Canterbury.

The evaluation is performed by shocking land productivity in a computable general equilibrium model tailored to replicate Nigerian economic development up to 2050. The detail of land uses in the model has been increased by differentiating land types per agro-ecological zones. Uncertainty about future climate is captured, using, as inputs, yield changes computed by a crop model under ten general circulation models runs. Climate change turns out to be negative for Nigeria in the medium term, with production losses and increase in crop prices, higher food dependency on foreign imports, and GDP losses in all the simulations after 2025. In a second part of the paper, a cost effectiveness analysis of adaptation in Nigerian agriculture is conducted. The adaptation practices considered are a mix of cheaper soft measures and more costly hard irrigation expansion. The main result is that the cost effectiveness of the whole package depends crucially on the possibility of implementing adaptation by exploiting low-cost opportunities which show a benefit-cost ratio larger than one in all the climate regimes.","[Bosello, Francesco; Campagnolo, Lorenza; Eboli, Fabio] CMCC Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Lecce, Italy; [Bosello, Francesco; Campagnolo, Lorenza; Eboli, Fabio] FEEM, Venice, Italy; [Bosello, Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy; [Cervigni, Raffaello] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Fondazione Mattei; University of Milan; The World Bank,"Campagnolo, L (通讯作者)，CMCC Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Lecce, Italy.;Campagnolo, L (通讯作者)，FEEM, Venice, Italy.",lorenza.campagnolo@feem.it,"Campagnolo, Lorenza/ABE-7927-2020; Bosello, Francesco/ABE-6686-2020; eboli, fabio/ABF-9764-2021; Cervigni, Raffaello/M-9255-2015","Campagnolo, Lorenza/0000-0001-7031-8055; eboli, fabio/0000-0003-3617-9543; Cervigni, Raffaello/0000-0002-2602-6482",World Bank,World Bank(The World Bank India),"This work is an elaboration of the economic assessment part of the Nigerian Climate Risk Analysis consulting report prepared for the World Bank, whose financial support is gratefully acknowledged.

In this paper, we highlight that a cooperative is an enterprise owned by a network of entrepreneurial members. By taking explicitly into account the social interactions among entrepreneurial members and the impact of social ties on members' product quality provisions, we identify the circumstances when pooling is efficient. It is shown that social interactions mitigate the free-riding effect of pooling and that the amount of members' social interactions depends upon, and increases with, the cooperative's pooling ratio. We show that the complete pooling policy is not only economically efficient but also socially advantageous when the context of the cooperative is conducive to frequent social interactions among members.","[Deng, Wendong] NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, Archimedesstr 17, NL-4816 BA Breda, Netherlands; [Hendrikse, George] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Mandeville Bldg T10-56,Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Breda University of Applied Sciences; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Deng, WD (通讯作者)，NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, Archimedesstr 17, NL-4816 BA Breda, Netherlands.",deng.w@nhtv.nl; ghendrikse@rsm.nl,,,,,,,41,7,8,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In particular, we focus on China, where bureaucratic interest groups are separate vertical organizations reaching down from Beijing to the provinces and cities. The key question in this paper is: what are the effects of the logrolling of parochial interest groups on state policies and social welfare in autocracies? We address this question both theoretically and empirically. The theory predicts a specific distortion in resource allocation because of logrolling, while the empirical results confirm the theoretical prediction. We find policy outcomes under logrolling are characterized by excessive spending on all the interest groups' preferred goods and insufficient spending on public goods. We test the existence of logrolling between the Ministry of Civil Affairs and Ministry of Health in China. Our result shows logrolling between the two ministries lead to inefficiencies in social security and health care policies.","[Gilli, Mario] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Quantitat Methods & Business Strategy, Milan, Italy; [Li, Yuan] Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Duisburg, Germany; [Li, Yuan] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst East Asian Studies, Duisburg, Germany; [Qian, Jiwei] Natl Univ Singapore, East Asian Inst, Singapore, Singapore",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Duisburg Essen; University of Duisburg Essen; National University of Singapore,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Duisburg, Germany.;Li, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst East Asian Studies, Duisburg, Germany.",mario.gilli@unimib.it; yuan.li@uni-due.de; jiwei.qian@nus.edu.sg,"; Qian, Jiwei/A-2376-2019","Li, Yuan/0000-0001-7139-4391; Qian, Jiwei/0000-0002-4031-0287",,,,,33,20,20,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2018,175.0,1-2,,,,,197,214,,10.1007/s11127-018-0526-4,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GA6QA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428457000010,0

For the purpose of comparability, the calibration to the term structure of a corporate bond credit spread is conducted under both NTS structural model and Merton structural model. We find that NTS structural model provides better fit for all credit ratings than Merton structural model. However, it is noticed that probabilities of default derived from the calibration of the term structure of a bond credit spread might be overestimated since the bond credit spread could contain non-default components such as illiquidity risk or asymmetric tax treatment. Hence, considering CDS spread as a reflection of the pure credit risk for the reference entity, we calibrate it in order to obtain more reasonable probability of default and obtain valid results in calibration of the market CDS spread with NTS structural model.","[Kim, Sung Ik] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Kim, Young Shin] SUNY Stony Brook, Coll Business, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Kim, SI (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",sungik.kim@stonybrook.edu; aaron.kim@stonybrook.edu,"Kim, Sung Ik/AAE-2020-2020","Kim, Sung Ik/0000-0001-7603-0319; Kim, Young Shin/0000-0002-3401-529X",,,,,53,8,8,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

While the standard economic reasoning is that these institutional constraints lead to welfare losses, the size of those losses and optimal second-best policies are usually unknown. We develop a dynamic bioeconomic model, in which a scientific body provides an optimal TAC given restrictions on (i) transferability between vessel segments and (ii) entrance of new vessels. Further, we also quantify welfare losses arising from not maximizing economic welfare, but physical yield-which is actually the case in many fisheries. We apply the model to the Northeast Arctic cod fishery, and estimate not only the cost and harvesting functions of the various vessel types, but also the parameters of the biological model as well as those of the demand function. This allows us to determine optimal second-best policies and quantify corresponding welfare effects for our case study fishery.","[Richter, Andries; Eikeset, Anne Maria; Diekert, Florian Klaus; Stenseth, Nils Chr.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Richter, Andries] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Sub Dept Econ, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Soest, Daan] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ & Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Diekert, Florian Klaus] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Bergheimer Str 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",University of Oslo; Wageningen University & Research; Tilburg University; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Richter, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.;Richter, A (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Sub Dept Econ, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",andries.richter@wur.nl,"Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016; van Soest, Daan P/C-5544-2013; Richter, Andries/A-9120-2016","van Soest, Daan P/0000-0002-3100-1810; Diekert, Florian/0000-0002-5986-4060; Richter, Andries/0000-0003-3423-4377","Norwegian Research Council [243892, 215831]; Nordforsk",Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Nordforsk(NordForsk),"We are grateful to Linda Nostbakken and Martin Quaas, as well as the editor and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on a previous version of this manuscript.

The sociodemographic factors behind the adoption of the credit card and debit card have changed, especially for the latter payment card. In addition, there are substantial shifts in the effects of sociodemographic factors and perceived relative payment attributes on which payment instrument consumers most often use. Shifts in payment behavior depend on the type of POS. Overall, we find that safety has become more important for payment behavior.

In this study, the spatial variation of self-containment of employment and jobs-housing balance is examined with job types, location, and housing prices using the cellphone data in Shenzhen, China. Jobs-housing balance is found to be more important in self-containment of employment for secondary-sector workers compared with that for tertiary-sector workers. Secondary-sector workers tend to reside near their workplaces because of relatively balanced jobs and housing, whereas tertiary-sector workers tend to reside farther away from their workplaces to save housing cost. The study enhances our understanding of self-containment of employment and jobs-housing balance which is primarily based on Western cities.","[Zhou, Xingang] Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xingang; Yeh, Anthony G.

We explore firmlevel data on investment and document that investment fell relative to fundamentals at the turn of the millennium-well before the Great Recession. This downturn in investment coincides with a shift in employment toward services and cognitive skills-the polarization described by Autor et al. (Am Econ Rev 96(2): 189-194, 2006), as a possible consequence of off-shoring and automation. An analogous sorting of firms into industries shows a shift of investment toward spatially grounded industries, such as energy and telecommunications, from which capital cannot be relocated. Investment shifts away from production sectors, such as manufacturing, which can be relocated. While high-tech firms grow in number and value, this growth is associated with a flat share of capital investment. For these sectors, we document a shift toward intangible, rather than physical, capital. The hollowing out of investment, like labor, carves out manufacturing and production sectors, leaving grounded industries that are less susceptible to off-shoring and cognitively intensive industries that are growing in intangible, rather than fixed, capital.","[Alexander, Lewis] Nomura Secur Int, New York, NY USA; [Eberly, Janice] Northwestern Univ, Finance, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Eberly, Janice] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Eberly, J (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Finance, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Eberly, J (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eberly@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Eberly, Janice/KCY-3297-2024","Eberly, Janice/0000-0001-9305-0944",,,,,28,28,33,0,8,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Besides notions of economic freedom, a rapidly growing body of literature stresses the role of personal freedoms and tolerance. It is argued that tolerance is essential for innovation because its creates an open environment where creativity and knowledge spillovers. However, mixed empirical evidence suggests that the relationship between tolerance and freedom is more nuanced towards additional social factors, such as the role of trust and other institutions. This paper re-investigates whether and to which extent notions of social and institutional trust affect the impact of tolerance on innovation using an original data set spanning three broad regions of the global and the 50 US states and 31 Chinese regions. Our findings support that tolerance and trust play an important role in stimulating innovation performance, however, the exact nature of the relationships is influenced by economic development. Our study fits into current debate about the role of sociocultural and institutional underpinnings in national innovation systems. As well as it aims to contribute to the almost currently re-starting debate about the influence of freedom and the advantage and disadvantages of diversity on economic performance.","[Audretsch, David B.; Rouch, Katherine Margaret] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Seitz, Nikolaus] Univ Augsburg, Fac Business & Econ, Univ Str 16, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Augsburg,"Seitz, N (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Fac Business & Econ, Univ Str 16, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",daudrets@indiana.edu; nikolaus.seitz@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de; kmrouch@indiana.edu,,"Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762",,,,,86,28,31,2,45,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

This effect is intended for a policy such as the 2008 Lifeline phone subsidy expansion, which aimed to increase affordable access to services. I examine the effects of this policy on households' self-reported wireless phone service spending in the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Using state-level variation in policy implementation and triple-differences event study methods, I estimate that the expansion reduced households' wireless service spending by more than 100 percent of subsidy payments. I document that the expansion led to a separate, competitive market for providers catering to low-income households. Consequently, higher-quality subsidized services crowded out lower-quality unsubsidized options, saving households more than an equivalent cash transfer. This highlights how market segmentation and competition can magnify a targeted subsidy's impact.","[Conkling, Thomas S.] Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Res Off, 1700 G St NW, Washington, DC 20552 USA",,"Conkling, TS (通讯作者)，Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Res Off, 1700 G St NW, Washington, DC 20552 USA.",thomas.conkling@cfpb.gov,,"Conkling, Thomas/0000-0001-8578-8674",,,,,43,3,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Thus, the storage, transport and port infrastructure represent an important factor in the export of the product. China is the largest importer of Brazilian soybean, with monthly and yearly volumes variability. This study aims to identify the impact of the variation in export volumes of soybean to China on the Brazilian port infrastructure, exploiting the concept of the 'bullwhip' effect (BE). Data on the export volumes of the five largest soybean-producing States is used to calculate the extent of the bullwhip effect caused by the demands for port services from these producer States on the main exporting ports. Beyond the variability of Chinese demand, climatic conditions contributed to produce bullwhip effect up to 2.0 in 2011, causing pressure on the ports of Santos and Paranagua. The research results suggest that to reduce the bullwhip effects provoked by the Midwest Producers-States, it will be necessary to design informational and coordination mechanisms to integrate the logistical agents involved in the export process and to invest on infrastructure (storage capacity).","[de Lima, Daruichi Pereira] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ctr Estudos Pesquisas & Agronegocios CEPAN, Ave Bento Goncalves 7712, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Fioriolli, Jose Carlos] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, EA, Rua Washington Luis 855, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Padula, Antonio Domingos] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, EA, PPGA, Ctr Estudos Pesquisas Agronegocios CEPAN, Rua Washington Luis 855, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Pumi, Guilherme] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Stat, Math & Stat Inst, Agron, Av Bento Goncalves Ave 9500,Bldg 43-111, BR-91509900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Padula, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, EA, PPGA, Ctr Estudos Pesquisas Agronegocios CEPAN, Rua Washington Luis 855, BR-90010460 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",daruichilima@yahoo.com.br; jcfioriolli@ea.ufrgs.br; adpadula@ea.ufrgs.br; guipumi@gmail.com,"Pumi, Guilherme/AAF-2931-2021; Padula, Antonio D/B-2992-2019","Pumi, Guilherme/0000-0002-6256-3170; Fioriolli, Jose Carlos/0000-0003-3610-1228",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [303994/2015-0]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES),Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),The authors thank the Brazilian agencies Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) (303994/2015-0) and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Ensino Superior (CAPES) for their support.

By investigating push and pull factors associated with cohabitation, this study aimed to identify linkages between cohabitation transitions and the broader socioeconomic context within which they occur. Collecting data from both members of low-income couples and carefully tracking all residential and cohabitation transitions made it possible to identify a wide range of push and pull factors that motivate couples to move. The findings suggest that cohabitation transitions were often motivated by economic necessity. Romantic partnerships, while important, were less frequently mentioned than other factors (i.e., interpersonal negotiations, finances, housing quality) in determining a couple's living arrangements. These findings have important implications for understanding the complex relationship between economic and non-economic factors that shape romantic relationships.","[Jamison, Tyler B.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Jamison, TB (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",Tyler.jamison@unh.edu,,,,,,,28,6,9,0,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Insurance agents and brokers play a significant role in helping employers navigate these problems. However, little is known about the relations between the structure of the agent/broker market and access and affordability of insurance. This article aims to fill this gap by investigating the influence of agents/brokers on health insurance offering decisions of small firms, which are particularly vulnerable to problems of financing health insurance. Using a unique membership database from the National Association of Health Underwriters together with a nationally representative survey of employers, we find that small firms in more competitive agent/broker markets are more likely to offer health insurance and at lower premiums. Moreover, premiums are less dispersed in more competitive agent/broker markets.","[Karaca-Mandic, Pinar; Feldman, Roger] Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Karaca-Mandic, Pinar] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Graven, Peter] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Portland, OR 97201 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; Oregon Health & Science University,"Karaca-Mandic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Karaca-Mandic, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",pkmandic@umn.edu; feldm002@umn.edu; graven@ohsu.edu,,,,,,,55,5,6,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

This has important implications for targeting interventions and allocating resources in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Several problems affect the measurement of urban poverty: definitions of 'slum' settlements vary widely, data collection may undercount slum populations, insufficient data disaggregation may conceal intra-city disparities, and common indicators and assumptions may be ill-suited to assessing both income and multidimensional poverty in urban contexts. However, not enough is known about the extent to which these issues affect the resulting estimates. This paper contributes to the existing literature by illustrating the scale of the bias associated with common practices in measuring urban poverty at different stages of the production of poverty estimates. The analysis draws on selected examples in the literature alongside new analysis of data from Demographic and Health Surveys and Household Income and Expenditure Surveys. The article also provides recommendations on how to address each of these problems to improve urban poverty measurement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The link between better health and better economic performance is by now well established, and many vaccines have been shown to generate significant ROI in a classical cost-benefit framework. To our knowledge, the longer term macroeconomic benefits of improved vaccination programs have not been estimated. We modify the standard conditional convergence model to account for changes in vaccination rates across time and countries, and use the modified model to estimate the macroeconomic gains from improved vaccination rates, using the DTP vaccine as a proxy for vaccination programs generally. We find evidence to suggest economically and statistically significant and sustained increases in the GDP growth rate associated with lagged increases in vaccination rates; furthermore, we find these effects increasing over time. We find that investments of the sort made by the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization (Gavi) are linked to measurably higher DTP rates, and we estimate the returns to such investments as at least 12:1. For countries on the threshold of graduating from Gavi, these results suggest that much is at stake: reducing investment in vaccination could reverse both the public health improvements and tangible economic benefits associated with ongoing improvements in vaccination rates.

This has compelled some analysts to question why banking crises happen in America but not in Canada. We examine the risk-taking behavior of banks in the US and Canada prior to the recent financial crisis and find that Canadian banks had lower risk than their US counterparts over the study period. Further analysis shows that entry restrictions, which create concentrated banking structure, strong supervisory power, and discipline constrain excessive risk taking by Canadian banks. Entry restrictions enable Canadian banks to generate higher profits and lower variability of asset returns, while restrictions on activities reduce profitability and increase variability in asset return. However, the former seems to overwhelm the effect of asset restrictions, given the lower risk that we observe for the Canadian banks. The less concentrated but competitive banking structure in the US is associated with higher bank risk taking. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that as a consequence of the increase in state presence and visibility, municipalities with a higher level of formalization of their land property rights witnessed a greater reduction in the area allocated to illicit crops. We hypothesize that this is due to the possibility of obtaining more benefits in the newly installed institutional environment when land is formalized, and the increased cost of growing illicit crops on formal relative to informal land. We find that a one-standard deviation increase in the formality index for smallholders is related to a reduction in the share of municipal area allocated to coca crops of 0.101 percentage points. That is, the formalization of one additional hectare of land with respect to small landholders in an average municipality in the year 2000 is associated with a decrease of approximately 1.4 hectares of land allocated to coca within that particular municipality, ceteris paribus. These results remain robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. Our findings contribute to empirical evidence on the positive effects of formal land property rights and effective policies in the war on drugs. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

While associations between travel behavior and physical factors in urban form have been confirmed through numerous studies, recent research underscores that focusing on the built environment poorly accounts for the sociodemographic factors bracketing amenity and route choices across space and time. As transportation planning turns toward strategies associated with maximizing accessibility over minimizing travel time, this epistemological gap is problematic for practitioners tasked with reducing structural inequalities in access to opportunity across society. Using participant testimony from a neighborhood in transition, as grounded in a qualitative geographic information system, we develop a user-oriented walkability framework which incorporates social and personal factors mediating pedestrians' spatial engagement.

But what do we know about public apologies for large scale man-made disasters? Herein we report on results from an experiment with apologies in a multilateral setting: a firm-caused environmental disaster. Subjects read about an oil spill scenario, and learned whether the oil firm made a full apology, a partial apology, or no apology, and whether the firm had a good, bad, or no environmental reputation. A partial apology is one that fails to accept full material responsibility for damages, such as by shifting the blame to another party. We find that full apologies and better reputation reduce the demand for punishment. However, full apologies and reputation are substitutes, with reputation being significantly more important. Additionally, apologies do not reduce the demand for compensation and may increase it if the firm is clearly a bad actor, or if admission of guilt is the only information subjects have. Our results help explain corporate social responsibility investments and greenwashing, and why many public apologies over an environmental disaster are only partial apologies.","[Gilbert, Ben] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [James, Alexander] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Econ & Publ Policy, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",Colorado School of Mines; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Wyoming,"James, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Econ & Publ Policy, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",alex.james@uaa.alaska.edu,"Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X; Gilbert, Benjamin/0000-0001-5729-5047",,,,,49,11,12,4,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

We simulated the impacts arising from the Energy Modeling Forum's broad range of carbon taxes under three revenue recycling options - lump sum redistributions, capital tax reductions, and labor tax cuts. We examined their consequences for industry prices and quantities, for the overall economy, and for the welfare of households, individuals, and society, the latter in terms of efficiency and equity. We rank recycling mechanisms from most to least favorable in terms of the magnitudes of their impacts on net social welfare - efficiency net of equity - recognizing that other objectives may be more important to policy makers and the public. Finally, we and the EMF 32 effort focus only on the economic effects of carbon taxation and revenue recycling; the environmental benefits arising from emissions reductions are not within our scope of study. We find CO2 emissions abatement to be invariant to the chosen recycling scheme. This means that policy makers need not compromise their environmental objectives when designing carbon tax swap options. We also find additional emissions reductions beyond the scope of coverage and points of taxation. Reducing capital taxes promotes new saving, investment and capital formation and is the most favorable recycling mechanism. In 2010 dollars, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $0.19 to $3.90 depending on the path of carbon prices. Reducing labor taxes promotes consumption and work through real-wage incentives and is the next most favorable recycling scheme. Here, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $11.09 to $16.49 depending on the carbon tax trajectory. Lump sum redistribution of carbon tax revenues is the least favorable recycling option. It incentivizes neither capital nor labor. Consequently, the damages to the economy and welfare are the greatest among the three schemes. With lump sum recycling, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $37.15 to $43.61 as carbon taxation becomes more aggressive. While this ranking is common among the participating EMF 32 models, the spread in our results is the greatest in comparison which we attribute to the substitution possibilities inherent in IGEM's econometrics, the absence of barriers to factor mobility, and likely differences in the manner in which tax incentives are structured. We find welfare gains are possible under capital and labor tax recycling when emissions accounting is viewed from a top-down rather than a bottom-up perspective and carbon pricing is at an economy-wide average. However, these gains occur at the expense of abatement. We find capital tax recycling to be regressive while labor tax recycling is progressive as is redistribution through lump sums. Moreover, we find that the lump sum mechanism provides the best means for sheltering the poorest from the welfare consequences of carbon taxation. Thus, promoting capital formation is the best use of carbon tax revenues in terms of reducing the magnitudes of welfare losses while the lump sum and labor tax options are the best uses for reducing inequality.","[Jorgenson, Dale W.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 122, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Goettle, Richard J.] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Goettle, Richard J.] Dale Jorgenson Associates, 433 NH Route,119 East Fitzwilliam, Fitzwilliam, NH 03447 USA; [Ho, Mun S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, 29 Oxford St,G2C, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wilcoxen, Peter J.] Brookings Inst, 1775 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Wilcoxen, Peter J.] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, 426 Eggars Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Harvard University; Northeastern University; Harvard University; Brookings Institution; Syracuse University,"Goettle, RJ (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Goettle, RJ (通讯作者)，Dale Jorgenson Associates, 433 NH Route,119 East Fitzwilliam, Fitzwilliam, NH 03447 USA.",r.goettle@northeastern.edu,"Ho, Mun/ABI-4730-2020",,,,,,15,14,14,1,31,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

As a determinant, I focus on affiliation ties, which are the relationships between issuers' board members and the underwriters with which these members have worked. Using board members' biographical information, I find that the presence of board members who have worked at a specific bank or its parent company increases the probability of choosing the bank as the lead underwriter. This effect is economically larger than that of lending relationships and remains even if the issuer has no lending and shareholding relationships with the underwriter. In addition, the effect is more pronounced when firms with small issues choose high-reputation underwriters, suggesting that affiliation ties can help firms with small issues, which would usually not be accepted by reputable underwriters, to be underwritten by reputable underwriters. I find little evidence that affiliation ties affect IPO outcomes, as measured by price revisions and underwriting fees.","[Takahashi, Hidenori] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Takahashi, H (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",hidenori.takahashi@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Takahashi, Hidenori/I-1231-2019; Takahashi, Hidenori/J-2153-2016","Takahashi, Hidenori/0000-0003-4801-3540; Takahashi, Hidenori/0000-0001-8017-7882","JSPS KAKENHI [JP16K17167]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K17167, 16H02027, 16H03668] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",I am grateful to Hirofumi Uchida for his support and comments.

Our results suggest that the unemployment rate in Spain has jumped to much higher levels while switching between equilibria or, what is the same, because of structural change.

The GCC region is facing new economic reforms as a result of low oil prices when oil is the main product of GDP in GCC. In addition, GCC impose tax in 2018 that would affect economy negatively due to lowering in purchase power. Based on lower prices of oil, Saudi Arabia released a plan called Vision 2030. This vision was announced in 26 April 2016 by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. The main reason behind this vision is to diversify economy. The FDI is one of the most important indicators to realize this diversity of economy. In this study, the data was collected through the United Nations Conference of Trade and Development, World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) databases. The data was analyzed through fixed-effects model and random-effects model. The GDP is found to have a significant and positive impact on FDI. The Arab Spring affected the FDI negatively and significantly through the period of the study.","[Alharthi, Majed] King Abdulaziz Univ, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",King Abdulaziz University,"Alharthi, M (通讯作者)，King Abdulaziz Univ, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,3,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-77-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,34,46,,10.20472/EFC.2018.010.002,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505164900002,0

One of the most questionable is the assumption of a causal relationship of interest rate and a tendency to saving. Above all due to the contradictory impacts of the substitution and income effects, the empirical results so far are ambiguous, not very robust and thus not quite stable. The aim of this work is to test a new method of verifying this relationship by dividing households into income categories according to their position in distribution of disposable income combined with the use of different types of market interest rates doing so on the example of the Czech Republic. As indicated by the initial results achieved through panel regression, this new approach could become a relevant enrichment of the interest rate pass-through analysis in relation to households. Repeatedly obtaining of unambiguous and stable results then may significantly assist the central bank in implementing of monetary policy.","[Badura, Ondrej] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Badura, O (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",ondrej.badura@vsb.cz,,,"Students Grant Project EkF, VSB-TU Ostrava [SP2017/110]","Students Grant Project EkF, VSB-TU Ostrava","This paper has been funded by a grant from Students Grant Project EkF, VSB-TU Ostrava within the project SP2017/110.",,24,0,0,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Empowerment is defined as the decision-making ability of a woman regarding her strategic and non-strategic life choices. Grounded in the Capability Approach and in the gender economics literature this conceptualisation accounts for three key elements: resources, values/traditions, and decision-outcomes. These elements interact into a system of structural equations where a latent variable is specified to measure empowerment; decision-outcomes enter as partial metrics of empowerment; and resources, and values/traditions are modelled as exogenous factors. Stochastic dominance analysis is used to compare the empowerment status of women across life choices.","[Ballon, Paola] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Sch Geog & Environm, REACH Programme, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Oxford,"Ballon, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Sch Geog & Environm, REACH Programme, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",paola.ballon@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Ballon, Paola/I-4851-2015","Ballon, Paola/0000-0002-0373-171X",,,,,62,12,15,3,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The CEECs are one of the most open economies worldwide those have undergone different types of shocks and structural changes during the last two decades. This raise a question: are the CEECs more sensitive to the external shocks compared to most developed countries worldwide? The main findings are that the CEECs with higher share of final domestic consumption and export are more vulnerable to the domestic and global shocks. The CEECs with higher share of gross value added by agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing, manufacturing, wholesale, retail trade, restaurants and hotels, transport, storage, and communications are more sensitive to different shocks, while these economic activities are focused on domestic market. Higher concentration and diversification of import portfolio of the CEECs affect higher volatility of real GDP. In other words, in the CEECs where import is concentrated on several products and similarity of the import structure between a given CEEC and the rest of the world is lower, volatility of real GDP is higher. In conclusion, the empirical results provide substantial evidence that the CEECs are more vulnerability to the domestic and external shocks.","[Deltuvaite, Vilma] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Finance, K Donelaicio G 73, LT-44949 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Deltuvaite, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Finance, K Donelaicio G 73, LT-44949 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vilma.deltuvaite@ktu.lt,,,Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-016/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. MIP-016/2015) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,6,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68762-9; 978-3-319-68761-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,81,87,,10.1007/978-3-319-68762-9_9,0.0,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL3UH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450036900009,0

Building on earlier work that shows that low oil prices are regularly followed by geopolitical strife, and that the latter is usually followed by higher oil prices, due to actual or feared disruption in oil supply, we focus in this paper on one particular factor. Which geopolitical events are most likely to lead to sustained supply disruptions? Using discrete wavelet analysis of oil production at the country level, we find that military conflicts that destroy production installations or disrupt oil transportation networks are the most significant antecedents of sustained, long term, disruptions in oil supply; whereas nonviolent regime change, internal political strife, and low level geopolitical tensions have more limited sustained impact. We discuss a framework to analyze whether conflict-related disruptions to oil supply could be endogenous to the oil cycle and offer some policy considerations for ameliorating that cycle's impacts.","[El-Gamal, Mahmoud A.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Jaffe, Amy Myers] Council Foreign Relat, Energy & Environm Director, Program Energy Secur & Climate Change, 58 East 68th St, New York, NY 10065 USA",Rice University,"Jaffe, AM (通讯作者)，Council Foreign Relat, Energy & Environm Director, Program Energy Secur & Climate Change, 58 East 68th St, New York, NY 10065 USA.",ajaffe@cfr.org,,,,,,,18,19,19,1,14,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

We use the ARDL bounds testing approach to deal with problems of autocorrelation and non-stationarity of key variables. Rather than rainfall, we find that it is maximum temperature that has long and short run effects on collective violence, with unidirectional causality from temperature shocks to riots. A one standard deviation increase in maximum temperature over the long run average increases the number of riots by 55 per cent. Return to long run equilibrium after a temperature shock takes approximately 15years. The insignificance of rainfall holds whether we consider rainfall levels or rainfall growth. Given the absence of long run relationships between income levels /growth and riots, it is unlikely that the income channel is the one through which climate affects riots in India. Instead, the evidence suggests a psychological channel through which temperature affects riots in India, with hotter temperatures being associated with increased levels of aggression.","[Gangopadhyay, Partha] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, Discipline Econ Finance & Property, Sydney, Australia; [Nilakantan, Rahul] Gokhale Inst Polit & Econ, Dept Econ, Pune, Maharashtra, India",Western Sydney University; Gokhale Institute of Politics & Economics,"Gangopadhyay, P (通讯作者)，Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Bankstown Campus,Bldg 20,Off 1-21,Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",P.Gangopadhyay@uws.edu.au,,"Gangopadhyay, Partha/0000-0001-6841-7791",,,,,44,9,9,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

We compare the average ROE and ROA ratios for the largest Czech entities with those achieved by the largest companies in Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Switzerland as the countries are generally considered as tax heavens. Malta is also included in the analysis. The main hypothesis is the conjecture that the Czech companies' corporate income tax base is influenced by transactions with related parties mainly by using royalties and intragroup trades in goods and services i.e. through transfer pricing. As the Czech taxpayers, based on the results of analysis, achieved in 2006-2015 period lower ROE as well as ROA in comparison to the selected countries (with an exemption of Switzerland) it can be concluded that their tax base is likely influenced by aforementioned profit shifting techniques.","[Hajek, Jan] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hajek, Jan] Robert Bosch Odbytova Sro, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hajek, Jan] Vysoka Skola Financni & Spravni As, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Hájek, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.;Hájek, J (通讯作者)，Robert Bosch Odbytova Sro, Prague, Czech Republic.;Hájek, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Financni & Spravni As, Prague, Czech Republic.",xhajj901@vse.cz,,"Hajek, Jan/0000-0002-3341-9436",,,,,40,2,2,1,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The focus was on two areas -the budget of the CAP and the agri-food trade of Poland and the United Kingdom. It was found that the Polish food sector may be particularly affected by the implications of Brexit. On the one hand, the growing pressure to limit spending on the CAP and, on the other, a very likely deterioration in terms of mutual trade in agri-food products will be a problem. In the moderate scenario, which provides relatively small reductions in the CAP expenditure, transfers to Polish agriculture could decrease by almost EUR 290 million on average per year. In the radical scenario, reductions could amount to nearly EUR 1 billion on average per year. In the case of restoring customs tariffs resulting from the WTO Most Favoured Nation Clause, one can expect a breakdown in the Polish exports to the UK of the most important agri-food product groups.","[Kosior, Katarzyna; Ambroziak, Lukasz] Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Kosior, K (通讯作者)，Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",Kosior@ierigz.waw.pl; Ambroziak@ierigz.waw.pl,"Kosior, Katarzyna/HKW-4450-2023","Kosior, Katarzyna/0000-0003-4825-730X; Ambroziak, Lukasz/0000-0001-8708-841X",,,,,12,0,0,1,4,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

Noether's theorem; Hyperbolic spiral; The W. Shubnikov method,,"Behavioral economics is closely related to the theoretical aspects that result from it. An especially important aspect is the problem of equilibrium. Experience shows that stock market investors often behave irrationally. Nevertheless, it was noted that in the long term, their activity is related to the equilibrium surface, which is a rotary cone. The chapter shows how using the method of least squares you can get a spiral line of the vector inverted right perpendicularq(i), p(i), t(i)inverted left perpendicular (p(i)-means the price of the ith good, q(i)-means the amount of the ith good, t(i)-time characterizing a certain economic process) using a hyperbolic spiral which in space creates a equilibrium surface that is a cone. Having a general solution, we can experiment by adopting certain values that are coordinates of the vector, inverted right perpendicularq(i), p(i)inverted left perpendicular, obtaining different cones of economic equilibrium. An important tool used in behavioral economics is game theory. The stock market can be treated as a game without the possibility of concluding a coalition. The chapter shows how to find the stock exchange state number, knowing the stock exchange information matrix and vice versa, how to find the state form of the stock exchange, knowing the stock market state number. In addition, the matrix boundary for the stock market is given, which is also the equilibrium matrix for the ideal economy. According to E. Noether's theorem, certain principles of conservation are associated with every symmetry. There is no equilibrium without symmetry. The third part of the work presents the problem of symmetry of economic quantities using the Shubnikov method. In addition, this chapter discusses the symmetry groups of some of the equilibrium surfaces encountered in economics.","[Kowgier, H.] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Econometr & Stat, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Kowgier, H (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Econometr & Stat, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",kowhenry@interia.eu,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-99187-0; 978-3-319-99186-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,61,76,,10.1007/978-3-319-99187-0_5,0.0,,,16,Behavioral Sciences; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Behavioral Sciences; Business & Economics,BM1WR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000460629400005,0

As part of this it evaluates the role of responsible innovation (RI) within the New Zealand sheep dairy (NZSD) industry and whether this can assist in achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. In the context of agrifood supply chains RI has received little attention despite the fact that these industries have significant environmental, ethical and social impacts. The research also addresses the lack of evidence as how to put RI into practice and the claim that the practical applicability of RI is not possible. The French sheep dairy industry was used as a comparative case study for the New Zealand industry. Information was gathered through a literature search, the comparative case study and interviews with New Zealand and French industry experts. Comparisons were made between the strategic capabilities and structural forces of the sheep dairy industries in both France and New Zealand. The study found that for the NZSD industry to achieve a competitive advantage it would need to pursue a differentiation strategy that focused on customer responsiveness, innovation, sustainability and quality. Furthermore, the study identified that RI had the potential to assist the NZSD industry by providing distinctive competencies to develop a competitive advantage. This is because there were existing resources and capabilities that provided a platform for differentiation. There were also strategic and economic drivers in the NZSD industry that encouraged RI as a competitive strategy. This indicated that for RI to occur there needed to be economic incentives that encouraged companies to pursue this strategy.","[Lees, Nic] Lincoln Univ, Agribusiness Management, Ellesmere Jct Rd, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand; [Lees, Isobel] EU Business Sch, Quai Seujet 18, CH-1201 Geneva, Switzerland",Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Lees, N (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Agribusiness Management, Ellesmere Jct Rd, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand.",nic.lees@lincoln.ac.nz,"Lees, Nicholas/G-2005-2015","Lees, Nicholas/0000-0002-9412-7939",,,,,46,12,12,1,11,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Financial information obtained from a sample of 106 Spanish agricultural cooperatives was used to calculate the variables that modelled the research hypotheses, which were then introduced into regression models to determine which ones had a significant effect on their financing decisions. According to the economic theory of cooperativism, the results show that these entities come closer to the pecking order theory, i.e. policies that maximise the prices received by members to the detriment of the entity's self-financing abilities, coupled with restrictions on cooperatives' equity capital that may lead them to use debt to fund growth. The results also show positive relationships between cooperatives' indebtedness and other factors, such as investments in non-current assets, liquidity and cooperative size in terms of turnover per member.","[Mateos-Ronco, Alicia] Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Res Business Management CEGEA, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Guzman-Asuncion, Sandra] Cooperat Agroalimentaries Comunitat Valenciana, C Caballeros 26, Valencia 46001, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Mateos-Ronco, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Res Business Management CEGEA, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",amateos@cegea.upv.es,"Mateos-Ronco, Alicia/N-8803-2019","Mateos-Ronco, Alicia/0000-0002-1185-1885",,,,,54,11,11,5,31,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Economic theory would suggest that benefits of area-based programs would be capitalized into land prices, as supply is relatively fixed compared to other factors of production. While revealed preference methods have been applied widely in the field of environmental economics, they have not yet been used to evaluate an international development project. We study the effects of The Millennium Villages Project (MVP) in Sauri, Kenya. Using administrative data from the Kenyan government on prices for land bought and sold within the MVP (established in 2005) and for land bought and sold in the surrounding area during 1999-2013, we estimate the project's effect on local land prices. We find no evidence that the MVP investments led to an increase in land prices within project areas.

Fixed-effects models with Driscoll and Kraay standard errors were estimated to control for cross-sectional dependence. Results indicate that price transmission depends on prices previously paid to farmers, variations in export prices and volatility of export prices, which reduces farmer prices in developed countries and it increases them in developing countries. In contrast, marketing margins are reduced by contemporaneous export price volatility and are increased by previous volatility. Exporters in developing countries take more time to transmit shocks in international prices, pay lower prices to farmers and absorb a bigger proportion of price fluctuations. These price transmission imperfections affect investments, technology adoption, production level and quality across the chain in developing countries, which negatively impact farmers, input and service providers, traders and other actors of the beef cattle chain.","[Morales, L.

Researchers used field study to explore in obtaining detail information on fund management system from the research subjects. Research methodology used is case study research using qualitative data approach which combines data derived from semi-structured interview, personal observation, and analysis of documented data. This study found similarities in fund management system in both house of worship, which is centralised at the Head of the Mosque and the Head Priest. Church has formal rules which are centralised at the Head Priest as the policy maker as well as the authority who decides on fund usage in the Church. Mosque also has formal rules on fund management where Mosque officials have the authority to dispense fund. However, in reality Mosque officials ask for the opinion of the Head of Mosque in an informal meeting before making any decision. This study also found similarities in relation to congregation's involvement in fund management system in both Mosque and Church. Although members of the congregations are the main fund providers to both house of worship, there is less involvement from members of the congregations in fund management. This case study argues that a source of the authority and power possessed by the leaders of the house of worships stem from the acceptance of some national cultures and the teachings of the Holy Scripture. Some national cultures and Holy Scriptures are dominant factors in fund management in both house of worship being studied. These findings have implications in understanding fund management system in house of worship in developing countries, especially Indonesia.","[Noormansyah, Irvan; Wulandari, Budiyanti] Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Ekon Indonesia Jakarta, Dept Accounting, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Herdiana, Vina] Securindo Packatama Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia",,"Noormansyah, I (通讯作者)，Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Ekon Indonesia Jakarta, Dept Accounting, Jakarta, Indonesia.",irvan@stei.ac.id; shariza0310@gmail.com; vinaherdiana@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-675-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,73.0,,,,,,83,87,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM7PB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000468277500019,0

The originally proposed innovative lease conceptual models are being analysed and compared in perspective of newly accepted IFRS 16. The substantial change of lessee accounting embodied in IFRS 16 has its origin in the proposed single approach by G4+1 in 1996, resp. 2000.

Drawing on the social psychology perspective on impression management, attributional statements are identified in the corresponding annual reports issued by the company from 2005 to 2011. The results provide partial support for existing literature as corporate narratives were influenced by the inherent scrutiny of a contested privatization. The change in ownership was reflected in a defensive stance of the causal attributions used, although acclaiming tactics were envisaged across the entire period of analysis. However, the study further identifies a distinct period (following the 2008 economic crisis) when the company started to emphasize the positive outcomes of the privatization by adopting a laudatory language.","[Sandulescu, Maria-Silvia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Sandulescu, MS (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",maria.sandulescu@cig.ase.ro,"Sandulescu, Maria-Silvia/IQS-8980-2023",,Bucharest University of Economic Studies,Bucharest University of Economic Studies,This paper was co-financed by The Bucharest University of Economic Studies during the PhD program.,,45,0,0,0,3,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-7-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,284,294,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM3BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461826900025,0

Adhocracy, and the concept underpinning this idea-the requirement of businesses and management teams to respond dynamically to changes in the business environment, is a reality in the globalized competitive landscape. That said, in order to develop coherent and logical strategies to achieve sustainable advantages it is necessary that the organization have reliable information from which to base decisions. Accounting professionals, specifically management accountants embedded within various aspects of the organization, are uniquely positioned to take advantage of these requirements. Organizations and management professionals need quality information to make quality business decisions, and this where accounting professionals who are able to effectively leverage technology can add significant value to the organization. Innovative thinking, creativity, and the ability to effectively use technology to make better business decisions are very possibly the competitive advantage of the twenty-first century.

Studies and policies have focused on the issue of profit shifting and tax avoidance by means of revealing the role of offshore investment hubs in BEPS. FDI analysis stems from the OECD recommendation, which emphasises that FDI could serve as a potential data source for further analysis of the profit-shifting practices of MNEs. Therefore, analysis of the available data for FDI could give a useful indication with respect to the magnitude of BEPS. Data used in this paper were provided partly by the OECD Globalization Database, IMF, and also by the UNCTAD database. The presented paper focuses on the methodology and descriptive statistics of the foreign direct investment (FDI) flows with an emphasis on the Czech Republic. Different FDI reporting methods (BPM5 vs BPM6) present different results and may have impacts on estimates of the BEPS models. The indicator of the level of FDI to GDP demonstrates that even within the EU, there are countries with specific characteristics that may be counted as states with a preferential tax arrangement.","[Vitek, Leos] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Publ Finance, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Vítek, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Publ Finance, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",leos.vitek@vse.cz,"Vitek, Leos/H-5125-2018",,Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [18-14082S],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"The contribution is processed as an output of the research project Ferove korporatni zdaneni: Mereni dopadu presunu zisku na rozpocet Ceske republiky (Fair Corporate Taxation: Measuring the Impact of Profit Shifting on the Budget of the Czech Republic), registered by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic under the registration number 18-14082S.",,11,0,0,0,2,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2283-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,167,174,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL8FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456200200022,0

Based on the field investigation of the debris flow disaster in the middle and lower reaches of the Bailong River, four evaluation factors of aspect, lithology, structure density and seismic density were selected based on the characteristics of debris flow source development. Using deterministic model and gray relation method was used to evaluate the sensitivity of debris flow source. Finally, the factors of source sensitivity, degree of erosion on the slop surface, grove gradient and gully density were selected from the top two terrain and provenance conditions of debris flow. The AHP model was used to analyze the regional debris flow susceptibility Zoning. The results showed that: 59.06% of the debris flow source distribution and 52.03% of the debris flow ditch are located in the high-prone area, 85.62% of the debris flow source distribution and 81.76% of the debris flow ditch is located in the area above the medium-prone area, and the ratio of debris flow area and the source area b/a also increases. It shows that the susceptibility calculation of debris flow based on the analytic hierarchy process is in good agreement with the actual situation, and the result is more ideal.

Using quantitative and qualitative methods, this article investigates the impacts of preference for transit and other residential preferences on residential location choice. Employing preference ranking, logistic regression and ANOVA tests on survey data from the Oslo metropolitan area, we find that individuals with simultaneously high preference for transit and low preference for attributes related to households with children are likely to reside in transit-friendly neighborhoods. Transit preference, while important in residential choice, is more so as second tier after other more important preferences related to lifecycle/demographics are satisfied. Individuals who prefer transit but live in transit-poor zones tend to have higher preference for private garden, a larger number of children, lower income, and are older. Variations in access to transit and transit preference have significant influences on transit use. The results of qualitative interviews are also consistent with these findings and substantiate the mechanism by which the built environment and travel preference affect residential and travel choices.","[Wolday, Fitwi] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, As, Norway; [Cao, Jason] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Naess, Petter] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, As, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Wolday, F (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, As, Norway.",hamdwold@nmbu.no; cao@tunn.edu; petter.nass@nmbu.no,"Wolday, Fitwi/IUP-5835-2023; Cao, Jason/AAE-4374-2020","Cao, Xinyu/0000-0002-4403-9762",Research Council Norway [230313]; US National Science Foundation (SRN) [1444745],Research Council Norway(Research Council of Norway); US National Science Foundation (SRN),Research Council Norway funded the study on which this paper is based (grant no. 230313).

This study is based on annual report data from the top 10 Chinese banks from state-owned (n=5) and domestic (n=5) banks from 2010 to 2016. The factor analysis and the multiple regressions are adopted to examine the differences of two different types of banks in regard to the relationship between capital structure and banking performance. The primary finding was that compared with state-owned banks, debt in domestic banks has a larger negative effect on banking performance. Secondly, it was discovered that the proportion of the largest shareholder positively impacts on bank performance with non-difference between state-owned and domestic banks. The third finding was that the proportion of the top six shareholders negatively impact on bank performance with no differences between state-owned and domestic banks. The finding of the study assists researchers or banking managers to focus on how to increase competitiveness of China banks.","[Wu Pojui] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Macau, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology,"Wu, PJ (通讯作者)，Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Macau, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,DALIAN UNIV TECHNICAL ELECTRONIC & AUDIO-VISUAL PRESS,DALIAN CITY,"NO.80 SOFTWARE PARK ROAD, HI-TECH ZONE, DALIAN CITY, LIAONING PROVINCE 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-202-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,110,115,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7UP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455659900017,0

We show that they are not always substitutes. Efficiency improvement can increase the demand for storage capacity in two scenarios: (1) if it increases water demand; (2) if, as a result of re-optimization of water inventory control, it increases the probability that the storage capacity will be exhausted. We identify properties of water demand and productivity under which the two scenarios will happen, and illustrate the potential complementarity using an empirical example of the California State Water Project. The results are also applicable to choices among infrastructure investment, improved consumption efficiency, and conservation of other storable resources, for example, energy.","[Xie, Yang] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Xie, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",yang.xie@ucr.edu; zilber11@berkeley.edu,"Xie, Yang/AAM-3528-2021",,,,,,129,11,11,1,41,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Significantly positive price and volume responses 2days after publication are observed. While most of this effect dissipates shortly thereafter, some excess returns remain impounded into the stock price. A study of the ex post takeover probabilities suggests that a positive response is justified, as takeover probabilities for such firms subsequently increase. This evidence is consistent with the idea that financial media speculation can facilitate the release of useful private information to shareholders. However, significantly positive excess returns and volume in the few days before publication also suggests that certain shareholders may benefit disproportionately.","[Yost-Bremm, Christopher] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Huang, Emily] Calif State Univ Chico, Chico, CA 95929 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University; California State University System; California State University Chico,"Yost-Bremm, C (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Dept Finance, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",cyostbremm@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,0,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

An important feature of the California trading system was its allowance price containment policies, intended to limit the range of allowance prices. The scope and ambition of the system had been expected to set an example for other states and countries about the efficacy and revenue potential of cap-and-trade systems. However, despite achieving its emissions reductions targets at lower than expected costs, the system has been considered a disappointment in the political arena. A major source of disillusionment with the California system has been its failure to generate the expected amount of revenues that would have contributed to a wide range of public expenditures. The design of the price-containment system, while effective at maintaining a relatively high marginal carbon price, contributes to the wide range of uncertainty over the revenue potential of allowance sales.","[Bushnell, James B.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bushnell, James B.] NBER, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bushnell, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Bushnell, JB (通讯作者)，NBER, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",JBBushnell@UCDavis.edu,,,,,,,18,2,2,1,14,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We find no support for the idea that an FTT improves market quality by affecting the composition of trading volume. Instead, our results are in line with the hypothesis that a lower trading volume reduces liquidity and in turn market quality. Consistent with theories of asset pricing under transaction costs, we document a shift in security holdings from short-term to long-term investors. Finally, we find that moderate aggregate effects on market quality can mask large adjustments made by individual agents.","[Colliard, Jean-Edouard] HEC Paris, Paris, France; [Hoffmann, Peter] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; European Central Bank,"Colliard, JE (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, Paris, France.",,"Colliard, Jean-Edouard/ACL-7091-2022","Colliard, Jean-Edouard/0000-0003-1936-8641",,,,,40,29,29,2,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Three of the five performance measures explicitly rewarded by CSPIA are reconstructed in this analysis, as are two child support outcomes that were considered for financial rewards but were ultimately rejected. Using a panel interrupted time series model with state fixed effects and state-specific trends, this analysis finds that CSPIA had a statistically positive impact on just one rewarded performance goal, cost-effectiveness, and negatively impacted an unrewarded child support outcome-collections sent to other states. Effect sizes suggest that CSPIA had little impact on child support performance, on balance. These results provide more evidence to the ongoing debate about the ability of performance incentives to improve public sector performance. It also suggests that reforming performance systems in response to perceived problems may create new gaming responses.

As a result, for many low-income adults, there has been stark variation across states in access to Medicaid since the expansions took effect in 2014. This study investigates whether individuals migrate in order to gain access to these benefits. Using an empirical model in the spirit of a difference-in-differences, this study finds that migration from non-expansion states to expansion states did not increase in 2014 relative to migration in the reverse direction. The estimates are sufficiently precise to rule out a migration effect that would meaningfully affect the number of enrollees in expansion states, which suggests that Medicaid expansion decisions do not impose a meaningful fiscal externality on other states.

Higher levels of crisis sentiment are associated with higher levels of price uncertainty. This effect is strongest for insurers with less exposure to the adverse effects of the financial crisis. Further, crisis sentiment also affects the cross-section of movements in insurer stock prices.

In the present study, we seek to examine whether information asymmetry, the importance of banks in the financial system and systemic risk play significant roles in the evolution of stock crashes in the banking sector. Information asymmetry is proxied by opacity, the importance of a bank in a financial network is proxied by network centrality, and systemic risk is proxied by clustering. The research framework considers a number of regulatory, reporting and financial market factors that have also been determined to relate to stock crashes and shows that all of the above factors are related to (idiosyncratic) stock crash risk under specific conditions.

This study aimed to assess the potential of e-bikes for low-carbon commuting by analysing a-bike commuters' motives, travel behaviour and experiences. We GPS-tracked outdoor movements of 24 e-bike users in the Netherlands for two weeks and used their mapped travel behaviour as input for follow-up in-depth interviews. Most participants commuted by e-bike, alternated with car use. E-bike use was highest in work-related, single-destination journeys. It gave participants the benefits of conventional cycling over motorized transport (physical, outdoor activity) while mitigating relative disadvantages (longer travel time, increased effort). The positive experience of e-bike use explained the tolerance for longer trip durations compared to other modes of transportation. Participants were inclined to make detours in order to access more enjoyable routes. Results demonstrate that a-bikes can substitute motorized commuting modes on distances perceived to be too long to cover by regular bike, and stress the importance of positive experience in e-bike commuting. This provides impetus for future actions to encourage commuting by e-bike.","[Plazier, Paul A.; Weitkamp, Gerd; van den Berg, Agnes E.] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Cultural Geog, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Plazier, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Cultural Geog, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands.",p.a.plazier@rug.nl,,,TGRG,TGRG,"An earlier version of this paper was presented to Current and Emerging Research in Transport Session, organised by the Transport Geography Research Group (RGS-IBG), RGS, London (1st September 2016).

For each greenway, we also analyzed the variables influencing its use (characteristics of the greenways, population, landscape, climate and season). Using the most significant variables, we have developed three different linear regression models (I: all 13 counters; II: sub sample of 10 mountain counters; III: sub sample of 9 homogeneous mountain counters) having as the dependent variable the monthly users number, in order to assess the combination more able to describe the studied phenomenon. The three models have a significant chi(2), meaning that the regressors are jointly significantly different from zero, thus the set of our explanatory variables plays a role in estimating greenways monthly potential users. The use of a greenway is influenced mainly by the population level of education, the tourists number, the richness of historical and architectural resources, the degree of accessibility of the trail and by the month of the year. The population aged under 15 and over 64, the degree of urbanization influence negatively the use. Although additional researches are needed, the model defined may have potential application in the forecasting studies to estimate existing or proposed greenways use.

Additionally, monetary restrictions only lead to an increase in trade credit in low or moderate sovereign risk countries.","[Cantero Saiz, Maria; Sanfilippo Azofra, Sergio; Torre Olmo, Begona; Lopez Gutierrez, Carlos] Univ Cantabria, Ave Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Cantabria, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Sáiz, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Ave Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Cantabria, Spain.",canterom@unican.es; sanfilis@unican.es; torreb@unican.es; lopezgc@unican.es,"Torre, Begoña/JJD-5456-2023; Lopez-Gutierrez, Carlos/E-6023-2017","Lopez-Gutierrez, Carlos/0000-0003-1703-6440; Sanfilippo Azofra, Sergio/0000-0001-8941-2033","University of Cantabria Foundation for Education and Research in the Financial Sector (UCEIF Foundation), Santander Financial Institute (SANFI)","University of Cantabria Foundation for Education and Research in the Financial Sector (UCEIF Foundation), Santander Financial Institute (SANFI)","This work was supported by University of Cantabria Foundation for Education and Research in the Financial Sector (UCEIF Foundation), Santander Financial Institute (SANFI).",,89,14,15,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

In comparison to earlier studies, it uses a much larger sample including 30 years of data for 515 firms, and also considers a much wider set of possible determinants of insolvency risk. The empirical results suggest that macroeconomic and firm-specific factors both play important roles. Other key findings are the following: insolvency risk varies across firms depending on their business lines; there is default clustering in the GI industry; different reinsurance levels also affect the insolvency risk of insurance firms. The implications of these findings for regulators of GI firms under the newly launched Solvency II are discussed. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Liquidity commonality across currencies increases during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and the 2009-2011 European sovereign debt crisis, which affirms the spiral effect between funding liquidity and FX market liquidity. The effect of funding constraint on liquidity in the FX market may be through carry trade activities that link the FX market and other classes of asset markets, as suggested by Melvin and Taylor (2009) and Banti (2016). The shift in liquidity commonality around the release of macroeconomic announcements also can be related to the spurs of unwinding carry trade positions in response to unexpected macro shock that affects interest rate differential. In contrast, quantitative easing (QE) policies in the United States, which inject high capital inflows into financial markets, are associated with decreased liquidity commonality, implying that QE implementation actually improves the funding liquidity and weakens the spiral effect, ultimately inducing weaker commonality in FX liquidity.

However, minimal progress has been made in identifying the key mechanisms that help explain why some urban areas have low rates of upward mobility while others have rates of upward mobility that resemble the most mobile nations in the developed world. In this article we focus attention on one specific dimension of urban areas, the level of violent crime. Using longitudinal data and an array of empirical approaches, we find strong evidence that the level of violent crime in a county has a causal effect on the level of upward economic mobility among individuals raised in families at the 25th percentile of the income distribution. We find that a one standard deviation decline in violent crime as experienced during late adolescence increases the expected income rank in adulthood by at least 2 points. Similarly, a one standard deviation decline in the murder rate increases the expected income rank by roughly 1.5 points. These effect sizes are statistically and economically significant. Although we are limited in our capacity to provide evidence on the mechanisms explaining the link between crime and mobility, we present suggestive results showing that the decline in the violent crime rate reduced the prevalence of high school dropouts at the county level between 1990 and 2010.

This paper examines the effects of changes in labor regulations on the incidence of formal employment. Using the case of Egypt, we study the effects of the introduction of more flexible labor regulations in 2003 on the probability that non-contractual workers will be granted a formal employment contract. To identify the effect of the law and control for potential confounding factors, we use a difference-in-difference estimator that measures the difference in the pre- and post-law probability of obtaining a formal contract across a treatment group of non-contractual workers initially employed in formal firms and a comparison group of non-contractual workers initially employed in informal firms. The latter serve as a useful comparison group since informal firms are unlikely to formalize as a result of the law, so that the only way their workers can become formal is to move to another firm. Our findings show that the passage of the new labor law did in fact increase the probability of transitioning to formal employment for noncontractual workers employed in formal firms by about 3-3.5 percentage points, or the equivalent of at least a fifth of informal workers in formal firms.","[Wahba, Jackline] Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Assaad, Ragui] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 301 19th Ave 307, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Southampton; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Wahba, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",j.wahba@soton.ac.uk,,"Wahba, Jackline/0000-0002-0002-3443; Assaad, Ragui/0000-0002-2608-5335",Economic Research Forum (ERF),Economic Research Forum (ERF),Financial support from the Economic Research Forum (ERF) is gratefully acknowledged.,,31,16,18,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Public, bailed-out and poorly capitalized banks responded to sovereign stress by purchasing domestic public debt more than other banks, consistent with both the moral suasion and the carry trade hypothesis. Public banks' purchases grew especially in coincidence with the largest ECB liquidity injections, which therefore reinforced the moral suasion mechanism. Bank exposures significantly amplified the impact of sovereign stress on bank lending to domestic firms, as well as on lending by foreign subsidiaries of stressed-country banks to firms in non-stressed countries. Altogether, our evidence connects this amplification effect and its cross-border transmission to the moral suasion exerted by domestic governments on banks during the crisis.","[Altavilla, Carlo] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Pagano, Marco; Simonelli, Saverio] Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy",European Central Bank; University of Naples Federico II,"Altavilla, C (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,"PAGANO, MARCO/AAD-8218-2022","PAGANO, MARCO/0000-0002-0709-6119",CEPR/Assonime RELTIF Programme; EIEF,CEPR/Assonime RELTIF Programme; EIEF,"We thank the editor (Alex Edmans) and an anonymous referee for very helpful suggestions.

In particular, before, during, and after the crisis, investors in large and systemic U.S. BHCs seemed to penalize leverage, albeit temporarily. Both before and after the crisis, they reward size in the short run. This pattern is appearing only briefly during the crisis. We also show that bank opacity plays no role in market valuation either in the short run or in the long run.

We consider a general equilibrium model with firm dynamics to evaluate the redistributive impact of changing the tradability of ITQs. A change in tradability would happen, for example, if permits are allowed to be traded as a separate asset from ownership of an active firm. If the property right is associated with ownership of an active firm, the permit can be leased in each period but it is not possible to exit the industry and keep the right. However, allowing the permits to be traded as a separate asset has two effects. First, it leads to a greater concentration of production in the industry. Second, it directly converts a non-tradable asset into a tradable one, and this is equivalent to giving a lump sum transfer to all firms. The first effect implies a concentration in revenues, while the second implies a redistribution of wealth. We calibrate our model to match the observed increase in revenue inequality in the Northeast Multispecies (Groundfish) U.S. Fishery. We show that although observed revenue inequality-measured by the Gini coefficient-increases by 12 %, wealth inequality is reduced by 40 %.","[Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria] ITAM, Ctr Invest Econ, Ave Camino Santa Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico; [Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria] Univ Vigo, Escuela Comercio, Calle Torrecedeira 105, Vigo 36208, Spain; [Sempere, Jaume] El Colegio Mexico, Camino Ajusco 20, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Universidade de Vigo; Colegio de Mexico,"Da-Rocha, JM (通讯作者)，ITAM, Ctr Invest Econ, Ave Camino Santa Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico.;Da-Rocha, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Escuela Comercio, Calle Torrecedeira 105, Vigo 36208, Spain.",jmrocha@uvigo.es; jsempe@colmex.mx,"Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/Y-7181-2018; Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/CAJ-5410-2022; Sempere, Jaume/L-1308-2014","Da-Rocha, Jose-Maria/0000-0003-3985-8816; Sempere, Jaume/0000-0001-6768-8565","European Commission (MYFISH) [FP7-KBBE-2011-5, 289257]; European Commission (MINOUW) [H2020-SFS-2014-2, 634495]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-39098-C06-00]; Xunta de Galicia [GRC 2015/014]; Xunta de Galicia (ECOBAS)",European Commission (MYFISH); European Commission (MINOUW); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Xunta de Galicia (ECOBAS)(Xunta de Galicia),"Helpful comments and suggestions from David Finnoff, three anonymous referees, and conference participants at the World Congress of Environmental and Resource Economics (Istanbul, Turkey) and the 2013 ICES Annual Science Conference (Reikiavik, Iceland) are gratefully acknowledged.

We study a group incentive mechanism (team output is shared equally among team members) and a hierarchical mechanism (team output is allocated by a team leader). We find that output is higher when a leader has the power to allocate output, but this mechanism also generates large differences between earnings of leaders and other team members. When team members can choose how much of team output is to be shared equally and how much is to be allocated by a leader they tend to restrict the leader's power to distributing less than half of the pie.

In a laboratory experiment, participants play a modified Dictator game with third-party punishment and we elicit punishment decisions both in isolation and after providing information about peers' average punishment. Results show that social influence is a major driver of third-party punishment: after receiving information on peers' average punishment, participants revise initial punishment choices and seek conformity. Social influence effects are stronger when peers punished more than the individual punisher and conformity implies revising punishment upward. Adding to the information on peers' punishment the possibility for other participants to sanction or reward with an emoticon the choices of the individual punisher does not change results. Our findings contrast with the predictions of major theories of social preferences and are only explained by special cases of models incorporating aversion to norm-breaking. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Health insurance systems that distinguish between the two sectors of employment create incentives or disincentives to start a business for different individuals. We estimate a discrete time hazard rate model of entry into self-employment based on representative household panel data for Germany, which include individual health information. The results indicate that an increase in the health insurance cost differential between self-employed workers and paid employees by a,notsign10 per month decreases the probability of entry into self-employment by 1.7% of the annual entry rate. This shows that entrepreneurship lock, which an emerging literature describes for the system of employer-provided health insurance in the USA, can also occur in a public health insurance system.

Recent years have witnessed considerable interest in cognitive logics employed by entrepreneurs. A growing body of literature examines factors contributing to the relative reliance on causal and effectual reasoning as entrepreneurs attempt to launch and grow new ventures, with evidence suggesting expert entrepreneurs engage more heavily in effectual reasoning than do novice entrepreneurs. The present study examines the mediating role of cognitive logic in explaining venture performance in differing cultural contexts. A series of hypotheses are tested using a sample of 3411 new ventures started by student entrepreneurs from 24 countries based on the Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students' Survey. The findings indicate that both venture cognitive logics have positive effects on new venture performance and serve as mediators in the culture-performance relationship. Based on these findings, we conclude entrepreneurial reasoning is shaped not only by personal characteristics of entrepreneurs but also by aspects of the cultural context.","[Laskovaia, Anastasiia; Shirokova, Galina; Morris, Michael H.] St Petersburg Univ, Grad Sch Management, 3 Volkhovsky Pereulok, St Petersburg 199004, Russia; [Morris, Michael H.] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business Adm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Saint Petersburg State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Laskovaia, A (通讯作者)，St Petersburg Univ, Grad Sch Management, 3 Volkhovsky Pereulok, St Petersburg 199004, Russia.",a.laskovaya@gsom.pu.ru; shirokova@gsom.pu.ru; michael.morris@warrington.ufl.edu,"Laskovaia, Anastasiia/B-4874-2015; Shirokova, Galina/A-9164-2014","Laskovaia, Anastasiia/0000-0002-6283-5025; Shirokova, Galina/0000-0002-3232-1752; Morris, Michael/0000-0003-2784-410X",Russian Science Foundation [14-18-01093]; Russian Science Foundation [14-18-01093] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),This research has been conducted with financial support from Russian Science Foundation grant (project No. 14-18-01093).,,130,77,86,5,102,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Although this market is the world's largest financial market in terms of nominal value, there has been basically no academic research on profitability owing to missing data. To address this problem, a new analytical method has been developed. Using this new method, the study shows that interest rate derivatives have been a substantial source of profitability that have netted a total average annual profit of more than USD 82 billion for banks since 2009. Furthermore, the study shows that counterparty type, market position (i.e. being one of the Top 5 banks), and trade currency are determinants of the profitability of a trade. For other features of a trade, such as duration or notional amount, no correlation with profitability is found. Finally, the impact of changes of the market structure on profitability driven by regulatory initiatives is discussed qualitatively.","[Meyer, Ralf] EBS Univ, EBS Business Sch, Dept Finance Accounting & Real Estate, Gustav Stresemann Ring 3, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany",European Business School (EBS) University,"Meyer, R (通讯作者)，EBS Univ, EBS Business Sch, Dept Finance Accounting & Real Estate, Gustav Stresemann Ring 3, D-65189 Wiesbaden, Germany.",ralfmeyer17@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

We employ single and multiple treatment matching together with rich data on US adolescents to explore the relationship between personality traits and their combinations on school attrition. Using the Big Five inventory, we find that introversion, and to a lesser extent neuroticism, are individually associated with higher probabilities of dropping out from school. Multiple treatment estimates show that blends of low levels of conscientiousness and neuroticism present higher likelihoods of an early exit. Furthermore, we exploit information on forgone health care and explore its role as a predictor of dropout, potentially proxying relevant traits associated with psychological maturity of judgement such as responsibility, perspective and temperance. These traits refer to the capacity of assessing the long-term consequences of actions and may influence an individual's decision-making process, including dropout choices. Forgone health care appears to be a statistically significant predictor of dropout throughout our models. Individuals who forgo their health care and present low conscientiousness and introversion have the highest risk of dropout. Overall, our results are robust to alternative specifications and increasing levels of selection on unobservables. We suggest that given its predictive power, forgone health care could be used as a signalling device to help identifying individuals at higher risk of school dropout. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Yet while this literature has produced hundreds of rich empirical case studies, there has to date been no attempt to systematically analyze this case literature for lessons regarding the antecedents and consequences of the key outcome of upgrading. This paper undertakes a systematic analysis of a representative sample of 45 case studies of primary product and light manufacturing industries in developing countries. These studies were coded for factors involved in initiating and sustaining upgrading processes, the results of upgrading, and the role of local institutions in these processes. We find that contrary to the major assumptions of the literature, advanced-country buyers are not the main force in the initiation of industrial upgrading. Rather, in most cases, developing-country firms initiate upgrades when pushed by shocks of market vulnerability, usually produced by state policies, that force them to seek to change their status quo operations. Once initiated, upgrading processes can produce a wide spectrum of results from little to no advancement in market position (`treadmilling') to vaulting to the forefront of a global industry (`leaps forward') on the basis of the sources of learning present in the local institutional environment, such as state agencies and business associations. We also identify conditions under which state participation in upgrading processes can lead to increased local institutional capacity: Together, these findings suggest a framework for upgrading that we refer to as an 'induced search' model. This model has important implications for future research on the dynamics of industrial upgrading in developing countries, techniques of state intervention, and processes of mutually supportive learning between actors in the public and private sector.

If so, how do gender differences in conservation-related attitudes help or hinder sustaining the commons? Since biases ingrained in community norms and expectations often exclude women from decision making in co-management, it is imperative to find plausible answers to these queries in order to understand gender relations and cooperation in co-management. To this end, the authors conducted psychometric surveys and trust experiments on 196 forest-dependent households in West Bengal, India during 2009-2010. The findings suggest that, despite an overall negative perception about women's involvement in co-management, women are more conservation friendly and pro-social than men. It is also noticed that forest biomass and forest incomes as the indicators of sustainability have increased in those forest communities where women's proportional strength as decision makers is greater and people hold an overall positive conservation attitude.","[Ray, Biswajit; Mukherjee, Promita] Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, 56 A BT Rd, Kolkata 700050, W Bengal, India; [Bhattacharya, Rabindra N.] Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata, India",University of Calcutta; Jadavpur University,"Ray, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, 56 A BT Rd, Kolkata 700050, W Bengal, India.",biswajitraycu@gmail.com; promita0705@gmail.com; rnbeco@gmail.com,"Ray, Biswajit/ABF-8108-2021","Ray, Biswajit/0000-0002-4280-9532","DRS-I, Department of Economics, University of Calcutta","DRS-I, Department of Economics, University of Calcutta","The authors thank the Associate Editor, two anonymous referees, Tushar Nandi, Basudeb Biswas and the participants at the 21st Annual Conference of EAERE, 2015 in Helsinki and the 25th Annual IAFFE Conference, 2016 in Galway, Ireland for their helpful comments.

Based on the data of 25 cities in China's Yangtze River Delta region during 1995-2014, this paper uses the (continuous) difference-in-differences model to investigate the influence of HSR on urban service industry agglomeration. The results show that HSR has a positive effect on the urban service industry agglomeration of the cities located along the rail lines. Compared with cities not located along the rail lines, HSR does not weaken the service industry agglomeration of the medium and small-sized cities that are also situated along the rail lines and around the core city. The service intensity of HSR, which is measured by train service frequency, also exhibits a significant effect on the service industry agglomeration of those cities located along the rail lines. Higher levels of HSR service intensity have a greater effect on urban service industry agglomeration. In addition, we further subdivide the category of service industry into producer service, consumer service, and public service industries. We find that HSR has a significant impact on producer service industry agglomeration, but HSR's influences on consumer service industry and public service industry are insignificant.","[Shao, Shuai; Tian, Zhihua] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Finance & Econ Res, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Yang, Lili] Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, Sch Int Econ & Trade, Shanghai 201209, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance,"Yang, LL (通讯作者)，Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, Sch Int Econ & Trade, Shanghai 201209, Peoples R China.",lii10910@126.com,"shao, shuai/T-5404-2019; Lili, Yang/JVO-5383-2024","Shao, Shuai/0000-0002-9525-6310; Tian, Zhihua/0000-0002-0868-7287","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373153, 71503168, 71773075]; Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Fund Project [2015BJB005]; Shanghai Education Development Foundation; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [14SG32]; Shanghai University of Finance and Economics for Postgraduate [CXJJ-2017-450]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Fund Project; Shanghai Education Development Foundation; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (SHMEC)); Shanghai University of Finance and Economics for Postgraduate,"We acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71373153, 71503168, and 71773075), Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Fund Project (No. 2015BJB005), the Shuguang Program supported by Shanghai Education Development Foundation and Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (No. 14SG32), and the Innovation Fund of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics for Postgraduate (No. CXJJ-2017-450).",,38,246,260,45,380,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

This paper uses panel data from India spanning from 1956 to 1999 to investigate the ability of farmers to adapt. To identify adaptation, the author exploits persistent, multidecadal monsoon regimes during which droughts or floods are more common. These regimes generate medium-run variation in average rainfall, and there is spatial variation in the timing of the regimes. Using a fixed-effects strategy, she tests whether farmers have adapted to the medium-run rainfall variation induced by the monsoon regimes. The author finds evidence that farmers adjust their irrigation investments and their crop portfolios in response to the medium-run rainfall variation. However, adaptation only recovers a small fraction of the profits farmers have lost due to adverse climate variation.","[Taraz, Vis] Smith Coll, Dept Econ, Pierce Hall,21 West St, Northampton, MA 01063 USA",Smith College,"Taraz, V (通讯作者)，Smith Coll, Dept Econ, Pierce Hall,21 West St, Northampton, MA 01063 USA.",vtaraz@smith.edu,,,,,,,63,49,61,4,33,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

This paper contributes to this literature by performing an evaluation of exchange rate forecasts of reference models in time and frequency. While the literature has usually addressed the performance of exchange rate models relative to the random walk in time only, this paper studies whether this relative per formance is uniform along different frequencies or whether it is driven by certain frequencies. The main finding of this paper is that the predictability of exchange rates varies along the different frequencies. Furthermore, the absence of the high frequency component leads to many cases in which the random walk is outperformed.","[Caraiani, Petre] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Caraiani, P (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest, Romania.",caraiani@ipe.ro,"Caraiani, Petre/E-9082-2018","Caraiani, Petre/0000-0002-7526-580X","CNCSIS - UEFISCSU [PNII IDEI, 42/2.09.2013]",CNCSIS - UEFISCSU(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)),"This work was supported by CNCSIS - UEFISCSU, project number PNII IDEI nr. 42/2.09.2013.",,35,10,11,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

It is debatable whether green electricity defaults conform to this latter intention. Using two design elements from existing electricity markets, costly opt-out of contracts and green electricity certificates, preferences for an electricity mix are elicited in an incentivized laboratory experiment. This study then assesses whether preferences in the absence of default options match with preferences in the presence of default options. It turns out that the alignment of default intentions and preferences depends on the relative price for green electricity. Green electricity defaults at low price premia, as currently applied in several electricity markets, do not match subjects' preferences. The findings are relevant for the design of green electricity defaults.","[Ghesla, Claus] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, IED, Clausiusstr 37,CLD C10, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Ghesla, C (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, IED, Clausiusstr 37,CLD C10, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",claus.ghesla@econ.gess.ethz.ch,,,Swiss Federal Office of Energy [SI/501109-01],Swiss Federal Office of Energy,"This research is supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy under the research program Energy-Economy-Society (EES) (contract number: SI/501109-01).

This article extends previous literature and examines time varying safe haven properties versus equities and bonds of four precious metals (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) across eleven countries. Results suggest that the metals each play safe haven roles; there are times when one metal is not while another may be a safe haven against an asset. The second part of this article attempts to identify robust economic and political determinants of precious metals safe haven properties applying zero-inflated Poisson regression (ZIP) and extreme bound analysis (EBA). Economic Policy Uncertainty is found to be a positive and robust determinant of a precious metal being a safe haven. This holds across countries. Stock volatility, exchange rates, interest rate and credit spreads are also found to be significant, but results are quite mixed for different markets and are fragile of model specification.","[Li, Sile; Lucey, Brian M.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Li, SL (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Business Sch, Dublin 2, Ireland.",lisi@tcd.ie; blucey@tcd.ie,"lucey, brian/AAY-3885-2021","lucey, brian/0000-0002-4052-8235",,,,,38,95,96,3,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

Significant abnormal volumes and order imbalances are found around rating changes, and the extent to which each investor group (domestic individuals, domestic institutions, or foreign investors) reacts to a rating change varies.

While a peg can be beneficial when the recession originates domestically, we show that a float dominates in the face of deflationary demand shocks abroad.

We show that such information raises the average willingness to pay for self-protection while it increases the average willingness to pay for self-insurance if health and wealth are complements (i.e. the marginal utility of wealth rises with health).","[Crainich, David] CNRS, UMR 9221, LEM, Lille, France; [Crainich, David; Eeckhoudt, Louis] Ieseg Sch Management, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France; [Eeckhoudt, Louis] LEM, UMR 9221, Lille, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); IESEG School of Management; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Crainich, D (通讯作者)，CNRS, UMR 9221, LEM, Lille, France.;Crainich, D (通讯作者)，Ieseg Sch Management, 3 Rue Digue, F-59000 Lille, France.",d.crainich@ieseg.fr,,"Crainich, David/0000-0001-6387-888X",,,,,30,5,5,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

This paper examines the moderating roles of the founder's experience and innovation degree on the relationship between opportunity confidence and new value creation intention (NVCI) at the pre-founding stage of a business. For this purpose, it uses survey data from 157 prospective entrepreneurs in the ICT industry from university incubators in Iran. Using SEM, we find that experience, alone, does not moderate the relationship between opportunity confidence and NVCI. However, if entrepreneurs have required opportunity confidence, then medium and high-level innovation can increase the likelihood of acting on the opportunity for novice and experienced entrepreneurs, respectively. For novice entrepreneurs, the innovation variance from low to medium moderates the relationship between opportunity confidence and intent. In fact, this relationship is strengthened by the medium novelty level. Whereas, for experienced entrepreneurs, the variance from medium to high, moderates the relationship that is strengthened by the high novelty level.","[Emami, Amir] Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn, Turin, Italy; [Dimov, Dimo] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England",Polytechnic University of Turin; University of Bath,"Emami, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn, Turin, Italy.",amir.emami@polito.it; d.p.dimov@bath.ac.uk,"Emami, Amir/H-4619-2018","Emami, Amir/0000-0002-2680-8628; Dimov, Dimo/0000-0003-0894-7736; , Amir/0000-0002-5813-6782",,,,,82,38,40,3,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Empirically, however, extrinsic motivation is rarely investigated. To explore the predictive validity of these theories of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in work settings, we tested how both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation affected supervisor-rated work performance, affective and continuance commitment, turnover intention, burnout, and work-family conflict. In the course of three studies (two cross-sectional and one cross-lagged) across different industries, we found that intrinsic motivation was associated with positive outcomes and that extrinsic motivation was negatively related or unrelated to positive outcomes.

Using several readability and disclosure size measures from computational linguistics, we test our hypotheses using a cross-sectional sample of stand-alone CSR reports issued by large U.S. companies. We find that increased CSR disclosure and more readable CSR reports are associated with better CSR performance. Our findings suggest that extending CSR disclosure increases transparency regarding firms' social and environmental performance, while using less-readable language in CSR reports increases obfuscation. This study contributes to the disclosure literature by documenting that the complexity indices that have been used as measures of obfuscation in prior finance and accounting research can help shareholders, financial analysts, and investors determine the credibility of CSR disclosure.

Also as predicted, the turnover-performance relation is stronger for funds trading less-liquid stocks and funds likely to possess greater skill. Turnover is correlated across funds.

Furthermore, firms increasingly collaborate with communities as sources of innovation, but how does such community-coupled open innovation affect a firm? Through an in-depth study of 250 firms collaborating with a leading open source software community, we show how this approach incorporates not only the exchange of intellectual property but also the provision of help. We find that while community-coupled open innovation does not affect productivity, it can expand a firm's social ties, lead to a more conservative strategic posture, and shift its innovation focus.

Our goal is to empirically evaluate the temporal and sectoral robustness of a large set of network indicators, thus providing a more complete description of R&D networks with respect to the existing literature. We find that most network properties are not only invariant across sectors, but also independent of the scale of aggregation at which they are observed, and we highlight the presence of core-periphery architectures in explaining some properties emphasized in previous empirical studies (e.g. asymmetric degree distributions and small worlds). In addition, we show that many properties of R&D networks are characterized by a rise-and-fall dynamics with a peak in the mid-nineties. We find that such dynamics is driven by mechanisms of accumulative advantage, structural homophily, and multiconnectivity. In particular, the change from the rise to the fall phase is associated to a structural break in the importance of multiconnectivity.","[Tomasello, Mario V.; Garas, Antonios; Schweitzer, Frank] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Chair Syst Design, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Napoletano, Mauro] Observ Francais Conjonctures Econ, Paris, France; [Napoletano, Mauro] Univ Cote Azur, SKEMA, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France; [Napoletano, Mauro] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Pisa, Italy; [Napoletano, Mauro] Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Pisa, Italy",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; SKEMA Business School; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Tomasello, MV (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Chair Syst Design, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",mvtomasello@gmail.com; mauro.napoletano@sciencespo.fr; agaras@ethz.ch; fschweitzer@ethz.ch,"Schweitzer, Frank/B-2127-2012; Garas, Antonios/E-9952-2011","Garas, Antonios/0000-0001-6914-0819; Napoletano, Mauro/0000-0002-8128-6674",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100014_126865]; EU-FET project [MULTIPLEX 317532]; EU H2020 project ISIGrowth [649186],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); EU-FET project; EU H2020 project ISIGrowth,"We thank Lionel Nesta, Claudio J.

Rwanda's political elite have staked their claim in the development of the country, one which is relatively free from rent-seeking. But education quality remains surprisingly low. Enrollment has surged, but primary school dropout and repetition are high. Most children have not acquired age-appropriate literacy or numeracy skills. We sought to investigate why the education sector hasn't done better in terms of improving quality than we might have expected. This paper draws from interviews and literature review to investigate how policy development and implementation shape the provision of quality education. Our study finds that education priorities were as much political as they were developmental. A lack of real opposition or pushback enabled the government to introduce profoundly transformative educational policies, such as switching the language of instruction from French to English. Often these decisions occurred outside the sector's strategic planning processes. Performance-based incentives tended to focus on aspects of quality that are measurable, such as the construction of classrooms, rather than improving the capacity of the teaching workforce. We did not find evidence of an effective, sustained strategy to improve education quality. It is thus debatable to what extent Rwanda's approach can be considered as inclusive development when quality for most children remains so low. This study makes an empirical contribution through evaluating how the education sector has been situated within Rwanda's broader political settlement, what kinds of outcomes it has led to, and why. It also makes a theoretical contribution by understanding the nature of the relationship between the national political settlement and the education sector.

The HG model preserves the parsimony and the closed form of the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) while introducing the implied volatility (IV) and skewness surface. Varying the skewness parameter of the HG model can restore the symmetry of IV curves. Practitioner's variants of the HG model improve pricing (in-sample and out-of-sample) and hedging performances relative to practitioners' BSM models, with as many or less parameters. The pattern of improvements in Delta-Hedged gains across strike prices accord with predictions from the HG model. These results imply that expanding around the Gaussian density does not offer sufficient flexibility to match the skewness implicit in options.

While the majority of empirical studies relies on the assumption that up to three factors are sufficient to explain all relevant uncertainty inherent in commodity spot, futures, and option prices, evidence from Trolle and Schwartz (Rev Financ Stud 22(11):4423-4461, 2009b) and Hughen (J Futures Mark 30(2):101-133, 2010) indicates a need for additional risk factors. In this article, we propose a four-factor maximal affine stochastic volatility model that allows for three independent sources of risk in the futures term structure and an additional, potentially unspanned stochastic volatility process. The model principally integrates the insights from Hughen (2010) and Tang (Quant Finance 12(5):781-790, 2012) and nests many well-known models in the literature. It can account for several stylized facts associated with commodity dynamics such as mean reversion to a stochastic level, stochastic volatility in the convenience yield, a time-varying correlation structure, and time-varying risk-premia. In-sample and out-of-sample tests indicate a superior model fit to futures and options data as well as lower hedging errors compared to three-factor benchmark models. The results also indicate that three factors are not sufficient to model the joint dynamics of futures and option prices accurately.","[Schoene, Max F.; Spinler, Stefan] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Kuhne Inst Logist Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Schöne, MF (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Kuhne Inst Logist Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany.",max.schoene@whu.edu,,,,,,,79,5,6,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Responding to this trend, many scholars and policy-makers highlight participatory development cooperation among state actors and non-state actors as a means of achieving comprehensive development goals. Despite this emphasis, however, only a handful of empirical studies have examined whether such partnerships have any meaningful relationship with project outcomes. This study aims to answer whether and to what extent different types of implementing partnerships (i.e., state or non-state implementing agencies) affect the outcome of development projects. Using the World Bank Independent Evaluation Group (WBIEG) project data with newly constructed implementing partnership variables, this study shows that implementing partnerships with host country governmental agencies tend to produce a less successful outcome compared to partnerships with non-state actors, and on average only attain moderate-level outcomes. Projects implemented by non-state actors, on the other hand, are likely to result in higher level project outcomes. The paper further tests these findings by analyzing the relationship between the number of state and non-state partners interacting in a project and the subsequent project outcome. This result suggests that an increased number of non-state actor participants leads to a better project outcome; this positive participatory effect, however, diminishes as the number of governmental implementers increases.

Most of the studies of this reform wave have looked at its socioeconomic consequences-e.g. on levels of poverty and inequality-paying less attention to its political consequences. This article looks at the effects of this transformation on state-society relations and the quality of democracy. It draws on a paired comparison of Argentina and Chile, utilizing qualitative data, to investigate the effects of welfare pluralism on state society relations and participatory governance. It shows how the pluralist welfare reforms enacted in Argentina and Chile in the 1990s led to contrasting political outcomes and how this can be explained by their different regime institutions. In Argentina, regime institutions provided politicians with wide discretion in distributing social funds, resulting in a populist mode of social governance in which neo-clientelism served to politicize the linkages between the political elites and subaltern sectors. In Chile, by contrast, regime institutions provided politicians with little discretion in distributing social funds, resulting in a technocratic mode of social governance in which neo-pluralism served to depoliticize the linkages between the political elites and subaltern sectors. Both outcomes differ from assumptions that couple welfare pluralism with more participatory governance and poor peoples' empowerment. The findings illustrate how regime institutions may exercise a crucial impact on the political outcome of welfare reform. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our IPO underpricing framework, which disentangles the effect of institutional investors' incentive associated with allocation policy, from the effect of underwriters' risk associated with underwriting contract, demonstrates that underpricing in book-building IPOs underwritten with firm-commitment contracts in India is higher in the post-September 2005 non-discretionary allocation investor protection period, than in the pre-September 2005 discretionary allocation period. Conversely, underpricing in fixed-price IPOs underwritten with firm-commitment contracts is lower in the post September 2005 investor protection period than in the pre-September 2005 period.

Previous studies have only focused on larger firms. In this paper, we are able to study the impact on smaller firms (fewer than 50 employees), which is important because 90% of the firms acquired by foreign enterprises meet this criterion. For this group of firms, there is no information on R&D, but by using the register of educational attainment, we obtain data on the share of high-skilled labour in all Swedish firms, irrespective of size. Interestingly, we find that among smaller firms, foreign enterprises tend to acquire high-productive, skill-intensive firms (cherry-picking). After the acquisitions, skill upgrading appears in acquired smaller, non-MNE firms, particularly in the service sector.","[Eliasson, Kent; Lindvert, Markus] Growth Anal, Studentplan 3, S-83140 Ostersund, Sweden; [Eliasson, Kent] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Hansson, Par] Growth Anal, Box 574, S-10131 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hansson, Par] Orebro Univ, Sch Business, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden",Umea University; Orebro University,"Hansson, P (通讯作者)，Orebro Univ, Sch Business, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden.",kent.eliasson@tillvaxtanalys.se; par.hansson@oru.se; markus.lindvert@tillvaxtanalys.se,,,"Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare","Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare","Financial support from the Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare is gratefully acknowledged.

The research design exploits rolling state adoption of the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act, which lifted some existing limits on firm spending for a fraction of firms within each state. This allows the use of triple-difference estimates that control for changes in local norms and economic conditions. UPMIFA increases firm spending, on average, implying that firms were complying with the pre-UPMIFA regime. Interacting the triple-difference factors with other predictors of compliance reveals no correlation between compliance and enforcement intensity, but some evidence that compliance is correlated with firm culture and reliance on accountants. These findings have potentially important implications for the governance of charitable organizations, and may speak more generally to drivers of compliance among other organizational forms.","[Galle, Brian] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Law, 600 New Jersey Ave NW, Washington, DC 20001 USA",Georgetown University,"Galle, B (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Law, 600 New Jersey Ave NW, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",brian.galle@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,75,8,9,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

The staggered introductions of catch shares in the Alaska pollock and Pacific hake fisheries-neighboring regional fisheries that are the largest and sixth largest fishery by volume in the United States, respectively-provide a unique natural experiment for isolating the impact of catch shares. Difference-in-difference-indifferences estimations, combined with vessel fixed effects, indicate that catch shares are associated with an increase in the number of days that a harvester spends at sea engaging in fishing activities, which implies a slowing of fishing effort, ceteris paribus. For the Pacific hake fishery, participation in the pollock fishery is a negative predictor of a harvester's days at sea in the target fishery. In the initial two years when the hake fishery was rationalized before the pollock fishery the pollock fishery served as a derby alternative for hake harvesters. Results also show that pollock and hake harvesters respond to changing economic conditions: fish or fish product prices are positive predictors of days at sea. For the Pacific hake catcher-processor fleet, an estimated increase in days at sea per ton of catch suggests that a harvester's fishing intensity has also slowed as a result of catch shares.","[Hsueh, Lily] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 North Cent Ave,Suite 455, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Hsueh, L (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 North Cent Ave,Suite 455, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",Lily.Hsueh@asu.edu,,,,,,,64,12,16,1,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

In the present paper, we apply the NIMBY model to the disposal of disaster debris after the Great East Japan Earthquake when there was substantial concern over radioactive contamination following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant incident. We empirically test the strategic interaction among municipality governments. We find strong evidence of such interaction. That is, in deciding whether to accept disaster waste, the municipality governments appear to keep a close eye on other municipality governments' choices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Especially, the CO2 emissions induced by taxis account for a high proportion in total CO2 emissions. The availability of taxi trajectory data presents new opportunities for addressing CO2 emissions induced by taxis. Few previous studies have analyzed the impact of human trips on CO2 emissions. This paper investigates trip-related CO2 emission patterns based on individuals' travel behavior using taxi trajectory data. First, we propose a trip purpose inference method that takes into account the spatiotemporal attractiveness of POIs to divide human trips into different types. Further, we reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of CO2 emissions from various types of trips, including temporal regularity and periodicity as well as spatial distribution of black areas. Finally, comparative analysis of CO2 emissions for different kinds of trips based on trip behavior is conducted using three variables, namely trip distance, trip duration and trip speed. This study is helpful for us to understand how to make travel and cities more sustainable through modifying people's trip behaviors or taxi trips.","[Zhao, Pengxiang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kwan, Mei-Po] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, 255 Comp Applicat Bldg MC-150,605 E Springfield A, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Qin, Kun] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Qin, Kun] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Wuhan University,"Kwan, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, 255 Comp Applicat Bldg MC-150,605 E Springfield A, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",mpk654@gmail.com,"Kwan, Mei-Po/S-4162-2016; Zhao, Peng/HDO-7507-2022","Kwan, Mei-Po/0000-0001-8602-9258; Zhao, Pengxiang/0000-0002-5279-9331","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41529101, 41471326]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2042015kf0183]; Hong Kong Polytechnic University [1-ZE24]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University),"We thank the constructive comments from the anonymous referees, and we appreciate the financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41529101 and Grant No. 41471326), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2042015kf0183).

The paper has the following objectives: to study the theoretical basis of location models, i.e. of the criteria (the variables) used and to compare them with the criteria used currently in decision-making practice. The study is based on qualitative research investigating the opinions of decision - makers in the area of distribution regarding the location strategy of new stores. The research findings confirm the existence of differences between the criteria retained by location models and the practice of distribution companies on the Romanian market. This type of approach - models and practices of location for distribution companies - is a novelty for the Romanian market. The study can be useful both for research (perfecting the location models vis-a-vis present-day evolutions of the business environment), as well as for the decision makers in distribution (the valorization of research findings in decision-making practice).","[Cazabat, Gerard] EDC Paris Business Sch, Courbevoie, France; [Belu, Mihaela Gabriela; Popa, Ioan; Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Belu, MG (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaelabelu2000@yahoo.com,"Belu, Mihaela/I-1104-2013; Mihaela, Belu/HPE-6574-2023; Popa, Ioan/D-2816-2015; Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/O-9071-2016","Belu, Mihaela/0000-0001-7631-6798; Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/0000-0002-4559-3466",,,,,35,8,8,0,12,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2017,19.0,45,,,,,493,508,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404523800012,0

We find that the sign of the equity beta crucially depends on country risk. In low risk countries, government bonds represent a natural hedge against equity risk as the equity beta is negative regardless of market conditions. On the other hand, government bonds of high risk countries lose their safe-asset status and exhibit more equity-like behaviour during the sovereign debt crisis, with positive and strongly significant co-movements relative to the stock market. Our estimates indicate that the equity beta switches from negative to positive when a sovereign's credit spread rises above 2%. We find that the decoupling of the government bond market between high risk and low risk countries implies that indiscriminate portfolio diversification does not pay. Instead, prudent diversification appears to offer superior risk adjusted returns in periods of sovereign stress and through the economic cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A similar phenomenon has been documented widely for other developing countries. However, unlike in other countries, which saw widening wage structures both between and within skill groups, I show that inequality in India increased between groups but fell within them over the period 1983-2005. Returns to education increased with the wages of college graduates rising relative to high school graduates who, in turn, earned increasingly more than less educated workers. But workers within education groups witnessed lower wage dispersion over time. Defining demographic groups more narrowly, by additionally including characteristics such as experience, gender, industry, and state, among others, regression results show that inequality increased between them while simultaneously declining within them, as indicated by a compression of the residual wage inequality. Decomposition analysis attributes the decline in wage dispersion within groups to falling returns to unobservable characteristics. This, previously undocumented, divergent trend in inequality between and within skill groups in India cannot be explained by the three main arguments in the extant literature for why developing countries have witnessed a rise in wage inequality in recent decades following trade liberalization greater imports of skill-complementary technology, offshoring, and reallocation of skilled labor toward exporting firms. I provide several pieces of suggestive evidence to argue that reduction in labor market frictions and growth in offshored tasks from developed countries that are routine in content, but performed by high-skilled workers, can lead to the divergent trends in inequality between and within groups. Compositional changes in the labor force do not account for the inequality patterns witnessed in India. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, recent research has emphasized that accounting regulation might be ineffective or even detrimental. However, this paper shows that the time inconsistency of AEM is more serious than that of REM and thereby results in a threshold below which accounting regulation can reduce AEM without inducing REM. The threshold coincides with the optimal stringency of accounting regulation to minimize the managerial inefficiencies caused by time inconsistency.","[Kang, Seongill] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Int Management, Kanazawa Ku, 22-2 Seto, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360027, Japan",Yokohama City University,"Kang, S (通讯作者)，Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Int Management, Kanazawa Ku, 22-2 Seto, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360027, Japan.",kang@yokohama-cu.ac.jp,,,Tokyo Center for Economic Research,Tokyo Center for Economic Research,"I am grateful for the helpful comments and suggestions from the anonymous reviewers and Hamid Beladi (editor).

As small countries are well known to be more open than large ones, it may appear uncontroversial to claim that the answer is yes. Nevertheless, this contradicts predictions from many standard trade models positing a home-market effect in the number of manufacturing firms and exporters. In this article, I present a theoretical model where a home-market effect in the number of firms coexists with a reverse home-market effect in the number of exporters: as in standard models, the number of firms in a small country relative to that in a large one is lower than relative income, but, in contrast to standard models, the relative number of exporters is larger. As a consequence, small countries will have higher proportions firms that export in manufacturing industries-a claim I support empirically.","[Medin, Hege] Norwegian Inst Int Affairs NUPI, POB 8159 Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",,"Medin, H (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Int Affairs NUPI, POB 8159 Dept, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",hege.medin@nupi.no,,,"Research Council of Norway [139982/510, 233836]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"I am grateful to Ragnhild Balsvik, Kjetil Bjorvatn, Pao-Li Chang (associate editor of this journal), Jan I.

The role of family ties is explored as a cultural determinant of firms' access to finance. Family ties persist over time and exhibit varying degrees of strength among countries. They are especially important in an Islamic environment characterized by risk-sharing values and wealth redistribution as incentives to financial contracting. Family ties are found to be significant predictors of firms' financing constraints under alternative models. However, the significance and predictive power of family ties varies in accordance with a range of firm-specific characteristics and country-level institutional and cultural conditions prevalent in the Islamic countries. These results add new insights on the role of social institutions and non-economic cultural factors in predicting financing constraints of firms in the Islamic world. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While some argue that economic growth leads to higher subjective well-being, and others argue that it does not, we are the first to specify two conditions that make economic growth compatible with subjective well-being over time: increasing social trust and declining income inequality. Our methodological contribution is to combine micro-and macro-level data from a large sample of developing, transition, and developed countries and to explicitly distinguish the cross-country differences from the changes over time. We perform a multilevel analysis of harmonized data composed of the World Values Survey, the European Values Study, and macro-level indicators of economic growth and income inequality for 46 countries, observed from 1981 to 2012. Our results show that in the long run economic growth improves subjective well-being when social trust does not decline and, in richer countries, when income inequality reduces. These results are compatible with the recommendation that, to pursue durable improvements in people's subjective well-being, policy-makers should adopt a promote, protect and reduce policy agenda: promote economic growth, protect and promote social trust, and reduce income inequality.

Around the Act's passage, U.K. firms operating in high-corruption countries experience a drop in firm value, while their non-U.K. competitors in these countries encounter an increase. U.K. firms respond to the Act by reducing the expansion of their subsidiary network into perceptively corrupt countries. Moreover, their sales and merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in such countries declines. In sum, bribes facilitate doing business in certain countries.

We also test whether controlling for conditional correlations in a dynamic setup, using bivariate Bayesian-Dynamic Conditional Correlation (B-DCC) models, improves inflation forecasts. To achieve this we compare out-of-sample forecast estimates of the B-DCC model to Random Walk, Autoregressive and Bayesian VAR models. We find that for both the BVAR and BDCC models, improving point forecasts of the Autoregressive model of inflation remains an elusive exercise. This, we argue, is of less importance relative to the more informative density forecasts. For this we find improved forecasts of inflation for the B-DCC models at all forecasting horizons tested. We thus conclude that including metals price series as inputs to inflation models leads to improved density forecasts, while controlling for the dynamic relationship between the included price series and inflation similarly leads to significantly improved density forecasts.

Empirically, we estimate the asset market incidence of two realizations of uncertainties we classify as ex post policy risks. The events we analyze concern the intellectual property of Myriad Genetics, Inc., an American molecular diagnostics firm. In June 2013, the Supreme Court invalidated several of Myriad's intellectual property claims. Subsequently, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) re-evaluated the reimbursements it pays for the services at issue in the Supreme Court's ruling. Each of these events moved Myriad's market capitalization by several hundred million dollars, or on the order of 20%. Myriad's exposure to the realization of these events reflected the concentration of its revenue streams among the affected services.

Some cultures engage in extreme religious rituals in which individuals take on forms of bodily harm to demonstrate their devotion. Such rituals entail excessive costs in terms of physical pain and effort, but the equivalent societal benefits remain unclear. The field experiment reported here examined the interplay between extreme rituals and moral behavior. Using a die-roll task to measure honest behavior, we tested whether engaging or observing others engaging in extreme ritual activities affects subsequent moral behavior. Strikingly, the results showed that extreme rituals promote moral behavior among ritual observers, but not among ritual performers. The discussion centres on the moral effects of rituals within the broader social context in which they occur. Extreme religious rituals appear to have a moral cleansing effect on the numerous individuals observing the rituals, which may imply that these rituals evolved to advance and maintain moral societies.

It identifies the e-commerce benefits realized by these SMEs and investigates the relationship between the levels of e-commerce adoption and the benefits thus realized. The study was motivated by the limited studies related to e-commerce adoption by SMEs, especially in developing countries. In addition, it seems that most e-commerce studies are focused more on upstream issues: to see the factors that facilitate, or barriers faced regarding e-commerce adoption, rather than downstream issues: to see post-adoption benefits. This certainly limits our understanding about e-commerce adoption by SMEs in developing countries, as well as the post-adoption benefits of e-commerce. Indonesia was chosen as the place in which to conduct the study. A survey of 292 SMEs shows that the majority of them are still at an early stage in their adoption of e-commerce. Their use of e-commerce is dominated by marketing and purchasing and procurement activities. Extending market reach'', increased sales'', improved external communication'', improved company image'', improved speed of processing'', and increased employee productivity'' are reported as the top six e-commerce benefits perceived by these SMEs. This study also shows that SMEs at the higher level of e-commerce adoption experience greater e-commerce benefits than those at other levels of adoption.","[Rahayu, Rita; Day, John] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Rahayu, Rita] Andalas Univ, Padang, Indonesia",University of Huddersfield; Universitas Andalas,"Rahayu, R (通讯作者)，Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.;Rahayu, R (通讯作者)，Andalas Univ, Padang, Indonesia.",aretrahayu@gmail.com,,"Day, John/0000-0002-1167-3644; rahayu, rita/0000-0001-5377-8818",,,,,34,75,88,7,86,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Our analysis exploits persistent and externally imposed differences in court enforcement that arose when the U.S. Congress assigned state courts to adjudicate contracts on a subset of Native American reservations. Using area-specific data on small business lending, we find that reservations assigned to state courts, which enforce contracts more predictably than tribal courts, have stronger credit markets. Moreover, the law-driven component of credit market development is associated with significantly higher per capita income, with stronger effects in sectors that depend more on external financing.","[Brown, James R.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Finance, Ames, IA USA; [Cookson, J.

Implementation of land use regulations in urban China,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Floor-to-area ratios; Land development; Compliance; Corruption; China,USE RESTRICTIONS,"This paper studies the implementation of land use regulations in urban China. In particular, we investigate land developers' compliance with floor-to-area ratio (FAR) regulations using a unique set of residential land parcel data from 30 major Chinese cities matched with the corresponding residential development projects built on those parcels. In our sample, in more than 20% of the cases, developers built above the regulatory FAR limits in the ex post land development, and the total floor area built in those cases increased 21.5% over the regulatory limit. Our analysis finds that attractive land location attributes tend to induce developers to pursue upward adjustments of FAR. Moreover, developers who are more likely to have special relationships with government officials tend to make larger upward adjustments. Our estimates suggest that there exists a significant gap between the privately optimal FAR that maximizes land value and the regulatory FAR. This gap is only modestly reduced by corrupt ties with government officials, implying that FAR regulations have imposed a highly restrictive constraint on China's urban land development even given imperfect compliance.

Using a panel dataset from all communities across the country during this period, I investigate the effect of PSH on homeless population sizes. I first estimate the association between PSH beds and homeless counts, controlling for all time invariant community-level factors, several time-varying community-level factors, and in some specifications, all time-varying state-level factors. One additional PSH bed is associated with between 0.04 and 0.12 fewer homeless people. Second, I estimate causal effects using federal funds allocated to communities for homeless assistance as instruments; funding decisions are based on information that precedes any current shocks to homeless populations. Adding one PSH bed reduces the homeless count by up to 0.10 people, and I can reject a reduction of more than 0.72 people at the 95% confidence level. Finally, I discuss several possible explanations for the relatively modest impact, including poor targeting, differential exit rates into private housing from PSH relative to homelessness, incentives for remaining homeless, errors in homeless counts, and migration in response to expanded PSH.

PG may incentivize employees to work hard for promotions; alternately, it may also lead to inequity aversion and decrease employees' work effort. We examine these two competing theories about the effects of PGs on firm productivity. By incorporating incentive and inequity aversion hypotheses into one model, we find that productivity is an inverted-U function of PG. Supporting evidence is provided using wage expenses of listed firms in China. To establish causality, policy shocks are introduced. We further show that outside job opportunities and employees' skills significantly moderate the inverted-U relationship.","[Dai, Yunhao; Xu, Jin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Kong, Dongmin] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Kong, DM (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China.",daiyunhao@hust.edu.cn; kongdm@hust.edu.cn; jinxu@hust.edu.cn,"Kong, Dongmin/AAT-2914-2021",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71372130, 71173078]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We acknowledge the helpful comments from Carl Chen (the editor), the anonymous referee, Wenjing Li, Shasha Liu, Pingui Rao, Rui Shen, Mingli Xu, and seminar participants in Jinan University, Peking University, Wuhan University, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law.

We find that an increase in immigration inflows into a particular MSA is associated with increases in rents and with house prices in that MSA while also seeming to drive up rents and prices in neighboring MSAs.

We calculate (estimate) the contribution of each block of physical and R&D capital investment to explain differences in Tobin's q by estimating each capital's unit's shadow values and their contributions to the differences in the realized Tobin's q. The steady growth of R&D capital after the bubble burst increased the R&D capital relative to the physical capital. The combined effect of this relative stock ratio and R&D capital's shadow value explain the high Tobin's q in highly R&D intensive firms. Conversely, Tobin's q is an inappropriate measure of physical capital investment in such highly R&D intensive firms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Given that voters in many states must approve property and income tax increases for these local entities, the lack of full information on the financial status of these local entities may lead to sub-optimal voting decisions. State financial intervention systems have begun to make financial problems more salient to residents, potentially alleviating these informational asymmetries. This paper examines the effect of the Ohio fiscal stress labeling program on voting outcomes and the tax-setting behavior of local officials for school district and municipal government tax referendums. We use a difference-in-differences approach to examine data from over 3000 school district and 2300 municipality property tax elections from 2004 to 2012. While we find minimal evidence that the yes vote share changed for school district referendums following fiscal stress label receipt, we find very large increases (15 to 23 percentage points) in the likelihood of referendum passage for school districts following label receipt. We do not find much evidence of changes in the likelihood of passage or the yes vote share following label receipt for municipalities, but we do find that these voting outcomes rise following label removal. We also find that local officials do not appreciably change their tax-setting behavior in response to these labels, as the size and likelihood of property tax proposal are largely unchanged following label receipt or removal.","[Thompson, Paul N.] Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Dept Econ, 340 Bexell Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Whitley, Joseph] Washington State Hlth Care Author, Forecasting & Financial Analyt Sect, Financial Serv Div, 626 8th Ave SE, Olympia, WA 98501 USA",Oregon State University,"Thompson, PN (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Dept Econ, 340 Bexell Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",paul.thompson@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,45,8,12,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2017,170.0,3-4,,,,,265,288,,10.1007/s11127-016-0395-7,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,EM0HF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394998700005,0

An Empirical Analysis,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,corruption; public debt; government expenditure; shadow economy,GENERALIZED-METHOD; GROWTH; INSTITUTIONS; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; FIRM,"This paper investigates the relationship between corruption, the shadow economy, and public debt. It additionally examines whether the shadow economy increases the adverse effects of corruption on public debt. The model is empirically tested for 126 countries over 1996-2012. Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Fixed effects, system generalized method of moments (GMM) and instrumental variable estimation, and two measures of corruption-the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index and the Kaufmann et al. Corruption Index-results confirm that increased corruption and a larger shadow economy lead to an increase in public debt. Results additionally indicate that the shadow economy magnifies the effect of corruption on public debt suggesting that they act as complements. Results also suggest that a larger shadow economy reduces tax revenues and thus increases public debt, similarly, higher government expenditure enhances the effects of corruption on government debt. Hence reducing corruption should be a primary policy goal of governments. Given the complementarity detected between corruption and the shadow economy, reducing corruption would also lead to a fall in the size of the shadow economy and public debt. Reducing corruption will also minimize the adverse effects of corruption on government debt through government expenditure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis indicated that in the 1980s, a paradigm shift emerged as bilateral debt relationships became negligible, while the role of financial market principles became much stronger. A financialization of the relationship with private investors took place, although still highly regulated. The introduction of the euro resulted not only in the new European rules but also in the financialization of the regulatory framework. The participating governments lost the privilege to encapsulate their markets. Because of these two processes, managing government debt in the common currency area meant developing a strategy to successfully issue in a transnational market without support from public authorities at least until the crisis.","[Preunkert, Jenny] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Preunkert, J (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Sch Educ & Social Sci, Dept Social Sci, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",jenny.preunkert@uni-oldenburg.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) [HE 2174/12-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a grant from the German Research Foundation (DFG) (Grant No. HE 2174/12-1).",,60,16,17,2,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Toward this end, the paper studies a conditional process model that assesses the role of visioning ability and perceived uncertainty in explaining how future-oriented managers may be better at strategic management. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a quantitative research design with closed-ended questionnaires as the main mode of data collection, and applies bootstrapping technique to test the significance and validity of the conditional process model. Findings - The results confirm that time orientation influences strategic practices in an organization through its impact on a manager's visioning ability, when uncertainty in the environment is perceived as low-moderate. The study also notes that local managers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) tend to be relatively future oriented and demonstrate a greater preference toward strategic work in comparison to operational tasks. Research limitations/implications - The scope of this study has been limited to UAE nationals, and generalization of these results should be done with caution. Future research is recommended on a wider geographical area, such that cross-national results can be used to better understand the concept of time orientation in Arab countries. Originality/value - Findings of this paper contribute to the literature by studying the concept of time orientation in a unique cultural domain. Moreover, by providing a theoretically relevant model for understanding the relationship between time orientation and strategic practices, the study highlights the significance of environmental uncertainty, and the importance of developing the visioning abilities of those involved in strategic roles in an organization.","[Abu-Rahma, Ali; Jaleel, Bushra] Abu Dhabi Univ, Coll Business Adm, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",Abu Dhabi University,"Abu-Rahma, A (通讯作者)，Abu Dhabi Univ, Coll Business Adm, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",ali.aburahma@adu.ac.ae,,"Khanam, Bushra/0000-0002-0639-3269; Abu-Rahma, Ali/0000-0002-4176-9006",,,,,73,3,9,6,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The ensuing recovery has been sluggish and by some measures still incomplete. In this paper, we break down aggregate employment during the Recession and the recovery into changes across industries and occupations. There is a clear asymmetric pattern: The contraction is driven by sectors and the recovery by occupations. In particular, the contraction between 2008 and 2010 primarily reflects a steep decline in construction employment, partially mitigated by expansions in the food services, education, and health industries. The recovery first came from a gradual increase in low-skill occupation employment across all sectors but after 2012 from a pronounced increase in high-skill occupation employment across all sectors. This pattern of recovery is a continuation of the underlying trend of polarization across occupations, which commenced in the 1980s.","[Aum, Sangmin] Washington Univ, Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Lee, Sang Yoon (Tim)] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Shin, Yongseok] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO USA; [Shin, Yongseok] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Aum, S (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,"Aum, Sangmin/AAQ-4147-2020; Lee, Tim/JGD-7558-2023","Aum, Sangmin/0000-0002-4993-0562;",,,,,9,6,7,0,2,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

The effect of employment status on life satisfaction has been of particular interest in the empirical research of economics. A substantial body of literature shows that unemployment is associated with lower levels of happiness conceptualized as life satisfaction. This paper investigates life satisfaction levels in three dimensions of life-social and demographic characteristics, social inequality, and employment-using the third wave of the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) conducted in 2011. Multiple regression results are consistent with that of previous literature. Even when the financial situation and other individual characteristics are held constant, unemployment reduces people's life satisfaction. The final model shows that the impact of social exclusion, deprivation, and financial differences on life satisfaction proves to be higher than the impacts of education level, marital status, age, and employment status. Hence, welfare state policies affecting social inequalities and labor market have significant effects on life satisfaction.","[Aysan, Mehmet Fatih] Istanbul Sehir Univ, Dept Sociol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Aysan, Ummugulsum] Istanbul Univ, Dept Social Serv, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Sehir University; Istanbul University,"Aysan, MF (通讯作者)，Istanbul Sehir Univ, Dept Sociol, Istanbul, Turkey.",mfaysan@sehir.edu.tr; ummugulsum.aysan@istanbul.edu.tr,"Aysan, Mehmet Fatih/AAR-7654-2020; Aysan, Mehmet Fatih/AAZ-4487-2020; Aysan, Gülsüm/GPS-9536-2022","Aysan, Mehmet Fatih/0000-0002-8311-8551;",Marie Curie FP7 Integration Grant within the 7th European Union Framework Programme [618792],Marie Curie FP7 Integration Grant within the 7th European Union Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"This research was supported by a Marie Curie FP7 Integration Grant (Project no: 618792) within the 7th European Union Framework Programme.

It analyses methods and criteria of territorial division and method how the competences are defined, both own and delegated, of city districts (boroughs), as they are specified in statutes of individual cities. In the event of territorially undivided statutory cities, our analysis shows that larger cities in particular adopt such structural measures using their own internal regulation that should at least partially substitute the non-existence of their territorial and administrative division (such as provisions of city district committees or settlement committees).

More in depth, we examine how the actors on the scene, such as the project sponsor and the project leader, behave with reference to an IC measurement project. We will also examine the role played by another actor so far remained behind the scene: the external partner (e.g. consultants, university researchers, etc.). In order to achieve this aim the results of an exploratory field study (Roslender and Hart, 2003, Lillis and Mundy, 2005) referred to Italian companies that adopted an IC report will be presented. The main findings are the following. First, it emerges that the project sponsor is the main actor that determines the success or the failure of the project. Second, the project leader is the one that shapes and operationalizes the theoretical concept of IC adopted by the project sponsor in order to make it applicable. Third, the sensemaking processes related to IC tends to be limited to the sponsor and the leader. This implies that IC tends to remain a private business, something reserved to an elite that tend to disappear when the elite quits or changes. Forth, when the CFO/controller adopts a traditional accounting approach (i.e. bean counter) rather than a business analyst approach, the IC project tends to fail and to be considered only as an accounting matter and not as a managerial matter. Fifth, the role of the consultant seems to determinant in the sensemaking, legitimization and implementation processes of the IC project. Our study adds to IC literature by showing, from a practice-based perspective, the roles played by the project sponsors and of the project leaders in different organizations and how external partners are, in several cases, the deus ex machina of the projects, i.e. they are determinant in the decision to undertake these projects, in their accomplishment, prosecution and abandonment. In particular, it emerges that external partners have a key role in the IC sensegiving and sensemaking processes: their specialization influence the way IC is perceived within the company and the fate of the IC report, i.e. in determining the success or the failure of the IC projects.","[Chiucchi, Maria Serena; Giuliani, Marco] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Management, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Chiucchi, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Management, Ancona, Italy.",m.s.chiucchi@univpm.it; m.giuliani@univpm.it,"GIULIANI, MARCO/ABF-2162-2021","GIULIANI, MARCO/0000-0002-0194-8616",,,,,44,0,0,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,58,65,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000008,0

MFIs are able to significantly cut down their operational expenses, of which 1.1 percentage points can be attributed to transformation. Other findings include a steep increase in commercial debt leverage and deposits, a significant decrease in the fluctuation of funding costs and a sharp rise in average loan size, often taken as an indicator for mission drift.

A qualitative review of industry structure revealed a great deal of similarity to market leaders globally. Price formation within broiler production contracts in South Africa utilizes the same tournament pricing used successfully in the USA, resulting in high levels of technical efficiency, however economic efficiency is lacking. Univariate time series analysis confirmed that the domestic price of chicken is more elastic to changes in the import parity price than changes in feed costs. Feed remains crucial to economic efficiency and while declining protein meal prices in the future is plausible given recent investment into the industry, marketing strategies that optimize the returns from an entire carcass could aid effective competition with imported products.","[Davids, T.; Meyer, F.

Therefore, policy implementation, both on national and local levels, depends to the overall organizational performance of the administrative apparatus that reflects capacity of the human recourse management to support the policy making process. In means that local authorities should have capacity to determine appropriate strategies and to develop corresponding programs, sub-programs and implementation action plans. The focus of this paper is the impact of the local level human resource management to the implementation of the local policies, emphasizing the role of in-service training and continuity of knowledge and skills upgrading in local administration. Therefore, attitude of the local officials regarding the human resources management is crucial for the overall performance of local administration and effectiveness in implementation of local public policies. This claim is supported by research done over the sample of 200 local officials and public servants, regarding their training for policy design and implementation and their role in overall policy making process. Even the research resulted with finding that 80% of municipalities are equipped with competent people (from perspective of human resources management) and have established administrative units for strategic planning and policy, remains recommendation for continuity of training and education of local administration, including training of mayors regarding the policy making and strategic planning. Last but not list, policy evaluation usually is a missing link in the policy chain on local level. Consequently, developing policy evaluating capacity and establishing policy evaluation procedures on local level are imperative as well.

Since the first contemporary industrial SEZ was established in Shannon, Ireland in 1959, their population has grown over the years to reach 4,300 in more than 140 countries. The vast majority of them started to operate after 2000 (The Economist, 2015). The study on SEZs conducted in Poland and discussed in this paper focuses on the assessment of factors decisive for the success of a particular zone among foreign entrepreneurs seeking investment locations to pursue economic operations. Due to the unprecedented number of zones in the new EU Member States for a single country, their long presence and relatively high importance for the economy, Poland makes a good case for research. The paper aims to identify the importance of factors, which explain why some SEZs in Poland attracted more FDI than others. In our opinion, that might be caused by the following three fundamental reasons: location of the zone in a more or less attractive region (equivalent to a voivodeship); investors' opinion about the zone (its reputation); and top quality performance of zone managing companies (ZMCs). Each of the above reasons was also analysed in more detail. Their priority order may provide some guidelines for those who implement regional policy, also through the SEZs, in Poland and in other countries. Our calculations have shown that efforts of ZMCs with regard to attracting FDI are crucial.","[Dorozynski, Tomasz; Swierkocki, Janusz; Urbaniak, Wojciech] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Dorozynski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland.",,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,164,176,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400017,0

Investment intensity greatly influences the solution of major macroeconomic tasks: structural adjustment in national economy, formation of favourable economic and financial climate, development of innovative business, development of competitive products, increase of tax base, replenishment of budget revenues, creating more employment, extention of enterprises' activity, poverty reduction. Enterprises' investment activity is determined by the role of capital investment in the economic development of the country. Increasing the levels of investment provides the growth of industrial production, improvement of innovative capacity, which will contribute to strenthening the position of the country in the world market. To achieve these objectives, it is crucial to create national sound technology of investment and the system of financial security of the investment process in the Russian Federation. Nowadays the problem of developing the system of financial security of the investment process should become one of the important tasks of government economic policy, which is aimed at achieving steady economic growth and cyclical up-ticks in economy in general. In a globalized world and development of knowledge-based economy, the improvement of investment climate is impossible without establishing an effective system of financial security. Thus, today the development of the system of financial security of the investment process is of considerable social and economic importance for the development of the country. To this end, it is necessary to design a further theoretical framework and to develop methodological and practical guidelines to its effective implementation. In this context, the artcile specifies the basic components of favourable financial and economic climate for the development of the investment process with the modernization of the economy, presents a regression model that helps to evaluate the degree of impact on the index of investment in the fixed capital in the Russian Federation, its principal sources of formation and establishes the dependence of innovative development from gross and national income.

Using a large panel of companies from 52 countries over the period 1999-2012, we document that social capital inversely affects the cost of equity. Our evidence suggests that the association between social capital and the cost of equity capital is stronger in underdeveloped financial markets and those characterized by weak legal protection. The marginal effect of social capital is also stronger for constrained firms with profitable investment opportunities.
