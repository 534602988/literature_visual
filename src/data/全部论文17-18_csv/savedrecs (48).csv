We study the division of costs in World Bank projects between the Bank and its borrowers. If this is a realm in which World Bank bureaucrats exert agency, we expect to see counterpart financing vary with poverty and governance, in line with theories about aid selectivity. If, on the other hand, this is a realm in which the Bank's state principals exert influence, we expect strategic interest measures to predict the division of financing. If counterpart commitments represent the outcome of Bank-borrower bargaining, we expect borrowers with outside options to contribute less. A 2004 rule revision at the Bank provides an opportunity to study how financing patterns changed when bureaucratic agents obtained more discretion. We show that increased flexibility within the Bank led to a deployment of resources that favored poorer countries, in line with the organizational mission of the Bank. We find less evidence of governance selectivity, and we find mixed results with regard to how a country's strategic importance or bargaining power influenced levels of counterpart funding.","[Winters, Matthew S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, 315 David Kinley Hall,MC-713,1407 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Streitfeld, Jaclyn D.] Global Ctr Responsibil Protect, New York, NY USA; [Streitfeld, Jaclyn D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Winters, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Polit Sci, 315 David Kinley Hall,MC-713,1407 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",mwinters@illinois.edu,"Winters, Matthew S./H-6098-2019","Winters, Matthew S./0000-0002-3693-9461",,,,,66,6,8,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Analyzing a unique loan-level dataset, this study examines the characteristics of mortgage prepayment and default behaviors in the Korean housing and housing finance markets. We also analyze mortgage termination behaviors across regions, loan purposes, and periods. The results suggest that the prepayment rate of fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) and the ratio of adjustable-rate mortgages to FRMs can provide meaningful signals for the Korean household economy. Although the macro-prudential policies pertaining to the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and debt-to-income ratio (DTI) are very effective, their effects can vary depending on the region or loan purpose. Furthermore, the DTI and credit score cannot always identify the default risks of mortgages not intended for housing purchases even though such mortgages are more vulnerable to macroeconomic changes. The observed changes in default behavior indicate that the government's policies to promote fixed-rate loans have achieved a certain degree of success.","[Kim, Hyeongjun] Korea Housing Finance Corp, 40 Munhyeongeumyung Ro, Busan 48400, South Korea; [Cho, Hoon] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, 85 Hoegiro, Seoul 02455, South Korea; [Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ SKKU, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ SKKU, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",sharpjin@skku.edu,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887; Kim, Hyeongjun/0000-0003-0386-005X; Cho, Hoon/0000-0003-2322-320X",,,,,54,12,14,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In 2013, travel accounted for 25% of services export in the world. Trade in services accounted for 12% of GDP in the world. Hence, the role of travel in many economies is substantial. The current paper studies the determinants of cross-border flows of people with a particular emphasis on the role of visa policies. We adopt the UN General Assembly Affinity Index, a measure of the quality of bilateral relations between nations, to instrument for bilateral visa policy. We find that, ceteris paribus, imposing visa restrictions on a country reduces travel from that country by about 73% in 2010 implying restrictive visa policies discourage cross-border travel significantly. This implies an adverse impact of restrictive visa policies on trade-in-services.","[McKay, Andy] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Tekleselassie, Tsegay G.] Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",University of Sussex,"McKay, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,,"McKay, Andy/0000-0002-5815-1739; Tekleselassie, Tsegay/0000-0001-6796-5024",,,,,32,5,5,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,2914,2933,,10.1111/twec.12686,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200004,0

The paper proposes a hierarchical structure of resource allocation where federal funding is routed through the state, and ultimately to local transit agencies. The framework encompasses multiple dimensions such as selection of different improvement program options (rehabilitation, remanufacturing, and replacement) of a mixed transit fleet spread over a temporally continuous planning period. It leverages optimization models for capital allocation among transit agencies in the state. Four sub-models are developed-two maximizing passenger miles traveled, and the other two maximizing the total fleet wide remaining life, all under agency-specific budget, capacity and policy constraints, and planning objectives. They are applied on real-world data from set of transit agencies spread across the state of Tennessee, containing a heterogenous fleet of 254 total buses at various levels of aging. Results indicate that by application of the framework, an average 40 percent additional mileage is generated through the planning period with the same levels of fleet size, with nearly 30 percent of the fleet receiving some form of improvement treatment per year.","[Ngo, Huan Hoang; Mishra, Sabyasachee] Univ Memphis, Dept Civil Engn, 104 Engn Sci Bldg, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Shah, Rohan] CDM Smith Inc, Transportat Serv Grp, 9430 Res Blvd,Suite 1-200, Austin, TX 78759 USA",University of Memphis,"Shah, R (通讯作者)，CDM Smith Inc, Transportat Serv Grp, 9430 Res Blvd,Suite 1-200, Austin, TX 78759 USA.",hhngo@memphis.edu; shahrj@cdmsmith.com; smishra3@memphis.edu,"Mishra, Sabyasachee/AAN-4236-2021","Mishra, Sabyasachee/0000-0002-7198-3548",,,,,31,8,9,0,24,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Increasing returns to density are found at all levels of output suggesting that marginal cost pricing will not recover full costs, and that government intervention is justified. Increasing returns to size are also found suggesting that expanding transit service areas is beneficial. Economies of scope between demand-response service and fixed-route service are found for average-size agencies suggesting benefits to combining these services for mid-size organizations. In order to examine the cost implications of combining transit agencies, we investigate the necessary and sufficient condition for natural monopoly - cost subadditivity. Rural transit is found to be a natural monopoly when service to a fixed service area is considered, suggesting that combining transit agencies that have duplicative service areas is likely to be beneficial - particularly when such transit agencies provide one type of service. On the other hand, there is little evidence of rural transit being a natural monopoly when the alternative to single provision of transit service is two systems with smaller service areas. This suggests that combining transit agencies with smaller service areas into larger regional systems may not be beneficial. We also find that rural transit agencies have excess capacity, suggesting that federal guidelines regarding vehicle purchase should be reviewed.","[Ripplinger, David G.] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND USA; [Bitzan, John D.] North Dakota State Univ, Coll Business, Fargo, ND 58105 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; North Dakota State University Fargo,"Bitzan, JD (通讯作者)，North Dakota State Univ, Coll Business, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",john.bitzan@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,44,4,4,1,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) is unique in following both the flexible employee and their partner over time. The study utilizes this feature to investigate whether the take-up of work hour flexibility is detrimental for the flexible employee's wage development. Men and women benefit from flexible working hours. For women, this positive wage effect occurs late, suggesting that, unlike men, they must first prove their commitment. Moreover, it tests for the first time whether flexible workers' partners profit from the increased couple-level flexibility. The positive cross-partner effect for the inflexible partner is particularly pronounced for mothers' wages, suggesting that men may use flexible working hours to support their wives' careers. These measures are not necessarily used more frequently by those in need (e.g. parents or women). Instead, they seem to be accessed by those in sought-after positions.","[Langner, Laura Antonia] Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Langner, Laura Antonia] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Langner, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.;Langner, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",laura.langner@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council [ES/ N001575/1, ES/L011662/1]; Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft; ERC [339703]; ESRC [ES/L011662/1, ES/N001575/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011662/1] Funding Source: researchfish; European Research Council (ERC) [339703] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant numbers ES/ N001575/1, ES/L011662/1], the Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft and the ERC [339703].",,43,24,25,7,47,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This model could potentially explain the intransitivities observed in the data while retaining rationality and optimization.","[Wilson, Matthew S.] Truman State Univ, Econ Dept, 100 East Normal Ave, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA",,"Wilson, MS (通讯作者)，Truman State Univ, Econ Dept, 100 East Normal Ave, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA.",mwilson@truman.edu,,"Wilson, Matthew/0000-0003-0490-590X",,,,,25,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2018,85.0,2,,,,,233,251,,10.1007/s11238-017-9628-6,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GO1ZL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439761200006,0

The paper reviews background and literature on rail liberalisation policy in European Union (EU), ASEAN and Thailand. Since Thailand is now facing a fast approaching rail reform initiative the paper shows an example of how the rail sector reform might be tackled at the very beginning, starting from analysing various rail models, identifying the knowledge of existing actors and the environment where these reforms need to be implemented. Three case studies of different EU liberalisation models, as adopted in the United Kingdom, Germany and France, are presented. Next, the perception of 18 That policy makers and 15 Thai academics toward rail liberalisation implementation in Thailand is examined based on the data collected via a questionnaire. The findings of the study indicated that rail liberalisation could be applied to solve some of the key problems of railway sector in Thailand and some other ASEAN countries. Statistical analyses of the results emphasize the differences between the opinions of the policy makers and the academic experts, where for example the majority of the first group is split between the partial separated rail model (33.3%) or none of the three models' (33.3%) analysed while the majority in the second group prefers the integrated rail model (66.7%) as an option for Thailand. The findings suggest that Thai rail transport problems should be solved by knowledge exchange, dialogue and integration between professional and academic views. Similar to several prior studies, it is recognised that there is no one solution that will fit all the countries involved in restructuring of national railways. However, this study has identified the possibility that, according to the opinions of the experts surveyed, the combination of an integrated model and regulatory body under the ministry could potentially be applied in a Thailand's context. In addition, this research also suggests application of several practices, such as introduction of assessment indicators and supporting policies and consideration of possible obstacles to the further development of rail market in Thailand. Moreover, the results of the study could be applied in ASEAN and any other developing country with a similar context, e.g. in Africa (Kenya) or South America (Brazil).","[Charanwanitwong, Thanaphon] Off Transport & Traff Policy & Planning, Bangkok, Thailand; [Fraszczyk, Anna] Mahidol Univ, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand",Mahidol University,"Fraszczyk, A (通讯作者)，Mahidol Univ, Fac Engn, CLARE, 25-25 Phuttamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.",anna.fra@mahidol.ac.th,,,Royal Thai Scholarship (Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning); Royal Thai Scholarship (Office of the Civil Service Commission); Royal Thai Scholarship (Office of Educational Affairs Royal Thai Embassy in London),Royal Thai Scholarship (Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning); Royal Thai Scholarship (Office of the Civil Service Commission); Royal Thai Scholarship (Office of Educational Affairs Royal Thai Embassy in London),"This paper is based on an original work included in an MSc thesis submitted at Newcastle University by Thanaphon Charanwanitwong and titled: Rail liberalisation in the European Union: The application to Thailand's context.

With the invention of GPS devices, information such as mileage, traffic condition and driving habits can be incorporated into auto insurance premium calculation. Several major auto insurance companies have offered usage based insurance (UBI) programs where auto insurance premiums are sensitive to actual GPS readings combined with driver's driving behavior. However, given that telematics data are proprietary to the insurance companies that collect such data, the accessibility of UBI is extremely limited. In this research we showcase how second-by-second GPS data can be integrated into existing or new auto insurance pricing structures. We use two types of data: real-time GPS trajectory data collected using a traffic app, as well as survey data. We incorporate vehicle trajectories and accident data to quantify the relationship between driving hazard and accidents with the goal of establishing the linkage between driving risks and accident costs. GPS data considered in this study include not only tradition UBI factors, but also the unique contextual-based risk measurements that compares the driving speed of the vehicle with other drivers on the same road segment. Although smartphone data is used in this study, the methodology developed can be applied to GPS trajectory data collected from other devices such as on-board diagnostics (OBD) or black box solutions. We find that hard brakes, hard starts, peak time travel, speeding as well as driving at a speed significantly different from traffic flow are highly correlated with accident rate. We illustrate the potential underwriting loss an insurer may incur resulting from adverse selection if omitting pertinent risk factors. The results of our study can help insurance companies that are interested in getting into the UBI area set up their auto insurance premium rates.","[Ma, Yu-Luen] Univ North Texas, Dept Finance Insurance Real Estate & Law, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Zhu, Xiaoyu] Metropia Inc, 1790 East River Rd,Suite 140, Tucson, AZ 85718 USA; [Hu, Xianbiao] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [Chiu, Yi-Chang] Univ Arizona, Dept Civil Engn & Engn Mech, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; University of Missouri System; Missouri University of Science & Technology; University of Arizona,"Hu, XBA (通讯作者)，Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.",Yu-luen.Ma@unt.edu; xiaoyu.zhu@metropia.com; xbhu@mst.edu; chiu@email.arizona.edu,"Hu, Xianbiao/ABE-3779-2020; Zhang, xiaoyu/HTM-3222-2023; xiaoyu, zhang/JXY-7226-2024; ZHU, XIAOYU/HJY-7240-2023","Hu, Xianbiao/0000-0002-0149-1847",Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Broad Agency Announcement Pay-As-You-Drive-And You-Save (PAYDAYS) Insurance Actuarial Study project [DTFH61-13-C-00033],Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Broad Agency Announcement Pay-As-You-Drive-And You-Save (PAYDAYS) Insurance Actuarial Study project,This research is supported by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Broad Agency Announcement Pay-As-You-Drive-And You-Save (PAYDAYS) Insurance Actuarial Study project.

This paper proposes a novel, disaggregated approach to investigating vulnerability to such increases at the household level. We propose a set of indicators of 'car-related economic stress' (ORES), based on individual household level expenditure data for the UK, to identify which low-income households spend disproportionately on running motor vehicles, and to assess the depth of their economic stress. By subsequently linking the dataset to local fuel price data, we are able to model the disaggregated price elasticities of car fuel demand. This provides us with an indicator of each household's adaptive capacity to fuel price increases. The findings show that 'Low Income, High Cost' households (LIHC) account for 9% of UK households and have distinct socio-demographic characteristics. Interestingly, they are characterised by very low responses to fuel price increases, which may cause them to compromise on other important areas of their household expenditures. Simulations suggest that a 20% increase in fuel prices would substantially increase the depth, but not the incidence of CRES. Overall, the study sheds light on a sector of the population with high levels of vulnerability to fuel price increases, owing to high exposure, high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity. This raises challenges for social, environmental and resilience policy in the transport sector.","[Mattioli, Giulio] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mattioli, Giulio; Lucas, Karen] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wadud, Zia] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Ctr Integrated Energy Res, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wadud, Zia] Univ Leeds, Sch Chem & Proc Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Mattioli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",G.Mattioli@leeds.ac.uk; Z.Wadud@leeds.ac.uk; K.Lucas@leeds.ac.uk,"Mattioli, Giulio/JCF-0799-2023; Wadud, Zia/A-6025-2012; Mattioli, Giulio/J-7314-2019","Mattioli, Giulio/0000-0003-1309-554X; Lucas, Karen/0000-0002-4009-7017",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the RCUK Energy Programme [EP/M008096/1]; EPSRC [EP/M008096/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the RCUK Energy Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as part of the RCUK Energy Programme (grant no.

It also provides a forensic analysis of the sanctioned cartels at each stage. This study shows that the introduction of the leniency programme was a critical juncture that allowed cartel authorities to identify cartels more effectively and to provide evidence for sanctioning collusion much more easily than before. This success was a key determinant for deepening the EU integration in competition policy. The intended drivers and the paradoxically unexpected shifters of such growing integration in cartel policy enforcement at the EU are discussed.","[Ordonez-De-Haro, Jose Manuel] Univ Malaga, Malaga, Spain; [Borrell, Joan-Ramon] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Jimenez, Juan Luis] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; University of Barcelona; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Jiménez, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Despacho D 2-12, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",juanluis.jimenez@ulpgc.es,"Borrell, Joan-Ramon/K-7095-2019; ORDÓÑEZ-DE-HARO, JOSE MANUEL/GWU-8843-2022","Borrell, Joan-Ramon/0000-0003-0531-8301; Jimenez Gonzalez, Juan Luis/0000-0002-3808-2588",Agencia de Defensa de la Competencia de Andalucia; Andalusian Excellence Research Project [SEJ-08065]; Catalan Government [SRG2014-325]; Spanish Government [ECO2016-76866-R]; [ECO2014-52345-P],Agencia de Defensa de la Competencia de Andalucia; Andalusian Excellence Research Project; Catalan Government; Spanish Government(Spanish Government);,"The authors are sincerely grateful for all the comments and suggestions made by three anonymous referees.

They use one of three general mechanisms to make such decisions: expert opinion, continuation of historical practices, or explicit optimization using costs and benefits data for alternative MRR actions. In using any of these decision mechanisms, the agency is guided by decision factors (i.e., the attributes of the infrastructure, the operating environment, and the action in question). With regard to the historical-practice mechanism where the agency's MRR policy is governed by past MRR decisions, there typically exists ample data on past decisions as well as the decision factors that existed at the time of the decision and hypothetically influenced the decision. Agencies that still use this decision mechanism continue to grapple with several issues, which include the feasibility of modeling the agency's past decisions as a function of the decision factors prevailing at the time of the decision; and the influence of the decision factors on the decision outcome (MRR choice) and the temporal stability of such influences. This paper demonstrates a proposed framework to address these questions using data associated with in-service bridge decks at a highway agency in Midwestern USA. This paper also discusses the insights gained about bridge infrastructure repair policy by assessing the sensitivity of past decisions to the decision factors. The paper also demonstrates how the framework can be used to develop MRR-choice probability distributions to guide future MRR decisions and then to estimate the funding needs for future bridge deck actions. Agencies can use the methodology presented in this paper for work decisions, training of new personnel, and long-term work planning and budgeting.","[Qiao, Yu; Saeed, Tariq Usman; Chen, Sikai; Labi, Samuel] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Div Environm & Ecol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Labi, S (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",qiao14@purdue.edu; tusaeed@purdue.edu; chen1670@purdue.edu; mateghi@purdue.edu; labi@purdue.edu,"Saeed, Tariq Usman/L-5494-2019; Nateghi, Roshanak/AAQ-2425-2020; chen, zhuo/JXX-1337-2024","Saeed, Tariq Usman/0000-0003-0752-9217; Chen, Sikai/0000-0002-5931-5619",,,,,50,15,17,0,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This study researches progress since 2010, as significant regulatory changes have been introduced to improve European and North Atlantic aviation risk manage ment with regards to volcanic ash. A participatory stakeholder workshop with scenario narratives was set up in which stakeholders discussed obstacles in the general management of aviation during volcanic ash eruptions as well as under extreme eruption scenarios. This paper presents recommendations developed from the workshop. The research found that a better understanding is needed of the impacts that long lasting ash episodes may have on aviation. Events of long duration require improved availability of staff, e.g., with staff exchange between related agencies. Furthermore, it is recommended that staff be trained to meet accelerated demands and restructured tasks during a crisis that may last for months. It is also suggested that more challenging response exercises be used to drive stakeholders out of their comfort zone. The study provides recommendations on information exchange between the stakeholders. During an event, the large amounts of information received from scattered sources may be quite challenging. A single point of information for stakeholders could be set up to structure the information and reduce confusion. Communication products, such as maps, must be better aligned with end-user needs. Ensuring the comprehensibility of difficult features, such as the representation of uncertainty in ash distribution modelling and produced data, requires discussion with end-users prior to an event. The study stresses the need for further funding of research on the impact of ash on jet engines since lack of knowledge in this area limits the benefits of advances in ash forecasting. The application of the Safety Risk Assessment approach needs to be coordinated across nations.","[Reichardt, Uta] Univ Iceland, Environm & Haan Resources Program, Gimli 321, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Ulfarsson, Gudmundur F.] Univ Iceland, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Hjordarhagi 2-6, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Petursdottir, Gudrun] Univ Iceland, Inst Sustainabil Studies, Gimli 321, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland; University of Iceland; University of Iceland,"Ulfarsson, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Hjordarhagi 2-6, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland.",utar@hi.is; gfu@hi.is; gudrun@hi.is,"Ulfarsson, Gudmundur F/G-8461-2012","Ulfarsson, Gudmundur F/0000-0002-0094-7531",European Commission on FP7 [308438]; University of Iceland ISAVIA Fund; NordForsk through the NORDRESS Centre of Excellence on Resilience and Societal Security,European Commission on FP7; University of Iceland ISAVIA Fund; NordForsk through the NORDRESS Centre of Excellence on Resilience and Societal Security(NordForsk),"This work was supported in part by the European Commission on FP7 grant number 308438, ENHANCE Enhancing Risk Management Partnerships for Catastrophic Natural Disasters in Europe, by the University of Iceland ISAVIA Fund, and by NordForsk through the NORDRESS Centre of Excellence on Resilience and Societal Security.

Spolaore and Wacziarg (The diffusion of development, Quarterly Journal of Economics, , 124, 469-529) argue that cultural differences, measured by countries' genetic distance, are an important barrier to the diffusion of development from the world's technological frontier. We revisit their findings in three ways. First, we successfully reproduce their results and confirm the robustness of their baseline findings. Second, we estimate their models for different time periods and find that the impact of genetic distance on income differences did not significantly change over time. Finally, we explore one of the underlying mechanisms of technology adoption and show that bilateral trade is one channel through which cultural differences retard the diffusion of development.","[Bove, Vincenzo] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Warwick, England; [Gokmen, Gunes] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia; [Gokmen, Gunes] Ctr Study Divers & Social Interact, Moscow, Russia",University of Warwick; New Economic School,"Bove, V (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Warwick, England.",v.bove@warwick.ac.uk,"Bove, Vincenzo/O-2279-2019",,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [14.U04.31.0002],"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Grant/Award Number: 14.U04.31.0002",,15,16,16,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

A standard approach is to extend agents' preferences over objects to preferences over lotteries, using (first-order) stochastic dominance, or the sd-extension. Following (Cho, Games Econ Behav 95:168-177, 2016a), we complement this approach with two alternative extensions, the dl- and ul- extensions, that give rise to lexicographic preferences (dl stands for downward lexicographic and ul for upward lexicographic) and apply all three of them in tandem to probabilistic assignment. Each property of rules now has three versions that vary with the extension chosen. We introduce a family of rules that generalizes the probabilistic serial rule. Then we study their behavior, as well as that of the random priority rule, in terms of efficiency, no-envy, and strategy-proofness.","[Cho, Wonki Jo] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Anam Ro 145, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University,"Cho, WJ (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Anam Ro 145, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",chowonki@korea.ac.kr,,"Cho, Wonki/0000-0002-7651-8784",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2924944]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2924944],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","I am grateful to William Thomson for his inspiration, encouragement, and support.

Conditions for stationarity and expressions for the moments of the process are derived. A Lagrange Multiplier test against misspecification of the within-regime correlation dynamics is proposed, and a simple recursion for multi-step-ahead conditional covariance matrices is deduced. We use this methodology to model the dynamics of the joint distribution of global stock market and real estate equity returns. The empirical analysis highlights the importance of the conditional distribution in Markov-switching time series models. Specifications with Student's t innovations dominate their Gaussian counterparts both in-and out-of-sample. The dominating specification appears to be a two-regime Student's t process with correlations which are higher in the turbulent (high-volatility) regime.","[Haas, Markus] Univ Kiel, Inst Quantitat Business & Econ Res QBER, Kiel, Germany; [Liu, Ji-Chun] Xiamen Univ, Sch Math Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China",University of Kiel; Xiamen University,"Haas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Quantitat Business & Econ Res QBER, Kiel, Germany.",Markus.haas@qber.uni-Kiel.de,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [HA 5391/21]; NSF China [11071202, 11301433]; NSF Fujian Province of China [2008J0207]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); NSF China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSF Fujian Province of China,"This paper is a considerably altered version of the manuscript Haas and Liu (2014).

Overall, we conclude that 1-year zero-coupon inflation swap rates are unbiased predictors of inflation rates. Further, there is no empirical evidence of an inflation risk premium and the assumption of rationality seems to hold. Definitely, these inferences encourage the reading of inflation expectations embedded in short-term inflation swaps. Additionally, we compare the predictive ability of inflation swaps with other measures of inflation expectations. The in-sample results show that, in contrast with surveys, market-based measures are able to accurately forecast inflation rates. In turn, based on an out-of-sample analysis, a straightforward econometric model dominates other sources. Therefore, a combined analysis that uses different sources contributes to a more robust view of future inflation rates.","[Ribeiro, Pedro Pires] Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Av Almirante Reis 71,6th Floor, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal; [Curto, Jose Dias] Inst Univ Lisboa, ISCTE IUL, UNIDE, Complexo INDEG ISCTE,Av Prof Anibal Bettencourt, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Curto, JD (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Lisboa, ISCTE IUL, UNIDE, Complexo INDEG ISCTE,Av Prof Anibal Bettencourt, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal.",ppribeiro@bportugal.pt; dias.curto@iscte.pt,,,,,,,60,3,3,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This article explores the contradictions and tensions that arise from different processes of normalisation driven by social policies that simultaneously decommodify and recommodify labour. An expanded framework of decommodification is presented that identifies how the standard employment relationship (SER) may be extended and flexibilised to include those in precarious work, drawing examples from a recent study of precarious work across six European countries. These decommodification processes are found to be both partial and, in some cases, coexisting with activation policies that position precarious work as an alternative to unemployment, thereby recommodifying labour. Despite these challenges and contradictions, the article argues that a new vision of SER reform promises greater inclusion than alternative policy scenarios that give up on the regulation of employers and rely on state subsidies to mitigate against precariousness.","[Rubery, Jill] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Comparat Employment Syst, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Grimshaw, Damian] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Employment Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Grimshaw, Damian] Int Labor Org, Res Dept, Geneva Off, Geneva, Switzerland; [Keizer, Arjan] Univ Manchester, Int HRM & Comparat Ind Relat, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Johnson, Mathew] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Work & Equal Inst, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of Manchester; University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School,"Rubery, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Work & Equal Inst, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",Jill.Rubery@manchester.ac.uk,,"Keizer, Arjan/0000-0002-0331-6081; Johnson, Mathew/0000-0003-1773-6391","European Commission funded project: DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Industrial Relations & Social Dialogue [VP/2014/004]","European Commission funded project: DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Industrial Relations & Social Dialogue","European Commission funded project: DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities VP/2014/004, Industrial Relations & Social Dialogue.",,43,138,142,1,39,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

There are both theoretical and empirical reasons to expect that some intelligent men may prefer to marry very unattractive women. The analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) shows that very unattractive women were significantly more likely to be married at Age 29 than unattractive or average-looking women, and their spouses or partners earned significantly more than those of unattractive or average-looking women. If intelligent men have historically preferred to marry very unattractive women generation after generation, then, because both general intelligence and physical attractiveness are highly heritable, this can explain why very unattractive workers are more intelligent and achieve higher education, thereby earning more. It can also explain why the positive correlation between intelligence and physical attractiveness is not larger despite assortative mating of intelligent men of higher status and physically attractive women over many generations.

We develop a legislative bargaining model in which firms influence legislators by transmitting information about the value of protection, using verbal messages and lobbying expenditures. Model estimation using firmlevel data on tariff suspension bills and lobbying expenditures reveals that the probability a suspension is granted decreases with each additional firm that expresses opposition. This effect is significantly larger than that of either opponent or proponent lobbying due to the greater information content of verbal opposition and legislative bargaining costs.","[Ludema, Rodney D.; Mayda, Anna Maria] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Mayda, Anna Maria] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Mishra, Prachi] Reserve Bank India, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Mishra, Prachi] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Georgetown University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Reserve Bank of India; International Monetary Fund,"Ludema, RD (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,29,11,12,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Second, the optimal scale of the port group in an MPR is determined by comparing the total internal costs for different scales of the port group. An integration method with multi-period investment and asset idling is also proposed that takes into account excess port resources in MPRs. Finally, main gateway ports in Northeast China are selected for an empirical study.

Although previous researches tried to unravel the scarce seafarer dilemma, there are very few studies especially in the discussion of the factors affecting the intention to work on-board or go seafaring. This research investigates the effects of shipping knowledge, attitude and reference group opinions on the intention of maritime students to work on-board basing on the knowledge, attitude and intention (KAI) model. Using questionnaire surveys collected from 243 students studying in the maritime and logistics related departments at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and Maritime Services Training Institute (MSTI) in Hong Kong. This research fmds that the attitude and reference group opinions positively influence students' intention to work on-board. Although the research hypothesis of the direct influence of shipping knowledge on the intention to work on-board was not supported. Specifically, this research finds the indirect influence of shipping knowledge and reference group opinions on students' on-board intention through attitude.

Based on this powerful approach, we propose a relevant filter and show that the proposed trend specification is a global approximation to any arbitrary trend. Furthermore, we prove formally a famous claim by Kydland and Prescott (1981, 1997) that over long time periods, the average value of the cycles is zero. A simple procedure for the econometric estimation of the model is developed as a seven-step algorithm, which relies on standard techniques, where all relevant measures may be computed routinely. Next, using relevant DGPs, we compare and show by means of Monte Carlo simulations that our approach is superior to Hodrick-Prescott (HP) and Baxter and King (BK) regarding the generated distortionary effects and the ability to operate in various frequencies, including changes in volatility, amplitudes and phase. In fact, while keeping the structure of the model relatively simple, our approach is perfectly capable of addressing the case of stochastic trend, in the sense that the generated distortionary effects in the near unit root case are minimal and, by all means, considerably fewer than those generated by HP and BK. Application to EU15 business cycles clustering is presented and the empirical results are consistent with the rigorous theoretical framework developed in this work.","[Michaelides, Panayotis G.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys Sci, Lab Theoret & Appl Econ, Heroon Polytech 9, Athens 15780, Greece; [Tsionas, Efthymios G.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England; [Vouldis, Angelos T.] European Cent Bank, Athens, Greece; [Vouldis, Angelos T.] Bank Greece, Athens, Greece; [Konstantakis, Konstantinos N.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Patrinos, Panagiotis] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Elect Engn ESAT STADIUS, Optimizat Engn Ctr OPTEC, Kasteelpark Arenberg 10, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Tsionas, Efthymios G.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; Lancaster University; European Central Bank; European Central Bank; Bank of Greece; National Technical University of Athens; KU Leuven; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Michaelides, PG (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys Sci, Lab Theoret & Appl Econ, Heroon Polytech 9, Athens 15780, Greece.",pmichael@central.ntua.gr,"Konstantakis, Konstantinos/F-1726-2019; Konstantakis, Konstantinos N./AED-3089-2022; Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020; Patrinos, Panagiotis/E-7806-2017","Konstantakis, Konstantinos N./0000-0001-6837-332X; Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106; Patrinos, Panagiotis/0000-0003-4824-7697",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,122,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Intuitively, it means that there exists a preference relation which induces an ordering of all other preferences such that frequent preferences are those that are more similar to it. This is a desirable property, since it enhances the stability of social choice by guaranteeing that there exists a Condorcet winner and it is elected by all scoring rules. In this paper, we present an algorithm for checking whether a given preference profile exhibits level-1 consensus. We apply this algorithm to a large number of preference profiles, both real and randomly-generated, and find that level-1 consensus is very improbable. We support these empirical findings theoretically, by showing that, under the impartial culture assumption, the probability of level-1 consensus approaches zero when the number of individuals approaches infinity. Motivated by these observations, we show that the level-1 consensus property can be weakened while retaining its stability implications. We call this weaker property Flexible Consensus. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that it is considerably more probable than the original level-1 consensus. In particular, under the impartial culture assumption, the probability for Flexible Consensus converges to a positive number when the number of individuals approaches infinity.","[Nitzan, Mor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Comp Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Nitzan, Mor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Nitzan, Mor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Fac Med, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Nitzan, Shmuel] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Segal-Halevi, Erel] Ariel Univ, Dept Comp Sci, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel; [Segal-Halevi, Erel] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Bar Ilan University; Ariel University; Bar Ilan University,"Nitzan, S (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.",nitzans@mail.biu.ac.il,"Segal-Halevi, Erel/H-4086-2019","Segal-Halevi, Erel/0000-0002-7497-5834; Nitzan, Mor/0000-0003-0074-9196",Azrieli Foundation; Israeli Science Foundation [1083/13],Azrieli Foundation; Israeli Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"We are grateful to the anonymous referees for insightful comments that led to this much improved version of the manuscript, and to Marc Timme and Yuval Benjamini for helpful and valuable discussions.

The results reveal a perceptible difference in labor migration among adult children whose parents are just above and below the age of pension eligibility: The adult children with a parent just attaining the pension-eligible age are more likely to be labor migrants compared with those with a parent just below the pension-eligible age. We also find that with a pension-eligible parent, the adult children are more likely to have off-farm jobs. These abrupt changes in household behavior at the cutoff suggest that these households are credit constrained. In addition, we find that the pension's effect on migration is greater among adult children with a parent in poor health; pension-eligible elderly report that they are more likely to use inpatient services when needed and less likely to rely on adult children for care when they are ill. These results suggest that (expectations regarding) providing care for elderly parents has constrained labor migration from China's rural areas to some extent, and that the new rural pension program has helped to relax this constraint.","[Eggleston, Karen] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Shorenstein Asia Pacific Res Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sun, Ang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Zhaoguo] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Zhaoguo] Kennesaw State Univ, Kennesaw, GA USA",Stanford University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Tsinghua University; University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Sun, A (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",karene@stanford.edu; ang.sun@gmail.com; zhanzhg@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University","Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University","The research for this article was financed by the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University.

This common perception is generally confirmed by empirical evidence, which is foremost provided for countries with high corporate taxes and relatively complex tax systems. We investigate whether multinational firms in a country with a comparatively more competitive tax system undertake profit shifting. We do this using detailed census data from corporate income statements and balance sheets filed by Swedish manufacturing firms between 1997 and 2007. We detect profit shifting by comparing MNEs with (purely) domestic firms. In particular, we identify systematic differences in tax payments, earnings (before interest and taxes) and equity ratios between multinational and comparable domestic firms based on propensity score matching. In addition, we examine the tax behavioural impact of acquiring multinational status using difference-in-differences estimations and/or propensity score matching. Our results reveal that the extent to which multinational firms have lower tax payments than their domestic counterparts depends on their production characteristics and foreign market outreach. In particular, we find evidence indicating that firms operating in few foreign markets and firms that become multinational engage in profit shifting from Sweden.","[Hansson, Asa; Olofsdotter, Karin] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Hansson, Asa] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Thede, Susanna] Univ Malta, Inst European Studies, Msida, Malta",Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); University of Malta,"Hansson, Å (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden.;Hansson, Å (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"The comments of an anonymous referee are gratefully acknowledged.

A case study for South Africa,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,World oil prices; Fossil fuel subsidies; Subsidy reform; Transport; CGE model; South Africa,IMPACTS; POVERTY; CHINA; CHALLENGES; PETROLEUM,"Since the fall in world oil prices in June 2014, the economic and political settings for fossil fuel subsidy reforms have changed. As in many developing economies, in South Africa oil price subsidies are criticized as an inefficient policy instrument because they hamper economic growth, contradict objectives of climate change mitigation and mainly benefit high income households which can afford to own a car. Public transportation services are the mobility option for poorer South African households, but are often unavailable and unaffordable due to insufficient governmental subsidization. Thus, the inefficient fuel subsidies and the insufficient subsidies for public transportation have complementary adverse effects on inequity with respect to the welfare of poor households and their mobility. In this study, a computable general equilibrium model simulates the decrease in world oil prices, the reduction in fuel subsidies and two options for reallocation of these subsidies to support the transport sector: either as consumer price support or as subsidies to production in the passenger transport sector. The simulations indicate improved affordability and availability of public transportation services and clearly show positive impacts for the economy, unemployment and household income. They also give some clues on how to improve the transport system in South Africa to pre-empt the situation when oil prices pick up again.","[Henseler, Martin; Maisonnave, Helene] PEP, Nairobi, Kenya; [Henseler, Martin; Maisonnave, Helene] Univ Havre, EDEHN, Le Havre, France; [Henseler, Martin] Thunen Inst Rural Studies, Bundesallee 64, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany",Universite Le Havre Normandie; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Henseler, M (通讯作者)，Thunen Inst Rural Studies, Bundesallee 64, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",martin.henseler@thuenen.de,,"Henseler, Martin/0000-0002-6621-4453",,,,,63,12,12,2,23,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Data are drawn from two national surveys administered before and after the 2014 World Cup event. Individuals are asked whether they perceive that additional funding for player development will improve the chances of the national team's performance at the 2018 World Cup and whether they are willing to pay an annual household tax to fund the program.

Results show that when children are left with fathers, the household budget is significantly diverted toward the purchase of adult private goods, but the share of budget devoted to children remains unaffected because mothers compensate by giving up their own private consumption and sending home more remittances.","[Rizzica, Lucia] Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Rizzica, L (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",lucia.rizzica@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,42,3,3,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Objectification is roughly defined as treating a human being or another animal as a thing. Concerning contemporary theories on objectification, it is remarkable that explanatory approaches refer prominently to Kant's ethic, especially to the second formula of the Categorical Imperative (Formula of Humanity, FUL). It states: 'So act that you use humanity, in your own person as well as in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means' (GMS, IV: 429). The aim of this paper is to examine how objectification can be considered in a Kantian moral framework in general and how it can be based on the FUL in particular. It will be argued that although there are overlaps between contemporary concepts of objectification and Kantian ethics, they differ in various aspects, especially concerning objectification of animals. This concerns first of all the fact, that Kant didn't use the term 'objectification' (Verdinglichung) at all. Secondly FUL can only be applied to persons, i.e. morally autonomous beings. Against the concept of objectification of many contemporary scholars, according to Kant's moral philosophy objectification of animals is not possible. Therefore FUL is smaller concerning the scope of morally relevant entities. At the same time FUL is wider regarding objectifying actions, including various forms of (self-) objectification, like gluttony, drunkness and suicide, that are not normally part of contemporary debates on objectification.","[Camenzind, S.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Camenzind, S (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",samuel.camenzind@vetmeduni.ac.at,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,365,368,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_57,0.0,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000057,0

According to many authors, the most important input in creating innovation is knowledge. The development of new products is a risky business move and is often considered as one of the most important business events in the company. For this reason, companies entering the development process have certain expectations of that product in the future in terms of: taking new market shares, becoming innovative and ultimately increasing profits. The term of new product, in this research, we mean: new products, improvements of existing products, product modification, and brand new product development for the market. When introducing a new product to the market, both companies and family can use one of several business strategies: strategy of slow penetration, strategy of fast penetration, fast-picking strategy, and slow-picking strategy. Innovation and innovation strategies and the concept of innovative family businesses will be also discussed in research. The research will be based on the data collected from the ten most successful family businesses through a survey questionnaire. Then, through the method of analysis and synthesis we will come to the conclusion what is the most common strategy for developing a new product that is used by successful family businesses and which is suitable for each type of product.

Russia's recent willingness to use power and coercion is theoretically counterintuitive as it appears to be in dissonance with the prevalent characterisation of the country as a status-overachieving inconsistent power. We argue that this behaviour is not the result of a consistent weighing of status against capabilities, but rather reflective of both internal and external dynamics. We analyse issues of identity, opportunity and costs as factors that influence Russian foreign action, showing that power politics will not solve Russia's status-inconsistency problem in the long run.","[Freire, Maria Raquel] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Ctr Social Studies CES, Ave Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Freire, Maria Raquel] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Int Relat Grp, Ave Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Heller, Regina] Univ Hamburg IFSH, Inst Peace Res & Secur Policy, Beim Schlump 83, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; University of Hamburg,"Freire, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Ctr Social Studies CES, Ave Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal.;Freire, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Int Relat Grp, Ave Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal.",rfreire@fe.uc.pt; heller@ifsh.de,"Freire, Maria Raquel/T-2321-2018","Freire, Maria Raquel/0000-0003-2952-6017",Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN-ETN) of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [642709-CASPIAN-H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [HE 6912/1-1],Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN-ETN) of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Maria Raquel Freire acknowledges research funding from the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN-ETN) of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under the grant agreement 'CASPIAN-Around the Caspian: Doctoral Training for Future Experts in Development and Cooperation with a Focus on the Caspian Region' (642709-CASPIAN-H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014).

In these cases, typically raised issues are risks to humans, insects becoming resistant to crop traits and to broader environmental consequences. However, novel biotechnological possibilities and growing interest in insects for food and feed could also raise additional ethical issues. In 2013 FAO published a report on edible insects promoting the use of insects in large-scale intensive production systems as an alleged more sustainable source of protein for food and feed than traditional livestock production. So far, a possibility that has received only little attention is the use of biotechnology to modify relevant insect species to speed up domestication to achieve higher productivity or better disease resistance. In this paper we explore some of the ethical aspects related to such a development to show what the discussions are about: E.g. the seemingly legal discussion whether insects produced using biotechnological tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 should warrant different labelling than conventionally bred insects? Would ethical concerns differ from when producing non-altered insects for food and feed? Will knowledge that the insects have been produced through biotechnology make it even more difficult to relate to them as anything other than protein units? Ethical considerations regarding animals often depend on human experiences of empathy for animals to ensure awareness of their welfare. However, with regard to insect ethics the border of both those aspects is challenged. Can insects experience welfare, and if they can, will we care; that is, can we experience any empathy with them? Moreover, issues related to human interference in a being's genome may be ethically significant. In turn, these issues could have ramifications for the social acceptability of GM insects used for food and feed.","[Gjerris, M.; Gamborg, C.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Rocklinsberg, H.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Environm & Hlth, POB 7068, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",University of Copenhagen; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Gjerris, M (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",mgj@ifro.ku.dk,"; Gamborg, Christian/L-7392-2014","Rocklinsberg, Helena/0000-0002-2821-6837; Gamborg, Christian/0000-0003-3150-8280",,,,,22,1,1,1,6,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,424,429,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_67,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000067,0

We take advantage of this time dimension available for an increasing number of economies, to tackle the endogeneity issue which has been seen as a problem in previous studies. We also use pertinent econometric techniques to address other biases inherent in the data, in particular measurement errors and multicollinearity. Our results reinforce previous findings by validating, with a larger than usual sample of countries and industries, the importance of a larger set of environment variables as well. We show that infrastructure quality (Infra), information and communication technologies (ICT), skills and experience of the labor force (H), cost of and access to financing (Fin), security and political stability (CrimePol), competition (Comp) and government relations (Gov) contribute to firms' and countries' different performances. The empirical analysis also illustrates that firms which chose an outward orientation have higher productivity levels. Nevertheless, outward oriented enterprises are, at the same time, more sensitive to investment climate limitations. These findings have important policy implications by showing which dimensions of the business environment, in which industry, could help manufacturing firms to be more competitive in the present context of increasing globalization.","[Hoang Thanh Mai Nguyen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Hoang Thanh Mai Nguyen] OECD Dev Ctr, Paris, France; [Veganzones-Varoudakis, Marie-Ange] CNRS, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Veganzones-Varoudakis, Marie-Ange] UCA Univ Clermont Auvergne, Clermont Ferrand, France",KU Leuven; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Nguyen, HTM (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.;Nguyen, HTM (通讯作者)，OECD Dev Ctr, Paris, France.",nguyen_mai94@yahoo.fr; veganzones@aol.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,248,264,,,,,,17,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540718700025,0

Under the conditions of globalization, economic diplomacy has become more propulsive, intensive and multifunctional.

Transformation and privatization of large banks led to improvement of financial stability and efficiency of banking sector. As first we used a combination of fixed assets and staff costs as input and net interest margin as output in terms of CCR and BCC-I models. In the next analysis we used the combination of three factors - fixed assets and loan-loss provisions as inputs and volume of credits as output in terms of CCR and BCC-I models.

Furthermore, we incorporated Shiryaev-Zhou index with analysis of mean (ANOM) and logistic regression to examine calendar effects of general equity and securitized real estate indices of Hong Kong, Japan, US, UK, France and Germany during the period 1996 - 2014. The results show that our new methods can detect additional channels of significant calendar effects of which normal methods fail to show. Furthermore, the general equity indices show significant Halloween and January effects. However, for the securitized real estate indices, the Halloween and January effects are less significant or even go into reverse in some cases. This study has two main implications. Firstly, investors can formulate a better trading strategy to earn more profits. Secondly, trends and phenomena found in equity markets may not be applicable to real estate markets, so investment rules on equity markets may not work on real estate markets.","[Hui, Eddie C.

We show that the spatial dependence in house prices is more pronounced in a rising housing market than in a falling market and can be associated with behavioural biases such as sellers' loss aversion tendency or herding of buyers. Using a spatio-temporal autoregressive model for 30,541 apartment transactions in Seoul, South Korea between 2006 and 2015, we find that spatial dependence in house prices is eight time higher in a boom as opposed to a bust. This shows huge asymmetric spatial effects across apartment transactions which suggests that neighbouring property prices can serve as an appropriate benchmark during a rising market but they may not be suitable to capture the housing market dynamics in a falling market. This implies that behavioural aspects such as sellers' loss aversion should be taken into account in the price formation when house prices are falling.","[Hyun, Dongwoo] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Real Estate & Planning, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England; [Milcheva, Stanimira] UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London, England",University of Reading; University of London; University College London,"Hyun, D (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Real Estate & Planning, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England.",d.hyun@pgr.reading.ac.uk; s.milcheva@ucl.ac.uk,,"Milcheva, Stanimira/0000-0002-7051-773X",,,,,59,17,18,2,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

In order to achieve this, in 2017 we conducted an empirical research using the structured questionnaire method in accordance with the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) model. Data from 100 district employees were collected and processed descriptively through SPSS. From the findings of this research and in accordance with those of other international surveys, we find that workers are generally satisfied, in a level that can be classified as medium to high. In addition, we note that satisfaction from endogenous factors is higher than exogenous. The Greek public sector needs to become more operational, efficient, decentralized and able to work in a flexible and efficient way, responding to internal and external changes. Ensuring the benefits of public administration will make it more effective and more efficient for citizens, contributing decisively to ending the economic and social crisis that has been rampaging Greece for about 8 years now.","[Karamanis, Kostas; Arnis, Nicolaos; Kypriotelis, Efstratios] Technol Educ Inst Epirus, Ioannina, Greece",,"Karamanis, K (通讯作者)，Technol Educ Inst Epirus, Ioannina, Greece.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,314,323,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500029,0

Empirical examination on 58 convertible sales conducted from 2009-2017 and financial characteristics of their 33 issuers leads to a number conclusions. First, it seems that less indebted and more profitable companies using convertibles for investment purposes may perceive them as delayed equity in order to avoid the issuance of undervalued common stock. Second, firms in financial distress issuing convertible bonds to restructure their liabilities may treat them as backdoor equity financing to reduce time and costs of selling common stock through public or private offerings. Third, several firms are likely to issue convertible debt for tax benefits available under Polish law.

Two groups of insurability criteria have been identified: endogenous and exogenous ones. Exogenous criteria of insurability refer to the attributes of the risk itself. Exogenous ones are connected with the features of the insurance market and its participants, especially the ability of the insurance companies to deal with the specific risk. The level of environmental risk insurability is relatively low. It is because of the problem with fulfilment of both endogenous and exogenous criteria. The occurrence, which results in environmental damage is very often not sudden, random and extraordinary. The probability of accident and probable maximum loss are difficult to estimate. Additionally, environmental risk results often in catastrophic loss.

In Morocco, the Constitution of July 2011 enshrines equality between women and men regarding all rights, including economic rights, the right to work and rights in the workplace. In the same context, Law No. 103.13 on combating violence against women was recently adopted on the 14th of February 2018. By including all forms of violence against women in different contexts, whether at home, on the street, at work or elsewhere, this law will allow Morocco to have a legal reference that could guarantee a better protection of women against all forms of violence. Despite the legislator's efforts, experience shows that affirming principles is not enough, and ensuring the implementation and effectiveness of these rules is necessary. In this field companies' key actors play a crucial role. Powell (1999) uses the notion of organizational attitude towards equality, which refers to actions and beliefs of actors in favor of equality. Furthermore, in the case of Morocco no exploratory study has been carried out until then. The present study aims to understand the commitment of companies in Morocco in terms of gender equality. To do this, four business case studies are mobilized. The analysis of the results shows that perceptions of key actors' within the company influence the priority given to equality. Depending on the level of organizational commitment, equality practices vary considerably from one company to another.

While Colombia is generally classified as a water-rich country, it is expected that water shortages will occur in the future without adequate planning and investments in water management infrastructures. Currently, even though all instruments required for an integrated water resource management are present in Colombia, they are employed independently from each other and thus not very efficient. To estimate the potential benefits of a more coordinated water management planning, especially in consideration of projected changes in water availability and demand in the near future, we developed a constrained welfare maximization model of the watershed (CAMARI). We ran the model with three different scenarios of future water availability, based on RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 6.0, and with two planning modes: coordinated and uncoordinated. The results show that a coordinated planning of investments in water management infrastructures increases welfare by 2-18% over the next century in the Magdalena river basin, which corresponds to average annual savings from US$ 610 million to US$ 6.4 billion. Benefits increase as water availability decreases. Our results also show that water demand from the agricultural sector is projected to rise in future, which further underlines the necessity for robust governance mechanisms to keep conflicts between sectors to a minimum.","[Rasche, Livia; Schneider, Uwe A.; Lobato, Martha Bolivar; Del Diego, Ruth Sos] Univ Hamburg, Res Unit Sustainabil & Global Change, Hamburg, Germany; [Stacke, Tobias] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; Max Planck Society,"Rasche, L (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Res Unit Sustainabil & Global Change, Hamburg, Germany.",livia.rasche@uni-hamburg.de,"Schneider, Uwe A/M-7342-2016","Schneider, Uwe A/0000-0002-6833-9292; Rasche, Livia/0000-0002-6494-2596",German Service for Academic Exchange (DAAD); Gleichstellungsfonds of the Universitat Hamburg; Colombian Administrative Department of Science and Technology (COLCIENCIAS); Universidad del Cauca in Colombia [2.3-31.2/O12 DE 2011]; cluster of excellence CliSAP of Universitat Hamburg,"German Service for Academic Exchange (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Gleichstellungsfonds of the Universitat Hamburg; Colombian Administrative Department of Science and Technology (COLCIENCIAS)(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); Universidad del Cauca in Colombia; cluster of excellence CliSAP of Universitat Hamburg","One of the authors was supported by grants from the German Service for Academic Exchange (DAAD), the Gleichstellungsfonds 2015 of the Universitat Hamburg, the Colombian Administrative Department of Science and Technology (COLCIENCIAS), and the Universidad del Cauca in Colombia under the Study Commission 2.3-31.2/O12 DE 2011.

As part of the market analysis, it is important to make good market segmentation. If we want to market a new product, service, or product that's known already to consumers and has only been modified or proved, it is necessary to have information whether consumers want such modified product or service. We are witnessing many homogenous products on the market, and for this reason, companies have no way of influencing the price of the products or services they offer. There is an old saying that wood is often not seen in the woods. Products that are homogenous represents companies that sell identical or similar products, which means that such products on the market are perfectly replaceable, and no company can raise the price of its product, as this would greatly affect competition or decline in sales. For these reasons, both the manufacturers and the consumers need to have information on what kind of product is required on the market and are it the manufacturer's able toa produce product according to required characteristics. For the modern market, we can say that is packed with various products and services, and trade has become very complex, both by bidders as well as by consumers. For these reasons, manufacturers are forced to change a the way they operate, so before they start producing the product, they know exactly all performance a particular product must have, It is possible for the consumer to buy a product that is personalized. This method of production in near future will be imperative in business because the consumer in busy lifestyle doesn't have time to explore the market to find a product or service according to his preferences.","[Resetar, Zlatko; Tolusic, Zdravko; Resetar, Nikolina Pavicic] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Resetar, Z (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",zlatko.resetar@bak.hr; tolusic@efos.hr; nikolina.pavicic@bak.hr,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1290,1307,,,,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300070,0

The green growth appears as an approach of the aiming development to promote the economic growth and the development while watching that the natural assets continue to supply the resources and the environmental services on which depends our well-being. To measure exactly the progress realized regarding transition towards a green growth, countries apply methods of calculation taking into account all the wealth and the value of the ecosystems, in a parallel to their conventional indicators such as the GDP. At the heart of the green growth, there is gratitude of the natural capital as factor of production and its role in the improvement of the well-being. However simple it is, to measure the green growth, we need to measure the growth and the first reflex in this context is to turn to the gross domestic product. The GDP is an essential tool to measure the economic growth. It is an essential indicator to understand the economic performance. However, it does not inevitably report variations of the stocks of capital, or the wealth, which are essential determiners of the growth and the present and future earnings of well-being. If it rests on the liquidation of assets, the production can grow while the wealth decreases. In this context, a country can over-exploit its resources, in the point to threaten the safety of its population (current or future), without show its balance sheet of it of development, if it leans only on the GDP. Nevertheless, several suggest resorting to new measurement tools in complement or as a replacement to the GDP. This situation highlights the necessity of finding better ways to measure the economic progress that is measures used in the side of the GDP which report in a more complete way the role of the natural capital in the economic growth, the human health and the well-being. In this article, we aim at examining about some of the essential indicators of measure of the green growth while decoupling the mystery marked around the GDP as the measurement tool for the economic growth. In fact, we shall show that it is necessary to use other measures in the highly-rated of the GDP which report the natural capital in the economic growth. During the last thirty years, the gross domestic product (GDP) stood out as measure of the green growth. As indicator of the economic growth, the relevance of the GDP is not disputed, but its capacity to report of the green growth is however questioned. This article will aim at answering four major questions: What are the effects of the threats of the ecosystems on the growth? Is there a link between the GDP and the green growth and which are the failures?

In this study, we propose the use of web mining techniques for restaurant growth prediction as a novel approach. Web mining enables automatic and large-scale collection and analysis of potentially valuable data from various online platforms, thus bearing a great potential for growth prediction. First, a systematic literature review on growth factors is conducted, which serves as a base to collect growth-relevant information from the web. Next, web mining methods are applied to automatically collect and extract growth factors from various web data sources. Finally, we build and compare different binary classification models using supervised machine learning algorithms. More specifically, the developed models classify a restaurant either in a non-growing or growing restaurant. The algorithms for predictive modeling include logistic regressions, random forests and artificial neural networks. Results show that random forests on web data outperform both logistic regressions and artificial neural networks and therefore are recommended for further investigations on predictive modeling of restaurant growth.","[Te, Yiea-Funk; Muller, Daniel] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Wyder, Sebastian; Pramono, Dwian] Die Mobiliar, Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Te, YF (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",fte@ethz.ch; danielmueller@ethz.ch; sebastian.wyder@mobi.ch; dwian.pramono@mobi.ch,,,,,,,63,1,1,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,237,256,,,,,,20,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300025,0

The results show that the comprehensive UCC has a fluctuating downward trend, and the UCC compositions of four sub-systems contribute differently. There is a large gap in UCC value among the five sub-UAs in the YREB, which indicates that the unbalanced and diverse sustainable development in UAs cannot be neglected. From a dynamic perspective, the spatial differentiation is increasingly noticeable, and the pattern of spatial clustering transforms into discrete small areas. This transformation implies that many hot spot cities have preferred coordinated cooperation within a small region rather than the whole UA in recent years. Some policy suggestions should be further provided. Our study makes contributions to UA's sustainable development research, and some findings could be used as the reference for future decision-making.","[Tian, Yuan] Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Chongqing 400040, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chuanwang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; Xiamen University,"Sun, CW (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",cw_sun@foxmail.com,"Sun, Chuanwang/JOZ-8733-2023","Sun, Chuanwang/0000-0002-1900-4699","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673230]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720151026, 20720151039]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the editor and anonymous referees for their insightful and constructive comments.

This paper discusses problems encountered in the implementation of bilingual courses, such as inefficiency in teaching and low acceptance among students. Through the understanding of students in the teaching practice, this paper finds that the problem is not caused by students' English skills, professional foundation or their learning habits, but by the mismatch of their English skills and professional knowledge reserves, leading to not being able to apply English in learning specialized courses, hence reducing learning interests. We conduct a series of methods on reforming bilingual teaching techniques based on actual experimental teaching and follow-up surveys, and find that use of targeted previews, English keywords, and online platform providing repeatable English micro lessons can largely improve students' learning interests and learning efficiency. This study explores the essential causes of problems in bilingual teaching and explores effective ways to improve teaching outcomes, filling the gap between theoretical and practical research.","[Yu, Yin; Zhao, Yawei] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Finance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Yu, Y (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Finance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",y.yu@njau.edu.cn,,,Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project of Nanjing Agricultural University [2015Y050],Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project of Nanjing Agricultural University,This paper is funded by Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project (2015Y050) of Nanjing Agricultural University.

This investment vehicle, which is designed to provide the risk-return benefits of private market real estate, is available to retail investors in a number of countries. At the same time, these funds are also subject to liquidity risk, because they hold an inherently illiquid asset in an open-end structure. This format presents fund-family managers with unique challenges, particularly with the decision to open new funds. The data consist of 2,127 German fund openings across 76 fund families in 12 asset classes over the 1992-2010 period. Including a wide range of asset classes allows for a comparison between real estate and other investment objectives. We find a substantial cannibalization effect across the existing real estate funds of a family, while we note the opposite effecti.e., flows into existing funds increase following a fund opening within the same objectivefor all other asset classes. Our analysis of fund opening determinants shows that inflows mitigate the cannibalization risk for new real estate funds. Additional evidence highlights the role of scale and scope economies in real estate fund openings. Overall, the results provide new insights into the relatively large size and small number of real estate funds when compared to mutual funds dedicated to other investment objectives.","[Downs, David H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Kornblau Inst, Snead Hall,301 West Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Sebastian, Steffen P.; Woltering, Rene-Ojas] Univ Regensburg, IREBS Int Real Estate Business Sch, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany",Virginia Commonwealth University; University of Regensburg,"Downs, DH (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Kornblau Inst, Snead Hall,301 West Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",dhdowns@vcu.edu; steffen.sebastian@irebs.de; rene.woltering@irebs.de,,,IREBS foundation; Kornblau Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University,IREBS foundation; Kornblau Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University,"Our work has benefited from discussions with many of our colleagues.

Consumer preference studies have indicated that the current limitation on driving distance is important. At the same time studies on the actual use of household vehicles indicate modest requirements for daily travel. An unresolved issue is to what extent these range limitations affect daily travel in EVs. In this study, we use real electric vehicle trip data to study the distribution of daily use and types of home-based journeys where a household decides to use an electric vehicle instead of their conventional vehicle. The results show how several factors related to distance and number of necessary charging events have plausible effects on electric vehicle travel behaviour. Further, the modelling indicates that the EV alternative is mostly used for well-planned transport and that EV use will not be the same as use of the conventional vehicle in two-vehicle households.","[Jensen, Anders Fjendbo; Mabit, Stefan Lindhard] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Management Engn, Bygningstorvet Bldg 116 Vest, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Jensen, AF (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Management Engn, Bygningstorvet Bldg 116 Vest, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",afjje@dtu.dk; smab@dtu.dk,"Jensen, Anders/AAS-8404-2021","Jensen, Anders Fjendbo/0000-0002-1952-7617; Mabit, Stefan Eriksen/0000-0002-3675-6884",,,,,22,28,32,2,45,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

In particular, we present an agent-based simulation of an Arrow-Debreu economy that accurately exhibits the Stolper-Samuelson effect as an emergent property. Absent of a Walrasian auctioneer or any other central coordination, we let firm and consumer agents of different types interact in an open, money-driven market. Exogenous preference shocks result in price and wage shifts that are in accordance with the general equilibrium solution, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively with high accuracy. Key to this achievement are three independent measures. First, we overcome the poor input synchronization of conventional price finding heuristics of firms in agent-based models by introducing sensor prices, a novel approach to price finding that decouples information exploitation from information exploration. Second, we improve accuracy and convergence by employing exponential search as exploration algorithm. Third, we normalize prices indirectly by fixing dividends, thereby stabilizing the system's dynamics.","[Meisser, Luzius] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kreuser, C.

In depth understanding of the fluctuations of a port's activities at the aggregate level requires a granular analysis at the disaggregate level. This becomes more critical in the case of containers since in general limited information for a container's content is available. In the present study Sydney's container port throughput is decomposed in its main industrial sectors and focus on their interrelations. Quarterly data are used covering the 2014:Q3 - 1995:Q2 period and 15 sectors in line with United Nations classification. For the identification of spillover shocks across container sectors over time we develop a spillover index on the basis of a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. The interpretation of the results is enhanced with the use of network theory. The results document that fluctuations on the aggregate level are the output of co-movement across container sectors for both imports and exports, while at the same time they respond differently to shocks revealing leadership and followship behavior. Finally, the main macroeconomic determinants affecting the co-movement of sectors demonstrate different sign and significance for exports and imports.","[Paflioti, Persa; Tsamourgelis, Ioannis] Univ Aegean, Business Sch, Dept Shipping Trade & Transport, Chios 82100, Greece; [Vitsounis, Thomas K.] CSIRO, DATA61, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia; [Teye, Collins; Bell, Michael G.

We find that the existing literature reports a statistically significant non-zero effect as a whole, and a genuine effect is confirmed for some FDI determinants beyond the publication-selection bias.","[Tokunaga, Masahiro] Kansai Univ, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Iwasaki, Ichiro] Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan",Kansai University; Hitotsubashi University,"Tokunaga, M (通讯作者)，Kansai Univ, Suita, Osaka, Japan.",,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science & Technology of Japan [23243032]; Joint Usage and Research Center of the Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University [FY2016]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23243032, 17H04553] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science & Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Joint Usage and Research Center of the Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was financially supported by a grant-in-aid for scientific research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science & Technology of Japan (No. 23243032) and the Joint Usage and Research Center of the Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University (FY2016).

Social norms have been posited as one potential explanation for misreporting of weight and height, but lack of awareness of body weight has been suggested as an alternative explanation, and the evidence presented to date is inconclusive. This paper is the first to offer a theoretical model of self-reporting behavior for weight and height, in which individuals face a tradeoff between reporting an accurate weight (or height) and reporting a socially desirable weight (or height). The model generates testable implications that help us to determine whether self-reporting errors arise because of social desirability bias or instead reflect lack of awareness of body weight and/or other factors. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2010, we find that self-reports of weight offer robust evidence of social desirability bias. However, lack of awareness of weight may also contribute to self-reporting biases, and this factor appears to be more important within some demographic groups than others. Among both women and men, self-reports of height exhibit significant social desirability bias only among those of below-average height, and very few individuals underreport their height. Implied self-reports of BMI exhibit gender-specific patterns similar to those observed for self-reporting of weight, and the inferred social norms for BMI (20.8 for women and 24.8 for men) are within the normal range established by public health institutions. Determining why individuals misreport their weight has important implications for survey design as well as for clinical practice. For example, our findings suggest that health care providers might take additional steps to increase self-awareness of body weight. The framework also helps to explain previous findings that the degree of self-reporting bias in weight is stronger in telephone surveys than it is in in-person surveys. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using the last wave of the Spanish National Health Survey, we find that 1710 adults out of the original sample of 36,087 have diabetes, reporting higher rates of unemployment. Our empirical results suggest that persons with diabetes, compared with non-diabetic persons, have poorer labor outcomes in terms of length of unemployment and lower income. However, diabetes is not significantly associated with unemployment probabilities, suggesting that the burden of diabetes on employment is mediated by lifestyle factors and clinical and functional complications. In addition, there are mixed outcomes to this econometric approach, depending on age and gender, among other factors. This interesting finding has several implications for research and policy on strategies to get lower health inequalities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Deepening PNs may generate positive welfare effects and lead to a proliferation in the formation of interdependent regional trade agreements (RTAs). This paper theoretically develops the link between PNs and the formation of RTAs and empirically investigates the link by applying a qualitative choice model estimation methodology (probit) with panel data that covers bilateral country-pairs among 147 countries between 2000 and 2010. We find that the RTA formation has been strongly driven by deepening PNs between members as well as with third countries.

Yet, the relationship between tourism and financial development (FD) has received scant attention in the academic literature. This article focuses on whether tourism promotes FD in Caribbean economies. We do so by using newly constructed data on tourism flows to the region during the period 1980-2013. We find that tourist expenditure, on average, has a positive and significant impact on various measures of FD. At our most conservative estimates, we find that by increasing tourism expenditures per capita by about $ 1200 (USD), depth in the financial system improves by about 10-15%, while efficiency increases by about 34%. Our results are robust to instrumental variables, system generalized method of moments, and limited information maximum likelihood estimation techniques as well as to a variety of measures of FD.

Both the theoretical and the empirical literature are extremely divided on this issue. We apply a relatively new empirical technique - the continuous wavelet transform - to Bangladesh. Bangladesh is of interest because of its remarkable economic growth and poverty reduction during the last 30years in combination with, for a developing country, a controlled inflation. The wavelet analysis is a contribution because it displays how the correlation and the lead-lag structure between variables change over timescales, taking into account that growth and inflation can follow several different cycles. Comovements between variables are generally studied in the time domain. Results from studies in the time-domain study can be sensitive to the frequency of observations. On the other hand, studies in the frequency domain are not easily translated into time domains that can be associated with economic policies. The wavelet methodology finds a balance between time and frequency domains. Our study finds that growth Granger causes inflation at all frequency scales, starting from the short run to the very long run. Inflation, on the other hand, Granger causes growth in the long run but not in the short run. This result has implications for Bangladesh, and as such for similar developing countries, where some policymakers believe that inflation must be kept at very low levels for sustained economic growth.","[Uddin, Gazi Salah; Sjo, Bo] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Linkoping, Sweden; [Muzaffar, Ahmed Taneem] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Business, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Arouri, Mohamed] Ctr Clermontois Rech Gest & Management CRCGM, Clermont Ferrand, France",Linkoping University; Western Sydney University,"Uddin, GS (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Linkoping, Sweden.",,"Sjö, Bo/J-1280-2014; Uddin, Gazi Salah/L-6135-2019; Muzaffar, Ahmed Taneem/GXH-4864-2022","Salah Uddin, Gazi/0000-0002-5744-0192",,,,,31,6,6,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2017,40.0,9,,,,,1918,1933,,10.1111/twec.12429,0.0,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FG5AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410299900009,0

Often regional indicators, in particular those concerning poverty and social exclusion, have to be derived from surveys with sample size and design determined primarily to serve estimation at the national level. In the specific context of EU-SILC surveys and the Headline Indicator at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) and its components defined by European Commission, this paper aims to contribute to the methodology for constructing such indicators at the regional level. The main difficulty arises from the smallness of regional samples in national surveys. The paper focuses on two related issues: identifying procedures potentially useful for improving sampling precision of regional estimates; and improving the precision of sampling error estimates of regional statistics based on small but complex samples. In addition to some results presented for a large number of OECD countries, more detailed numerical illustration is provided for two countries (Austria and Spain) based on EU-SILC data.","[Verma, Vijay; Lemmi, Achille; Betti, Gianni; Gagliardi, Francesca] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Siena, Italy; [Piacentini, Mario] OECD, Stat Directorate, Paris, France",University of Siena; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Betti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Siena, Italy.",gianni.betti@unisi.it,"Betti, Gianni/J-4836-2019; Gagliardi, Francesca/AAG-5320-2020","Betti, Gianni/0000-0002-0414-7806; Gagliardi, Francesca/0000-0001-7710-6653",,,,,23,7,7,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

The main motivation is to test hypothesized relations between urban freight delivery parking issues and the aforementioned factors as a way to perform an indirect, but informative, freight infrastructure adequacy assessment. The hypothesized model structure makes it possible to examine, for example, if the distribution channel characteristics (e.g., the most frequently used delivery vehicle type) can be linked to a certain type of parking behavior/preference, due to operation requirements, which could result in perceived urban freight delivery parking issues. The chosen variables are assembled from a plethora of sources. Establishment characteristics include size, number of employees and weekly deliveries, with this data being gathered using an establishment-based freight survey. Distribution channels are characterized by the predominant delivery agent and vehicle type. Delivery operations are represented by the most common parking location. Finally, the perceived issues include vehicles blocking other vehicles, lack of loading/unloading bays and illegal parking in loading/unloading bays. The land use data is obtained from parking records, the OpenStreetMap repository, the Portuguese National Statistics Institute (e.g., information on residents) and the City Council's retail establishments' census. The results show that, in general, the hypothesized relationships hold true. Perceived urban freight delivery parking issues are a function of the establishment characteristics, their distribution channels and delivery operations patterns. Weekly deliveries are dependent on distribution channels and establishment characteristics. Finally, weekly deliveries' frequency did not seem to influence the perceived urban freight delivery parking issues. This supports the hypothesis that the retailers' judgement is not biased by the frequency of said operations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper uses tools of network analysis to examine the evolution of value-added trade from 1995 to 2011. GVCs are very centralised and asymmetric networks, with a few large economies acting as hubs, which exposes them to the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks. As GVCs expanded, the networks of foreign value added in exports became denser, more complex and intensively connected. The regional dimension of GVCs is still dominant but is progressively giving place to a more global network. Networks of foreign value added in goods exports outpace those of services exports. However, foreign inputs of services are important for exports of both goods and services. There is a striking rise of China as a supplier of value added, while Germany and the United States maintain a central role in GVCs over the whole period.","[Amador, Joao; Cabral, Sonia] Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Lisbon, Portugal; [Amador, Joao] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Amador, J (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, Lisbon, Portugal.;Amador, J (通讯作者)，Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",,,"Amador, Joao/0000-0002-8966-8036; Cabral, Sonia/0000-0002-6315-6745",,,,,63,61,64,10,88,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2017,40.0,7,,,,,1291,1313,,10.1111/twec.12469,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FA2RN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405288600002,0

We adopt a two-stage estimation procedure to assess whether competition among public schools influences demand for places. A robust conditional order-m approach is used to estimate the efficiency of each school; a spatial econometric framework is then applied to disentangle the determinants of demand for the school when strategic interaction among parents is present. We detect the presence of positive spatial autocorrelation in the demand for public schools, but the magnitude of the spillover effects drops when neighboring school performance is added in. Our results confirm the existence of competitive pressures among public schools' performance that we also infer from parents' school choices.","[Lopez-Torres, Laura; Prior, Diego] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Business, Edifici B,Campus Bellaterra, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Nicolini, Rosella] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Edifici B,Campus Bellaterra, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Prior, D (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Business, Edifici B,Campus Bellaterra, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",Diego.Prior@uab.es,"López-Torres, Laura/AAT-8389-2021; Nicolini, Rosella/J-8838-2012","López-Torres, Laura/0000-0002-7998-5759; Nicolini, Rosella/0000-0002-3331-8926; Prior, Diego/0000-0002-4669-2861",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2013-44115-P]; FPU [12/01341],Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); FPU(Spanish Government),"The authors are grateful to the Conseil Superior d'Avaluacio del Sistema Educatiu for providing the data, with a special mention to Dr. Paquita Grane-Terradas.

Some analysts use no-price methods by using a food Engel curve to derive the deflator as that needed for nominally similar households to have equal food shares in all regions and time periods. This method cannot be tested in countries where it is used as a spatial deflator since they lack suitable price data. In this paper, data from Vietnam are used to test this method against benchmarks provided by multilateral price indexes calculated from repeated spatial price surveys. Deflators from a food Engel curve appear to be a poor proxy for deflators obtained from multilateral price indexes. To the extent that such price indexes reliably compare real living standards over time and space, these results suggest that estimates of the level, location, and change in poverty and inequality would be distorted if the Engel method deflator was used in their stead.","[Gibson, John] Univ Waikato, Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Le, Trinh] Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Kim, Bonggeun] Seoul Natl Univ, Econ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Waikato; Seoul National University (SNU),"Gibson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",jkgibson@waikato.ac.nz; Trinh.Le@motu.org.nz; bgkim07@snu.ac.kr,,"Le, Trinh Van Thi/0000-0002-7541-158X",,,,,45,9,10,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Using 10-digit Harmonized System data, we show that a doubling of distance is associated with about 7.5 per cent increase in the average product-level price, from which five percentage points can be attributed to within-firm-product variation. We run a number of tests to look for heterogeneity in this pattern. Interestingly, the measured effect is very similar for domestic and foreign firms but distance seems to matter somewhat more for EU countries than outside the EU. We do not find much evidence for heterogeneity across product categories based on measures of vertical differentiation. The level of product aggregation matters; the distance coefficient is larger when products are aggregate to the eight or six-digit level.","[Goerg, Holger] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, CEPR, Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Halpern, Laszlo] CEU, CEPR, CERS HAS, Budapest, Hungary; [Murakozy, Balazs] CERS HAS, Budapest, Hungary",University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Central European University; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Görg, H (通讯作者)，Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, CEPR, Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",,"Murakozy, Balazs/AAH-8844-2021","Murakozy, Balazs/0000-0002-7666-428X",European Commission [225551]; Hungarian Academy of Sciences [LP2013-56],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences),"This paper is produced as part of the 'European Firms in a Global Economy: Internal policies for external competitiveness (EFIGE)', a collaborative project funded by the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (contract number 225551).

Since the 1970s, in particular in the French language literature, Georgescu-Roegen's ecological claim has often been considered as a promotion of degrowth. In this paper, I challenge this usual interpretation. I conclude that Georgescu-Roegen might be a source of inspiration for degrowth defenders only in a very narrow sense. A cautious reading of his bioeconomic paradigm shows that Georgescu-Roegen's stance was different from the growth/degrowth debate, and might be more accurately linked with an agrowth option.","[Missemer, Antoine] CIRAD, CNRS, CIRED, UMR 8568,ENPC,EHESS,AgroParisTech, 45bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",CIRAD; AgroParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Missemer, A (通讯作者)，CIRAD, CNRS, CIRED, UMR 8568,ENPC,EHESS,AgroParisTech, 45bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",missemer@centre-cired.fr,,"Missemer, Antoine/0000-0003-3972-7648",,,,,49,13,13,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Results show that export growth has no impact, whereas import growth reduces employment growth. But contrary to popular belief, Canada's job loss due to imports has been very small, only about 6,000 persons annually. China's negative impacts are more pronounced in industries where the share of information and communication technology (ICT) capital is rising fast and among low R&D intensive industries. In terms of skill change, ICT use and real exchange rate appreciation are biased towards high skill workers. Imports from the United States and China are skill-neutral, whereas imports from Mexico are skill-upgrading. Overall, neither export nor import growth has an impact on the wage rate. However, had there been no imports from China, the annual wage growth rate of high skill manufacturing workers would have been 0.6per cent higher. Between 1992 and 2007, there was an annual net gain from the rise in imports at about 0.4per cent of GDP, in addition to the gains obtained from 1992 import levels vis-a-vis autarky.","[Acharya, Ram C.] Govt Canada, Dept Ind, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Acharya, RC (通讯作者)，Govt Canada, Dept Ind, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,16,4,5,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2017,40.0,5,,,,,849,882,,10.1111/twec.12360,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,ET9RB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400644200002,0

The internationalisation process can be a one-off transfer of authority to international institutions or an ongoing process. In the latter situation, the level of internationalisation may be gradually increased by expanding the regulatory scope of the regime or by deepening it. However, internationalisation processes may also involve stalemate or even reversal. How do domestic policy makers respond to such non-linear internationalisation? To answer this question, this paper analyzes the relationship between developments in the GATT and WTO farm trade negotiations and the reform trajectory of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) from the early 1990s to 2013. Until 2008, the EU gradually changed the support instruments of the CAP to limit their trade distorting impact. After the Doha Round stalled in 2008, international trade policy concerns were downgraded and domestic concerns took priority in the 2013 reform.","[Daugbjerg, Carsten] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Daugbjerg, Carsten] Univ Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Australian National University; University of Copenhagen,"Daugbjerg, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.;Daugbjerg, C (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",carsten.daugbjerg@anu.edu.au,"Daugbjerg, Carsten/E-5035-2015","Daugbjerg, Carsten/0000-0003-3869-6034",Research Fund of the Basic Agricultural Agreement in Norway [159101],Research Fund of the Basic Agricultural Agreement in Norway,"An earlier version of this article was presented at the ECPR General Conference, Glasgow, 3-6 September 2014.

IICs are intended to stimulate the development of intentional, community-driven networks for innovation that transcend current institutional and organizational boundaries, with an emphasis on building both democracy and strategy. The IIC model is designed to be broadly replicable. This study presents IICs conceptually and discusses key findings from pilot research that support their design. Then, case studies are presented from five communities in rural Australia, where IICs were used to form nascent network relationships and start meaningful discussions about launching community-driven entrepreneurship and innovation projects.

The authors use a unique data set of the number of daily visitors at a specific ski resort from 2007/2008 to 2013/2014. The main findings suggest that weather conditions, day of the week and holidays significantly affect the number of daily visitors. The time series regression analysis highlights the demand pattern and specific non-linear relationships between visitors and wind chill temperature. The study finds that, if the wind chill temperature is below -9.5 degrees C, a temperature increase has a positive effect on the number of daily visitors. Similarly, if the wind chill temperature is above -9.5 degrees C, a higher temperature leads to a lower number of skier visits, on average. Tourism providers can use these results for decision-making, planning and managing ski resort operations.

To account for cross-national variations in the application of financial corrections for non-compliant spending, several factors are explored, focusing on regional autonomy, administrative capacity and goodness-of-fit. The quantitative analysis finds strong support for the impact of administrative capacity on cross-national compliance patterns and some evidence for the role of goodness-of-fit. Contrary to expectations, regional autonomy is not associated with compliance in this critical case of EU multi-level governance.

These recovery plans are undertaken by the municipality or by the state depending on the type of label. I examine the effect of these fiscal stress labels on municipal government financial behavior, crime, and housing prices from 1999-2012. Using difference-indifferences, I find that municipalities with fiscal stress labels reduce total expenditures per capita by nearly 25 percent. Although municipalities make reductions to both per capita capital and operating expenditures, the largest percentage reductions occur in per capita capital expenditures. There are heterogeneous responses by the type of municipality and type of governance structure in place, especially in the reductions made to operating expenditures. Cities and municipalities with council-manager governance structures much more heavily focus on reductions in spending for specific public services (e.g., safety services, roads), while villages and municipalities with mayor-council governance structures primarily reduce general operating expenditures and increase local tax revenue. These labels have minimal impacts on crime rates and police employment. While I find no statistically significant effect of label receipt on housing prices, I do find that residential home sale prices fall following fiscal stress label removal.

They are key players in the deepening of the global value chain (GVC). However, little is known about their contribution to world trade due to a lack of information on their location and status. This paper sets out to improve knowledge in this area by analysing the trade performance of EPZ countries at macro-level with a focus on EPZ externalities and distortive costs. We have built an original database of EPZs in which we define them as processing zones benefiting from import tariff incentives. We show that EPZs increase trade only by easing the negative impact of protection. As importers of components and raw materials, they raise the rest of the world's exports. This confirms the contribution of EPZs to the GVC. This result is robust to a change in the model specification, errors and bias due to data collection issues and sample composition.","[Yucer, Aycil] Univ Dokuz Eylul, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey; [Yucer, Aycil; Siroen, Jean-Marc] Univ Paris 09, PSL Res Univ, IRD, LEDa,UMR 225,DIAL, Paris, France",Dokuz Eylul University; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Yücer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Dokuz Eylul, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey.;Yücer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, PSL Res Univ, IRD, LEDa,UMR 225,DIAL, Paris, France.",,"Yücer, Ayçıl/GWV-3221-2022; SIROEN, Jean Marc/JDN-0086-2023","Yücer, Ayçıl/0000-0002-2720-0710; Siroen, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-4494-3169",Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR) programme Les Suds II; NOPOOR programme (FP7),Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR) programme Les Suds II(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); NOPOOR programme (FP7),This research on free trade zones was funded by the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR) programme Les Suds II with the participation of the NOPOOR programme (FP7).

The findings suggest that labor, private capital and, when controlling for cross-sectional dependence, average schooling years exert a positive and significant effect on state income. In contrast, the income effect of public capital stock is negative. The state-specific coefficients indicate that this effect likely stems from the negative elasticity of income with respect to public capital in the states located primarily in the Snow Belt region.","[Benos, Nikos; Mylonidis, Nikolaos; Zotou, Stefania] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece",University of Ioannina,"Benos, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece.",nbenos@cc.uoi.gr; nmylonid@uoi.gr; stefaniazotou@gmail.com,"Benos, Nikos/Z-5719-2019","Benos, Nikos/0000-0002-9361-8808; Mylonidis, Nikolaos/0000-0001-7185-3703",,,,,97,5,7,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

An analysis of the weight of premium production within the total income enables us to see if its amount offsets the continuing decline in the real price of raw milk.

We exploit a (quasi-) natural experiment - the implementation of the Western Extension Zone (WEZ) to the London Congestion Charging zone in 2007. We measure investment in social capital by using the frequency of visits to friends and family before and after the implementation of the WEZ. Using longitudinal data collected in January and November 2007 made available by Transport for London, we perform difference-in-difference analysis, using both OLS and interval regression, with the treatment group defined as those who used a car to make visits pre-WEZ. We observe large and statistically significant reductions in visits as a result of the WEZ, with, for example, a reduction of around 20 visits a year to friends. The effect of the WEZ on the number of visits to act as an informal carer is much larger, with reductions of around 100 visits a year. Given that the changes occurred in such a small time frame (10 months), we conclude that the WEZ is likely to be the main driver of these reductions. (c) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on militia rosters of the Choson Dynasty from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, we tentatively conclude that the final height of Korean men during this period was 166 cm and thus slightly above that of modern North Korean men (165 cm). On the other hand, the average height of modern South Korean men is 172 cm, 6 cm more than what we tentatively estimate for pre-modern Korean men. Regression analysis of the height of pre-modern Korean men finds that un-free Koreans (slaves) were significantly shorter by about 0.6-0.7 cm than commoners, whereas the average height of recruits suffering from smallpox did not differ significantly from that of other recruits. Moreover, regional, as opposed to birth-dummy, variables account, and to a significant degree, for most of the differences in height. Whether or not this is a result of socioeconomic differences across provinces or a result of other regionally-varying factors remains an open question. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using original primary sources retrieved from annual administrative and statistical reports, it provides some of the first evidence in a historical setting on the causal relationship between poverty and crime. Extreme rainfall, both droughts and floods, lead to a large increase in property crimes (such as robbery, petty theft, and cattle raiding), but not to an increase in interpersonal violent crimes (such as murder, homicides, and assault). In line with a growing body of literature on the climateeconomy nexus, this study offers evidence that loss of agricultural income is one of the main causal channels leading to property crime. Additional historical information on food shortages, poverty, and crime is used to explore the connection in greater detail.","[Papaioannou, Kostadis J.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Rural & Environm Hist, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Papaioannou, KJ (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Rural & Environm Hist, Wageningen, Netherlands.",kostadis.papaioannou@wur.nl,,,,,,,59,10,12,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

They can find recreation in countless type of tourism, depending on they wish to spend their rest actively or passively. The growing demand of tourism infers the growing supply of tourism and diversity too. Parallel to this the needs of the people who want to relax increase. In case of a tourist destination it is more and more determinative how they can offer various types and quality of services for their guests how they can cooperate in the region in the area or in the same settlement with other service-units, who can even be their competitors. Morahalom in Hungary is a good example for that where the cooperation between the several service-units is exemplary. That is why I choose my research's topic: analyzing the Thermal Panzi6 in Morahalom. The accommodation service is an area where services are used by all age-group regardless of age and gender. Thus, the target group could include almost everybody. The purpose of my work is to examine the importance of the Thermal Panzio, on the other hand, to do the interrelation and relationship testing among the guests of the pension. The latter is done after the results of my quantitative research among the guests in the pension in 2013. My research focuses on three aims A1: To examine the coverage-, the requisition of the offered services-, the price-value ratio of the rooms-, and the family-friendly nature of the Thermal Panzi6 among the guests.

Quite the contrary: they would argue that ethnic Russians as the majority population find themselves under under siege from ethnic minorities. A case in point, they hold, is Stavropol Krai in the North Caucasus. In local ethno-nationalist circles this region is depicted as Russia's Kosovo, a glaring example of the Kremlin's betrayal of ethnic Russian interests. This article presents a case study of the under-researched regional dimension of Russian nationalism. The purpose is twofold: to map regional ethno-nationalist discourse and, drawing on survey data, to explore to what extent this discourse is reflected in general attitudes toward the influx of migrants and plans for own migration. We find that local ethno-nationalists have succeeded in mobilizing support at the national level, but that, despite increased ethnic tensions in Stavropol Krai, few Russians contemplate leaving.","[Blakkisrud, Helge] Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, Res Grp Russia Eurasia & Arctic, Oslo, Norway; [Kolsto, Pal] Univ Oslo, Dept Literature Area Studies & European Languages, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Blakkisrud, H (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, Res Grp Russia Eurasia & Arctic, Oslo, Norway.",hb@nupi.no,", Helge Blakkisrud/O-8311-2019; Kolstø, Pål/AAU-8491-2021",", Helge Blakkisrud/0000-0002-7363-5766; Kolsto, Pal/0000-0002-2745-4198",Research Council of Norway [220599],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway [grant number 220599].,,93,2,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The high level of rivalry in sports should lead to a feeling of pleasure at the suffering of another group (known in German as Schadenfreude) and we assume to see the satisfaction of investor fans with the defeat of the archrival. Likewise, the win of the archrival can have a negative impact on the mood of investors. This study shows that, when club supporters experience the negative performance of their team, the results of their archrival can affect their investment decisions. It is therefore proven that, at least in this respect, the investors (also widely represented by club supporters) are driven by the sentiments conveyed by rivalry which, considered to be a source of emotion, may be relevant to the market.","[Demir, Ender] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Unalan Mah Unalan Sok,D-100 Karayolu Yanyol, TR-34700 Istanbul, Turkey; [Rigoni, Ugo] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Corp Finance & Financial Inst, Venice, Italy",Istanbul Medeniyet University; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Demir, E (通讯作者)，Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Unalan Mah Unalan Sok,D-100 Karayolu Yanyol, TR-34700 Istanbul, Turkey.",ender.demir@medeniyet.edu.tr,"Rigoni, Ugo/JNE-0704-2023; Demir, Ender/J-8808-2017; Schulz, Lydia/HGB-8387-2022","Rigoni, Ugo/0000-0002-0892-4588; Demir, Ender/0000-0003-4034-269X;",,,,,42,14,18,3,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Since then the situation has not essentially changed for the better. The problem of building creative areas and the economy of creativity is of great significance for modern Russia. Today the developed postindustrial countries see the source of the maturity and stability of the society in the transition to the economy of creativity or as it is also called the creative economy where the main factor of production is the creative activity of the population capable of creating principally new products. The main goal of the transition is the building of the developed economy by creating an innovative environment, and the main instrument of achieving this goal is the building of creative towns with the creative industries as their basis. The elaboration of these topics starting with the American sociologist and futurologist Elvin Toffler has been the main focus of attention of scholars and practitioners across the world for nearly half a century. But so far there isn't a universal scenario of the transition from one type of the economy to another.

This paper, from the perspective of evolution economics for industrial convergence, will explore the mechanism of the coordinated development of cultural industry and propose some feasible suggestions based on the current fusion problems existing in the development of cultural industry in Liaoning province.","[Fan, Xiaonan; Lai, Qiligeri; Bao, Xiaona] Dalian Polytech Univ, Dalian, Peoples R China",Dalian Polytechnic University,"Fan, XN (通讯作者)，Dalian Polytech Univ, Dalian, Peoples R China.",1294596339@qq.com,,,"Liaoning provincial social science federation project [2016lsljdwtzdian-03]; Liaoning education department project [W2015053]; Education scientific research management, a think-tank project in Liaoning province department of education [ZK2015088]; Liaoning higher education institute 13th five-year plan subject [GHYB160102]; Dalian social science federation project [2016dlskyb112]","Liaoning provincial social science federation project; Liaoning education department project; Education scientific research management, a think-tank project in Liaoning province department of education; Liaoning higher education institute 13th five-year plan subject; Dalian social science federation project","This work has been partially funded by the Liaoning provincial social science federation project(project number 2016lsljdwtzdian-03),Liaoning education department project(W2015053),Education scientific research management, a think-tank project in Liaoning province department of education(ZK2015088),Liaoning higher education institute 13th five-year plan subject(GHYB160102),Dalian social science federation project(2016dlskyb112).",,13,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-423-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,33.0,,,,,,162,168,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6HQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426695800022,0

Specifically, our work offers, for the first time, a comprehensive account of Keynes's personal dealings in wheat futures in the market places of Winnipeg, Chicago and Liverpool in the years from 1925 to 1935. Our reconstruction of Keynes's trading activity benefits from archival research at King's College (Cambridge, uk) where the Keynes Papers are kept. Moreover, in order to form a full picture of the markets in which Keynes was operating we reconstructed the historical series of spot and future prices. The result marks an advance in thorough examination of Keynes's speculative style in a complex international environment, as was the wheat futures market in the interwar period. One of the main findings of the article is the fact that Keynes adopted a completely different strategy when operating on the North-American markets in the 1920s from the approach he followed trading on the Liverpool market in the 1930s. In the former case he tried to anticipate reversal in the price trend, aiming at 'beating the market' and acting prevalently as a short-term investor. In the latter, he followed a long-term roll-over strategy (that is, with renewal of long positions) more consistent with his own theoretical representation of the speculator as a << risk-bearer >> (Keynes 1923). Our reconstruction of Keynes's operations in the wheat futures markets constitute further confirmation of the view - shared in the literature (Chambers and Dimson 2013, Marcuzzo and Sanfilippo 2016) - that a change occurred in Keynes's speculative style (both in stocks and in commodities) around the beginning of the 1930s, when he abandoned a short-term type investment behaviour in favour of a long-term investor perspective.","[Foresti, Tiziana] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Appl Res Int Markets Banking Finance & Regula, Baffi Carefin, Milan, Italy; [Sanfilippo, Eleonora] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy",Bocconi University; University of Cassino,"Foresti, T (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Ctr Appl Res Int Markets Banking Finance & Regula, Baffi Carefin, Milan, Italy.;Sanfilippo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy.",tiziana.foresti@unibocconi.it; e.sanfilippo@unicas.it,,,,,,,40,7,7,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

It is founded in debates about neo-liberalism and financialisation which highlight the shift of power from, or through, the state to large corporations. One result of this structural shift is an increasingly integrated political, media and corporate culture which promotes the interests of the market' in public and private lives, and operates to limit the information available to audiences. Alternatives to economic policies and solutions to problems are marginalised in public debate, as illustrated by media coverage of the financial crisis. This limiting of alternatives is decisively implicated in the development of sympathetic attitudes to preferred' perspectives and related policy moves, which constrain the potential for effective resistance at the level of collective and individual responses.","[Happer, Catherine] Univ Glasgow, Dept Sociol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Happer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Dept Sociol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",Catherine.happer@glasgow.ac.uk,,,"UKERC; Glasgow City Council; project Financialization, Economy, Society and Sustainable Development (FESSUD) - European Union [266800]","UKERC; Glasgow City Council; project Financialization, Economy, Society and Sustainable Development (FESSUD) - European Union","The author received financial support from the UKERC and Glasgow City Council.

One reason was that formal-axiomatic theories allowed mathematical economists to improve the conceptual and theoretical foundations of economics and thereby to increase its scientific status. Furthermore, the separation between mathematical economics and other behavioral sciences was not as clear-cut as often argued. While economists did not modify their behavioral assumptions, some acknowledged the empirical shortcomings of their models.

The household structure meaning the size and other demographic and economic characteristics of household members should be always taken into account. Economies of scale are represented by the equivalence scale of consumption units. The current international consumption unit scale may not be appropriate as economies of scales might differ among countries. Therefore, the national scale should be estimated. Economies of scale of Czech households and subsequently consumption unit scales are analysed from more perspectives in the paper. An alternative approach to consumption unit scales applied in other countries is based on household expenditures. We have estimated the consumption unit scale within our previous research. Another method that uses utility function is applied in this paper and compared to the previous one. This utility function of households is indirectly measured using subjective data of financial satisfaction. The analysis is based on data from EU_SILC. Consumption units are estimated applying regression. At first the estimation of economies of scale based on expenditures and utility function are provided. Subsequently, the results of estimated consumption unit's scale are compared also with international scales.

The distribution of welfare effects depends critically on each port's productivity, China's economic geography as it influences trade costs, as well as the degree of regional diversity in production, which increases the potential gains from trade. We utilize this framework to quantify the size and distribution of welfare effects resulting from new technology and lower trade costs that emerged during the Treaty-Port Era. Our results suggest that the new trade with foreign countries led to significant changes in domestic trade relationships. There was a limit to how much could be gained through increased domestic trade, however, because differences in productivity across regions were relatively low.","[Keller, Wolfgang; Santiago, Javier Andres; Shiue, Carol H.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Keller, Wolfgang; Shiue, Carol H.] CEPR, London, England; [Keller, Wolfgang; Shiue, Carol H.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Keller, Wolfgang; Shiue, Carol H.] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; National Bureau of Economic Research; Ifo Institut,"Shiue, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",wolfgang.keller@colorado.edu; javier.andressantiago@colorado.edu; shiue@colorado.edu,"Keller, Wolfgang/AAI-9160-2020; Santiago, Javier Andrés/Y-9498-2019","Keller, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2834-6516; SHIUE, CAROL/0000-0003-1890-318X; Andres Santiago, Javier/0000-0001-5197-4866","National Science Foundation [SES 1124426]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1124426] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",support by the National Science Foundation (grant SES 1124426).,,41,12,13,2,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

After joining a car-sharing organization, people can use a shared-car. Because sharing a car involves other members, there is some inherent uncertainty that originates from the possible non-availability of the shared-car. This uncertainty may trigger people to apply decision-making mechanisms other than the maximization of expected utility. In addition, variable satisfaction with current mobility options may affect individuals' decisions differently. Such uncertainty and satisfaction associated with car sharing decisions have been largely ignored in previous studies. The present study is designed to examine the effects of latent satisfaction with current mobility options and uncertainty underlying car-sharing decisions. A random-regret minimization-based hybrid choice model is proposed to simultaneously estimate these effects. The model allows investigating car-sharing decisions in both risky and riskless choice contexts. The parameters are estimated based on stated choice data using a Bayesian D-efficient optimal design. The results show that satisfaction significantly affects the car-sharing decision, and that car availability has a significant effect on the likelihood of joining a car-sharing organization.

As research on excess commuting has shown, the spatial distribution of housing and jobs in many cities would theoretically allow much shorter commuting distances than are actually observed. The question this paper tackles is how a more efficient commuting pattern would affect the transport modes workers use to travel to work. If workers and jobs were rematched in such a way as to minimise average commute distance, how would such a change impact the way people travel to work? While one might easily imagine an increase in the share of trips covered by soft modes of transport, there are reasons to believe that in some cases there might also be unexpected outcomes such an increase in car use. So how would people travel to work in a city where there is no excess commuting? We looked for an answer to this question through empirical simulations in the case of the Paris Metropolitan Area.

In this study, schedule delays were used for measuring travel reliability. The trip scheduling model and binary logit model were used to estimate the value of travel time reliability. First, by considering the impacts of the income level and time constraint, the trip scheduling models were developed. Then, data for model calibration was collected through street-interview survey based on the stated preference (SP) approach. Finally, the model was calibrated using the collected data and the commuters' value of travel time reliability were estimated. On the basis of the model results, the influence of income level and time constraint on the value of travel time reliability was analyzed. The results revealed that the value of travel time reliability differed significantly for different income and time constraint levels, and transportation modes.

While the strategies adopted during the 2013 wave had a performative dimension, as they disrupted routines and created opportunities for social change, the 2014 practices are to be considered prefigurative, as they developed modes of interaction embodying a new model of citizenship at odds with the existing one based on the institutionalisation of ethno-national categories.","[Milan, Chiara] Scuola Normale Super, Inst Humanities & Social Sci, Piazza Strozzi 1, I-50123 Florence, Italy",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,"Milan, C (通讯作者)，Scuola Normale Super, Inst Humanities & Social Sci, Piazza Strozzi 1, I-50123 Florence, Italy.",chiara.milan@sns.it,"Milan, Chiara/AAD-6268-2019","Milan, Chiara/0000-0002-2604-3442",European University Institute,European University Institute,This work was supported by European University Institute.,,45,20,20,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2017,69.0,9,,,,,1346,1361,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1388358,0.0,,,16,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FP6VZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417765900002,0

Understanding the power structures behind global monetary orders, their distributional effects, as well as the systemic consequences associated with practices within domestic financial systems, particularly within financial centres, remains a priority. In a recent commentary, Cohen argues that the field is fragmented and that excessive attention to social scientific method is to blame. I agree with Cohen that the field of international political economy (IPE) of money is fragmented but I disagree that social scientific method is the cause. The fragmentation, and slow progress in the IPE of money, to which Cohen refers, is rather attributable to a lack of social scientific method, resulting in conceptual and empirical ambiguity, and unclear standards. Finally, I outline how social science methods could produce the kind of systemic analysis Cohen is calling for, 'macro-money theories', the flip side of the 'micro-money theories' embodied by open economy politics.","[Norrlof, Carla] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Norrlof, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",carla.norrlof@utoronto.ca,"Norrlof, Carla/V-5834-2019",,,,,,82,3,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In Britain, Mill's work set off a dialogue among mainstream economists. Contributors included Thornton, Fawcett, and Cairnes from Mill's school, as well as Jevons and Marshall who while sympathetic endorsed the less radical reform of profit sharing. Ironically, much of the socialist left, including Beatrice Potter (Webb), praised Mill's concerns, but rejected producer co-operatives in favour of nationalisation. By the early twentieth century, Mill's message resonated only with the guild socialists who kept the radical argument for producer co-operatives alive. The subtext of the paper is that modern liberals have too conveniently lost connection with this important history and its radical/liberal message of capitalism as a transitional mode.","[Persky, Joseph] Univ Illinois, 601 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Persky, J (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, 601 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",jpersky@uic.edu,,,,,,,46,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Third, there is a growing discussion about whether to abolish high denomination banknotes and limit the maximum value of cash transactions on the grounds that cash is often used in illicit activities. My belief is that money is more important than monetary policy. An optimum response differs both across countries and over time.

By this redefinition process, European Union (EU)'s external wall forming the boundaries with the neighbourhood countries have also begun to be rebuilt at local and regional level. Throughout this process, new frontier identities are formed with a degree of permeability where the state's security policies act as the prior issue in the international relations. Border permeability, that contains grey values varying from closeness to full openness, defines the degree of permeability according to the size, shape and direction of the flows. Dynamic feature of the flows converts border space into a subject of continuous social, economic and political movement. In such places, actors leading the flows appear as the basic elements of permeability and they can be described as economic, political and socio-cultural agents. At the edge of supranational and national border, actors use networks, which are connected to both local and regional levels, in order to build up cross-border cooperation in different aspects. In this context, border regions transform into a space, where local actors develop methods to overcome the restrictiveness of constraints for the flows among the supranational and the national borders. This paper aims to evaluate the permeability between EU supranational border and Turkish national border and to define the new cross-border cooperation formed by the social, economic and political flows of the actors. In this context, the permeability and the new border identity will be assessed through three type of administrative body (supranational, national EU and national non-EU) by using the national and local level data supported by EU cross-border programmes and by in-depth interviews conducted at various actors including national institutions, local organizations and NGOs in Turkey.","[Varol, Cigdem; Soylemez, Emrah] Gazi Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ankara, Turkey",Gazi University,"Varol, C; Söylemez, E (通讯作者)，Gazi Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ankara, Turkey.",cvarol@gazi.edu.tr,"Varol, Cigdem/O-7549-2018; Söylemez, Emrah/D-4512-2018","Söylemez, Emrah/0000-0003-4150-3184",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [SOBAG-114K887],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"Funding for this research was provided by Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), SOBAG-114K887.",,19,2,2,1,13,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,87,98,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.649,0.0,,,12,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200007,0

GJT is used to model rail demand in Britain and is composed of station-to-station journey time, service headway and a penalty for the need to change trains. We analyse a large data set of rail ticket sales data to explore three features of GJT. The first is to determine how GJT impacts on rail demand, including interactions with distance and value for money and exploring the effects of the size and sign of the change in GJT, distinguishing between short run and long run effects. The new evidence obtained was important given concerns over the elasticities previously recommended for use in the rail industry in Britain. Secondly, we provide evidence as to whether the weights associated with headway and interchange in GJT are appropriate. Our analysis indicates that more influence should be attached to interchange. Finally, the rail industry in Britain's approach of using GJT and fare is quite unique. We have tested how it compares with the more traditional approach of generalised cost and with the specification of separate elasticities to the component parts of GJT. This indicates that the GJT approach is preferable to the more conventional approach although there would seem to be value in further pursuing separate elasticities to the components of GJT.

Then, a regression analysis of China's marine transportation industry and its influencing factors is done by using EVIEWS software. It is found that the operation efficiency of China's marine transportation industry is good, but still needed to be improved. The investment in fixed assets of the coastal transportation industry and the container capacity of the wheel barge and its power have a positive effect on the operation efficiency of the marine transportation industry.

One of its main components is fiscal or budgetary policy. Traditionally, it is defined as the money required for setting revenue and expenditure policy that is needed to ensure the government operation, but the economic interpretation says it is the economy regulation system through taxes and government spending. It is emphasized that it is closely linked with the state's role in the redistribution of society profits, determining the state budget's proportion in the gross domestic product, defining objectives for the common tax burden, budgetary expenditure, allowable deficit, volume, and structure of the government debt. In addition, the concept of fiscal space correlating with application of the fiscal policy measures becomes topical. Thus, the government is able to influence income of both the society generally and certain groups of residents, their purchasing power and impact on economic development in general.

We make two contributions to the literature. First, we build a novel data set comprising 28 SSA countries for the period 2000-14 to uncover the main correlates of LCBM capitalisation, of local currency bond (LCB) tenors and of LCB issue yields. We find that LCBM capitalisation in SSA relates to politico-institutional factors, overall financial development and financial system structure. For LCB tenors and issue yields, inflation levels matter too. Second, we complement our econometric analysis with qualitative case studies of Kenya and Nigeria, where we further investigate the drivers of LCBM development and place LCBMs in a broader public debt context. While we document the increasing importance of LCBMs in SSA, we also highlight new vulnerabilities, including those related to investor base composition.","[Dafe, Florence] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Dafe, Florence; Volz, Ulrich] German Dev Inst DIE, Bonn, Germany; [Essers, Dennis] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy IOB, Antwerp, Belgium; [Volz, Ulrich] SOAS Univ London, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); University of Antwerp; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Dafe, F (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.;Dafe, F (通讯作者)，German Dev Inst DIE, Bonn, Germany.",,,"Dafe, Florence/0000-0001-7337-0027; Essers, Dennis/0000-0002-4572-8826; Volz, Ulrich/0000-0001-9917-8068",,,,,37,18,19,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2018,41.0,12,,,SI,,3317,3344,,10.1111/twec.12624,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HE7HH,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453601800004,0

Although the relationship between stock market returns and oil price changes has been scrutinized excessively in the literature, the possibility of predicting future stock market returns using oil prices has attracted less attention. This paper investigates the ability of oil prices to predict S&P 500 price index returns with the use of other macroeconomic and financial variables. Including all the potential variables in a forecasting model may result in an over-fitted model. So instead, dynamic model averaging (DMA) and dynamic model selection (DMS) are applied to utilize their ability of allowing the best forecasting model to change over time while parameters are also allowed to change. The empirical evidence shows that applying the DMA/DMS approach leads to significant improvements in forecasting performance in comparison to other forecasting methodologies and the performance of these models are better when oil prices are included within predictors.","[Naser, Hanan] Arab Open Univ, Fac Business Studies, Rd 3206, Aali, Bahrain; [Alaali, Fatema] Ahlia Univ, Dept Accounting & Econ, Exhibit Ave, Manama, Bahrain",Ahlia University Bahrain,"Naser, H (通讯作者)，Arab Open Univ, Fac Business Studies, Rd 3206, Aali, Bahrain.",hanan.naser@aou.org.bh,,"Naser, Hanan/0000-0002-9062-0603; Alaali, Fatema/0000-0002-5466-0149",,,,,53,11,11,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In many states, demand response transit (DRT) services are provided to meet such needs. However, state public agencies face the dilemma of whether to increase or decrease the service availability for on-call services. To enhance decision making of identifying what the causal factors related to DRT trips, the authors present a set of econometric models by integrating a sample DRT data with other explanatory variables such as land use, socio-economic, and demographic characteristics. Seven count data models including Poisson, Negative Binomial, Zero-inflated Poisson, Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB), Hurdle Poisson, Hurdle Negative Binomial, and ZINB Mixed Effect were developed to understand the factors that affect DRT trips. The ZINB Mixed Effect model that combines a zero-inflated negative binomial model with random effect was found to provide the best fit. A number of factors showed significant relationship with DRT trip frequency including distance, population density, elderly population, average income, and others. Further, the elasticity effects of these different factors were computed to quantify the magnitude of their impact on DRT. The proposed model can be helpful for transit agencies to predict the frequency of DRT trips and to provide adequate services in rural areas.","[Sultana, Zohora; Mishra, Sabyasachee; Golias, Mihalis M.] Univ Memphis, Dept Civil Engn, 3815 Cent Ave, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Cherry, Christopher R.; Jeffers, Saman Tabrizizadeh] Univ Tennessee, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Memphis; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Mishra, S (通讯作者)，Univ Memphis, Dept Civil Engn, 3815 Cent Ave, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",zsultan@memphis.edu; smishra3@memphis.edu; cherry@utk.edu; mgkolias@memphis.edu; stabrizi@vols.utk.edu,"Mishra, Sabyasachee/AAN-4236-2021; Cherry, Christopher/B-3270-2009","Mishra, Sabyasachee/0000-0002-7198-3548; Cherry, Christopher/0000-0002-8835-4617",TDOT,TDOT,"This research was funded by TDOT.

However, there is limited understanding of the driver acceptance of various types of in-vehicle HMIs and the impact of such systems on driving behaviour. Forty drivers participated in a simulated driving experiment to evaluate three variations of an eco-safe in-vehicle HMI: visual advice only; visual feedback only; or visual advice and feedback. To evaluate the impact of the different HMIs, subjective and objective measures were analysed, including fuel consumption, eco-safe driving behaviour, driver acceptance, and workload. Results indicate that all system types were associated with the relatively high levels of driver acceptance, with the advice only system accepted the most. While all system types produced relatively low levels of workload for drivers, systems involving feedback significantly increased the workload associated with using the interface. The findings suggest that the combined advice and feedback system has the potential to simultaneously reduce fuel consumption and improve eco-safe driving behaviour. Specifically, both advice and feedback appeared to be critical in encouraging positive changes in eco-safe driving behaviour. Our contribution can inform the design and development of future in-vehicle HMIs to improve eco-safe driving style that are accepted by drivers and have minimal adverse impacts on driver workload.","[Vaezipour, Atiyeh; Rakotonirainy, Andry; Haworth, Narelle] Queensland Univ Technol, Ctr Accid Res Rd Safety Queensland CARRS Q, 130 Victoria Pk Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Vaezipour, Atiyeh; Rakotonirainy, Andry; Haworth, Narelle] Queensland Univ Technol, IHBI, 60 Musk Ave, Kelvin Grove 4059, Australia; [Delhomme, Patricia] French Inst Sci & Technol Transportat, Dev & Networks IFSTTAR, Dept Planning Mobil & Environm, Mobil, 25 Allele Marronniers,CS 9058, Versailles, France",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Vaezipour, A (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Ctr Accid Res Rd Safety Queensland CARRS Q, 130 Victoria Pk Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia.;Vaezipour, A (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, RECOVER Injury Res Ctr, 288 Herston Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4006, Australia.",a.vaezipour@uq.edu.au; r.andry@qut.edu.au; n.haworth@qut.edu.au; patricia.delhomme@ifsttar.fr,"Vaezipour, Atiyeh/F-9652-2018; Haworth, Narelle/AAV-4845-2021; Vaezipour, Atiyeh/F-9661-2018; Rakotonirainy, Rakotonirainy/HJI-9729-2023","Vaezipour, Atiyeh/0000-0001-8110-1652; Haworth, Narelle/0000-0003-2514-787X; Vaezipour, Atiyeh/0000-0001-8110-1652; Rakotonirainy, Rakotonirainy/0000-0002-2144-4909; delhomme, patricia/0000-0002-0889-6177","Australian Research Council Discovery [DP140102895]; Queensland University of Technology, Australia","Australian Research Council Discovery(Australian Research Council); Queensland University of Technology, Australia","This research was supported by Australian Research Council Discovery (grant number DP140102895) and Queensland University of Technology, Australia.

Unlisted firms lack visible share prices, which heightens the sensitivity of investors to dividends paid during the offering. By paying high dividends early, managers of unlisted REITs positively influence the flow of new equity. Dividend manipulation occurs when discretionary yields are exceptionally high and predominantly favorable dividend changes occur during the equity offering, followed by a surge in unfavorable changes after the offering. Evidence of dividend manipulation at unlisted REITs is provided where even discretionary yields are significantly reduced once the offering expires.","[Wiley, Jonathan A.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Real Estate, Room 1408,POB 3989, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Wiley, JA (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Real Estate, Room 1408,POB 3989, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",jwiley@gsu.edu,,,,,,,42,4,4,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2018,46.0,4,,,,,887,935,,10.1111/1540-6229.12193,0.0,,,49,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,HA1BQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449946800004,0

Relying on his argument that the division of labour is limited by the extent of the market, Smith insisted that a treaty of commerce with France would be more beneficial, and supported Eden's Treaty (1786). Smith also rejected the argument of Cantillon and mercantilists that the exchange of English cloth for Portuguese wine benefitted Britain by bringing in gold and silver, arguing that an excess demand for precious metals in Britain would by itself cause an inflow of gold and silver. Smith's critique of the Methuen Treaty and his posing of the question of which commercial treaties would be trade-creating rather than trade-diverting have been largely overlooked.","[Dimand, Robert W.] Brock Univ, Dept Econ, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",Brock University,"Dimand, RW (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Dept Econ, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",rdimand@brocku.ca,,,,,,,64,1,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Using a new dataset on tax revenues for 130 countries between 1792 and 2006, we identify ninety-nine episodes of trade liberalization defined as a large fall in trade tax revenues not accompanied by a decrease in trade. Seven took place before World War One, seven in the interwar period, eighteen in the Bretton Woods period and the remainder after 1970. We examine the extent to which countries were able to recover the tax revenues lost by liberalizing trade by using other sources of revenue. We find that historical (pre-1970) trade liberalization episodes were unlikely to be accompanied by decreases in tax revenues, especially during the Bretton Woods era. In the recent period however, over 40% of the developing countries in our sample experience a fall in total tax revenues that lasts more than ten years after an episode of trade liberalization. Overall, trade liberalization led to larger and longer-lived declines in tax revenues in developing countries since 1970 than in today's rich countries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Results are similar when we consider government expenditures, suggesting decreases in trade tax revenues negatively affect governments' capacity to provide public services in many developing countries.","[Cage, Julia] Sci Po Paris, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France; [Cage, Julia; Gadenne, Lucie] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Gadenne, Lucie] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Warwick,"Cagé, J (通讯作者)，Sci Po Paris, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.;Cagé, J (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",julia.cage@sciencespo.fr; l.gadenne@warwick.ac.uk,"Cagé, Julia/AAA-1522-2019","Cagé, Julia/0000-0001-7085-5774",ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,93,55,57,1,14,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

While it is apparent that different types of cyclists have varying preferences for the facilities on which they ride, in current research and practice, measures are used that are either insufficiently quantitative and empirical or lack cyclist segmentation. In this study, we conducted a detailed survey on cyclist habits, preferences, and user experience, capturing responses to videos of a bicycle traveling on road segments in the San Francisco Bay Area. The survey provided rich behavioral data, which invited both quantitative and qualitative exploration. We compared facility preferences from the survey to scores from two common measures, NCHRP bicycle level of service (NCHRP BLOS), and level of traffic stress (LTS); and we examined the responses to open-ended questions to gain insights about heterogeneity of preferences among cyclists. Finally, we applied behavioral analysis tools as a proof of concept for a new bicycle level of service measure that accounts for the segmentation of cyclist types via a latent class choice model. Combining statistics and behavioral analysis, we can improve the quality of bicycle level of service measures to make decisions driven by empirically measured cyclist preferences.","[Griswold, Julia B.; Grembek, Offer] Univ Calif Berkeley, Safe Transportat Res & Educ Ctr, 2614 Dwight Way, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yu, Mengqiao] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Filingeri, Victoria] Univ Derby Online Learning, Enterprise Ctr, Bridge St, Derby DE1 3LD, England; [Walker, Joan L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 111 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Griswold, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Safe Transportat Res & Educ Ctr, 2614 Dwight Way, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",juliagris@berkeley.edu; mengqiao.yu@berkeley.edu; v.filingeri@derby.ac.uk; grembek@berkeley.edu; joanwalker@berkeley.edu,,"Griswold, Julia/0000-0002-1125-3316; Grembek, Offer/0000-0003-1869-9457",University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation,University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation,"This research was funded by a grant from the University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation.

We show that such mutations can result from rational behavior when the dictator's flow use of repression is complementary to his stock of wrongdoings: past wrongdoings then perpetuate further wrongdoings and the dictator can unintentionally get trapped in a repressive steady state where he himself suffers from ex-post regret. This then begs the question why such a dictator would ever choose to do wrong in the first place. We show that this can be explained from the dictator's uncertainty over his degree of impunity in relation to wrongdoing, which induces him to experiment along this dimension. This produces a setting where any individual rising to power can end up as either a moderate leader, or as a dreaded tyrant. Since derailment is accidental and accompanied by ex-post regret, increasing accountability can be in the interest of both the public and the dictator.","[Larcom, Shaun] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Sarr, Mare] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Willems, Tim] OxCarre, Oxford, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cape Town; University of Oxford,"Sarr, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Rondebosch, South Africa.",stl25@cam.ac.uk; mare.sarr@uct.ac.za; timwillems85@gmail.com,,"Willems, Tim/0000-0002-1100-5312; Sarr, Mare/0000-0002-5903-7102",,,,,62,1,1,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Along the business cycle, the economy follows a Minsky base cycle with firms traversing through the various stages of financial fragility, i.e. hedge, speculative and Ponzi finance (cf., Minsky in The financial instability hypothesis: a restatement. Hyman P Minsky archive paper, vol 180, pp 541-552, 1978; Stabilizing an unstable economy. Yale University Press, 2nd edn 2008, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1986; The financial instability hypothesis. Economics working paper archive wp74. The Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, 1992). In the speculative financial stage cash flows are insufficient to finance the repayment of principle but sufficient for paying interest, so banks are willing to roll-over credits in order to prevent loan defaults. In the Ponzi financial position even interest payments cannot be served, but banks my still be willing to keep firms alive through extend and pretend loans, also known as zombie-lending (Caballero et al. in Am Econ Rev 98(5):1943-1977, 2008). This lending behavior may cause credit bubbles with increasing leverage ratios. Empirical evidence suggests that recessions following such leveraging booms are more severe and can be associated to higher economic costs (Jorda et al. in J Money Credit Bank 45(s2):3-28, 2013; Schularick and Taylor in Am Econ Rev 102(2):1029-1061, 2012). We study macroprudential regulations aimed at: (i) the prevention and mitigation of credit bubbles, (ii) ensuring macro-financial stability, and (iii) limiting the ability of banks to create unsustainable debt bubbles. Our results show that limiting the credit growth by using a non-risk-weighted capital ratio has slightly positive effects, while using loan eligibility criteria such as cutting off funding to all financially unsound firms (speculative and Ponzi) has strong positive effects.","[van der Hoog, Sander] Bielefeld Univ, Deptartment Business Adm & Econ, Chair Econ Theory & Computat Econ ETACE, Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld,"van der Hoog, S (通讯作者)，Bielefeld Univ, Deptartment Business Adm & Econ, Chair Econ Theory & Computat Econ ETACE, Bielefeld, Germany.",svdhoog@gmail.com,,"van der Hoog, Sander/0000-0002-2348-3194",Horizon 2020 Grant [649186],Horizon 2020 Grant(Horizon 2020),"This research has received funding under Horizon 2020 Grant Agreement No. 649186 - Project ISIGrowth (Innovation-fuelled, Sustainable, Inclusive Growth).",,85,7,7,3,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Although existing literature has shown that externally managed REITs have underperformed their internally managed counterparts, the Asian REITs market has a strong preference for the external management model. This paper investigates the factors that drive REITs to internalize or deter them from internalizing their manager by studying the characteristics of 26 internalization subjects in Australia at their point of internalization.

We use two unique datasets collected in Italy from 2000 to 2010. Using the first dataset-insurance contracts for hospitals-we estimate the average treatment effect of schedules on insurers and premiums paid, conditional on judicial efficiency and proxied by different measures. Our identification rests on the partial overlap between healthcare districts and judicial districts, meaning that the caseload of a court and malpractice events at the healthcare provider level are not perfectly correlated. On average, the adoption of schedules does not produce any significant effect on insurers or on premiums paid. However, adopting schedules has a robust and significant effect on the number of insurers, but only in inefficient courts. We further investigate these findings using a second dataset comprising 17,578 malpractice insurance claims. We find evidence of a composition effect among claims that is triggered by higher levels of judicial inefficiency: As a court's inefficiency increases, the likelihood for a case to not be decided on the merits decreases and the levels of reserve and recovery per claim decrease.","[Bertoli, Paola] Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bertoli, Paola] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Grembi, Veronica] Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria,"Grembi, V (通讯作者)，Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.",paola.bertoli@vse.cz; veronica.grembi@unirc.it,"Bertoli, Paola/AAG-1751-2019","Bertoli, Paola/0000-0001-8818-4243; Grembi, Veronica/0000-0002-5405-320X",[IG505045],,"We thank Tom Baker, Rosa Ferrer, Tommaso Nannicini, Neil Rickman, Matteo Rizzolli, the participants of the 2012 Italian Health Economics Association Meeting, the 2012 Italian Association of Law and Economics Meeting, the 2013 workshop The Future of Law and Economics (Rotterdam), ISNIE 2013, the 15th Joint Seminar of EALE and The Geneva Association, the Eighth Conference of Empirical Legal Studies, and the seminars at Bocconi University, Catholic University of Milan, Free University of Bozen, Copenhagen Business School, University of Prague, Universita' di Cagliari, and Norwegian School of Economics, two anonymous referees, an associate editor, and the editor Robert M.

We find evidence of a strong intergenerational transmission through passive smoking and that this is around four times larger for mothers compared to fathers. Moreover, we estimate an intention to treat difference-in-differences (DiD) model using parental cotinine as a continuous measure of exposure to the treatment and we find that the level of transmission of cotinine from parents was reduced to 51 per cent of the previous level just after the spread in the use of e-cigarettes in England and to 77 per cent when considering transmission from mothers. This is confirmed also by a DiD model which considers interaction between cotinine levels and self-reported use of NDP by parents and suggests that lower taxation of these devices may be justified on externality grounds.

Unlike previous literature where game-theoretic structures are imposed on cost pass-through, our framework allows for estimating cost pass-through and the degree of market competition simultaneously. Further, our model incorporates potential cross-brand effects representing demand substitution and strategic complementarity effects. Our model supplements the traditional reduced-form approach to pass-through and is applicable in environments, where the lack of brand-level cost data renders reduced-form analysis infeasible. The empirical value of our model is illustrated in an econometric analysis of retail pass-through for national and store brand yogurt. Our results indicate that: (1) market competition has a positive impact on own-brand cost pass-through, especially for national brands, and (2) overlooking cross-brand effects results in biased own-brand pass-through estimates. Finally, we provide a graphical illustration of the relationship between cost pass-through and market competition.","[Hovhannisyan, Vardges] Univ Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Hovhannisyan, V (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",vhovhann@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

For example, anorexia nervosa involves the over-perception of weight and raises the risk of cardiovascular disease. Do the health consequences of inaccurate self-perceived weight carry through to the labor market? We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) to investigate patterns in weight misperception and three labor market outcomes.

Hagedorn and Manovskii (Am Econ Rev 98(4):1692-1706, 2008) demonstrate that recalibrating the standard DMP model to be consistent with the small vacancy posting cost and wage elasticity observed in the data can resolve the Shimer puzzle. They close by stating that their calibration strategy would also resolve the Shimer puzzle in the real business cycle (RBC) search framework. In this paper, we examine their claim and find that their strategy resolves the Shimer puzzle in the RBC search model for linear preferences (with risk neutrality and infinite Frisch elasticity of labor supply), but falls significantly short for more standard assumptions on the degree of relative risk aversion (of 1-2) and Frisch elasticity (of 2-3), in line with empirical estimates. While our conclusions are based on highly accurate solutions using the Generalized Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, we also assess the accuracy of a frequently used linearization method and its implications for the assessment of labor market volatility.","[Atolia, Manoj; Marquis, Milton] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Atolia, Manoj] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Gibson, John] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; International Monetary Fund; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Gibson, J (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",matolia@fsu.edu; jgibson25@gsu.edu; mmarquis@fsu.edu,"Atolia, Manoj/AAJ-7691-2020",,,,,,29,5,5,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

While prior studies have shown that relative income effects matter for optimal income taxation, most assumed either homogeneous relative income effects for the entire population, or relative income effects that differ only on the basis of whether one is above or below their comparison group. We investigate the importance of relative income effects within the context of an optimal income tax model with a broader form of heterogeneity. Specifically, we assume income-dependent relative income effects, which follow in the spirit of empirical evidence. Simulation results show that the optimal tax system becomes more progressive to the extent that the relatively wealthy have stronger concerns regarding others' income than the relatively poor. This is an important result because it may provide theoretical evidence that increasing progressivity can be efficiency-enhancing.","[Bruce, Donald] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Boyd Ctr Business & Econ Res, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Peng, Langchuan] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Nanjing Audit University,"Peng, LC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dbruce@utk.edu; langchuan_peng@126.com,,"Peng, Langchuan/0000-0001-9253-2378",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603273],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank Celeste Carruthers, Matthew Harris, Jacob LaRiviere, LeAnn Luna, Matthew Murray, William Neilson, Casey Rothschild, Rudy Santore, Adrienne Sudbury, Christian Vossler, Marianne Wanamaker, participants in the University of Tennessee Economics Brown Bag Workshop and the 2014 National Tax Association Annual Conference on Taxation, the associate editor and two anonymous referees for valuable suggestions.

To explore ethnicity and business ownership, this study merges restricted-access data from 11 million businesses. Multinomial logistic regression estimates how characteristics associate with the probability of the business being Latino-owned relative to White-owned, Black-owned, or Asian-owned. There are differences in the source and amount of start-up funds, gender, and the sector of the business. The differences depend on the group to which Latinos are being compared; for example, manufacturing firms are less likely to be Latino owned than White owned, but more likely to be Latino owned than Black owned. An exception is college education and rurality; Latino owners are consistently less likely to be college educated and more likely to locate in rural areas than the other ethnic minorities. The results should be helpful to groups attempting to improve Latino business outcomes.","[Carpenter, Craig Wesley] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Community Econ & Business Dev, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Loveridge, Scott] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Michigan State University,"Carpenter, CW (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 600 John Kimbrough Blvd, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",ccarpenter@tamu.edu,"Carpenter, Craig/K-9369-2019; Molina, Nicholle/AAA-7370-2022","Carpenter, Craig/0000-0001-7511-1168;","USDA; Department of Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics at Michigan State University; Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research; TXRDC Consortium","USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Department of Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics at Michigan State University; Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research; TXRDC Consortium","Thanks to Anil Rupasingha, Myriam Quispe-Agnoli, Julie L.

The intensification of gendered divisions of paid and unpaid work after the birth of a child create unequal constraints and expectations such that, all else equal, mothers earn less than childless women, but fathers earn a wage premium. The fatherhood wage premium, however, varies substantially among men. Analyses of linked workplace-employee data from Canada reveal how organizational context conditions educational, occupational and family-status variation in fatherhood premiums. More formal employment relations (collective bargaining and human resource departments) reduce both overall fatherhood premiums and group differences in them, while performance pay systems (merit and incentive pay) have mixed effects. Shifting entrenched gendered divisions of household labour is thus not the only pathway to minimizing fathers' wage advantage.","[Fuller, Sylvia] Univ British Columbia, Sociol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Cooke, Lynn Prince] Univ Bath, Social Policy, Bath, Avon, England",University of British Columbia; University of Bath,"Fuller, S (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, 6303 NW Marine Dr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",sylvia.fuller@ubc.ca,,"Cooke, Lynn Prince/0000-0001-9307-9501",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [430-2014-00140]; European Research Council (ERC) under European Union [680958]; European Research Council (ERC) [680958] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); European Research Council (ERC) under European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Research was supported by Sylvia Fuller's funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC, grant no. 430-2014-00140).

Through examination of the experiences of trailing wives, it highlights the interconnected roles of state regulation, industry practice and destination communities in the gendering of transnational labour migration. Specifically, we attend to the experiences of trailing wives accompanying partners who migrated to Boddington in rural Western Australia to take up skilled work in the nearby gold mine, and incorporate (inter) related perspectives of local community members, in particular the provision of substantive migrant support by a key local figure. This research extends the labour migration literature in two ways. First, it develops understandings of how transnational labour migration fortifies gendered divisions of reproductive labour and, importantly, can encompass unpaid reproductive labour in local communities. Second, this article foregrounds the ways in which complex configurations of unpaid and paid reproductive labour - in households, community spaces and work-camp - underwrite economic globalization.","[Mayes, Robyn] Queensland Univ Technol, Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Koshy, Paul] Curtin Univ, Natl Ctr Student Equ Higher Educ, Perth, WA, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Curtin University,"Mayes, R (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Business Sch, Sch Management, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",robyn.mayes@qut.edu.au,,"Mayes, Robyn/0000-0002-8661-3638",,,,,44,6,6,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The rationale of sustainability usually rests on what renewable social, economic and cultural benefits the festival offers the community. However, changing visitor characteristics and economic difficulties putting more strain on the disposable income of households compel organizers and marketers to rethink their strategy in order to ensure the sustainability of festivals. This novel and exploratory study utilized a multistage DEA model to identify the presence of tendencies to overspend and budget mismanagement exhibited by visitors at the Innibos National Arts Festival. By identifying the sources of these inefficiencies, this study was able to formulate a framework that can guide organizers and marketers to develop price discounts or package combos that will ensure greater satisfaction which is a vital contributor to sustainability. The results accentuated the need to tailor these package combos to both male and female attendees, with the emphasis on improving satisfaction by limiting the tendencies to overspend that relate to paying for entrance fees, food and drinks.","[van Heerden, Chris; Saayman, Melville] North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Saayman, M (通讯作者)，North West Univ, TREES, Private Bag X6001, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",Melville.saayman@nwu.ac.za,"Van Heerden, Chris/ABF-5250-2020","Van Heerden, Chris/0000-0001-8074-0719",,,,,81,12,13,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The nonlinear relationship is originated by two forces within a Schumpeterian economy: On the one hand, as the number of public holidays grows, the total number of workers searching for innovation increases; on the other hand, as the number of days of recreation increases, the number of working days producing innovations decreases. The combination of these two forces generates the inverted u-shaped relationship. The hypothesized mechanism suggests the existence of an optimal number of public holidays for an economy.","[Barrera, Franco] Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Santiago, Chile; [Garrido, Nicolas] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile",INACAP; University Diego Portales,"Garrido, N (通讯作者)，Univ Diego Portales, Dept Econ, Vergara 210, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.",nicolas.garrido@udp.cl,"Garrido, Nicolás/AAM-6458-2021","Garrido, Nicolás/0000-0002-7304-3592",,,,,34,4,5,3,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

But very little is known about the heterogeneous impacts of innovation on exports. Since innovation is not a costless activity, it is relevant to know the specific situations in which a firm most likely needs to innovate to raise its exports. Using data from Chile, we combine information on innovation activities at the firm level with a rich dataset on exports at the transaction level. We find that the firms that engage in innovation tend to export more than other firms because they are able to sell goods and target markets that reward innovation. We show that the goods and markets in which innovative exporters outperform non-innovative exporters are those where innovation can lead to substantial differences in terms of quality. Innovative firms do not have an edge in exporting goods and in targeting markets that do not reward innovation. In particular, innovative firms do not outperform non-innovative firms when exporting goods and penetrating markets in which differentiation in terms of quality is not possible or not relevant.","[Blyde, Juan; Mussini, Micaela] Inter Amer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20755 USA; [Iberti, Gonzalo] Chilean Minist Finance, Santiago, Chile",Inter-American Development Bank,"Blyde, J (通讯作者)，Inter Amer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20755 USA.",juanbl@iadb.org,,,,,,,28,12,12,4,28,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Estimations are based on monthly market prices of four agricultural commodities (maize, groundnuts, rice, and beans) in 27 local markets for the period 1998-2006. Market pairs connected by rail when the railway line was operational are intervention observations. Railway transport services explain a 14 to 17 percent reduction in price dispersion across markets. Geographical reach of trade varies by crop, most likely related to storability and geographical spread of production. Perishability appears to increase impact, reflecting limited scope for arbitrage. Overall, impacts are remarkably similar in size across commodities.","[Zant, Wouter] Vrije Univ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Zant, Wouter] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Zant, W (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Zant, W (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",wouter.zant@vu.nl,"Zant, W./AAW-8475-2021","Zant, W./0000-0002-0453-5403",,,,,36,10,10,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

This paper proposes a new parametric approach to estimate the aggregate spatial effect of multiple heterogeneous sites while providing fruitful interpretations of the effect of each of these sites. While the proposed method is developed based on a traditional accessibility measure, the way in which it addresses the role of the proximity order of sites in the spatial analysis is novel. The method is applied empirically using rental housing data in Tokyo, Japan to examine how the clustering of train and subway stations influences the rental prices in their vicinity. The results reveal a discounting impact of the order of each station's proximity, even after controlling for the effect of distance. In addition, the results reveal that using a traditional accessibility measure without considering the proximity order leads to serious estimation biases. The proposed methodology is applicable to various spatial topics, such as transportation, neighborhood externalities and polycentric urban structures.","[Sadayuki, Taisuke] Waseda Univ, Res Inst Environm Econ & Management, Shinjuku Ku, Nishiwaseda 1-6-1, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Sadayuki, Taisuke] Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, 607 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Waseda University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Sadayuki, T (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Res Inst Environm Econ & Management, Shinjuku Ku, Nishiwaseda 1-6-1, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.;Sadayuki, T (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, 607 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",tai.sadayuki@gmail.com,,"Sadayuki, Taisuke/0000-0003-4733-1299","CSIS, University of Tokyo [470]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP17H07181]","CSIS, University of Tokyo; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This paper is a revised version of a chapter in the author's doctoral dissertation.

Despite the evidence on the advantages of hybrid discrete choice models, most literature on parking choice only involves observable factors while leaving aside issues related to the latent variables. The behavioral hypothesis is that parking choice process depends not only on a set of observable factors but also has to do with individual specific latent attributes. A hybrid discrete choice model with interactions among attitudes and observable factors, as well as among socioeconomic characteristics and observable factors, was estimated in order to consider individual heterogeneity. The results showed that, in addition to parking fee, search time and access time, a Risk-averse attitude and a Positive car care (maintenance) attitude are determinants for parking choice. The inclusion of these latent attributes and their interactions also resulted in a large improvement in the goodness-of-fit of the model and affected the time valuations.","[Soto, Jose J.] Univ Tecnol Bolivar, Fac Engn, Parque Ind & Tecnol Carlos Velez Pombo Km 1 Via T, Cartagena, Colombia; [Marquez, Luis] Univ Pedag & Tecnol Colombia, Sch Transportat & Highways Engn, Ave Cent Norte 39-115, Tunja, Colombia; [Macea, Luis F.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana Cali, Dept Civil & Ind Engn, Calle 18 118-250, Cali, Colombia",Universidad Tecnologica de Bolivar; Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia (UPTC); Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,"Marquez, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pedag & Tecnol Colombia, Sch Transportat & Highways Engn, Ave Cent Norte 39-115, Tunja, Colombia.",jsoto@utb.edu.co; luis.marquez@uptc.edu.co; luis.macea@javerianacali.edu.co,"Márquez, Luis/ISV-1348-2023; Marquez, Luis/L-4522-2013","Soto Martinez, Jose/0000-0001-5335-2315; Marquez, Luis/0000-0002-5052-1694",,,,,48,41,42,5,62,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This hierarchy of institutions has been observed in macroeconomic policy, where it has long been understood that there are political incentives for economic mismanagement, namely the creation of inflation. But are there longer-term effects of currency manipulation on the rule of law in a country? That is, does the hierarchy not always hold? This paper answers this question by focusing on a specific case of monetary instability, the newly-independent Second Polish Republic of 1918 to 1939. Using appropriate econometric techniques on a new database of historical data, I find that monetary profligacy correlates strongly with significantly lower levels of the rule of law. This result is robust to several tests and most specifications, including the use of a new variable for measuring access to the political system. The results suggest that monetary instability is a threat to political institutions in its own right, eroding the rule of law in addition to creating macroeconomic difficulties. (C) 2018 The Author.

As the outcome variable, I use data on grant receipts for highly visible investment projects for which mayors must apply to the state government. Elected mayors attract 7% to 7.4% more grants in election years; for appointed mayors, there is no cycle. Using hand-collected data on mayor characteristics, I find suggestive evidence that although the selection of mayors changes following the reform studied, a likely reason for the observed cycle is that elected mayors have stronger electoral incentives.","[Hessami, Zohal] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Hessami, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany.",,,"Hessami, Zohal/0000-0002-0669-6913",,,,,46,26,33,0,4,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This time-to-build feature can lead to an autonomous system of mixed-type functional differential equations (FDEs), causing aggregate fluctuations for a deterministic economy. We present a continuation method to solve a system of mixed FDEs by solving a sequence of boundary value problems for systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Unlike other iteration techniques, this method can avoid the need to predetermine both forward-looking and backward-looking difference terms. The strategy is to form a homotopy that can deform a simpler ODE system into a target FDE system, while treating the deformation process as a sequence of ODEs. We can thereby compute oscillatory cycles for a time-to-build economy while it is in transition to the steady state.","[Lin, Hwan C.] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Econ, Belk Coll Business, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Lin, HC (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Econ, Belk Coll Business, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",hwlin@uncc.edu,,"Lin, Hwan C./0000-0002-9983-8078",,,,,20,2,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Through analysis of policy documentation, interviews and non-participant observation material, the article demonstrates how the Commission has operated as a key driver and agenda-setter in the field, exposing the inter-institutional dynamics in a competence in which the EU has a supporting role.

We analyze the concentration of household savings in Germany by estimating saving amounts, saving rates and shares in aggregate savings across income and wealth groups. Our calculations are based on the Sample Survey of Household Income and Expenditure (EVS), containing more than 40,000 households in Germany. We show that the concentration of savings is substantial: while the top income decile's share in total savings reaches 60 percent, the lower half of the income distribution on average does not save at all. Across wealth groups the concentration of savings is somewhat less pronounced. We also look beyond the top income threshold underlying the EVS (18,000 euros of monthly net household income) and demonstrate that corrected saving rates for the top income groups are considerably higher than those derived from the EVS alone. Hence, the top income groups' shares in aggregate savings exceed estimated shares solely based on EVS data, revealing a substantially more pronounced concentration of savings along the income distribution.","[Spath, Jochen; Schmid, Kai Daniel] Inst Appl Econ Res, Ob Himmelreich 1, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Späth, J (通讯作者)，Inst Appl Econ Res, Ob Himmelreich 1, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",jochen.spaeth@iaw.edu; kdschmid@googlemail.com,,,Hans Bockler Foundation,Hans Bockler Foundation,"This paper is an outcome of the research project Bedingte Haushaltsersparnis in Deutschland - zentraler Baustein einer endogenen Akkumulationsdynamik funded by the Hans Bockler Foundation.

It argues that the hierarchical and asymmetric architecture of the international monetary system imposes a survival constraint' upon non-center countries that obliges them to generate net inflows of the international center currency to finance their payment commitments. It outlines why management of this constraint has historically been associated with a development approach that prioritizes exports and investment over domestic consumption and illustrates how this development approach creates economic structure subject to path dependence and network effects, which perpetuates the role of non-center countries as users of the international currency and the role of the center country as supplier of the international currency. On this basis, it is argued that currency internationalization cannot be pursued in isolation from broader economic policy, but rather requires economic structural change, political mediation and accommodative balance of payments management. Specifically, raising the international profile of the Chinese renminbi would require rebalancing of the Chinese economy towards domestic demand, whereas the status of the US dollar is intimately intertwined with the international openness of the US economy.","[Angrick, Stefan] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Publ Policy Program, Tokyo, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Angrick, S (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Publ Policy Program, Tokyo, Japan.",contact@stefanangrick.net,,,Japanese Monbukagakusho scholarship,Japanese Monbukagakusho scholarship,The financial support of the Japanese Monbukagakusho scholarship is gratefully acknowledged.,,102,7,8,4,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Vets play an important role in a wide variety of social contexts, including in 'nontherapeutic' roles, for example in facilitating the use of animals in sport or for food production. This paper focuses on a further non-therapeutic example, namely the role of the vet in laboratory animal research. The research arena itself is characterised by ethical tensions and polarised opinion regarding the significance of, and justification for, using animals in harmful research for the primary benefit of humans. The aim of this paper is to explore some of the ethical questions raised by the position of the veterinary surgeon in the lab, focusing on the UK example. First, we outline the legislative responsibilities for the Named Veterinary Surgeon (NVS) under the Animals Scientific Procedures Act (ASPA) 1986, and compare this with the professional guidance for UK vets in all settings (RCVS Code of Conduct), making the argument that the NVS responsibilities to a scientific establishment under ASPA should be viewed as additional to the multiple responsibilities which are faced by all veterinary surgeons. A critical review of published and grey literature is then used to highlight how poorly the nature of this role is understood. In line with recent calls for improved sociological understanding of the veterinary profession, particularly in the case of potentially harmful veterinary interventions, we raise the need for careful empirical work which is focused on this complex professional role, and identify three preliminary research themes: The embodiment of professional expertise; the relocation of veterinary procedures; and reframing the veterinary 'patient. Finally, we conclude more broadly that the current articulation of a veterinarian's role may not fit well with some aspects of the varied non-therapeutic work which is undertaken by the profession.","[Ashall, V; Hobson-West, P.] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Appl Bioeth, Sch Vet Med & Sci, Bonington Campus, Sutton LE12 5RD, Surrey, England",University of Nottingham,"Ashall, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Ctr Appl Bioeth, Sch Vet Med & Sci, Bonington Campus, Sutton LE12 5RD, Surrey, England.",vanessa.ashall@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,2,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,291,295,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_45,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000045,0

This paper shows how some of its key ideas may be found in contributions by Cambridge economists D. H. Robertson and D. G. Champernowne advanced in the 193os and before as critical responses to J. M. Keynes's General Theory. Robertson and Champernowne devised the concepts of normal and basic unemployment rates respectively, expressed as equilibrium positions when workers' real wage expectations arc satisfied. Robertson combined that with his previous discussion of monetary misperceptions, whereas Champernowne argued how equilibrium might be achieved through inflation/deflation acceleration. Unemployment homes in on its natural equilibrium level only if the market rate of interest converges to its (Widuellian) natural rate, as Robertson stressed.","[Boianovsky, Mauro] Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Boianovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",mboianovsky@gmail.com,,,CNPq,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"I would like to thank Edward Nelson, David Laidler, Charles Goodhart, Sylvie Rivot, James Forder and (other) participants at the History of Economics Society conference (Chicago, June 2018) for their helpful comments.

Competitiveness as part of sustainability cornerstone is also examined in this paper in the context of specificities of Latvian banks. The aim of the research is to describe main aspects that relate to banking sustainability in the context of the Latvian banking sector which is characterized by considerable market participant density and variability of business models, thus making competitiveness a significant contributing factor. The analysis presented in the paper employs both qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative part focuses on the content analysis that was carried out by means of a literature review, market analysis and examination of relevant documentation (i.e. banking prudential regulation), but quantitative part focuses on the analysis of the statistical data and respective calculations. Various aspects that relate to sustainability of banks are shown through selected factors, which are deemed to be significant in the context of Latvian banks. The research outlines the main aspects that describe bank sustainability in the tailored view of Latvian banks. One of the main innovations of this paper is the analyses of dual business models that comprise the Latvian banking sector - one emphasizing servicing local, the other - foreign customers. The second business model is currently in flux, transforming into different composition due to extensive regulatory interventions and measures to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing and to enhance the effectiveness of internal control systems. These changes are anticipated to only strengthen the importance of competitiveness as one of the cornerstones for sustainability in Latvian banking sector given the density of market participants, their market shares and client bases. Main aspects that relate to sustainability of a bank are recognized from extensive information analyses, but competitiveness needs to be analysed as an additional aspect in the context of Latvian banking sector. The overview of available information allows concluding that sustainability can be also analysed using frameworks different from the widely employed green resource allocation method.","[Bojare, Kristina] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Bojare, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,67,78,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500006,0

Spatial agglomerations increase factor productivity, and therefore rents paid and wages earned. Larger agglomerations imply higher rents and wages, justifying the clustering of health professionals in large cities and medical centers. We show for 372 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (2013) that health professionals' wages increase significantly with increased total employment, but fall as the proportion of the total labor force comprised by the sectors within the regional economy increases. Rents respond similarly, although with smaller elasticities. The wage-rental ratio (W/R) decreases with total regional employment, but increases with jobs per thousand in the health sector. Exogenous factors like heating and cooling degree days are consistent with slight positive increases in the W/R. Inclusion of W/R in a model that accounts for the covariance of wages and rents yields supply elasticities from + 3.47 to + 7.20 for all medical providers, and from + 0.22 to + 0.43 for registered nurses. These interregional elasticities (particularly for nurses) are consistent with estimates in other contexts.","[Goodman, Allen C.] Wayne State Univ, 656 W Kirby St, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Smith, Brent C.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, POB 844000, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Wayne State University; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Goodman, AC (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, 656 W Kirby St, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",allen.goodman@wayne.edu; bcsmith@vcu.edu,"Smith, Brent/AAJ-5789-2020",,,,,,23,3,4,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

This has led to an increasing pressure to adjust the legal framework regarding these interventions. In Austria, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMH) has the responsibility to draft the relevant legal regulations for farmed animals, which are then enforced by the parliament. In preparation for this, the FMH approached the Messerli Research Institute to organize a participatory process for nominated stakeholder representatives and researchers to describe pros and cons of various alternatives to the aforementioned zootechnical interventions. Based on Ben Mepham's (1996) idea of the ethical matrix, a modified matrix (MM) was used developed to analyse and compare possible alternatives to the currently performed interventions. The modified matrix comprised four domains: (1) impacts on animal welfare; (2) impacts on the farmer/economy (3) issues related to implementing a particular alternatives; (4) 'other aspects: In the first phase of the project the matrix was developed and embedded into an online questionnaire that was sent out to nominated participants. In a period of two weeks, they had the possibility to fill out the modified matrix based on their expertise and specialised knowledge. The content of the filled out matrices provided the basis of discussion for the subsequent face-to -face meetings in the second phase. By means of the modified matrix, a systematic and consensual description of alternative measures could be reached, even though the background of stakeholder representatives varied from animal protection groups, chamber of agriculture, chamber of veterinarians, animal breeders, retailers, consumer protection groups, industry representatives to veterinary scientists. In this paper we will (1) describe the background of the project; (2) elaborate on the development of the adopted matrix and methodology of the workshops; (3) demonstrate its usefulness to structure debates; (4) outline the results of the workshops. In summary, this ethical tool provides a well-structured and promising way to consensually describe the normative dimensions of the zootechnical interventions in question.","[Grimm, H.; Springer, S.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Fromwald, S.] Fromwald Consulting, Castellezgasse 27-27, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Grimm, H (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",herwig.grimm@vetmeduni.ac.at,,,,,,,1,1,1,3,4,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,55,59,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_6,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000006,0

Thanks to several unpublished documents from personal archives and Chamberlin's articles on the subject, we establish that Chamberlin began to emphasize duopoly only later in his career (1950). Even if we accept Chamberlin's notion of monopolistic competition as a theory combining oligopoly and product differentiation, it still suffers from inconsistency, and may owe its existence to Chamberlin's sheer determination to differentiate it from Joan Robinson's notion of imperfect competition.","[Guicherd, Thibault] Univ Lumiere Lyon 2, 86 Rue Pasteur, F-69007 Lyon, France",Universite Lyon 2,"Guicherd, T (通讯作者)，Univ Lumiere Lyon 2, 86 Rue Pasteur, F-69007 Lyon, France.",thibault.guicherd@hotmail.fr,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Associated benefits are among others a high level of organizational commitment. To add to this topic, this paper examines the influence of employees' satisfaction with job characteristics on organizational commitment. The underlying research question is whether the satisfaction with different categories of job characteristics lead to a different type of organizational commitment. Furthermore, it shall be analysed, whether different demographic or work-related groups show different levels of satisfaction with certain job characteristics. An empirical study with 183 participants has been conducted. A factor analysis revealed three components for the employees' satisfaction with job characteristics: (1) social, (2) status and perspective and (3) independence and interest. A. regression model tested the explanatory power of these components on affective, continuous and normative commitment and explained 20.5% of variances for affective organizational commitment. The models for continuous and normative organizational commitment showed no statistical significance. Differences in their satisfaction with job characteristic's categories were found for the groups age, nationality, management responsibility and type of employment. Derived from these results, a practical recommendation for a company could be to include a regular examination of employees' satisfaction with certain job categories in their employer branding process in order to maintain a high level of organizational commitment.","[Hager, Michael] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Seibt, Tatjana] Univ Appl Management Erding, Erding, Germany",University of Latvia,"Hager, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,30,0,0,1,8,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,222,234,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500021,0

The framework is similar to that of Hausman and Newey (Econometrica, 1995, 63, 1445-1476), but allows for more general forms of heterogeneity. Individual demands are characterized by a general model that is nonparametric in the regressors, as well as monotonic in unobserved heterogeneity, allowing us to identify the distribution of welfare effects. We first argue why a decision maker should care about this distribution. Then we establish constructive identification, propose a sample counterparts estimator, and analyze its large-sample properties. Finally, we apply all concepts to measuring the heterogeneous effect of a change of gasoline price using US consumer data and find very substantial differences in individual effects across quantiles.","[Hoderlein, Stefan] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Vanhems, Anne] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France",Boston College; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education,"Hoderlein, S (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",stefan_hoderlein@yahoo.com,,,,,,,29,4,4,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

In recent times, however, the topic has received increasing attention from the natural sciences. Natural scientific disciplines such as ethology, that studies animal behaviour, increasingly conduct research on morally-relevant behavioural capacities, e.g. prosociality, empathy, or inequity aversion in various animal species. However, the resulting scientific publications often lack an explicit and reflected examination of the underlying concept of morality. This is problematic because as is evident from philosophical research, 'morality' is a highly contested concept. We hypothesise that the study paradigms and experimental designs are informed by a very specific conception of morality which is implicit in the experimental design; being able to make explicit through critically analysing the latter. We argue that the concept of morality applied represents a particular core idea of the morally good and bad and is strongly oriented along egalitarian lines. However, as we will argue, philosophy can provide alternative conceptions. We will first identify how this hidden concept of morality is at work in a sample of relevant publications in the field by highlighting a number of thick ethical concepts (morally evaluative descriptive terms; cf. Williams, 1985) which reveal the moral foundation underlying these studies. This is further elucidated by, second, turning to an examination of the study paradigms, e.g. through identifying and analysing the criteria to classify the study subject as behaving prosocial (i.e. morally good) or not prosocial (i.e. morally bad). Besides providing an important - so far ignored - perspective on studies dealing with interdisciplinary research topics like morality, we strengthen the importance of a mutual exchange of knowledge between scientific disciplines in order to conduct reasoned science.

Clusters are one of the s of such cooperation. The aim of the article is to show the impact of functioning in clusters has on the associated enterprises and on their competitive level in the global economy, especially in the context of reduction of investment risk. There are the following research questions in the paper: (1) in what aspects of enterprise functioning the clusters can bring benefits? (2) can cluster reduce the investment cost and time (3) can function in a cluster contribute to an increase in the company's competitiveness? In order to verify the research questions, the following research methods were used: method of critical analysis of available literature (data from both primary and secondary sources), cause-and-effect analysis (used to examine the impact of enterprises' association in clusters on the increase of company's competitiveness) and own empirical research carried out among senior managers of companies located in the industrial cluster under study. The empirical research carried out in the paper is used to verify the state of knowledge about clusters and competitiveness. As the research result, it can be noted that clusters bring many economic effects for companies, taking advantage of economies of scale and synergy. Creation of an effective cluster contributes to the reduction of operating costs, and the cost of supply, logistics and production - these elements are consistent with the assumptions described in the literature. However, based on the research from the paper, it can be stated, contrary to theoretical assumptions, that the cluster's activity does not contribute to the easier access to educated workforce and does not shorten the time to enter the market.","[Jankowiak, Anna H.] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Jankowiak, AH (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",,"Jankowiak, Anna H./I-7901-2016",,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,270,279,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500025,0

We will do so firstly, by identifying the geopolitics as a concept and secondly, by analysing Russian geopolitical thinking Three main approaches to it in Russia are based on Eurasianism - the New Right, the Eurasianist Communism and the Democrats.

These studies are, however, mainly concerned with the consumer as a buyer and neglect the other roles that he/she may perform with regard to sustainability. This article aims at proposing a theoretical model of the factors affecting consumer intentions for sustainable action which may take the form of both sustainable consumption and involvement which adds complexity to existing conceptualizations. The selection of variables to be included in the model is based partially on the theory of planned behaviour and the ideal point model. In order to set the basis for testing the proposed model, there is developed a scale, which measures one of the key constructs of the model - the gap between the ideal view of sustainable development and its perceived current state. The research methods used include semi-structured personal interviews and associative techniques to support the design of the model and an online survey among target audience to empirically test the developed scale. As a result of the study some new perspectives to the explanation of how intentions for sustainable action are being formed is added. The constructed measurement scale can be used in further research that might include testing the validity of the model. Another research direction could be examining the differences imposed by varying cultural and economic backgrounds on a cross-national basis.","[Kraleva, Vanya; Ivanov, Svilen] Univ Econ Varna, Varna, Bulgaria",University of Economics Varna,"Kraleva, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Varna, Varna, Bulgaria.",,"Ivanov, Svilen/AAN-7801-2021","Ivanov, Svilen/0000-0003-4559-9056",,,,,43,1,1,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,358,366,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500033,0

Considering methodology, this paper uses secondary data from Croatian Bureau of Statistics. Further research should take into consideration longer observation and monitoring time periods as well as the need to determine reasons (includinglinancial reasons, administrative obstacles when starting a business, educational reasons, insufficient possibilities for creating a future for oneself etc.) as an incentive to participate in migrations. This research is important for the long-term sustainability of both regional areas and national economy; not only in economic but many other contexts such as demographic and social development. It is important to emphasize that migration movements present both a threat and an opportunity at the same time, so modern national economies need to carefully and timely create specific policies which can influence those migrations.","[Marosevic, Katarina] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Marosevic, K (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",katarina.marosevic@pravos.hr,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1571,1585,,,,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300087,0

The government's rationale for simplification of financial reporting requirements is mainly based on reducing the administrative burden. The purpose of this paper is to carry out a comparative analysis of the reporting obligations of micro enterprises in selected Eastern-European countries (Poland, Belarus, Lithuania, Ukraine). These are countries with different levels of economic development, but with a common political-economic ground. As a research method, the authors have chosen desk research of national accounting regulations (laws and national standards) in terms of requirements to micro-entities. Literature studies and analysis of the national legal regulations show that the elements of financial statements of micro-entities are similar in four selected countries. The differences, however, concern the definitions of a micro-entity, the range of financial data presented in financial statements and the requirements of keeping accounting books. As a result, the scope of the financial information for decision-making and evaluation of the enterprises is not homogenous in the researched Eastern-European countries. Poland and Lithuania are the state members of European Union what affects on their accounting law and financial reporting requirements of micro enterprises. In the case of Ukraine, the financial reporting requirements are similar to the ones of European Union. Although, the definition of micro entity differs from the European one. Belarus is a country where the transformation has been limited. It has influenced not only by the structure of Belarus' enterprises but also on the national accounting law.

All high- or medium-income occupation groups exhibited substantial within occupation income inequality. Across municipalities, income inequality is higher in high-income municipalities, and lower in muncipalities with high levels of fisheries and pastoral agriculture. While manufacturing activity is positively correlated with income inequality, the association is not apparent when other economic factors such as the mode of food production is accounted for.

The concern for rights is captured by a pre-ordering over combinations of thresholds corresponding to floors or ceilings on various quantitative indicators. The resulting constraints on actions and on levels of state variables are interpreted as minimal rights to be guaranteed to all generations, for intergenerational equity purposes. The level of these rights are endogenously chosen, accounting for the cost in terms of welfare of granting them. Such a criterion could embody the idea of sustainable development. We provide an axiomatization of such a criterion and characterize the tension between rights and welfare in a general economic framework. We apply the criterion to the standard Dasgupta-Heal-Solow model of resource extraction and capital accumulation. We show that if the weight given to rights in the criterion is sufficiently high, the optimal solution is on the threshold possibility frontier. The development path is then driven by the rights. In particular, if a minimal consumption is considered as a right, constant consumption can be optimal even with a positive utility discount rate. In this case, the shadow value of the right plays an important role in the determination of the rate of discount to be applied to social investment projects.","[Ngo Van Long] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Ngo Van Long] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Martinet, Vincent] Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, AgroParisTech, Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",McGill University; University of Tasmania; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; INRAE,"Martinet, V (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, AgroParisTech, Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",ngo.long@mcgill.ca; vincent.martinet@inra.fr,"Martinet, Vincent/X-4953-2019","Martinet, Vincent/0000-0002-7135-8849",,,,,48,4,4,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2018,50.0,1,,,,,35,64,,10.1007/s00355-017-1073-5,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FQ3YV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418295500002,0

The study covers 48 African, 16 Caribbean and 15 Pacific countries and is based on the data retrieved from the World Bank Database. During the analysed 15 years, five African countries and Cuba had average annual GDP per capita growth rates higher than 4.0%.On the other hand, more than twenty ACP countries recorded negative or very low average annual GDP per capita growth rates. GDP in the fastest growing ACP countries has been primarily generated through services and industry sectors. Services and agriculture sectors have contributed the most to GDP in the slowest growing ones. The poorest countries were highly dependent on agriculture which provided a living for the vast majority of their population. On the demand side, domestic private consumption was the main source of growth in the analysed countries. Many countries experienced a decline in the share of exports of goods and services in GDP. Several ACP countries sustained growth mainly because of foreign aid. Resource rich countries managed to attract foreign direct investment. In some fast growing ACP countries, economic growth resulted from the implementation of market-based economic policies and improvement of investment framework and in other countries, government's interventionist policies enhanced it. The slowest growing ACP countries have been affected by conflicts, internal political turmoil and suffered from climate-related shocks. The vast majority of the analysed countries have to improve the business climate, governance, and control of corruption to maintain or accelerate economic growth.","[Nowak, Wioletta] Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Nowak, W (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.",wioletta.nowak@uwr.edu.pl,"Nowak, Wioletta/L-1548-2019","Nowak, Wioletta/0000-0002-9200-2972",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,313,324,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300037,0

The paper examines philosophically IPRs employed as a legal instrument to protect the control of animal-related innovations and the creation of novel genetic material in animals. It focuses on what kind of moral relation to animals is being formed if patents and other forms of exclusive control are granted for animals used in food production and for their genetic material and how the resulting human-animal relationship has been criticized. It also explores the open-source approach, or Bio-Linux, in animal genetic modification. The paper argues that even if animal-related innovations were not granted patent protection, for example on the basis of morality exclusion, there are other forms of ownership that offer just as powerful control as patents over the maintenance of animal life and the direction of its evolution. These forms include the ownership of animals as things, or as tangible property, and trademarks. Together they enable the in-depth self-regulation of business in the development and maintenance of animal breeds and allow other less desirable breeds to disappear. Thus, the patents on animal genetic material do not imply a qualitatively novel moral relationship between humans and animals. Are patents then as morally acceptable as the ownership of animals as things? The answer to this question depends on what the production of patentable information involves, in particular, what kind of treatment of animals it allows and what kind of sentient beings it brings into existence.","[Oksanen, M.] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Social Sci, POB 1627, Kuopio 70211, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,"Oksanen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Social Sci, POB 1627, Kuopio 70211, Finland.",markku.oksanen@uef.fi,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,4,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,234,239,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_36,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000036,0

While regulators have full access to confidential information on all supervised entities and market data are available to all interested parties, determining systemic risk where bank shares or debt securities are not publicly listed is problematic to say the least. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to evaluate principal components analysis (PCA) as an alternative method for identifying level of systemic risk among banks in small, open economies with un-developed capital market for banks. The study presented in this paper uses publicly available yearly bank performance data (return on assets, equity multiplier, non-performing loans ratio, liquidity and capital adequacy) in Latvia to compute principal components. The increased cross-correlation and interdependency of bank performance indicators, materialized as increased percentage of variance that first two principal components explain, during global financial crisis and ensued European debt crisis show that PCA is an alternative method for tracking level of systemic risk in small, open economies with undeveloped share market for banks. The increased interdependency leads to potential system instability to marginal threads. The results of the research show that PCA is a suitable method for tracking the level of systemic risk in the banking sector even with divergent business strategies and regulatory framework.","[Petrovska, Kristine] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Petrovska, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,511,519,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500047,0

Harmonic analysis was used in the research. An attempt was made to present regional differences in the seasonality of unemployment as an effect of different amplitude and frequency. In this study, seasonality analysis was carried out on the example of the United States, one country, but with a varied climate structure. Limiting research to one economy allows a better understanding of the importance of non-economic factors. And as it turns out, these are crucial in the scale and distribution of seasonal fluctuations. Differences among states arise from a different share of waves of an annual and semiannual frequency, and from a date of maximal unemployment in a wave of an annual frequency. Northern states are characterised by the prevalence of a wave, of annual frequency, with its maximum in the winter period. In the southern states, the unemployment maximum is a wave of annual frequency occurring in the summer period, in which the further south, the bigger the share of this wave in total seasonal variability. In the majority of states between the northern and southern ones, seasonality of unemployment has the character of a cycle of semiannual frequency with seasonal maximum in both winter and summer periods. The value of seasonal fluctuations is clearly related to the distribution of seasonal fluctuations. Smaller seasonal fluctuations characterise those states where the maximum for the annual harmonic occurs in the summer period. The superposition of waves of different frequency results in specific seasonal fluctuations in unemployment in particular states.","[Przekota, Grzegorz; Rembeza, Jerzy] Tech Univ Koszalin, Koszalin, Poland",Koszalin University of Technology,"Przekota, G (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Koszalin, Koszalin, Poland.",grzegorzprzekota@wp.pl; jerzy.rembeza@tu.koszalin.pl,"Przekota, Grzegorz/D-5133-2019","Przekota, Grzegorz/0000-0002-9173-2658",,,,,15,0,0,1,4,STANISLAW STASZIC UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES PILA,PILA,"UL PODCHORAZYCH 10, PILA, 64-920, POLAND",,,978-83-62617-89-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,170,186,,10.14595/CP/01/012,0.0,,,17,Development Studies; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BM3DE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461899000012,0

The international competitiveness of a country is a reflection of the ability of the organizations within it to achieve success both on the national and international markets. The latest scientific researches attribute organizational performance and consequently competitive advantage to its leaders and their ability to optimally use available resources. Sources have shown that leaders facing the ongoing globalization market challenges through their behaviour can improve the organization's performance. Effective leaders enable it by increasing the level of entrepreneurial orientation of the organization (nurturing its proactive, innovative and risk-taking characteristics) through the interrelationships among its workers as well as their commitment, confidence and motivation for greater work quality. All these favourable effects are primarily enabled by transformational leadership style, first described by Burns (1978), and elaborated in detail by Bass (1985a), whose implementation is dominantly advocated in modern organizations. This paper explores which leadership characteristics can be used to improve the organization's performance, and whether less successful organizations can be distinguished from the ones that are more successful. The results of this study show that there are specific characteristics that the organization should nurture if it wants to be successful and that less successful organizations can be distinguished from the ones that are more successful according to leadership style they use.","[Pureta, Igor] Grawe Hrvatska Dd, Zagreb, Croatia; [Pureta, Tanja] Ramiro Doo, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Pureta, I (通讯作者)，Grawe Hrvatska Dd, Zagreb, Croatia.",igor.pureta@grawe.hr; tanja.pureta@ramiro.hr,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,6,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,112,130,,,,,,19,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300007,0

Particularly, the author has faced an acute lack of points of reference in his specific research field, those cognitive elements meant to offer theoretical support and stability to one's study. It is distinctly relevant to note that most of the doctrine analyzing the juridical phenomenon of abuse of tax law within the EU find its ultima ratio argument in the EUCJ jurisprudence or in the EU legislation, without even attempting any critical assessment of these sources. In this context, besides many other subsidiary research questions, the main research question guiding the present study is: why is it important for the abuse of tax law researcher to look for reference points in his investigation outside of the formal EU law sources he is examining? We will try to answer this question throughout the two main parts of this paper which will present (I.) the hyper-specialization of the EU tax law researcher and (II.) the side effects of this hyper-specialization. To sum up, the answer to the research question (and of the thesis this paper will defend) will be that unless the researcher will look for reference points outside of the formal law sources he is studying, he will ultimately fail to fulfill his calling.

Polish ferry market is a prime segment of ferry industry in South Baltic. Services from Polish ports to Sweden determine the carriage of units and wheeled cargo as well as transport of passengers between Continent and Scandinavia. Since Poland and other states have acceded to the European Union, growing foreign exchange between Continental and Scandinavian countries is visible and Polish ferry market has been affected by increasing demand for transport. These services as the only ones in the Baltic Sea have not recorded decline in turnover since 2008. Polish ferry terminals located in Swinoujscie, Gdynia and Gdansk are pointed as transport nodes in Baltic - Adriatic Corridor. Ferry routes from mentioned ports constitute the shortest connections for cargo transported from Central European countries to Scandinavia. These two factors determine the add value and competitiveness of Polish ferry market. The aim of the article is to analyse the trend in foreign trade among the above countries, the market development as well as study the interrelationship between the trade volumes and ferry turnover. The research hypothesis is: the increase in trade between Central Europe and Scandinavia is the prime factor developing the demand for ferry services in Polish shipping market. Detailed research hypothesis is that: the group of factors affecting Polish ferry market are both opportunities and threats for development of ferry traffic. In order to verify the hypothesis, the article is focusing on following aspects: international trade volumes and trends between Scandinavia and Central Europe, potential of Polish ferry market in context of market requirements.","[Urbanyi-Popiolek, Ilona; Studzieniecki, Tomasz] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Urbanyi-Popiolek, I (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",i.urbanyi@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; tomaszstudzieniecki@wp.pl,"Studzieniecki, Tomasz/Q-7351-2018; Urbanyi-Popiolek, Ilona/R-5237-2018","Studzieniecki, Tomasz/0000-0002-1272-0908; Urbanyi-Popiolek, Ilona/0000-0002-1042-8559",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,199,205,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300024,0

This paper presents the case of Russian political economy, dubbed statist-patrimonial capitalism', which is marked by state threats to private property rights through bureaucratic extortion or legal harassment. How can we explain the resilience of Russia's statist-patrimonial capitalism? Predominant accounts focus on the lack of institutional constraints on state predation. The paper offers a different perspective by exploring the often-overlooked contribution of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). First, statistical data show a steady rise of SMEs in the 2000s despite increasing state predation, suggesting that SMEs are not simply subjugated by the state. Second, in-depth interviews with Russian entrepreneurs reveal that business contributes to the maintenance of the statist-patrimonial system through the mechanism of the informality trap': firms that choose the informal strategy have difficulties to return to the legal sphere and get stuck in informality. The drivers of informality include firm-specific characteristics, institutional factors and socio-cultural factors dubbed normality'. The mechanism of the informality trap' highlights the agency of firms in corrupt polities and may be applicable to other emerging economies.","[Vasileva, Alexandra] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Vasileva, A (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",a.vasileva@uva.nl,,,,,,,59,15,16,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In particular, it examines if states engage in strategic interaction when making decisions about the total value of EDI offered in a given year. The goal is to better understand if competition among states for jobs and private investment is a contributing factor to the increase in EDI spending programs. Taking advantage of a national search engine, spatial econometric techniques are applied to state-level panel data and different metrics of neighborliness are considered to better identify patterns of EDI competition. Results from 48 states during the period 2007 to 2012 suggest the presence of strategic interaction: states increase their EDI spending when their neighbors do so. Estimates are robust to numerous specification checks, including an alternative source of EDI spending data. Notably, states compete more intensively over out-of-pocket incentives than those in the form of forgone revenue.","[Wang, Jia] Univ Dayton, Dept Econ & Finance, 300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45469 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Dayton,"Wang, J (通讯作者)，Univ Dayton, Dept Econ & Finance, 300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45469 USA.",jwang8@udayton.edu,,,Robberson Research and Creative Endeavors Grant from University of Oklahoma,Robberson Research and Creative Endeavors Grant from University of Oklahoma,This research project is supported by the Robberson Research and Creative Endeavors Grant from the University of Oklahoma ($600).,,43,12,13,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

In line with this view I first calibrate different criteria of intergenerational equity in the AK model of economic growth, with a given productivity parameter A, and then evaluate their performance by mapping the consequences of the criteria in various technological environments. The evaluation is based on the extent to which they yield social choice mappings satisfying four desirable properties. The Calvo criterion as well as sustainable discounted utilitarianism and rank-discounted utilitarianism yield sustainable growth in the AK model, the Ramsey technology and the Dasgupta-Heal-Solow-Stiglitz technology for any specifications of these technological environments.","[Asheim, Geir B.] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Asheim, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",g.b.asheim@econ.uio.no,,"Asheim, Geir B./0000-0003-0669-4632",Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme [179552],Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme(Research Council of Norway),"I am grateful for extensive discussions with Paolo Piacquadio and for correspondence with John Roemer and Joaquim Silvestre.

However, what is less explored is that this travel satisfaction is not only an outcome of travel-related preferences and choices, but that travel satisfaction can also be a predictor of travel-related components. In this conceptual paper we tend to fill the gaps in the existing albeit rather fragmented literature concerning travel satisfaction. We provide an overview of the elements explaining travel satisfaction, and possible outcomes of travel satisfaction, with a focus on (i) subjective well-being, (ii) travel mode choice, (iii) travel-related attitudes, and (iv) the residential location. Furthermore, we suggest a continuous cyclical process including the four above mentioned elements in which travel satisfaction plays an essential role; a process which can result in the formation of travel habits.","[De Vos, Jonas; Witlox, Frank] Univ Ghent, Geog Dept, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"De Vos, J (通讯作者)，Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",jonas.devos@ugent.be,"Witlox, Frank/A-5143-2008; De Vos, Jonas/AAJ-1298-2021","Witlox, Frank/0000-0002-8966-6823; De Vos, Jonas/0000-0003-4919-2157",Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) [12F2516N],Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"We would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions, making it possible to improve this article.

To that end, we use a measure of globalisation that distinguishes the social and political dimensions of integration from the economic dimension, thus allowing us to adopt a broader perspective than in most of existing studies. The results show that the inclusion of country fixed effects removes the statistical association between the degree of integration with the rest of the world and the incidence of internal conflict. We present instrumental variables estimates that also show no causal effect of globalisation on civil conflict. These findings do not depend either on the specific dimension of globalisation considered or the measure of conflict used in the analysis. Likewise, the absence of a relationship between globalisation and civil conflict is not driven by countries located in the most conflictive regions in the world.","[Ezcurra, Roberto; Manotas, Beatriz] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Ezcurra, R (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona, Spain.",,,"Manotas Hidalgo, Beatriz/0000-0002-1341-5905","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2011-29314-C02-01, ECO2015-64330-P]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The authors would like to thank one anonymous referee, Joan Esteban, Carmen Herrero, Javier Hualde, Sara Martinez de Morentin, Laura Mayoral, Fidel Perez, Prakarsh Singh and participants at the 17th World Congress of the International Economic Association and the 14th Conference on International Economics for their useful comments and suggestions to earlier versions of the paper.

In this paper, we propose a multi-agent model to factually describes the human psychologies of the decision-making process in LUBA. The model produces bid-price distributions that are in excellent agreement with those from the real data, including the whole inverted-J shape which is a general feature of the real bid price distribution, and the exponential decreasing shape in the higher price range.

An Artificial Agent-Based Analysis,COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Extended trading hours; Agent-based market model; Price efficiency; Return volatility; Trading volume,MARKET; TIME; VOLUME; PRICES,"The extension of trading hours to provide more trading opportunities and improve price efficiency has increasingly been discussed. However, currently, stock market trading activity during the extended-hours session is quite limited. Thus, we should examine whether the extension of trading hours is effective in creating more trading opportunities and increasing price efficiency even if there are only a few market participants during the extended session. For this study, we build an agent-based market model and analyze the effect of extending trading hours. We find that although the extension of trading hours could increase daily trading volume, price formation and trading activity could be distorted if the number of market participants during the extended-hours session is limited. Specifically, the extension could result in more concentrated trading at the open of the regular trading session, greater divergence between market prices and the fundamental value of assets, as well as higher return volatility (especially at the open).","[Miwa, Kotaro] Tokio Marine Asset Management Co Ltd, Chiyoda Ku, 1-8-2 Marunouchi, Tokyo 1000005, Japan; [Ueda, Kazuhiro] Univ Tokyo, Meguro Ku, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538902, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Miwa, K (通讯作者)，Tokio Marine Asset Management Co Ltd, Chiyoda Ku, 1-8-2 Marunouchi, Tokyo 1000005, Japan.",miwa_tfk@cs.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ueda@gregorio.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Miwa, Kotaro/0000-0002-4223-3430; Ueda, Kazuhiro/0000-0003-1244-7945",Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16H01725]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H01725] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Publication of this paper was supported by a grant-in-aid from Zengin Foundation for Studies on Economics and Finance, and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (No. 16H01725) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

Yet because of the methodological challenges related to the identification of a counterfactual when a single unit is treated, the causal effects of these policies on the growth of the industry, or specifically on employment, are seldom identified. We adopt a Synthetic Control Method (SCM) approach to analyze the long-term impact on employment of the Tourism Development Policy (TDP) implemented by the Argentinean province of Salta. We find an 11 percent average annual impact over 10 years on employment in the hospitality sector, which translated in an accumulated impact of 1376 formal jobs in the tourism value chain. We also find that this growth did not happen at the expenses of other industries and that TDP generated positive inter -industry employment spillovers/externalities. For each job created in the tourism value-chain, an additional job was created in the rest of the provincial economy, which resulted in a total creation of 2750 formal jobs. Our results are robust across a series of placebo tests and sensitivity checks and are consistent among alternative synthetic control units.","[Castillo, Victoria] Minist Labor Employment & Social Secur, Observ Employment & Entrepreneurial Dynam, Av Leandro N Alem 628,C1001AAO, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Figal Garone, Lucas] Univ San Andres, Dept Econ, Vito Dumas 284,Victoria B1644BID, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Figal Garone, Lucas; Maffioli, Alessandro] Interamer Investment Corp, 1350 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Salazar, Lina] Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Inter-American Development Bank,"Garone, LF (通讯作者)，Univ San Andres, Dept Econ, Vito Dumas 284,Victoria B1644BID, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",vcastillo@trabajo.gob.ar; lfigal@iadb.org; alessandrom@iadb.org; lsalazar@iadb.org,,,,,,,66,33,35,0,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Bicycles have been considered an optimum means of completing these short trips because the bicycle is an environmentally friendly, economical, and convenient vehicle. Accordingly, many countries have adopted public bicycle-sharing systems to reduce the use of private vehicles for short trips in central downtown areas. In this paper, we propose a new framework, based on taxi trajectory data, for locating bicycle-sharing stations most efficiently to replace short automobile trips. The proposed framework is applied to Gangnam-gu, a district within the city of Seoul, Korea. Results using two different location-allocation models are demonstrated. As expected, when the p-median model was implemented, the selected stations were more scattered over the whole district, whereas when the MCLP model was implemented, the stations were more concentrated on central areas. Our approach is applicable to any city considering a bicycle-sharing system and can contribute to the system's efficiency in improving environmental conditions in a central downtown area.","[Park, Chung; Sohn, So Young] Yonsei Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Sohn, SY (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Informat & Ind Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",sohns@yonsei.ac.kr,,,"MOLIT (The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport), Korea, under the national spatial information research program [16NSIP-B081011-03]","MOLIT (The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport), Korea, under the national spatial information research program","This research, 'Geospatial Big Data Management, Analysis and Service Platform Technology Development', was supported by the MOLIT (The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport), Korea, under the national spatial information research program supervised by the KAIA (Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement) (16NSIP-B081011-03).",,27,64,67,3,73,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Exposome science examines the total accumulated environmental exposures (both detrimental and beneficial) as a means to understand the response of the 'total organism to the total environment' over time. The repetitive stimulation of compensatory physiological responses (immune, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine) in response to stress including sources of stress highly relevant to socioeconomic disadvantage - may lead to metabolic dysregulation and cellular damage, ultimately influencing behavior and disease. The collective toll of physiological wear and tear, known as allostatic load, is not paid equally throughout developed societies. It is paid in excess by the disadvantaged. In the context of fast-food, human and experimental research demonstrates that the biological response to a single fast-food-style meal-especially as mediated by the microbiome-is a product of the person's total lived experience, including the ability to buffer the fast-food meal-induced promotion of inflammation and oxidative stress. Emerging research indicates that each meal and its nutritional context matters. As we discuss, equal weekly visits to major fast-food outlets by the affluent and deprived do not translate into biological equivalency. Hence, debate concerning reducing fast-food outlets through policy-especially in disadvantaged neighborhoods where they are prevalent- requires a biological context. The fast-food establishment and fast-food meal- as they represent matters of food justice and press upon non-communicable disease risk-are far more than physical structures and collections of carbohydrate, fat, sugar and sodium.

Specifically, there are three criteria: (1) The positive or negative signs of elements in the eigenvector of correlation matrix indicate the response direction of individual stocks. (2) The components are included based on the sequence of corresponding eigenvalue magnitudes from large to small. (3) All the elements in the cluster representing individual stocks should have same signs across the components included in the classification process. With the number of vectors included in the process increasing, a speed-up process for cluster number is identified. We interpret this phenomenon as a phase transition from a state dominated by meaningful information to one dominated by trivial information. And a critical point exists in this process. The sizes of clusters near this critical point can be regarded as a power law distribution. The critical exponent evolvement indicates structure of the market. The vector number at this point can be adopted to classify the stock clusters. We analyze the cross-correlation matrices of stock logarithm returns of both China and US stock market for the period from January 4, 2005 to December 31, 2010. The period includes the anomalies time of financial crisis. The number of clusters in financial and technology sectors is further examined to reveal the varying feather of traditional industries. Distinct patterns of industrial differentiation between China and US have been found according to our study.","[Li, Zhaoyuan; Tian, Maozai] Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Ctr Appl Stat, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhaoyuan] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tian, Maozai] Lanzhou Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Tian, Maozai] Xinjiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Informat, Urumqi, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; University of Hong Kong; Lanzhou University of Finance & Economics; Xinjiang University of Finance & Economics,"Tian, MZ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Ctr Appl Stat, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.;Tian, MZ (通讯作者)，Lanzhou Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.;Tian, MZ (通讯作者)，Xinjiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Informat, Urumqi, Peoples R China.",mztian@ruc.edu.cn,,,major research projects of philosophy and social science of the Chinese Ministry of Education [15JZD015]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11271368]; Major Program of Beijing Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA17]; Ministry of Education - Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China [20130004110007]; Key Program of National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation Grant [13AZD064]; Major Project of Humanities Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education [15JJD910001]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [15XNL008]; Project of Flying Apsaras Scholar of Lanzhou University of Finance Economics; Project of Tianshan Mountain Scholar of Xinjiang University of Finance Economics,major research projects of philosophy and social science of the Chinese Ministry of Education; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Program of Beijing Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Education - Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; Key Program of National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation Grant; Major Project of Humanities Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China; Project of Flying Apsaras Scholar of Lanzhou University of Finance Economics; Project of Tianshan Mountain Scholar of Xinjiang University of Finance Economics,"The work was partially supported by the major research projects of philosophy and social science of the Chinese Ministry of Education (No. 15JZD015), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11271368), Project supported by the Major Program of Beijing Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China (No. 15ZDA17), Project of Ministry of Education supported by the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (Grant No. 20130004110007), the Key Program of National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation Grant (No. 13AZD064), the Major Project of Humanities Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education (No. 15JJD910001), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (No. 15XNL008), the Project of Flying Apsaras Scholar of Lanzhou University of Finance & Economics, and the Project of Tianshan Mountain Scholar of Xinjiang University of Finance & Economics.",,33,2,2,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Will low-income individuals respond to the incentives of living in a state with better health subsidies by relocating to the state? This paper addresses this question by examining the population growth rate of low-income individuals in Massachusetts following the Massachusetts Health Care Reform (MHCR) of 2006. Like the ACA, the MHCR expanded the Medicaid program, and also provided subsidized health insurance for low-income individuals. Using difference-in-differences and triple-differences models and Internal Revenue Service tax return data, we show that the reform did not have a global effect on the movement of low-income individuals across all cities in Massachusetts. However, we also show that the reform did have a local (or border) effect on the movement into border cities of the state, an effect that is relatively large for cities very close to the border but disappears quickly once the distance to border goes beyond 15 miles.","[Alm, James] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 6823 St Charles Ave,208 Tilton Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Enami, Ali] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 6824 St Charles Ave,Tilton Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Tulane University; Tulane University,"Alm, J (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 6823 St Charles Ave,208 Tilton Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",jalm@tulane.edu; aenami@tulane.edu,,"Enami, Ali/0000-0003-0761-1130",,,,,62,6,7,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

However, to decide if the outcome of such a choice is efficient or approximately so, it is necessary to explore the question of optimal risk-sharing in mortgage contracts. But because only a small literature has studied this question, more research is clearly warranted. The present article helps fill this gap by developing a simplified version of Arvan and Brueckner's model, using it to characterize optimal contracts in the absence of mortgage termination, and then exploring how termination via prepayment or default affects optimal risk-sharing. The broad conclusion of the analysis is that potential mortgage termination makes higher risk exposure for borrowers optimal.","[Brueckner, Jan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Lee, Kangoh] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; California State University System; San Diego State University,"Brueckner, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jkbrueck@uci.edu; klee@mail.sdsu.edu,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2017,45.0,3,,,,,761,784,,10.1111/1540-6229.12149,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,FF9TJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000409359900007,0

According to one of the niost cited research works, carried out on 16 samples from seven countries worldwide, in two Italian cohorts (Crevalcore and Montegiorgio) mortality;from CHD was reduced by 26% in 20 years and by 21% in 40 years of follow-up with an index growth of 1 logarithmic unit (Fidanza et al., 2004). Fifteen years after that publication, this study aims to assess, in the six countries surveyed (Finland, USA, Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Japan and Croatia and Serbia, the former Yugoslavia), the MAI index dynamics extended universally, using the Food balance sheets data provided by FAO for the period 1961-2011.

Specifically, given increasing market thinness with distance and a limited number of heterogeneous buyers, higher income households are able to bid down land prices at farther away locations. This creates an incentive for leapfrog development and leads to a positive income gradient, which we also confirm empirically.","[Chen, Yong] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 219B Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Irwin, Elena G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 316 Agr Adm Bldg,2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Jayaprakash, Ciriyam] Ohio State Univ, Dept Phys, 191 West Woodruff Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Irwin, Nicholas B.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 331 Agr Adm Bldg,2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Oregon State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 219B Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",yong.chen@oregonstate.edu; irwin.78@osu.edu; jay@physics.osu.edu; irwin.114@osu.edu,,"Irwin, Elena/0000-0001-7908-5964; Irwin, Nicholas/0000-0002-8759-0159","James S.

Three global alliance clusters emerged, with founding partners located in the major geographic regions, and often already involved in bilateral partnerships with other founders. This study examines whether the formation of global airline alliances, with its related expansion of network reach, resulted in an increase in profitability for the founding members. Employing difference-in-difference regressions, this study has found no evidence that the formation of global alliances improved the profitability of founding member airlines, or conferred an economic advantage over airlines that were not founding members. This result is robust across geographic regions, individual global alliances, and alternative event dates. The results of this research suggest that regulators should be less anxious that by sanctioning these closer relationships they are providing major carriers with opportunities for excessive profits.

Using information on previous and current contracts, the approach yields a model of customer behaviour, useful, for example, in assessing the impact of determinants of default, a natural concern for credit and behavioural scoring. Under plausible assumptions, a debtor in each period faces a number of missed payments, which depends on his previous repayment decisions; meanwhile, as most debtors are expected to meet financial obligations, the number of missed payments is bound to display excess zeros, with reference to a single-part law. Each sequence of missed payments is modelled by using the binomial thinning, a conceptual tool that allows for dependence between integers by defining the support of consecutive counts. Under suitable assumptions on heterogeneity, the model can be produced under a random effects approach, leading to a two-part panel data model, estimable by quasi-maximum likelihood. The proposed approach is illustrated using a panel data set on personal loans granted by a Portuguese bank.","[Murteira, Jose M.

This approach is motivated by models of institutional change drawn from the political science literature which focus on the existence of both fast-moving and slow-moving institutional changes and the interactions between them as drivers of the dynamics of asset prices. As a methodological contribution, we use several time-varying parameter models for the first time in investigations of institutional change. Our findings support the existence of both structural breaks and continuous variance in parameters. This contributes to our understanding of the housing market in two respects. Firstly, the dates of structural breaks appear to better match unexpected market shocks rather than remarkable political events, and this supports prior institutional theory. Secondly, assessment of the effect of slow-moving institutional changes shows that people's biased expectations rather than the economic fundamentals have increasingly played an important role in driving housing prices in the short run although fundamentals continue to drive house prices to converge to their long-run equilibrium.","[Zhang, Hanxiong] Lincoln Univ, Brayford Pool LN6 7TS, Lincoln, England; [Hudson, Robert] Hull Univ, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Metcalf, Hugh] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Manahov, Viktor] York Univ, York YO10 5GD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Lincoln; University of Hull; Newcastle University - UK; University of York - UK,"Zhang, HX (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Brayford Pool LN6 7TS, Lincoln, England.",hzhang@lincoln.ac.uk,,"Hudson, Robert/0000-0001-9024-4874",,,,,38,9,9,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Measuring cost efficiency provides useful information on the performance of hotels to management, shareholders and, in general, to all stakeholders. Cost control is an issue managers are particularly concerned about, as it gives a competitive advantage that allows hotels to perform better. The results indicate that the inefficiency in average costs for the sample considered is 32.44% and is time invariant. The results also show that labour productivity, the accumulation of knowledge and location are factors that largely determine the differences in efficiency between hotels. These findings have important implications for public policymakers and hotel management, specifically, policies aimed at improving the skills of hotels' human resources should be encouraged. Likewise, both location and the accumulation of knowledge are strategic resources that hotel management must include in their competitive strategies to increase efficiency.","[Arbelo, Antonio; Perez-Gomez, Pilar] Univ La Laguna, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain; [Arbelo-Perez, Marta] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Arbelo, A (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, IUDE, Dept Business Management, Cmno Hornera S-N, San Cristobal la Laguna 38071, Tenerife, Spain.",aarbelo@ull.es,"arbelo alvarez, antonio/AAA-7219-2019; Perez-Gomez, Pilar/AAA-7246-2019; Arbelo-Pérez, Marta/O-9670-2019","arbelo alvarez, antonio/0000-0002-2656-4061; Arbelo-Pérez, Marta/0000-0003-2347-4295; Perez-Gomez, Pilar/0000-0003-1724-2957",,,,,44,21,23,0,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Also, shipment sizes have a large impact on transport mode choice. Therefore, they are an important aspect in the modeling of freight transport demand, as they allow to display the reactions of various stakeholders on policy measures. In this article, a model for the discrete choice of shipment sizes is applied to interregional road freight transport. Preferences of actors are reflected by a total logistics cost expression. Furthermore, a Latent Class Analysis approach is applied to identify groups of transport cases with similar logistics requirements. The classification reduces significantly heterogeneity in behavior.

The experimental results show that the AdaBoost algorithm combined with imputation methods has strong predictive accuracy in both data sets and it is a useful alternative for bankruptcy prediction with missing data.,"[Zhou, Ligang] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Int Business Sch, Xian, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology; University of Hong Kong; Shaanxi Normal University,"Zhou, LG (通讯作者)，Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China.",mrlgzhou@gmail.com; mskklai@cityu.edu.hk,,"Zhou, Ligang/0000-0003-3714-8562",Faculty Research Grants of Macau University of Science and Technology [0497]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71433001],Faculty Research Grants of Macau University of Science and Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Thank the anonymous reviewer for the very helpful and valuable suggestions and comments to improve this article.

By embedding housing costs, the SPM diverges from official measures in some instances, offering a conflicting view on family well-being. However, there is limited direct evidence of the impact of housing costs on household well-being, and virtually all of it focuses on food insecurity. This study examines the impact of local housing costs on household well-being using the basic needs data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Across a wide variety of specifications, no evidence is found that housing costs impact well-being. In contrast, local labor market conditions do impact the well-being measures in many specifications. The findings call into question one of the key motivations for the SPM-that geographic cost differences are a major factor for household well-being.","[Yelowitz, Aaron] Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 223B, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of Kentucky,"Yelowitz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 223B, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",aaron@uky.edu,"Yelowitz, Aaron/M-7378-2014","Yelowitz, Aaron/0000-0001-8847-1437",,,,,39,4,7,2,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In the empirical analysis, we examine conditional forecasts obtained with a VAR in the variables included in the DSGE model of Smets and Wouters (American Economic Review 2007; 97: 586-606).

Classic results on this problem assume that the set of relevant events-the agenda-is a -algebra and is thus closed under disjunction (union) and conjunction (intersection). We drop this demanding assumption and explore probabilistic opinion pooling on general agendas. One might be interested in the probability of rain and that of an interest-rate increase, but not in the probability of rain or an interest-rate increase. We characterize linear pooling and neutral pooling for general agendas, with classic results as special cases for agendas that are -algebras. As an illustrative application, we also consider probabilistic preference aggregation. Finally, we unify our results with existing results on binary judgment aggregation and Arrovian preference aggregation. We show that the same kinds of axioms (independence and consensus preservation) have radically different implications for different aggregation problems: linearity for probability aggregation and dictatorship for binary judgment or preference aggregation.","[Dietrich, Franz] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Dietrich, Franz] CNRS, Paris, France; [List, Christian] London Sch Econ, London, England",Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"List, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",C.List@lse.ac.uk,,"List, Christian/0000-0003-1627-800X","Ludwig Lachmann Fellowship at the LSE; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-12-INEG-0006-01]; Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship [MRF-2012-100]; Harsanyi Fellowship at the Australian National University, Canberra; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-INEG-0006] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","Ludwig Lachmann Fellowship at the LSE; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship(Leverhulme Trust); Harsanyi Fellowship at the Australian National University, Canberra; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","We thank the referees and the editor for very helpful and detailed comments.

The EZR approach is a bottom-up approach which intends to bring about behavioural change. This approach starts by teaching the drivers an eco-driving method, then coaching driver managers into enhancing performance, and finally involving regional managers in setting, and upholding realistic energy saving targets. The EZR approach has proven to be successful in bringing about the necessary changes to run a more energy-efficient TOC. To support the management, an energy saving monitor has been developed, and implemented. This monitor measures the amount of energy savings per team of 30 drivers on a monthly basis.

The principal can give the agent monetary incentives; in addition, he can give the agent an order. The agent finds it costly to disobey orders provided they are legitimate. We find that it may be optimal for the principal to take costly actions to bolster legitimacy. We argue that many organizational phenomena can be understood as attempts to bolster legitimacy.

These hypotheses are tested by investigating the impact of decentralization contingent on regulators' characteristics. Exploring both decentralization and centralization reforms in the coal mine industry, we find that decentralization is correlated with an increase in coal mine death rates.

In the existing literature, various levels of GDP per capita have been chosen based upon visual inspection of the scatter plots of the data. The estimated income-well-being gradients are sensitive to the choice of such kink points. We first replicate the results in Stevenson and Wolfers (American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings 2013; 103(3): 598-604), then apply the methods proposed in Hansen (Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 2016), which estimate the regression kink model with an unknown threshold, to the data in Stevenson and Wolfers (2013) to re-examine the two modified versions of Easterlin's hypothesis. In most cases, we do not find the existence of any kink point. In the few cases where a kink point is detected, the estimated kink point thresholds are different from those chosen in the previous literature.

A Transnationalist Critique of Jurgen Habermas' Reconstruction of Degressive Proportionality,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,European Parliament; degressive proportionality; political representation; Union citizenry; electoral integration; pouvoir constituant mixte,,"Arguing from a transnationalist perspective, this contribution contests Jurgen Habermas' reconstruction of degressive proportionality according to which the principle is justified as a mechanism empowering national interest. The critique is developed on legal, empirical and normative grounds. In the first step, the article demonstrates that the European Parliament (EP) is legally designed to serve as a medium of transnational political alignments. Based on empirical studies, it then shows that the members of the EP exercise their representative role as advocates of political platforms of a cross-border nature. Normatively, the contribution argues that it is possible to reconstruct degressive proportionality from a transnationalist, European perspective: The purpose of this complex legal construction is to establish the conditions of an open, fair and pluralistic transnational discourse in the EP. Degressive proportionality allows for heterogeneity and diversity within the Union citizenry, which remains - for the time being - divided in national constituencies, to be articulated politically.","[Von Achenbach, Jelena] Univ Giessen, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Von Achenbach, J (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Dept Law, Licher Str 64, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.",jelena.v.achenbach@recht.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,13,10,10,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

At the same time, generous tax exemptions and privileges are granted to battery electric vehicles. Continued application of the purchase tax instrument may induce large-scale penetration of electric cars into the passenger car stock, thus halving the fleet's fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions within two or three decades. The main tangible cost of this low carbon policy is the extra cost of acquiring novel products with currently small economies of scale. This cost difference will decline over time. The main benefits consist in reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We calculate the gross and net tangible cost of the low carbon policy in a long-term perspective, i.e. towards the 2050 horizon. A crucial cost determinant is the speed at which the manufacturing costs of battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will fall. Under moderately optimistic assumptions about impending economies of scale, net tangible costs by 2050 come out in the range 48 to 278 per tonne CO2, depending on the discount rate and on battery replacement costs.

As a result, this grassroots movement unintentionally brought into being a transcendent political subjectivity that was based on civic principles rather than ethnic values. The essay explores how the Beranselo movement embodied a democratic practice radically different from already available institutional practice of politics, in the process transforming the local ethnos into a demos and creating a dynamic of cross-ethnic, civic-minded mobilisation, organisation, and solidarity.","[Baca, Bojan] York Univ, Dept Sociol, 4700 Keele St,2071 Vari Hall, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Baca, B (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Sociol, 4700 Keele St,2071 Vari Hall, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",bojan84@yorku.ca,,"Baca, Bojan/0000-0001-9844-0941",Swedish Institute scholarship,Swedish Institute scholarship,"This essay was written during my research stay at the University of Gothenburg, thanks to a Swedish Institute scholarship.

It begins by addressing the nature of financialisation itself, drawing on a tight definition in order to distinguish the phenomenon of financialisation from its effects and from the looser associations prevalent within much of the literature such as the presence of credit or even simply (more extensive) monetary relations. In order to locate financialisation within economic and social reproduction, of which material culture is a part, close attention is paid to the distinctive forms of financialisation arising from commodification, commodity form and commodity calculation. The differences in the extent to which, and how, these prevail are addressed through the system of provision approach and its framing of material culture through its use of 10 distinctive attributes of such cultures, known as the 10Cs (Constructed, Construed, Conforming, Commodified, Contextual, Contradictory, Closed, Contested, Collective and Chaotic). The analysis is then illustrated by reference to the papers that follow in this volume which demonstrate the diverse ways in which shifting cultures have served to embed financialisation in our daily lives. The first is on the material culture of financialisation itself and this is followed by a number of case studies that include the promotion of financial literacy and financial inclusion, well-being, the media and finally two sector examples are provided on housing and water.","[Bayliss, Kate; Fine, Ben] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, London, England; [Robertson, Mary] Univ Greenwich, PSIRU, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Greenwich,"Bayliss, K (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Econ, London, England.",bf@soas.ac.uk,"Bayliss, Kate/AAR-3329-2021","Bayliss, Kate/0000-0001-9018-5085",project Financialization Economy Society and Sustainable Development (FESSUD) - European Union [266800],project Financialization Economy Society and Sustainable Development (FESSUD) - European Union,"Research for this paper was supported by the project Financialization Economy Society and Sustainable Development (FESSUD), which is funded by the European Union under Framework Programme 7 [contract number 266800].",,71,20,21,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We exploit a novel, rich panel data set, covering bilateral remittances from 103 Italian provinces to seventy-nine developing countries over the period 2005-2011. We find that remittances are negatively correlated with the business cycle in recipient countries and in particular increase in response to adverse exogenous shocks, such as large terms-of-trade declines. This effect is stronger where the migrant communities have a larger share of newly arrived migrants. Finally, we show that recipient-country financial development is negatively associated with remittances, suggesting that remittances help alleviate credit constraints.","[Bettin, Giulia] Univ Politecn Marche, Econ, Ancona, Italy; [Presbitero, Andrea F.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Spatafora, Nikola L.] World Bank, East Asia & Pacific, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Marche Polytechnic University; International Monetary Fund; The World Bank,"Spatafora, NL (通讯作者)，World Bank, East Asia & Pacific, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",g.bettin@univpm.it; apresbitero@imf.org; nspatafora@worldbank.org,"BETTIN, GIULIA/AAF-4345-2021; Hadri, Valdet/AAE-5457-2021","BETTIN, GIULIA/0000-0001-6711-0253; Presbitero, Andrea/0000-0003-4622-941X",U.K. Department for International Development [60925],U.K. Department for International Development,"We thank Giacomo Oddo, Roberto Tedeschi, and Simonetta Zappa at the Bank of Italy for clarifications on the remittances dataset.

More recently, the revival of Alvin Hansen's 1939 secular stagnation hypothesis by Lawrence Summers and others has brought to the fore the notion of a negative natural rate of interest, in the sense that there is no positive rate of interest able to equilibrate saving and investment at full-employment income. The present paper shows that the notion of a negative natural rate of interest may be found in Wicksell under different guises. It also examines in what extent the idea of secular stagnation is compatible with his original theoretical framework.","[Boianovsky, Mauro] Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Boianovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",mboianovsky@gmail.com,,,CNPq; Capes,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Capes(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"I would like to thank Hans-Michael Trautwein, Ingo Barens, Geoff Harcourt, Michael Assous, Matheus Paiva, two anonymous referees, and (other) participants at the 14th Nordic History of Economic Thought Meeting (Lund, 25-26 August 2016) and at the seminar series Histoire de la macroeconomie et des theories monetaires (Maison des Sciences Economiques, Paris, 14 October 2016) for helpful comments.

The daily life of every individual contains many moments when easier or harder decisions need to be make. Without making decisions, we cannot live, develop ourselves or make achievements. Many researchers have acknowledged that individuals have habitual tendencies to approach various problems in consistently similar ways, meaning that every individual has a unique approach to decision making. These approaches or decision making tendencies are defined as decision making styles and they represent individual differences among people (decision makers). The purpose of this paper is to explore individual differences and decision making styles among young adults university students. The paper primarily examines the relationship between demographic and psychological characteristics of university students and individual decision making styles. The sample is comprised of 77 Croatian university final year students at the Faculty of Economics at the University of Split. Due to the wide application and confirmed validation of the General Decision - Making Style (GDMS) test, developed by Scott & Bruce (1995), this test is used as the focus of this survey. The results revealed that; females are more intuitive and spontaneous in decision making than males; older students were less prone to use avoidant style in decision making; degree graduate students were more rational in decision making than profesional graduates; students with work experience were more prone to a rational, intuitive and avoidant decision making style; student with external locus of control showed great propensity to avoidant and dependent decision making style; risk prone students showe tendeny toward rational decision making style and those students with higher achievement desire prefered spontaneous decision making style. Considering decision making styles and outcomes of their own decisions, students with a rational style were the most satisfied ones. Following them were students who prefered intuitive and avoidant decision making style, while students characterized by spontaneous style were the least satisfied with the outcomes of their own decisions.

To achieve so, this study designs triple-bound dichotomous choice contingent valuation scenarios, and employs multilevel interval regression to capture possible endogeneity within individuals. The estimated models using data with all three bounds, with the first two bounds, and with any specific single bound mostly gave consistent parameter significances and effect directions. However, the WTP estimated using the single third bound model demonstrated a different pattern from the other models, suggesting possible weariness effects. The analysis results also revealed yea-saying and free-riding effects, implying that respondents tended to say yes if their first two responses were yeses, and say no if their first two responses were noes. The yea-sayers had high income and low frequency in using public transit. On the other hand, the free riders significantly less supported the bus fare reform. Under well control of bound and path effects, WTP estimated by the proposed models was consistent with the WTP estimated with actual mode choice data, implying an anchor effect of current stage-based bus fares on travelers' WTP for future distance-based bus fare scheme. This study suggests that researchers who use DCm to evaluate WTP should investigate internally inconsistent responses caused by psychological and technical factors; DCm provides robust WTP estimates if the survey has been carefully designed with potential bound and path effects well controlled. More importantly, those internally inconsistent responses also provide information that is useful to fare reform. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

All of them fit to the standard of a small open economy, but have quite different exchange rate regimes. We derive long-term zero and sign restrictions on the reactions of underlying macro variables to real and nominal shocks from the stochastic macroeconomic model. For each country a Bayesian structural vector autoregression model with common serial correlations is estimated on quarterly data from the 1998-2015 period for relative GDP, interest rate differential, real exchange rate and relative price level. We use forecast error variance decompositions to identify the importance of individual shocks. Then we compare impulse response functions of relative output in order to discern the differences between floaters and peggers and in this way assess the magnitude of insulating property of flexible exchange rate. Our main finding is that though the empirical evidence is mixed, it lends non-negligible support to the hypothesis that the flexible exchange rate insulates the economy against shocks to a greater extent than the fixed exchange rate regime.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Wroblewska, Justyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl; eowroble@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Wróblewska, Justyna/AAA-8421-2020; Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018","Wróblewska, Justyna/0000-0002-9789-2601; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811",National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2012/07/B/HS4/00723],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Science Centre in Poland (grant no.

Volunteer labor is the village public sector labor force for maintenance, clean-up and renovation of public capital. While also examining the effects on volunteerism of village destruction and trauma, pre-existing social capital, diversity, and aid delivery, we focus on effects of democratization. The tsunami and massive international aid effort prompted the settlement of the insurgency movement in Aceh, which had led to suspension of local elections over the prior twenty or more years. Until 2006, village heads who call volunteer days were effectively selected by village elites, who may highly value the public facilities maintained by volunteer labor. With elections, volunteer days fall under the new regime, with democratically elected village heads calling fewer volunteer days, which may appeal more to the typical villager. Identification comes from pseudo-randomized differential timing of elections.","[Kuncoro, Ari] Univ Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia; [Kuncoro, Ari] LPEM UI, Jalan Salemba 4, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia; [Henderson, J.

Several possible modelling approaches were developed in the past. Chain ladder method is a particularly popular distribution free method, which models development of the cumulative liability through weighted averages of the past development factors. The assumption of this model is that developments of the cumulative claims for each occurrence year are independent. If a trend is identified in occurrence years, predictions are biased. A modification of this method can be applied to relax this assumption. For example, development factors, can be extrapolated to the future by a trend function. Other approaches may be based e.g. on variety of regression specifications. In this contribution, a new approach is presented, which is based on the assumption that number of discrete years until the claim is registered has Poisson distribution. The mean of this distribution is estimated by maximum likelihood method, taking in to account that observations are truncated.

The Taiping Rebellion was a shock that caused groups without a history of shared governance to be relocated to the same region. We use a unique historical dataset of surnames in the Lower Yangzi of China to construct a measure of the cultural distance between migrants and natives (MNCD). We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the MNCD is associated with a decrease of over 0.19 public primary schools per 10,000 persons in the early twentieth century. The results survive various robustness checks and an instrumental variable analysis that exploits the pre-existing cultural distances between the native and the nearby population. Evidence from the timing of when the MNCD takes effect suggests that the primary mechanism runs from migrant-native cultural distance through quality of collective decision-making to modern primary education.","[Hao, Yu] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xue, Melanie Meng] UCLA Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Peking University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Xue, MM (通讯作者)，UCLA Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",maxhao1003@pku.edu.cn; melanie.xue@anderson.ucla.edu,,,"school of economics, Peking university","school of economics, Peking university","We would like to thank editor Debin Ma, the two anonymous referees, and Ying Bai, Zhiwu Chen, Qiang Chen, Gregory Clark, Christian Dippel, Mark Koyama, James Kung, Nan Li, Cong Liu, Kris Mitchener, Jean-Laurent Rosenthal, Tuan Hwee Sng, Romain Wacziarg, Noam Yuchtman and the conference participants at the All-UC Conference on Frontiers in Chinese Economic History, Asian Historical Economics Conference (Seoul), Chinese University of Hong Kong, EHA, Shandong University, Xiamen University and Peking University for their helpful comments and suggestions.

At the same time, connecting with the other markets led, on the one hand, to increasing the complexity of the products by the insurance companies and, on the other hand, to take additional measures of supervision by the competent authorities and institutions in order to ensure the stability and transparency of the insurance market. In parallel with this development, there has also been an increase in the associated risks due to the increasing volatility of financial markets, thus leading to an important increase in the risk management function at the level of the insurance companies. The initiatives implemented in the supervision of insurance companies, both by the authorities involved and by the management of these companies, focused - besides monitoring the liquidity ratios and asset and liability management - and trying to standardize a model Through the adoption of the Solvency I Directive at European level since 1973, replaced by a new model called Solvency II in force on 1 January 2016. Additionally, specific accounting standards and financial reporting have been adopted and applied through the adoption by the European Union of standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Thus, in March 2004, the first financial reporting standard for the insurance sector was issued under the name of IFRS Standard 4 - Insurance Contracts, the reasons for issuing this standard being to bring improvements to the accounting of insurance contracts and to impose on the entities issuing insurance contracts to provide information on these contracts. The adoption of IFRS 4 meant only the beginning of an analysis process to continuously improve accounting standardization, the conclusions being focused on a new standard - IFRS 17, under discussion, scheduled to be issued and published in the course of 2017, with applicability from 2021. The new standard aims to improve the comparability of the reported data and the quality of the resulting financial information.","[Istrate, Costin Andrei] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Istrate, CA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",istrate_costin@yahoo.com,"ISTRATE, Costin Andrei/AAH-6014-2020",,,,,,11,1,2,0,10,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,91,106,,,,,,16,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300007,0

In several of our previous research projects, we focused on the advancement of contemporary theory of social responsibility to the level of social responsibility of marketing messages, which in addition to initial commercial purposes also support the personal development of the recipient of communication. In the presented study, we focus on the analysis of perception of this issue by future creators of adverfacts and marketing experts. From the educational perspective, we identify two core areas of the socially responsible education by means of marketing messages (1) and commercial education by means of adverfacts (2), which we interconnect with the revised Bloom's Taxonomy. The pedagogical and socialization aspect of adverfacts is interconnected with the KESMAK model, whereby the adverfact denotes a situation creating the object of indirect education in the form of creatogenic environment. These theoretical assumptions are confronted with the results of the content analysis of collages made by marketing communication students, which were created on the topic Educational advertising. By mapping out the effects of educational elements in marketing messages, we monitored the impact of existing messages on the reactions and attitudes of the target groups. The results of this research confirm the effectiveness of the initial educational intent in messages only partially. Completing our analysis with the views of authors of these messages provides a more complex view of this issue; streamlines our recommendations for creation of adverfacts emphasizing education and for the elaboration and production of marketing messages with the educational content in commercial sphere.","[Jankova, Gyorgyi; Strbova, Edita] Constantine Philosopher Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Mass Media Commun & Advertisement, Nitra, Slovakia",Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra,"Jankova, G (通讯作者)，Constantine Philosopher Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Mass Media Commun & Advertisement, Nitra, Slovakia.",gjankova@ukf.sk; estrbova@ukf.sk,"Štrbová, Edita/AAH-4955-2020","Jankova, Gyorgyi/0000-0003-1354-7147",project KEGA Socializing and Educational Functions of Marketing Text as a Reflection of Media Culture,project KEGA Socializing and Educational Functions of Marketing Text as a Reflection of Media Culture,The study was supported by the grant and presents partial findings of project KEGA Socializing and Educational Functions of Marketing Text as a Reflection of Media Culture.,,15,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,598,609,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000063,0

Instead, early detection of crisis significantly increases the possibilities of solving the company's financial crisis, saving assets and future development opportunities.

While repression surely played a role in this outcome, choices made by movement leaders during demobilisation should not be overlooked: one part of the movement became radicalised while another made a premature attempt to enter formal politics, thus hindering the movement's later attempt to institutionalise.","[Lasnier, Virginie] McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",McGill University,"Lasnier, V (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",virginie.lasnier@mail.mcgill.ca,,,,,,,114,12,13,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2017,69.0,5,,,,,771,793,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1332166,0.0,,,23,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FB8IO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406382900004,0

It is argued that they contain the foundations of his economic philosophy. Pigou's research on the meaning and content of the good merged into his definition of welfare, and his interest in religion as a subjective experience resurfaced in the subjective framework of his economics. A methodological pragmatism informed his economics as well as his ethics; moreover, the endorsement of interpersonal comparisons of the good in the ethical texts was consistent with Pigou's adoption of utility comparisons in welfare economics. Pigou's philosophical pessimism was reflected in his analysis of the economic evils of society, eventually leading to his advocacy of governmental intervention to foster economic welfare.

Yet, time series of typical lengths contain only limited information about this long-run variation. This paper suggests that long-run sample information can be isolated using a small number of low-frequency trigonometric weighted averages, which in turn can be used to conduct inference about long-run variability and covariability. Because the low-frequency weighted averages have large sample normal distributions, large sample valid inference can often be conducted using familiar small sample normal inference procedures.

The paper suggests an approach which locates youth not as a class in itself, but as being at the epicentre of the growing labour precariat. Youth policy, formulated and disseminated through the structures and hierarchies of global neo-liberal capital via the positive development approach, constructs narratives of youth as a social category which subordinate it to the changing needs of the labour market and disrupt the emergence of broad-based resistance or class consciousness. In Ben Ali's Tunisia, youth policy had the added task of servicing the authoritarian reproduction of the regime, creating tensions and contradictions between the objectives of the various global and local structures and hierarchies of power at play.","[Murphy, Emma C.] Univ Durham, Sch Govt & Int Affairs, Polit Econ, Durham, England",Durham University,"Murphy, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Govt & Int Affairs, Polit Econ, Durham, England.",emma.murphy@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,13,13,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The methods are presented using the case of the Czech Republic and Czech regional Input-Output tables for 2013. Several models used and derived for these purposes are presented within the paper, and their results are subjected to sensitivity analysis with the aid of the CGE model. Regional economic structures are necessary for advanced economic analyses aimed at the regional level, and since they are not published by official statistical agencies, they must be based on academic research. The core of regional structures is derived from both national and regional Input-Output tables and, therefore, they provide a good basis for the use of Input-Output analysis. From the statistical point of view, computational process results in a big square matrix depicting the flows of products allowing the use of dynamic Input-Output models. There can be found several methods for obtaining the flows between the regions and we briely focus on gravity method, optimalization of distance, physical flows and distance betweem the centroids. The results presented within the paper should be useful for economists dealing with regional economic models.","[Safr, Karel; Sixta, Jaroslav] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econ Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Safr, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econ Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",karel.safr@vse.cz; sixta@vse.cz,"Sixta, Jaroslav/J-9828-2014",,"University of Economics, Prague - Internal Grant Agency [28/2017]; Institutional Support for Long Period and Conceptual Development of Research and Science at Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague","University of Economics, Prague - Internal Grant Agency; Institutional Support for Long Period and Conceptual Development of Research and Science at Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague","This paper has been prepared under the support of the project of the University of Economics, Prague - Internal Grant Agency, project No. 28/2017 Regional statistics structures and by Institutional Support for Long Period and Conceptual Development of Research and Science at Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague.",,14,1,1,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",2453-9902,,978-83-7695-693-0,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2017,,,,,,,401,418,,10.15611/amse.2017.20.33,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BP1SD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540714200033,0

Drawing upon constructivist strands of institutionalism, political sociology and industrial economics, this definition is used to build an analytical framework for understanding the political work' which determines the policies of both firms and public regulatory authorities. Specifically, using this politics as values approach', a fundamental tension within capitalism between the values of Freedom, Security and Equality is closely examined. This is tackled by studying conflicts within the definition of these three values during the regulation of specific industries, together with their prioritisation. To illustrate the heuristics of this analytical framework, the case of recent change within the regulation of medicines in France is then developed. Far from simply resulting from a drug scandal', this approach shows that this change was caused firstly by a value-driven conflict within pharmacology and, secondly, by its impacts upon the way administrators, journalists and politicians have reframed the Freedom-Security-Equality value hierarchy.","[Smith, Andy] Sci Po Bordeaux, Ctr Emile Durkheim, 11 Allee Ausone, F-33607 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Smith, A (通讯作者)，Sci Po Bordeaux, Ctr Emile Durkheim, 11 Allee Ausone, F-33607 Pessac, France.",a.smith@sciencespobordeaux.fr,,,French government's Initiative d'excellence (IdEx) programme; University of Bordeaux's project 'Health Determinants and Societies' (HEADS),French government's Initiative d'excellence (IdEx) programme; University of Bordeaux's project 'Health Determinants and Societies' (HEADS),"The research was funded by the French government's Initiative d'excellence (IdEx) programme, and this via the University of Bordeaux's project 'Health Determinants and Societies' (HEADS).",,60,5,5,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The result indicates that user innovation contributes to improving the industry innovation performance and social innovation level.","[Zheng, Tong-Tong; Zhou, Qiong-Jie] Wuhan Donghu Univ, 301 Wenhua Rd, Wuhan 430212, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan Donghu University,"Zhou, QJ (通讯作者)，Wuhan Donghu Univ, 301 Wenhua Rd, Wuhan 430212, Hubei, Peoples R China.",ppllztt@163.com; Katharine7878@163.com,,,Hubei Provincial Collaborative Innovation Centre of Agricultural E-Commerce(under Construction)(Wuhan Donghu university research) [11],Hubei Provincial Collaborative Innovation Centre of Agricultural E-Commerce(under Construction)(Wuhan Donghu university research),This work was supported by the grants from Hubei Provincial Collaborative Innovation Centre of Agricultural E-Commerce(under Construction)(Wuhan Donghu university research [2015] No. 11 Document).,,7,1,1,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-357-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,21.0,,,,,,17,23,,,,,,7,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6JA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426729800004,0

The article is based on a much larger and more comprehensive database than prior studies of depreciation in such properties, and it is based on actual transaction prices rather than appraisal estimates of property or building structure values. The article puts forth an investment perspective on depreciation, which differs from the tax policy perspective that has dominated the previous literature in the United States. From the perspective of the fundamentals of investment performance, depreciation is measured as a fraction of total property value, not just structure value, and it is oriented toward cash flow and market value metrics of investment performance such as internal rate of return and holding period return. Depreciation from this perspective includes all three age-related sources of long-term secular decline in real value: physical, functional and economic obsolescence of the building structure. The analysis based on 107,805 transaction price observations finds an overall average depreciation rate of 1.5%/year, ranging from 1.82%/year for properties with new buildings to 1.12%/year for properties with 50-year-old buildings. Apartment properties depreciate slightly faster than nonresidential commercial properties. Depreciation is caused almost entirely by decline in the property's current real income, only secondarily by increase in the capitalization rate (cap rate creep). Depreciation rates vary considerably across metropolitan areas, with areas characterized by space market supply constraints exhibiting notably less depreciation. This is particularly true when the supply constraints are caused by physical land scarcity as distinct from regulatory constraints. Commercial real estate asset market pricing, as indicated by transaction cap rates, is importantly related to depreciation differences across metro areas.","[Bokhari, Sheharyar; Geltner, David] MIT, Ctr Real Estate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Bokhari, S (通讯作者)，MIT, Ctr Real Estate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dgeltner@mit.edu; sbokhari@mit.edu,,,,,,,20,23,25,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2018,46.0,4,,,,,745,782,,10.1111/1540-6229.12156,0.0,,,38,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,HA1BQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449946800001,0

To do that, this paper proposes an alternative bootstrap Granger causality test, which can capture the contemporaneous correlation of the term error in the Vector Autoregressive Model, based on a seemingly unrelated regression estimator. Using a quarterly data set containing more dynamic changes, this study reinvestigates the relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth. The results show that there exists a long-run relationship between the two variables. Electricity consumption can be treated as an indicator of the functioning of the economy. A strong unidirectional Granger causality is found running from gross domestic product to electricity consumption. However, the causality relationship from electricity consumption to gross domestic product is relatively weak. Thus, electricity consumption is a useful indicator to check the reliability of GDP data, however, caution is required when using electricity consumption to predict future economic activities in China.","[Wang, Jianlin; Li, Hongzhou] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Ind & Business Org, Dalian 116025, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jiajia] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Res Acad Econ & Social Dev, Dalian 116025, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; Dongbei University of Finance & Economics,"Zhao, JJ (通讯作者)，Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Res Acad Econ & Social Dev, Dalian 116025, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",jjzhaodufe@sina.com,"Jiang, Yalin/ITV-2565-2023; wang, jian/GVS-0711-2022","Jiang, Yalin/0009-0003-3726-8828;","Humanities and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education Youth Project of China [16YJCZH155]; China Natural Science Foundation [71203023, 71663021]",Humanities and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education Youth Project of China; China Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are thankful for the support of Humanities and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education Youth Project of China (No. 16YJCZH155), China Natural Science Foundation (Nos. 71203023 and 71663021).",,42,18,18,3,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Despite their widespread use, little is known about the conditions under which peer reviews bear significance in the global fight against corruption. This article seeks to shed light on this by considering the authority that three major, yet hitherto understudied, peer reviews carry: the OECD Working Group on Bribery, the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption, and the Implementation Review Mechanism of the UN Convention against Corruption. Authority is conceptualized as a social relation between the institution carrying authority (the peer review) and the intended audience (mostly states). Drawing upon original survey data and expert interviews, the findings reveal that the three peer reviews have different degrees of authority. The article subsequently explains the observed variation in authority, by looking at the membership sizes and compositions of the peer reviews, their institutional designs, and the types of officials that are involved in the review process.","[Jongen, Hortense] Maastricht Univ, Dept Polit, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Jongen, Hortense] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Global Studies, Gothenburg, Sweden",Maastricht University; University of Gothenburg,"Jongen, H (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Polit, Maastricht, Netherlands.;Jongen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Sch Global Studies, Gothenburg, Sweden.",hortense.jongen@gu.se,,"Jongen, Hortense/0000-0002-4170-9898",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [452-11-016],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This work was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [grant number 452-11-016].,,53,13,15,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It was massive in scale, discrete in timing and exogenous to firms and consumers in the textile industry. Since the MFA quota removal did not affect all textile products at the same time, we are able to use a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the causal effects of the MFA. Using transaction-level data from the Chinese Customs Trade Statistics over the period 2000-06, we find that the MFA removal reduced average export prices by about 25%. This fall was mainly caused by a combination of the entry of new low-price exporters and new low-price products, rather than a fall in prices of existing firm-product combinations. We also find that price reductions are twice as large for heterogeneous than for homogeneous products.","[Bernhofen, Daniel] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Upward, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Upward, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Globalisat & Econ Policy GEP, Nottingham, England; [Wang, Zheng] De Montfort Univ, Fac Business & Law, Leicester, Leics, England",American University; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; De Montfort University,"Bernhofen, D (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,"Wang, Zheng/0000-0001-6276-1831",,,,,19,5,5,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,2983,3000,,10.1111/twec.12581,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200007,0

In this paper, we explore the impact of the legal environment from provisions for mortgage default across U.S. states. To do so, we develop a rigorous framework with microeconomic foundations for financial intermediaries. To be specific, we introduce a housing market and a residential mortgage market in the Diamond and Dybvig framework which emphasizes the role of depository institutions to help depositors manage idiosyncratic liquidity risk. Notably, we think of non-recourse provisions as a legal arrangement to protect risk-averse homeowners from the loss of housing value. While housing demand should be higher in markets where mortgage borrowers have full insurance, lenders also adjust the amount of mortgage credit provided to protect their risk-averse depositors. Thus, a priori, there is not an obvious connection between mortgage recourse provisions and housing prices. To draw further insights into the issue, we proceed to look at empirical evidence on housing prices at the MSA-level using the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Once one controls for regional level unobservables, the evidence suggests that the demand side factors dominate in which prices are higher in non-recourse states, following the prediction from the model that the demand for mortgages would be higher. We next move to obtain more concrete predictions from our theoretical framework with calibration exercises to study the effects of mortgage recourse. Upon calibrating the model to match some stylized evidence on housing market conditions, the theoretical predictions are consistent with the regression analysis. In this manner, our work sheds numerous insights into the implications of the legal landscape regarding mortgage default for housing market activity.","[Reed, Robert R.; LaRue, Amanda] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Ume, Ejindu S.] Miami Univ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Reed, RR (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",rreed@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,39,1,3,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Also it is important for railway administrators to carry passengers safely to their destinations. One of the parameters that cause unsafety transportation is faults in railway transportation. Undergoing safety procedures and developing safety systems require awareness of what is causing unsafe conditions. This can be obtained by learning from the past. Data mining is a tool to extract information from historical data. One of the most common fields of transportation to apply data mining is fault analysis. In the present study the data set of 4-year record of tram faults from a railway transportation company in Turkey was obtained to carry out rule extraction from the occurrence of faults that cause delays in tram services. For this purpose, we used a rough set tool Rosetta as well as Weka for rule extraction. As a result, we obtained meaningful and useful rules, and these rules were interpreted.","[Gurbuz, Feyza] Univ Erciyes, Dept Ind Engn, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey; [Turna, Fatma] Metropolitan Municipal Kayseri, Dept Transportat Planning & Rail Syst, Kayseri, Turkey",Erciyes University,"Gürbüz, F (通讯作者)，Univ Erciyes, Dept Ind Engn, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey.",feyza@erciyes.edu.tr,"Gürbüz, Feyza/AAM-3210-2021",,Research Fund of the Erciyes University [FBY-11-3510],Research Fund of the Erciyes University(Erciyes University),This work was supported by Research Fund of the Erciyes University.

The main aim of the research was to identify the extent to which the revealed travel behavioural outcomes of the study participants are due to personal social constraints or environmental conditions in their residential locations. Specifically, we sought to identify if the greater access to local amenities and public transport services of inner city residents led to an increase in their daily travel activities when compared with their urban peripheral counterparts. The research analysed data from a personal travel survey and one-day travel diary with 502 adults aged between 16 and 65 years in two different deprived areas in Merseyside, North West England. Our analysis is somewhat hampered by the small sample size, but the modelled results suggest that more trips, and longer journey distances do not necessarily imply greater social inclusion. The geographically weighted regression models (GWR) highlighted that the physical location of where people live within the city is more influential on their trip-making patterns than social determinants such as household income, age, gender, and/or employment status. Street connectivity, the level of bus services and neighbourhood safety were all particularly significant for determining spatial variations in the daily trips that were undertaken, with more trips being undertaken where there was a greater density of street nodes, bus stops and where people felt safer at night. This highlights the need for local transport and urban policymakers to carefully consider and target these micro-scale factors when attempting to introduce transport interventions to reduce social exclusion amongst low-income urban populations.","[Lucas, Karen; Philips, Ian] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Mulley, Corinne] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, 378 Abercrombie St, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Ma, Liang] RMIT Univ, Ctr Urban Res Global Urban & Social Studies, Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Leeds; University of Sydney; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Lucas, K (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",k.lucas@leeds.ac.uk,"Mulley, Corinne/ACN-0179-2022; Ma, Liang/L-1363-2016","Ma, Liang/0000-0002-3013-4726; Lucas, Karen/0000-0002-4009-7017",Economic and Social Research Council of the UK; Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies at the University of Sydney; Merseytravel Integrated Transport Authority; ESRC [ES/J00023X/2] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council of the UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies at the University of Sydney; Merseytravel Integrated Transport Authority; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council of the UK and was undertaken in close collaboration with Merseytravel Integrated Transport Authority, who funded the survey component of the project.

We first explore the typical equilibrium mode-choice patterns with exogenous city boundary and population distribution, and then incorporate the residents' mode choice into an urban spatial equilibrium model, in which the residents' household consumption, the residential location choice and the property developers' housing production are also explicitly modeled. Using comparative static analysis, we find that the urban corridor expands with the increase of railway fare if there is no congestion in the bimodal transportation system, but it's not necessarily the case if highway congestion and transit crowding cannot be ignored. We provide numerical evidence to show that the urban corridor possibly shrinks with the increase of railway fare once congestion effects are considered. We also discuss the changes of urban form, utility level of residents and social welfare with different railway fare and subsidy policies. Numerical results show that the distance-based fare policy with low subsidy should be preferred because it can realize the Pareto-improved social welfare and utility level of residents.","[Xu, Shu-Xian; Liu, Tian-Liang; Huang, Hai-Jun] Beihang Univ, MoE Key Lab Complex Syst Anal & Management Decis, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shu-Xian; Liu, Ronghui] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Beihang University; University of Leeds,"Liu, TL (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, MoE Key Lab Complex Syst Anal & Management Decis, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",liutianliang@buaa.edu.cn,"Huang, Hai-Jun/AAP-2269-2020","Huang, Hai-Jun/0000-0002-9001-9172",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771007]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; UK Rail Safety and Standard Board Project [RSSB-T1071]; Royal Academy of Engineering [UK-CIAPP/286]; China Scholarship Council,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); UK Rail Safety and Standard Board Project; Royal Academy of Engineering(Royal Academy of Engineering - UK); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"The research described in this paper was jointly supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71771007), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the UK Rail Safety and Standard Board Project RSSB-T1071 and the Royal Academy of Engineering Newton Fund project UK-CIAPP/286.

Experienced politicians are more likely to reach the EP when they serve vote-seeking and policy-seeking parties while inexperienced politicians are more likely to enter the EP when their parties are opportunity seeking. Overall, I find the role of individual ambition is conditioned by party strategy to determine the institutional composition of the EP, contributing to a growing literature on the strategic use of European elections by national political parties. It suggests that the electoral goals of parties should be examined in order to understand the nature of democratic representation in the European Union.","[Aldrich, Andrea S.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Aldrich, AS (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Polit Sci, POB 20831, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",andrea.aldrich@yale.edu,"Aldrich, Andrea/H-7186-2019","Aldrich, Andrea/0000-0003-4418-254X",,,,,49,3,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This paper examines the economic impact. After briefly discussing some significant EU treaties that serve as the background materials, it presents the key arguments advocated by the leave and remain camps. The economic impact depends critically on the negotiation outcomes. Aside from the debate on the divorce costs, there are numerous issues that must be negotiated, such as immigration, trade in goods, services, agriculture, fisheries and financial regulations. We discuss various scenarios of possible new trade regimes, resulting in different impacts on the UK economy. With each side having its bargaining chips to play, the trade-offs between give and take in the negotiation game are analysed. Considering various strategic options, this paper urges rationality and cooperation, especially weighing both sides' entwined economic interests, in addition to their mutual security, defence, environmental and world concerns. The potential gains and losses in the event where the UK contemplates new trade arrangements with the non-EU countries are analysed in the Appendix.","[Chang, Winston W.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Chang, WW (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Econ, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023","Chang, Winston/0000-0003-2561-8424",Center for European Studies (CEUS); Baldy Center,Center for European Studies (CEUS); Baldy Center,"This paper was presented at the Brexit Roundtable Discussion on 10 April 2017, SUNY at Buffalo, organised by Jean Monnet Chair Deborah Reed-Danahay and co-sponsored by The Center for European Studies (CEUS) and The Baldy Center.

As migration is generally observed from low to high income regions, growth rates of income per worker tend to decrease in regions experiencing net immigration, while lagging regions experience higher speeds of income convergence due to net emigration.

Moreover, for gross disbursements the impact is greatest when LICs are faced with substantial macroeconomic imbalances or large shocks. Results indicate a sharp difference between the responsiveness of multilateral and bilateral donors to programs. While multilateral donors significantly raise their gross and net disbursements to program countries, the aid allocation by bilateral donors, on both a gross and net basis, does not seem to be affected by programs.","[Gunduz, Yasemin Bal] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Crystallin, Masyita] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",International Monetary Fund; The World Bank,"Gündüz, YB (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",ybalgunduz@imf.org,"Gündüz, Yasemin/JCD-9523-2023","Bal Gunduz, Yasemin/0000-0001-8258-2267",,,,,81,1,1,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The growth rate of optimal production technology in the Western region markedly outperformed those in other regions and yet its growth rate of operational efficiency significantly underperformed. We also found that catch-up effects in the Central and Western regions were progressing in terms of operational efficiency and optimal production technology, respectively. The findings suggest that policy makers and practitioners should focus on TFP growth and its components, drawing the attention of star-rated hotels to upgrade their optimal production technology and enhance their operational efficiency as a means of improving TFP and competitiveness.

Economic developers have initiated a great deal of policies to promote clusters and encourage technological advancement. Despite the efforts of previous studies to quantify the cluster innovation relationship, they failed to differentiate two major mechanisms, such as learning (firms improving in clusters) and selection (less innovative firms being forced out of clusters). This study differentiates and quantifies learning and selection using nonparametric estimation and quantile regression. Using employment and establishment data as well as patent data from Maryland from the years 2001 to 2012, this study detects both mechanisms in information technology clusters.

At the same time, firms filing fewer than one patent per year are 40% less likely to survive in clusters than they are in nonclusters.

At the same time, environmental awareness, new regulations for increased fuel efficiency, and the need to diminish greenhouse gas emissions make small vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles more competitive. As a consequence, vehicle characteristics and consumer decisions will change rapidly in the short and medium run. Accounting for the dynamic of the problem is important to correctly forecast green vehicle acceptance and to evaluate eco-friendly policies. This paper proposes a generalized dynamic discrete choice approach that models purchase behavior and forecasts future preferences in a finite time horizon setting. The framework allows one-time purchases, repeated purchases, univariate and multivariate diffusion processes that capture the evolution of vehicle characteristics and dynamics in the market conditions. The models proposed are estimated using stated preference data collected in Maryland. Results show that the formulation with repeated purchases successfully captures changes in the market shares, and that the multivariate diffusion process adopted to model the evolution of fuel prices further improves both model fit and the ability to recover peaks in demand. The estimated coefficients have been applied to test different policy scenarios, including changes in fuel prices, vehicle purchase prices, and improvements of car characteristics. These policies have a high impact on the adoption of electric cars and on their diffusion in the marketplace.","[Liu, Yan; Cirillo, Cinzia] Univ Maryland, 1179 Glenn L Martin Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Cirillo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, 1179 Glenn L Martin Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",ccirillo@umd.edu,,"Cirillo, Cinzia/0000-0002-5167-0413","National Science Foundation [1131535]; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [1131535] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant N. 1131535.

We discuss a parsimonious hedonic model of demand for differentiated products and derive an equilibrium price function that depends on idiosyncratic risk, among other factors. Empirically, we use a nonlinear spatial regression model and identify a potential measure of idiosyncratic risk from sales data of individual residential properties in Ames, Iowa. The results show that, for our disaggregated housing data, there is a significant volatility interdependence among cross-sectional units because of geographical proximity. In our sample, a 1% increase in idiosyncratic risk, ceteris paribus, is associated with a 0.80% increase in average price of residential properties. We find that accounting for spatial autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity increases the evidence that idiosyncratic risk, which is captured by space-varying volatility, reveals important information about average housing prices. We conclude that using a spatial regression model that allows interaction between property prices and volatility yields strong predictive power.","[Simlai, Prodosh] Univ North Dakota, Coll Business & Publ Adm, 293 Centennial Dr, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA; [Simlai, Prodosh] Dept Econ & Finance, 293 Centennial Dr, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Simlai, P (通讯作者)，Univ North Dakota, Coll Business & Publ Adm, 293 Centennial Dr, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.;Simlai, P (通讯作者)，Dept Econ & Finance, 293 Centennial Dr, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",psimlai@business.und.edu,,,,,,,45,8,8,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

These similar characteristics enable peer organizations to benchmark performance once their operational data are normalized for differences in scale of operations. The most commonly used normalization factors for the demand side output are passenger boardings and passenger kilometres. For the supply side output these are vehicle kilometres and vehicle hours. Through twelve years of experience in the International Bus Benchmarking Group (IBBG) a better understanding of differences in service characteristics between 'similar' peers has been achieved, which highlight a challenge for the interpretation of normalized performance. It became clear that relative performance should often not be concluded from performance indicators normalized in a single dimension. Variety between peers in commercial speed, trip length, vehicle planning capacity, vehicle weight and network efficiency result in the need for a bi-dimensional or balanced approach to data normalization. This paper quantifies the variety within these operational characteristics and provides examples of the interpretation bias this may lead to. A framework is provided for use by bus organization management, policymakers and benchmarking practitioners that suggests applicable combinations of denominators for a balanced normalization process, leading to improved understanding of relative performance.","[Trompet, Mark; Anderson, Richard J.; Graham, Daniel J.] Imperial Coll London, Railway & Transport Strategy Ctr, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Skempton Bldg, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of London; University College London; Imperial College London,"Trompet, M (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Railway & Transport Strategy Ctr, Ctr Transport Studies, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Skempton Bldg, London SW7 2AZ, England.",m.trompet@imperial.ac.uk; richard.anderson@imperial.ac.uk; d.j.graham@imperial.ac.uk,"Graham, Daniel/AAA-6157-2021; Trompet, Mark/O-5002-2018","Graham, Daniel/0000-0002-6971-8737; Trompet, Mark/0000-0002-3231-8617",,,,,22,7,7,0,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

A pre-recessionary narrowing of the part-time/full-time gap in job quality appears to have been maintained for the women in higher-level part-time jobs, while part- and full-timers in lower-level jobs suffered the worst effects of the recession, signalling deepening occupational class inequalities among working women.","[Warren, Tracey] Univ Nottingham, Sociol, Nottingham, England; [Lyonette, Clare] Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Nottingham; University of Warwick,"Warren, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Sociol & Social Policy, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",tracey.warren@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Warren, Tracey/0000-0002-1485-4969",,,,,59,32,34,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This administrative tax database provides a unique lense to study firm growth as it allows us to look at the universe of Canadian employer firms and investigate the firm growth distribution across different dimensions. A non-normal, fat-tailed shape for the firm growth distributions holds across years, industries, regions, as well as firm size and age classes. The results show that the distributions of employment growth rates in Canada have more density in both the center and tails than a normal distribution. The evidence paints a picture of firm growth dynamics whereby most firms change very little each year, while a nontrivial amount also markedly grow or decline. A final finding is that young firms, aged four or less, represent a special case with an upwardly skewed distribution and a median growth rate greater than zero.","[Petrunia, Robert] Lakehead Univ, Dept Econ, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Dixon, Jay; Rollin, Anne-Marie] Stat Canada, 100 Tunneys Pasture Driveway, Ottawa, ON K1A 0T6, Canada",Lakehead University; Statistics Canada,"Petrunia, R (通讯作者)，Lakehead Univ, Dept Econ, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",jay.dixon@canada.ca; rpetruni@lakeheadu.ca; anne-marie.rollin@canada.ca,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We do so through a qualitative content analysis of over 200 national parliamentary opinions submitted to the Commission in recent years and interviews with national parliamentary representatives and Commission officials. We demonstrate that national parliaments' engagement with the Commission is not simply a story about venue shopping in which parliaments seek to compensate for their domestic weaknesses. Their activity is driven by a rich repertoire of institutional actions, where parliaments simultaneously act as institutional lobbyists, traditionalists and communicators. They follow three main strategies, including attempts to control their government, influencing EU legislation directly, and engaging in parliamentary branding. Direct parliamentary lobbying of the Commission does not, however, render parliaments' traditional role of controlling their government redundant as it improves domestic scrutiny methods.","[Rasmussen, Mette Buskjaer] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Dionigi, Maja Kluger] Think Tank Europa, Amagertorv 29A, DK-1160 Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Dionigi, MK (通讯作者)，Think Tank Europa, Amagertorv 29A, DK-1160 Copenhagen, Denmark.",mkr@thinkeuropa.dk,,,,,,,26,9,9,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

To this end, we apply Local Indicators of Spatial Association and spatial econometric models. Both techniques enable the visualization of a spatial and temporal overview of the convergence process in tourism employment in Brazil. The main results suggest that the externalities of specialization, urbanization and diversification positively affect the employment growth rate in the tourism sector. Nevertheless, the employment growth rate for tourism in neighbouring municipalities reduces local employment in the same sector, which we interpret as arising from a competitive effect.","[De Santana Ribeiro, Luiz Carlos; De Lima Andrade, Jose Roberto] Univ Fed Sergipe, Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil; [Carneiro Rios Lopes, Thiago Henrique] Univ Salvador, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Goncalves Montenegro, Rosa Livia] Fed Univ Sao Joao del Rey, Sao Joao Del Rei, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sergipe; Universidade Salvador (UNIFACS); Universidad de El Salvador,"Ribeiro, LCD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Sergipe, Econ Dept, Ave Marechal Rondon S-N, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil.",ribeiro.luiz84@gmail.com,"Montenegro, Rosa/X-9067-2019; Ribeiro, Luiz/U-9096-2019","Montenegro, Rosa/0000-0001-8383-5131; Ribeiro, Luiz Carlos/0000-0001-6374-3811",,,,,45,7,8,3,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The influence of the evolutionary frequency on learning performance has occasioned many studies of agent-based computational finance (e.g., Lettau in J Econ Dyn Control 21:1117-1147, 1997. doi:10.1016/S0165-1889(97) 00046-8; Szpiro in Complexity 2(4): 31-39, 1997. doi: 10.1002/ (SICI)1099-0526(199703/04)2: 4<31:: AID-CPLX8> 3.0.CO; 2-3; Cacho and Simmons in Aust J Agric Resour Econ 43(3):305-322, 1999. doi: 10.1111/1467-8489.00081).). Although these studies all suggest that evolving less frequently and, hence, experiencing more realizations help learning, this implication may result from their common stationary assumption. Therefore, we first attempt to approach this issue in a 'dynamically' evolving market in which agents learn to forecast endogenously generated asset prices. Moreover, in these studies' market settings, evolving less frequently also meant having a longer time horizon. However, it is not true in many market settings that are even closer to the real financial markets. The clarification that the evolutionary frequency and the time horizon are two separate notions leaves the effect of the evolutionary frequency on learning even more elusive and worthy of exploration independently. We find that the influence of a trader's evolutionary frequency on his forecasting accuracy depends on all market participants and the resulting price dynamics. In addition, prior studies also commonly assume that traders have identical preferences, which is too strong an assumption to apply to a real market. Considering the heterogeneity of preferences, we find that converging to the rational expectations equilibrium is hardly possible, and we even suggest that agents in a slow-learning market learn frequently. We also apply a series of econometric tests to explain the simulation results.","[Huang, Ya-Chi] Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, 300,Sec 1,Wanshou Rd, Taoyuan 33306, Taiwan; [Tsao, Chueh-Yung] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Ind & Business Management, 259 Wenhua 1st Rd, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan",Chang Gung University,"Huang, YC (通讯作者)，Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, 300,Sec 1,Wanshou Rd, Taoyuan 33306, Taiwan.",estherhyc12@yahoo.com.tw; cytsao@mail.cgu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC. 100-2410-H-262-006],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),The authors are grateful to the respected editor and two anonymous referees for very useful comments.

A time series analysis complements the EEMD investigation and reveals that the low-frequency component contributes more than 49% to food price volatility; notable events or food trade policies are the primary reasons for such changes. The high-frequency component is determined mainly by small events and regular market adjustments for economic growth. In the long term, food prices are determined by an intrinsic trend, triggered by economic development throughout the world.

Nevertheless, a spread between both usually remains. This spread can be persistently positive due to elevated risk in the economy. This paper models that feature by building a DSGE model with a currency board, where the domestic interest rate is endogenously derived as a function of the foreign rate, the external debt position and an exogenous risk premium component. Time variation in the volatility of the risk premium component is then modelled via a Markov-switching component. Estimating the model with Bayesian methods and Estonian data shows that the economy does not react much to shocks to domestic interest rates in quiet times but is much more sensitive during crises, and matches the financial and banking crises, which cannot be captured by the standard DSGE model.","[Blagov, Boris] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Blagov, B (通讯作者)，RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",boris.blagov@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,40,3,3,1,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

On the other hand, although some data protection reforms have been adopted by legislators in response to courts acting as reformers in the post-Snowden context, the EU and US courts' approaches to balancing national security and data protection remain diametrically opposite.

Our analysis is based on a structural vector autoregressive model that includes bank loans and uses sign restrictions to identify monetary policy shocks. Given these identified policy shocks, we quantify the relative importance of different transmission channels via counterfactual analysis. Our results suggest a nontrivial role for the bank-lending channel at the aggregate level, but its importance has been greatly diminished since the early 1980s. Despite the timing, we find no support for a link between this change in the transmission mechanism and the concurrent reduction in output volatility associated with the Great Moderation.

The data indicate that the proportion of females among workers, managers, directors and board members is higher in foreign affiliates than in domestic firms of comparable size operating in the same industry. Foreign affiliates are also more likely to offer flexible working arrangements, telecommuting and childcare subsidies as well as employ foreign workers. These effects are visible almost exclusively in older affiliates. The analysis of foreign acquisitions combining propensity score matching with a difference in differences suggests that increase in the female labour share takes place a few years after the ownership change.

In Korea, to overcome the shortcomings of conventional transportation modes such as buses and subways, the introduction of advanced public transit modes that deliver eco-friendly and cost efficient transport has become a critical issue in public transportation policy. Therefore, when a new town is designed, the adoption of APTM should be seriously considered as part of the municipal public transportation system. As part of efforts to provide basic and evidence-based information for the successful introduction of APTM in Korea, we explored which values an APTM initiative should pursue most extensively and investigated the option of APTM to best meet those values, considering the urban type in which the APTM will be operated. In this study, the decision criteria for evaluating the competitiveness of each APTM were suggested, and a hierarchical structure for the decision-making process was developed. Subsequently, dividing the types of new towns into the Metropolis type and the Small & medium-scale city type, relative weights of decision criteria are derived using MCDA, and the competitiveness of each APTM alternative is quantified in order to prioritize each mode for the type of city where the APTM will be introduced.","[Lee, Deok-Joo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, DJ (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",leedj@snu.ac.kr,,,"Korea Railroad Research Institute; Research Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [NRF-2017R1A2B2005894]","Korea Railroad Research Institute(Korea Railroad Corporation (KORAIL)); Research Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by Korea Railroad Research Institute in part.

With this in mind, we formalize and apply a class of bounded-variation assumptions that flexibly restrict the degree to which outcomes may vary across time and space. Using these assumptions, we present empirical analysis of the effect of RTC laws on violent and property crimes in Virginia, Maryland, and Illinois. Imposing specific assumptions that we believe worthy of consideration, we find that RTC laws increase some crimes, decrease other crimes, and have effects that vary over time for others.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Pepper, John V.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",Northwestern University; University of Virginia,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,,,,,25,52,65,1,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Heterogeneity in PTAs is accounted for through a provision count index derived from data provided in a recent World Bank study. PTA formation now involves two separate, sequential decisionsfirst, whether two trading partners should form a PTA, and second, if they do, how broad that agreement should be. We find our explanatory variables are significant for both decisions, but often have opposing effects on each. Using matched PTA and non-PTA groups of country pairs, we estimate a dose-response function which indicates that arrangements with few provisions and arrangements with many provisions do not appear to have a significant impact on goods trade flows between their members. PTAs in an intermediate range are shown to have a significant positive effect. We then relate these outcomes to the actual content of the PTAs using the concept of provision intensity.","[Falvey, Rod] Bond Univ, Bond Business Sch, Robina, Qld, Australia; [Foster-McGregor, Neil] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands",Bond University; Maastricht University,"Falvey, R (通讯作者)，Bond Univ, Bond Business Sch, Robina, Qld, Australia.",,"Falvey, Rodney/F-6944-2013",,,,,,20,4,5,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2018,41.0,4,,,SI,,1088,1110,,10.1111/twec.12618,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GC9JM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430113300008,0

But decentralized systems face several challenges (economic feasibility, public acceptance) that need to be better understood. The city of Bengaluru in India provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate such systems. In 2004, in an effort to curb the alarming levels of pollution in its water bodies due to untreated sewage disposal, the environmental regulatory agency mandated apartment complexes above a certain size to install STPs and reuse 100% of their wastewater, resulting in the installation of more than 2200 on-site STPs till date. This study attempts to analyze the factors influencing the extent of treatment and reuse in such systems, through structured surveys of residential associations, STP experts and government officials. The results are analyzed using a framework that integrates the technology adoption literature with the monitoring and enforcement literature. The study indicates that, while no apartment complex is able to reuse 100% of its treated water, there exists significant variation across apartment complexes in the level of treatment and reuse (from partial to poor) due to a complex mix of economies of scale, the price of fresh water, the level of enforcement and awareness, and technological choices made under information asymmetry. Only apartments dependent on expensive tanker water supply had clear economic incentives to comply with the order. Yet many large complexes that depended on low-priced utility or borewell supply were partially compliant, owing partly to lower (although positive) costs, higher level of formal enforcement and perhaps greater environmental awareness. On the other hand, the high treatment cost pushed smaller complexes to curtail the operation of their STPs (and the lower levels of enforcement further worsened this), resulting in inadequate treated water quality and consequently low reuse levels. The study recommends relaxing the infeasible 100% reuse criterion, and raising the threshold size above which DWTRU should be mandated so as to reduce the cost burden and increase enforceability. Subsidies towards capital costs and enabling resale of treated water will enable wider adoption. DWTRU is an apparently attractive solution that however, requires judicious policy-making and implementation to succeed.","[Kuttuva, Pradeep; Villalba Mendez, Gara] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, Barcelona, Spain; [Kuttuva, Pradeep] ATREE, Bengaluru, India",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Kuttuva, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, Barcelona, Spain.;Kuttuva, P (通讯作者)，ATREE, Bengaluru, India.",pradeep.kuttuva@gmail.com,"villalba, gara/B-1379-2009","villalba, gara/0000-0001-6392-0902; Lele, Sharachchandra/0000-0001-7037-089X",Erasmus Mundus Scholarship [2013-1961/001-001-EMMC]; IDRC Canada [107086-001]; Royal Norwegian Embassy [IND-3025 12/0050],Erasmus Mundus Scholarship; IDRC Canada(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Royal Norwegian Embassy,"We wish to thank the office-bearers and staff of the Resident Welfare Associations that opened their gates to us and shared their experience and information, and also officials of KSPCB and independent DWTRU experts for their cooperation and inputs.

We also develop a Gibbs sampling approach for posterior inference by using data augmentation and a location-scale mixture representation of the asymmetric Laplace distribution. Bayesian calculations are easily implemented, because all complete conditional densities used in the Gibbs sampler have closed-form expressions. The proposed Gibbs sampler provides the basis for a stepwise re-estimation procedure that ensures non-crossing quantiles.

This paper diverges from this commonly used approach by presenting a more collaborative and unstructured framework to backcasting that allows the experts to have a much greater part in defining the process and the outcomes. The focus is on the evaluation stage that is operationalised by a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) where the experts themselves have the opportunity to discuss, rank and evaluate the policy packages. The spatial context (Andalusia in Spain) is taken as the laboratory, and regional and local policy-makers are engaged in a series of workshops facilitating an open deliberative process, where MCA is combined with face-to-face discussions, and both of them are integrated with transport scenario analysis. This 'collaborative appraisal framework' consists of presenting the methodological process, the identification of sustainability impacts, the ranking of those impacts according to three different policy pathways (lower carbon emissions, technological innovation, and urban compactness), as well as commenting on the feasibility, acceptability and potential barriers of such policy options. The paper ends with comments on the usefulness of open-ended and participatory approaches in transport backcasting studies, in particular the use of MCA in identifying and evaluating transport decisions.","[Soria-Lara, Julio A.] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Transport Terr, Transport Res Ctr TRANSyT, C Prof Aranguren 3, Madrid 28041, Spain; [Soria-Lara, Julio A.; Banister, David] Univ Oxford, Transport Studies Unit, Sch Geog & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; University of Oxford,"Soria-Lara, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Transport Terr, Transport Res Ctr TRANSyT, C Prof Aranguren 3, Madrid 28041, Spain.",julio.soria-lara@upm.es; david.banister@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Soria-Lara, Julio A./P-4672-2018","Soria-Lara, Julio A./0000-0002-2383-6332","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme, Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions (COFUND) [291780]; Ministry of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment of the Junta de Andalucia (Spain); Spanish Government under National R + D Plan [CSO2017-86914-C2-2-P]","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme, Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions (COFUND)(European Union (EU)); Ministry of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment of the Junta de Andalucia (Spain); Spanish Government under National R + D Plan","This paper has been developed in the following research projects: BACK-SCENE: Backcasting Scenarios as collaborative learning process: Involving stakeholders in transport climate policy.

The results show that output reacts mostly positively to an increase in the debt ratio in both financial stress regimes; however, the differences in estimated multipliers across regimes are relatively small. Furthermore, a financial stress shock has a negative effect on output and worsens the fiscal situation.

We measure pricing efficiency at the firm level using variance ratios calculated from quote midpoints in the TAQ database. We find four main results. First, on average, the market is efficient, with variance ratios close to one. However, in any given year, there is considerable cross-sectional variation in variance ratios, suggesting at least some firms are priced inefficiently. Second, higher institutional ownership by active institutional investors is related to better pricing efficiency, while passive ownership does not reduce pricing efficiency. Third, REITs that are included in the S&P 500 and S&P 400 are priced more efficiently than other REITs. For the S&P 500 firms, we find evidence that this was purely driven by sample selection, while for S&P 400 firms, we find evidence that it is inclusion in the index that drives efficiency. Finally, we find evidence that firm investment, analyst coverage and debt capital raising activity can influence pricing efficiency.","[Aguilar, Mike] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Boudry, Walter I.] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Cornell SC Johnson Coll Business, Ithaca, NY USA; [Connolly, Robert A.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, Dept Finance, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; Cornell University; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Aguilar, M (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",maguilar@email.unc.edu; wb242@cornell.edu; robert_connolly@unc.edu,,,,,,,42,15,15,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2018,46.0,1,,,,,251,283,,10.1111/1540-6229.12210,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,FW8OK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425595600007,0

We find that the bank lending channel is especially operative for Islamic banks. Impulse responses for conventional and Islamic banks reveal that Islamic bank depositors' sensitivity to policy rate changes is substantially larger than that of conventional bank depositors. Next to heavily dependence on deposit funding, we consider that inertia in Islamic bank deposit rates impedes these banks to keep those depositors who consider the opportunity cost of monetary policy rates is unbearable. On the lending side, we obtain similar results, implying that tight monetary policy leads to a larger contraction in Islamic bank credits.

Before 2010, Oklahoma had only a couple of earthquakes per year that were strong enough to be felt by residents. Since 2010, seismic activity has increased, bringing potentially damaging quakes several times each year and perceptible quakes every few days. Using repeat-sales and difference-in-differences models, we estimate that prices decline by 3-4 percent after a home has experienced a moderate earthquake measuring 4 or 5 on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale. Prices can decline 9 percent or more after a potentially damaging earthquake with intensity above 6. We also find significant increases in the time-on-market after earthquake exposures. Our findings are consistent with the experience of an earthquake revealing a new disaxnenity and risk that is then capitalized into house values.","[Cheung, Ron] Oberlin Coll, Dept Econ, 10 North Prof St, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA; [Wetherell, Daniel] EIG Serv Inc, 10375 Profess Circle, Reno, NV 89521 USA; [Whitaker, Stephan] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Res Dept, 1455 East Sixth St, Cleveland, OH 44101 USA",University System of Ohio; Oberlin College; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland,"Whitaker, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Res Dept, 1455 East Sixth St, Cleveland, OH 44101 USA.",rcheung@oberlin.edu; danielcwetherell@gmail.com; stephan.whitaker@clev.frb.org,"Cheung, Ron/AAP-2771-2020",,,,,,44,22,28,1,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Owing to conjugate prior assumptions we obtain a very efficient sampler for the regime allocation variable. A new hierarchical prior is introduced to allow for learning over different structural breaks. The model is extended to independent breaks in regression coefficients and the volatility parameters. Two empirical applications show the improvements the model has over benchmarks. In a macro application with seven variables we empirically demonstrate the benefits from moving from a multivariate structural break model to a set of univariate structural break models to account for heterogeneous break patterns across data series.,"[Maheu, John M.] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Maheu, John M.; Song, Yong] RCEA, Rimini, Italy; [Song, Yong] Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",McMaster University; University of Melbourne,"Song, Y (通讯作者)，111 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia.",ysong1@gmail.com,,,SSHRC of Canada,SSHRC of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We are grateful for the many helpful comments from the Editor Herman van Dijk and two anonymous referees.

Much empirical research concerns choice problems in which persons act with partial knowledge of the utilities of the feasible actions. Economists use random expected utility models to analyze such choice problems. A common practice is to specify fully the expectations that persons hold, in which case choice analysis reduces to inference on preferences alone. However, the expectations assumptions made in empirical research rarely have much foundation. To enable more credible research, this paper considers inference when one specifies a set of expectations that decision makers may plausibly hold. I first pose the idea in abstraction and then specialize to binary response with linear utilities, where the analysis is particularly straightforward. I initially assume that decision makers possess unique subjective probability distributions on the states of nature and make choices that maximize expected utility. I later consider the possibility that persons place only partial probabilistic structure on the states of nature and make undominated choices.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",cfmanski@northwestern.edu,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,,,,,20,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2018,84.0,2,,,SI,,205,213,,10.1007/s11238-017-9620-1,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FW8XW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425621300004,0

Since self-employment can aid regional economies, if such a relationship holds at the state level, insurance regulation may bolster state economic development. Yet such regulations may spawn high insurance premiums, which can depress self-employment. This study tested whether state self-employment rates from 2009 to 2011 related positively to states' use of guaranteed issue mandates in the individual and small group markets from 2008 to 2010. These mandates require insurers to offer coverage to all applicants. Self-employment rates are measured as the share of the nonagricultural labor force self-employed, and alternately as the number of individual proprietorships per 1,000 population. Both measures are statistically higher in states that mandate guaranteed issue for groups of one in the small-group market than in states that do not; however, they are insensitive to individual market-guaranteed issue and inversely related to premiums.","[Chattopadhyay, Jacqueline] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Charlotte, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Chattopadhyay, J (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",jchattop@uncc.edu,,,,,,,103,0,0,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

While previous studies use models relying on area-specific unemployment rates to estimate this average effect, this paper employs a model based on area-specific unemployment rates by gender and age group. The rationale for breaking down unemployment rates is that the severity of cyclical upturns and downturns does not only significantly vary across geographical areas, but also across gender and age. The empirical analysis uses microdata from the Italian Multipurpose Household Survey on Everyday Life Issues. The estimates suggest that models employing aggregated and disaggregated unemployment rate measures as a proxy for the business cycle produce similar findings for some health behaviours (such as smoking), whereas different results are obtained for others. While using unemployment rates by gender and age group, fruits and/or vegetables consumption turns out to be procyclical (a 1pp increase in this unemployment rate decreases the probability of consuming at least five daily fruit and/or vegetable servings by 0.0016pp), the opposite effect, though statistically insignificant, is observed once general unemployment rates are used. While both models conclude that physical activity declines during economic downturns, the size of the procyclical effect is much smaller when employing disaggregated rather than aggregated unemployment rates (a 1pp increase in the unemployment rate by gender and age group decreases the probability of doing any physical activity by 0.0017pp).

Second, the structure of employer interest representation has evolved and is fragmented between a small number of large, general employers' organizations, a large majority of sectoral employers' organizations, regional interest representation in the devolved nations, which has become more important, and a new type of employer body, the employer forum, which focuses on corporate social responsibility.

The presented article includes the study of the countries belonging to the so-called old and new (ten countries that joined the EU after 2004) European Union, taking into account such values as: gross wealth, indebtedness and net assets per capita (per adult) as well as the dispersion of these values. The main source of output data was the Global Wealth Databook report prepared by the Credit Suisse Bank A.G. The gross per-capita assets in the audited period (2006-2016) increased in all EU countries by 108.9%, debt by 12.50%, and net assets 8.72%. Analysing the group of new EU countries that we were interested in, they recorded an increase in gross assets by 23.60%, debt by 38.00%, and net assets by 7.00%; and in the case of other EU countries adequately (gross assets - 7,60%, debt by 10.00%, net assets by 7.00%). Although the countries that joined the EU after 2004 recorded a higher increase in gross and net assets per adult in relation to other countries, their position did not improve and they remained in the least prosperous zone during the entire period considered. In the analysed period, in the examined group of 27 countries, the discussed per capita figures of countries from the first quartile (only the countries from the new EU) exceeded the median by 10-15%, while the third quartile countries (only the old EU countries) exceeded the median by several times.

In particular, micro and small business performers have experienced financial constraints over the past years. Despite numerous financial instruments designed in the EU to facilitate access to external financing for enterprises, a popular opinion about financial constraints still prevails, especially as regards micro-enterprises and business start-ups. The study aims to explore the practical aspects of the availability of financial instruments for micro-enterprises in Latvia based on data from banks and JSC Development Finance Institution Altum. In order to clarify, whether financial instruments are available or not, a study was carried out based on two opposing views obtained via two separate surveys: a survey of 147 Latvian entrepreneurs and a survey of 9 financial experts. The study looked at the knowledge of financial instruments in micro-enterprises and the associated awareness on their availability. The survey of entrepreneurs displayed that 75 % of the respondents were not aware of the available financial instruments, while 5 % of the respondents were not willing to apply for external funding. Importantly enough, the survey of experts revealed not only the existing financing constraints for micro-enterprises, but also helped to identify the specific factors that hinder access to finance. Many sources speak about lack of availability or constraints on financing, particularly for start-ups and micro-enterprises. The study shows that the situation is somewhat ambiguous. The lack of availability might be explained through unwillingness of companies to borrow or insufficient awareness of the financial instruments available.","[Beizitere, Ilona] Univ Business Arts & Technol, Riga, Latvia",,"Beizitere, I (通讯作者)，Univ Business Arts & Technol, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,30,41,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500003,0

Our hypothesis is that the benchmarking is a powerful business tool that isn't used enough which can enable companies to measure their own performance to others and to draw conclusions on the direction in which a company's management strategy should go. In this paper, we offered the methodology for drafting a financial benchmarking analysis of a chosen company. In that context, we presented the choice of a relevant sample, data sources used for comparison and we suggested key indicator groups. The purpose of the paper is to establish key measures and the extent used for the comparison of the industry against the accomplishments achieved by our company. After we determine the range for every chosen indicator, as well as the best practices, we want to establish if there is room for improvement in terms of each parameter. By looking at the picture of the industry in its entirety, we distance ourselves from the subjective assessment of our own company's business and we form our opinion according to the position that we take in relation to what is achieved by our competitors on the market. We tested our research by forming benchmarking model of the off set printing industry in the Republic of Croatia, and the subject of observation is the company Radin Print. The choice of a relevant sample was based on the size and primary type of the print. All data was compiled from annual financial statements of chosen companies. The time period of monitoring is 5 years, which should be long enough to monitor the trends of used indicators. The chosen indicators represent only part of key performance indicators and the analysis can be further elaborated in accordance with the methodology presented, depending on the users' needs.","[Belamaric, Ante] Auto Hrvatska Dd, Zagreb, Croatia; [Ledinscak, Goran] Radin Print Doo, Sveta Nedelja, Croatia; [Holik, Zeljko] Minist Publ Adm, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Belamaric, A (通讯作者)，Auto Hrvatska Dd, Zagreb, Croatia.",anbelamaric@gmail.com; goran.ledinscak@radinprint.hr; holik.zeljko@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,523,543,,,,,,21,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300030,0

The essay examines whether user groups (parents) and low-ranking sector employees (teachers) were active in the movement critical of the reform, and how the state responded to the anti-reform movement. The movement consisted of several networks and organisations with no central node. It included teachers, parents and activists from both non-systemic groups and systemic opposition parties. Pressure from below by networks and organisations was combined with pressure from actors situated above in the political system, that is, in the Duma. Since the movement was welfare-oriented rather than fundamentally regime-critical, the Russian authorities tolerated open criticism both from civil society and inside the Duma. Some gains for teachers were won, but the movement's proposed amendments and demands were generally rejected or only introduced in revised form.","[Berg-Nordlie, Mikkel] OsloMet Oslo Metropolitan Univ, NIBR Inst Urban & Reg Res, Dept Int Studies & Migrat, Post Box 4, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Bolshakov, Nikita] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, 20 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa, Moscow 101000, Russia",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Berg-Nordlie, M (通讯作者)，OsloMet Oslo Metropolitan Univ, NIBR Inst Urban & Reg Res, Dept Int Studies & Migrat, Post Box 4, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",mikkel.berg-nordlie@oslomet.no; nbolshakov@hse.ru,"Bolshakov, Nikita/L-8813-2015; Bolshakov, Nikita/AAU-1958-2021","Bolshakov, Nikita/0000-0001-8976-7248",,,,,37,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2018,70.0,4,,,SI,,666,684,,10.1080/09668136.2018.1471450,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,GH8VM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433947000008,0

In the article prices of shares listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange are studied using methods of correlation analysis (various correlation coefficients). Calculated values and results of various statistical tests enable to draw a few conclusions. First of all, it must be noticed that the main scientific hypothesis in case of risk measures like standard deviation ought to be rejected, while e.g. for the omega or Farinelli-Tibiletti ratio we are unable to do it.

Management programs that require the killing of sentient animals to save a species have been the subject of extensive criticism in animal ethicists. In contrast, environmental ethicists who attribute value to species and their conservation normally argue that eradication programs are legitimized if they contribute to saving a species. So far, this moral conflict between animal ethics and species conservation has been insurmountable, although many philosophers have tried to reconcile the two approaches. Palmer argues for a relational approach that addresses the moral status of wild animals. Unlike most classical individualistic views, Palmer bases her claims not solely on the animals' capacities, but also on the relations between animals and humans. The potential of her account regarding this issue will be analysed in the context of the management of alien sentient animals in New Zealand. We will clarify whether her relational approach can be used to minimize the conflict between environmental and animal ethics positions, that is, whether it can offer a way to preserve a species through the protection of individual animals, without attaching intrinsic value to the species itself. This analysis of Palmer's view will make it obvious that, in situations in which the rights of two sentient animals are in conflict, negative rights outweigh positive relation-based rights, resulting in a relapse into a classical animal ethics approach. We will therefore conclude that the potential of the relational approach to minimize the conflict is limited and that it cannot overcome the gap between the diverging values and goals of environmental ethics and animal ethics.","[Kliesspiess, B.; Grimm, H.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Kliesspiess, B (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",1001090@students.vetmeduni.ac.at,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,381,385,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_60,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000060,0

First of all, a multidimensional discriminatory analysis was used to construct prediction models, later replaced by logistic regression. The new challenge in predicting financial development is neural networks representing a more reliable financial forecast compared to mathematical and statistical methods. The neural network, by mimicking the capabilities of human brain neurons, is capable of modeling the course of dependencies between individual indicators and results. A disadvantage of the original prediction models is also the low range of empirical accounting data and the fact that they are focused only on financial data. The introduction of the financial statements registers led to the possibility of free access to full data from the financial statements, which opens the door to new possibilities in scientific research. For the purpose of this paper an annual report of 20 selected companies were tested. The aim of this paper is to accept or reject the claims that non-financial narrative data could be also used for the assessment of the financial position and financial performance of the companies. The results of our sentiment analysis supported the hypothesis that financially distressed companies use a different tone of language in their annual reports compared to financially stable companies. These findings confirmed the relationship between the tone which managers use in constructing annual report narratives, and the financial performance of the company. Therefore, it is advisable to incorporate non-financial data into the forecasting models.","[Kubascikova, Zuzana; Tumpach, Milos; Juhaszova, Zuzana] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Informat, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Dolnozemksa 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Kubascíková, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Informat, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Dolnozemksa 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",zuzana.kubascikova@euba.sk; milos.tumpach@euba.sk; zuzana.juhaszova@euba.sk,"Tumpach, Miloš/ABD-1920-2020; Tumpach, Milos/H-4857-2011; Tumpach, Milos/AAM-8774-2021","Tumpach, Miloš/0000-0003-3389-6803; Tumpach, Milos/0000-0003-3389-6803",Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA) [1/0512/16],Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA)(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This article is an output of the project of the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic and Slovak Academy of Sciences (VEGA) no. 1/0512/16 (2016-2018) Retention and Development of Business Property of Company as a Relevant Tool for Sustainable Development.,,13,1,1,0,4,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,334,340,,,,,,7,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800043,0

R&D-based growth models, however, often presume an infinite patent length. In this paper, finite-length patents are embedded in a non-scale R&D-based growth model, while allowing any patent's effective life to be terminated prematurely, subject to two idiosyncratic hazards from imitation and creative destruction. This gives rise to an autonomous system of mixed-type functional differential equations (FDEs) that had never been encountered in the growth literature. Its dynamics are driven by current, delayed and advanced states. We present a relaxation algorithm to solve these FDEs by solving a sequence of standard boundary value problems for systems of ordinary differential equations. We use this algorithm to simulate a calibrated U.S. economy's transitional dynamics by making discrete changes from the baseline 20 years patent length. We find that if transitional impacts are taken into account, the switch to the long-run optimal patent length can incur a welfare loss, albeit rather small.","[Lin, Hwan C.] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Econ, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Shampine, L.

Housing units are an artifact of the way in which individuals cluster in residential real estate. The most fundamental measure of willingness to pay on the part of consumers and cost of production experienced by producers is interior space. Empirical literature on housing supply in cities has been based on counts of housing units primarily because counts of units are readily available, across time and space. This paper shows how to produce estimates of aggregate square feet of housing. A theory section then demonstrates that measuring supply elasticities using counts of units are biased downward compared to results using interior space. Finally empirical tests confirm the theoretical evidence that housing supply estimates based on counts of units are too small.","[Liu, Yishen] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Monroe Hall 2115 G St NW,Suite 340, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Liu, YS (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Monroe Hall 2115 G St NW,Suite 340, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",yishen@gwmail.gwu.edu,,,,,,,26,5,6,1,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

However, there are many problems in archives management in China, which obviously can't meet the needs of the society. Two main aspects are as follows: one is that the work of archival management is generally not paid enough attention to, the other is the aging of the knowledge structure of the archivists and the lack of the learning spirit. In order to solve these two problems, it is essential to solve the ideological problems of archivists. That is to say, the professional ethics construction of archivists must be strengthened quickly and effectively. Good professional ethics first requires practitioners to love the work and be devoted to it. Therefore, to change the phenomenon that the work of archival management is generally ignored and to fundamentally promote its sound development, the professional ethics of archivists, first of all, should be strengthened, and every archivist should equipped with high sense of responsibility and dedication through the construction of professional ethics. Meanwhile, only with a good professional ethics, practitioners can face the difficulties encountered in the work with a positive attitude, and constantly strengthen their own learning ability. No matter what kind of work one is engaged in, he will always encounter problems that are difficult to solve or deal with in a certain amount of time, and archivists are no exception. However, the more terrible thing is the lack of spirit of study and research rather than the problems, and good professional ethics requires the practitioners to learn and recharge constantly in their work. Therefore, the construction of professional ethics is also an effective guarantee for archivists to improve their personal quality and work level. However, the actual situation is not satisfactory. At present, the professional skills and professional ethics of archivists in China are generally not high, which has become the biggest obstacle to the development of archives in our country. As a consequence, strengthening the construction of professional ethics of archivists is a problem that must be faced and urgently solved.","[Lu, Hongwei] Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Yantai 264005, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong Technology & Business University,"Lu, HW (通讯作者)，Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Yantai 264005, Shandong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-521-4,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2018,182.0,,,,,,277,279,,,,,,3,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BM5RA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465424800062,0

It focuses on how Russia understands power, the way this understanding impacts the ideational and cultural influence that it projects, and how Moscow has applied a range of tools in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. It argues that Russia's power projection cannot be understood without reference to its interactions with the West. The 2014 crisis in Ukraine brought greater consistency to Moscow's approach, which has become more strategic, mixing different elements in pursuit of foreign policy objectives. Still, Moscow remains an anti-revisionist power beyond the Ukrainian case and continues to act as a status quo power in Europe where it has been adapting its strategies to a climate of hostile international relations. Russian soft power is a significant asset that needs to be recognised as a phenomenon in its own right and more clearly distinguished from the direct pursuit of state interests.","[Matveeva, Anna] Kings Coll London, Dept War Studies, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Matveeva, A (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept War Studies, London WC2R 2LS, England.",anna.matveeva@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,127,9,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2018,70.0,5,,,SI,,711,737,,10.1080/09668136.2018.1479735,0.0,,,27,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM0CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437713900003,0

The changes have been all-pervading and have also significantly affected science. While during the Soviet times Latvia was one of the more advanced Soviet republics in terms of quality of academic research, especially in pharmaceuticals, radio-electronics and physics, science had been weakened during the transition period not only due to constant lack of funding, but also lack of continuity in funding that was available. Also, while during the Soviet times a significant part of academic research performed in Latvia was linked to the industry, it had to shift its efforts towards different objectives in the independent Latvia, as links with enterprises were cut Project-based funding with specific criteria, such as quality of academic output had been driving scientific activity towards basic science and away from cooperation with enterprises. However, when Latvia joined the European Union (EU), the policy mix was devised to target indicators like research and development (R&D) expenditures, number of patents, as well as cooperation between science and industry, while not taking into account the context in which this policy mix was supposed to be implemented. In this paper we discuss how this policy mix came into being and what are the results so far.

We assume resources to be indivisible and nonshareable and that agents have responsive preferences over the power set of the resources, but only submit ordinal preferences over single resources to the social planner. Using scoring vectors, these ordinal preferences induce additive utility functions. We then focus on allocation correspondences that maximize utilitarian social welfare, and we use extension principles (from social choice theory, such as the Kelly and the Gardenfors extension) for preferences to study manipulation of allocation correspondences. We characterize strategy-proofness of the utilitarian allocation correspondence: It is Gardenfors/Kelly-strategy-proof if and only if the number of different values in the scoring vector is at most two or the number of occurrences of the greatest value in the scoring vector is larger than half the number of resources.","[Nhan-Tam Nguyen; Baumeister, Dorothea; Rothe, Joerg] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Nguyen, NT (通讯作者)，Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",nguyen@cs.uni-duesseldorf.de; baumeister@cs.uni-duesseldorf.de; rothe@cs.uni-duesseldorf.de,,,"NRW Ministry for Innovation, Science, and Research; DFG [RO 1202/14-1, RO 1202/14-2, RO 1202/15-1]","NRW Ministry for Innovation, Science, and Research; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We thank the anonymous Social Choice and Welfare, IJCAI-2015, and COMSOC-2016 reviewers (of the earlier versions) for helpful comments and Jerome Lang for interesting discussions and feedback on an earlier draft of this paper.

Besides the product quality issues, this research focus also on rules and standards that are imposed by safety and hygiene requirements, highlighting the importance given to these particular topics, which are rich in specifications. Finally, the views of customers regarding the restaurant and food service are examined. In order to achieve this purpose, several research hypotheses were designed, focused on accessing several aspects of consumer satisfaction on a fast food chain. An inquiry was carried in order to examine such views, using the questionnaire technique, from which results has been found that the majority of customers are regular ones, and such loyalty can be measured by the intention to return, which was recorded as high, and occurs regardless of gender, or age group. Overall, it is also suggested that there is satisfaction with the promotions made, together with the services that the restaurant provides, although not necessarily true when such services are not on promotion in this case, prices are higher and the relation quality-price diminishes, hurting customers' perceived satisfaction.","[Pinto, Gabriela] JCS Grp, Lisbon, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Humberto] Univ Aveiro, ESTGA, GOVCOPP, Aveiro, Portugal; [Alves, Sandra Raquel] Polytech Inst Leiria, CIC DIGITAL, Leiria, Portugal; [Veloso, Claudia Miranda] Univ Aveiro, Inst Polytech Braganca, UNIAG, Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Pinto, G (通讯作者)，JCS Grp, Lisbon, Portugal.",gabrielasnpintos@gmail.com; humberto@alumni.dmu.ac.uk; raquel.alves.pt@gmail.com; cmv@ua.pt,"Veloso, Cláudia Miranda/W-4239-2017; Ribeiro, Humberto/AAJ-9053-2020","Veloso, Cláudia Miranda/0000-0001-6612-0580; Ribeiro, Humberto/0000-0003-4747-1048","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy - FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI) [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-008540]; FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy - FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work was financially supported by the research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy (project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-008540), funded by FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI) - and by national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia & a Tecnologia.",,7,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,483,496,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300047,0

The line of descent from Genovesi to Beccaria in pre-Smithian Europe,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF ECONOMIC THOUGHT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Genovesi; Beccaria; Italian enlightenment; civil economy; cameral science,,"The Italian Enlightenment is one of the great intellectual achievements of Europe's siecle des lumieres. Its two branches, the Lombard branch together with the Neapolitan, both cooperate to producing perhaps the greatest overall contribution of Italian culture to the development of a modern European tradition of civil rights and enlightened governance. After the Second World War, there has been an intense flourishing of Italian studies, with a worldwide readership, on the Enlightenment and on the Italian Enlightenment in particular. This has been a response to the emerging need for deeper research on the roots of western culture and on the civic values of our societies so much shattered by the traumatic experiences of a new kind of war savaging our cities especially in Europe. Economic analysis is the core issue of the Italian Enlightenment. The economic discipline - originally called Civil economy in eighteenth century Naples and Cameral science (or Public economy) in Milan - was indeed prominent in the historical experience of the Italian Enlightenment, although the prominence of the discipline is only imperfectly reflected in much of the recent historiography. This paper belongs to a new developing line of research on the Italian Enlightenment rooted in a retrieval of the economic discipline of the time. Italy is the country where the first economic Chairs worldwide were created in Universities during the second half of the eighteenth century. This article presents a comparison and reciprocal integration of the two main schools in Italy, the Milanese and the Neapolitan, through the works and influence of the two incumbents to the respective Chairs, Antonio Genovesi in Naples, from 1754, and Cesare Beccaria in Milan, from 1769. The two Professors turn out to have much in common and in particular a clear economic perspective appears to be at the root of the whole of their literary production. A special attention is given to the Lezioni of Genovesi and the Elementi of Beccaria, reflecting the actual teaching of the two masters in their respective lectures.",,,,,,,,,,,48,6,6,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

One manifestation of this crisis of belief is the increased focus on global imbalances, institutionally reflected in the creation of the Mutual Assessment Process (MAP) at the G20 level and subsequently the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP) at the European Union (EU) level. Comparing both newcomers to international macroeconomic policy coordination, this article analyses four features that shape (and we show, institutionalise) the process of paradigm contestation: presence, position, promotion and plausibility. We argue that although initially the G20's MAP scored higher in terms of presence, position and promotion, it is the EU's MIP, which heralds a more substantial shift in macroeconomic management. Collectively, both indicate the increased prominence of global imbalances as the subject of inter- or supranational management, and a broadening of the notion of necessary or legitimate economic governance.","[Rommerskirchen, Charlotte] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Dept Polit & Int Relat, 18 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Snaith, Holly] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Edinburgh; University of Copenhagen,"Rommerskirchen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Dept Polit & Int Relat, 18 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",charlotte.rommerskirchen@ed.ac.uk,,"Rommerskirchen, Charlotte/0000-0001-7054-5629",,,,,60,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In this scholarship, central banks have been seen as the most promising actors to utilise one of the most synergetic policies, the maintenance of high and stable prices of financial assets. Since the financial crisis of 2007-8, central banks of the developed world have adopted various unconventional monetary policy measures that serve this function. But will these unconventional measures become institutionally legitimate and institutionalised as conventional practice, as suggested necessary by scholars of financialisation? In this paper, we answer to this question by studying the institutional legitimation of the Federal Reserve's Quantiative Easing (QE) programmes. We argue that the QE programmes have been legitimated successfully but with institutional legitimation strategies, which cause institutional pressures that question the potential of QE from becoming a regular policy instrument and practice.","[Ronkainen, Antti] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland; [Sorsa, Ville-Pekka] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Management & Org, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; Hanken School of Economics,"Ronkainen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland.",antti.ronkainen@helsinki.fi,"Sorsa, Ville-Pekka/I-8598-2019","Sorsa, Ville-Pekka/0000-0002-8539-092X; Ronkainen, Antti/0000-0002-4173-1016",,,,,87,11,12,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Building on the argument that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) prefer public skill systems to generate a technically skilled workforce more than large firms do, it puts forward that governments supporting and being supported by SMEs will be more willing to endorse skill certification systems for their distributional consequences. It argues that public skill institutions are embraced to varying degrees based on cost-benefit calculations of domestic elites; and only adopted effectively if they are in concord with key actors' interests. Therefore, this paper contributes to the emerging literature on skill politics in the MICs by examining the dynamics of domestic political coalitions that support or prevent the development of skill institutions based on extensive empirical analysis, and it agrees with the arguments emphasizing the importance of SMEs' presence in political coalitions for skill reforms. Furthermore, it provides important evidence against the arguments on institutional convergence in the age of globalization by showing the varying outcomes of similar external pressures in the MICs.","[Sancak, Merve] Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Sociol, Cambridge, England; [Oezel, Isik D.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Social Sci, Madrid, Spain",University of Cambridge; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Sancak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Sociol, Cambridge, England.",,"Ozel, Isik D./AAB-2474-2019","Ozel, Isik D./0000-0001-6239-1279",Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation (AMEXCID),Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation (AMEXCID),Merve Sancak's research in Mexico was partially funded by the Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation (AMEXCID).,,116,8,9,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The essay uses the case study of Soviet Armenia to explore how nationalist ideas became an accepted part of the official Soviet discourse, in doing so examining the relationship between popular sentiment, the local authorities and the central authorities in Moscow. The case study suggests that the Soviet authorities implemented a much more fluid and flexible nationality policy in the periphery than is usually assumed. It also suggests that the local authorities tried to find a balance between local sentiments and the demands of the central authorities in Moscow.

Keeping fish in accordance with the animal protection laws should be part of a good professional aquaculture practice and is indispensable for ethical, legal and economic reasons. Only a healthy fish growths up adequately. The talk provides and discusses legal aspects of animal protection applied to fish taking the German welfare act and EU regulations as example. First possible indicators for the assessment of well-being will be mentioned. The assessment of fish welfare indicators should be carried out within the frame of daily and regular working routines, e.g. feeding, harvesting, grading or slaughtering. The interpretation of animal welfare in fish is discussed and set into the context of human sensations projected on fish and the debate on consciousness in fish.","[Seibel, H.; Weirup, L.; Schulz, C.] Gesell Marine Aquakultur mbH, Hafentoern 3, D-25761 Buesum, Germany",,"Seibel, H (通讯作者)，Gesell Marine Aquakultur mbH, Hafentoern 3, D-25761 Buesum, Germany.",seibel@gma-buesum.de,,,,,,,20,1,1,1,4,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,439,443,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_69,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000069,0

To attenuate its problems, the EU has delegated regulatory competences to Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), which have been given a right to intervene' in those Member States that put the system at risk. This article expands Majone's typologies of agents and trustees to explain why and how power has been delegated and the resulting consequences. It includes cases of failed delegation and argues that, although Frontex and EASO should operate as trustees - to prevent co-operation from breaking down - they have not been provided with enough autonomy, which exposes them to capture by particular interests. The reforms show that EU agencies are likely to be used as proxies by a group of strong Member States to monitor and intervene in weaker Member States.","[Servent, Ariadna Ripoll] Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Servent, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany.",ariadna.ripoll@uni-bamberg.de,"RIPOLL SERVENT, Ariadna/H-6542-2019","RIPOLL SERVENT, Ariadna/0000-0002-1399-6535",,,,,49,31,31,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Many social movement scholars explain differentialparticipation in terms of micro-structural, biographical, or cognitivefactors. Others rely on rational choice theories of collective actionbased on coordination. Testing competing explanations arecomplicated because the variables included in structural andagency-based models are often the same, although the underlyingcausal mechanisms are different. In this article, I argue that thekey to understanding the role of agency and structure in protestparticipation is to relax strong assumptions about the unified natureof society and consider the multiple paths to participation. Thisapproach suggests that both structural and agency-based causalmechanisms can influence political engagement depending onindividual experiences, identities, and perceptions of events.","[Smyth, Regina] Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Smyth, R (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rsmyth@indiana.edu,,,Social Science Research Council at Indiana University,Social Science Research Council at Indiana University,The data project that underpins this work was funded by the Social Science Research Council at Indiana University.,,52,12,12,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

As well as being a necessary function and part of the public sector, public procurement can also be a generator of economic activities in its own right. If we consider the fact that public procurement makes up 14% of GDP at European Union level (European Commission, 2017a), it is evident that it represents a huge market which is, as a rule, predictable and generates enough advance information for efficient planning and management. It is beyond doubt that public procurement is recognised as a tool that governments use to guide and develop certain sectors within the economic policies that they implement. Also, it is no wonder that a number of strategic goals of the European Union are targeted at strengthening administrative capacities within the public sector that can use public procurement to boost employment, economic growth, investments and to stimulate the development of an economy that is innovative, energy-efficient and socially inclusive in the long run.

Unlike studies that ass'ess state-building vis-a-vis a particular outcome, our research examines what kind of state Russian political elites seek to build, and focuses on symbolic state-building strategies. To capture symbolic state-building in the Putin era, we examine the Pryamaya Liniya broadcasts: annual, high-profile TV broadcasts in which citizens pose questions to the president. We find that a broad range of formal institutions appear to be central to Putin's state-building project, a finding that runs counter to claims that governance is largely deinstitutionalized, informal and personal. We argue that symbolic state-building seeks to reconcile personalism and institutionalism, by conveying a dual image of a state in citizens' everyday lives - emphasizing both formal institutions, while also affirming Putin as the personal guarantor of the state's authority.","[Wengle, Susanne] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Evans, Christine] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Hist, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Wengle, S (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",swengle@nd.edu,,,,,,,74,7,8,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The level of land carrying capacity was approached by the ratio of per capita rice harvested area to the land area to achieve self-sufficiency. The results showed that one sub-district which were characterized as agricultural areas achieved a recovery on class I of land carrying capacity in 2009 to 2012.

One of its key elements is the international shifting of profits, for example, through transfer pricing that big enterprises use to cross-subsidise their subsidiaries, often to avoid taxes. Accounting rules conceal much of the information about transfer pricing, reproducing secrecy and facilitating the use of administered prices. Given the prevalence of administered price setting, a significant amount of international trade cannot be meaningfully analysed as market transactions. This provokes questions about the validity of market assumptions in research on trade in particular and global capitalism more generally. Our specific contribution focuses on the role of the arm's length principle and the significance of cross-subsidisation and other forms of corporate planning in intra-firm trade. Under certain conditions, price planning by private corporations should be analysed as political rule within the economic sphere. Since the politics of the world economy is not merely related to governmental intervention, corporations should also be theorised as potentially political entities. Crossing the disciplinary boundaries between political economy and normative political theory, we suggest that the politicisation of intra-firm trade opens possibilities for creating more effective responses to price administration and for creating more democratic ways of governing the global economy.","[Ylonen, Matti; Teivainen, Teivo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland; [Ylonen, Matti] Aalto Univ, Business Sch, Dept Econ, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; Aalto University,"Ylönen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland.;Ylönen, M (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Business Sch, Dept Econ, Helsinki, Finland.",matti.v.ylonen@gmail.com,"YlÃ¶nen, Matti/Y-4401-2019; Ylonen, Matti/E-3855-2018","Ylonen, Matti/0000-0003-0024-0867",,,,,116,16,18,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Although previous studies provide important insights into individual determinants of bridge employment, there is scant research on the extent to which differences across countries and between genders exist and how these might be explained by economic and societal differences in the pension context. The determinants of participation in bridge employment are investigated among male and female retirees in 16 European countries. Multilevel models are estimated based on data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe project. It was found that where there is high expenditure on pensions there is a lower likelihood of retirees participating in bridge jobs, while strong norms that support working past retirement are positively associated with bridge employment.","[Dingemans, Ellen] Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst NIDI KNA, Groningen, Netherlands; [Henkens, Kene] Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst NIDI KNA, Work & Retirement Dept, Groningen, Netherlands; [van Solinge, Hanna] Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst NIDI KNA, RUG, Groningen, Netherlands; [Dingemans, Ellen; Henkens, Kene; van Solinge, Hanna] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Dingemans, Ellen; Henkens, Kene] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Henkens, Kene] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI-KNAW); Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI-KNAW); Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI-KNAW); University of Groningen; University of Groningen; University of Groningen; University of Amsterdam,"Dingemans, E (通讯作者)，Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst, POB 11650, NL-2502 AR The Hague, Netherlands.",dingemans@nidi.nl,"van solinge, hanna/F-2714-2011","van solinge, hanna/0000-0002-8985-8681",MaGW Research Talent Grant - Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [406-11-029],MaGW Research Talent Grant - Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),This work was supported by MaGW Research Talent Grant (406-11-029) awarded to Kene Henkens and Ellen Dingemans by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).,,54,37,39,1,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We investigate a closer-to-practice case where advertisers do not have an ex-ante known value per click and her bid on a keyword is an outcome of simple cost-cap heuristics on a portfolio of keywords. Using simulations and an experimental setup containing advertisers that have the same upper-cap on cost, we show that the distribution of advertisers' cost per click and bids are emergent in nature. Keywords exhibit ex post heterogeneity in observed valuation even when all advertisers bid under the same cost-cap constraint. We explore the dynamics of the market, such as temporal stability of advertiser's bids, and advertiser's rank based on the click-share along with the distribution of ex post valuation of keywords associated with this closer to practice setup. The results call for a richer understanding of these markets that can incorporate temporal interdependence between auctions of a keyword as well as boundedly rational behavior of advertisers working under imperfect information.","[Gupta, Agam] Indian Inst Management, Management Informat Syst Grp, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India; [Saha, Biswatosh] Indian Inst Management Calcutta, Strateg Management Grp, Kolkata, India; [Sarkar, Uttam K.] Indian Inst Management Calcutta, Management Informat Syst Grp, Kolkata, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Tiruchirappalli; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Calcutta; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Calcutta,"Gupta, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Management Informat Syst Grp, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India.",agamg10@email.iimcal.ac.in,"Saha, Biswatosh/AAR-9276-2020",,,,,,31,2,2,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

We examine the crisis possibility in the five Eastern European nationsthe Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romaniaby performing a comparative analysis with East Asian countries before the 1997 currency crisis. For the analysis, we estimate how much the exchange rate deviates from the estimated equilibrium exchange rate, as well as the synchronicity of currency value towards some of the key currencies by creating market pressure index. The results can be explained in two ways. First, the market pressure in the Eastern Europe after 2012 is smaller than they were in East Asia before 1997. The crisis possibility especially intensifies when more the exchange rate deviates from the equilibrium value. Second, the monetary policy change in the key currency countries does not greatly affect the crisis possibility in Eastern Europe when their local currencies have the strong synchronisation with euro. Therefore, Eastern European countries show strong synchronicity towards the euro, so the crisis possibility may be alleviated if the Eurozone continues its expansionary monetary policy.","[Kim, Jong-Hee] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Jeonju, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University,"Kim, JH (通讯作者)，Chonbuk Natl Univ, Jeonju, South Korea.",,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2017,40.0,12,,,,,2752,2770,,10.1111/twec.12484,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FO8JB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417130900009,0

A simple survey elicitation mechanism allowing for individual heterogeneity in the number of rankings for ranked-ordered data is proposed. Using the proposed ranking mechanism as a data augmentation tool yields higher prediction of ranking choices compared to conventional rankings and best-worst methods. The results provide robust evidence of differences in error variance scale and the structure of the underlying utility preferences across ranking stages, including best-worst rankings. The highest predictive power was achieved with the proposed ranking method using only the best ranked alternative. Including any additional rankings other than the best alternative reduces predictive power. Nevertheless, if more than one ranking is used to model preferences, then better predictions are achieved by using the top two best ranked alternatives as supposed to the exploded best-worst rankings. The results stand as a warning about equating ranking choices to true underlying utility preferences across different ranking elicitation stages or mechanisms without properly testing for symmetry and stability of preferences.","[Palma, Marco A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 2124 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Palma, MA (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 2124 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",mapalma@tamu.edu,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Building on the principal-agent framework, I argue that powerful member states seek dominant positions in IOs' secretariats, in an effort to increase their ability to control them. At the same time, it is often the weakest low-income countries that are the IOs' primary clients. Over-representation of the most powerful states is likely to lead to functional and legitimation problems for the IOs, in particular with regard to the IOs' lack of access to 'soft' information about the countries in which they operate. Using a newly created dataset covering 19 major bodies of the United Nations family, I identify two aggregate patterns in the geographical distribution of their professional staff. First, the most powerful states dominate IOs' secretariats. Second, however, many IOs systematically deviate in their staffing practices from this overall pattern, as well as from the existing rules that formalize it, and relatively over-represent also low-income countries. What results is a curvilinear (U-shaped) pattern where both powerful and very poor states are over-represented in many IOs' professional staff.","[Parizek, Michal] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Polit Studies, Fac Social Sci, U Krize 8, Prague 15800, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Parízek, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Polit Studies, Fac Social Sci, U Krize 8, Prague 15800, Czech Republic.",michal.parizek@fsv.cuni.cz,"Parizek, Michal/K-9015-2017","Parizek, Michal/0000-0003-0117-5999","Czech Science Foundation (GA CR) Grant Member states in the WTO - preferences, compliance, and monitoring [GA15-12533S]","Czech Science Foundation (GA CR) Grant Member states in the WTO - preferences, compliance, and monitoring","This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GA CR) Grant GA15-12533S Member states in the WTO - preferences, compliance, and monitoring.

This model permits estimation of long-run pass-through coefficients while simultaneously accounting for asymmetric adjustments and short-run dynamics. In contrast to empirical frameworks used in previous studies, it also allows testing of commonly made assumptions such as exogeneity of the market rate, making inference more robust. I find that pass-through was complete for all rates before the financial crisis although only after the mid 1990s for the 1 year mortgage rate. Since the end of the 2008-2009 recession, pass-through remains complete in the mortgage market but has significantly declined for deposit rates. Furthermore, many rates adjust asymmetrically but the direction of rigidity differs among rates and time periods.","[Popiel, Michal Ksawery] Queens Univ, Econ, Dunning Hall,Room 209 94 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Popiel, MK (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Econ, Dunning Hall,Room 209 94 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",popielm@econ.queensu.ca,,,,,,,49,1,1,1,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

This effect persists despite controlling for the criminal experience and gang affiliation of the cohort, and is found in settings where youths are unlikely to interact after release.","[Stevenson, Megan] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Stevenson, M (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,,"Stevenson, Megan/0000-0002-3518-8985",,,,,46,33,40,1,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Without shared fiscal resources, financial integration was expected to play a leading role in this respect. This paper documents the failure in fulfilling this expectation: Along with an analysis of the evolution of specialization and risk-sharing, we present evidence supporting the claim that progress in financial integration has not been conducive to income risk-sharing across euro area members, while it might have favoured a specialization split between countries with low-medium and high technology productive structures. As a result, monetary union members face higher income fluctuation risk without enhanced insurance protection. Additionally, evidence suggests a differential impact of the specialization split on sector productivity, contributing to making the monetary union a club of non equals.","[Ballabriga, Fernando; Villegas-Sanchez, Carolina] Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Ave Torreblanca 59, Sam Cugat 08172, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE),"Villegas-Sánchez, C (通讯作者)，Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Ave Torreblanca 59, Sam Cugat 08172, Spain.",carolina.villegas@esade.edu,,,Banco Sahadell; AGAUR - Generalitat de Catalunya,Banco Sahadell; AGAUR - Generalitat de Catalunya(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)Generalitat de Catalunya),The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees and the Editor for useful comments that significantly improved the paper.

This paper investigates the existence of common factors for innovation and ICT at the regional level, considering not only ICT use by households but also that of firms. Using factorial and spatial regression analysis, we find that although ICT use and innovation are mainly explained by different variables, knowledge-intensive services and the percentage of population aged 15-64 are common to all of them. In addition, ICT use by households and ICT use by firms are basically driven by different factors. Government quality is the main factor explaining ICT use at home, while ICT use by firms is mostly driven by employment in knowledge-intensive services. R&D is the main variable explaining innovation. We also find positive spatial effects, which are particularly notable in ICT use by households. The results stress the importance of promoting specialization strategies based on the knowledge economy that may contribute to creating synergies between innovation and ICT use in different environments.","[Billon, Margarita] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Dev Econ, Ciudad Univ Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Marco, Rocio] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Ciudad Univ Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Lera-Lopez, Fernando] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Pamplona 31006, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Marco, R (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Ciudad Univ Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",margarita.billon@uam.es; rocio.marco@uam.es; lera@unavarra.es,"MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/L-3511-2013; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/CAH-0724-2022; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/CAG-4979-2022; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/J-4450-2016; Billon, Margarita/L-2498-2013","MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/0000-0002-9230-9405; Billon, Margarita/0000-0003-4860-9133","Spanish Ministry of Science [ECO2010-21393-C04-03, ECO2013-48496-C4-2-R]",Spanish Ministry of Science(Spanish Government),Margarita Billon and Fernando Lera-Lopez acknowledge the financial support of the Spanish Ministry of Science (ECO2010-21393-C04-03 and ECO2013-48496-C4-2-R).

The substantive rights of economically inactive EU migrant citizens are dependent on the 'export' of social rights from their country of origin to the Member State of destination, in particular during the initial phase of their residence in a new Member State as a jobseeker or a pensioner. This paper demonstrates that EU citizens' social rights are substantively stratified, not only by economic status, but also according to the Member State of origin and destination. Stratified social rights, it is argued, generate unequal opportunities to free movement and eo ipso challenge the very concept of EU citizenship.

We examine the model's predictions empirically using a comprehensive longitudinal firm-level data set from China. Our empirical results are consistent with the theoretical predictions.

Few studies have focused on agency-level factors guiding entry, including seeing sex work as a viable career or professional choice. Analysis of data from interviews with a purposive multi-gender sample (N = 218) reveals the multiple reasons for entry into sex work in Canada.

The proposed model also considers road availability and disruptions. A greedy solution method is developed to cope with the complex nature of vehicle routing problem. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed solution is evaluated by comparison with a designed genetic algorithm on sets of various numerical examples. The model is then applied on the real case study of the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, Australia. Several plausible evacuation scenarios are generated, utilizing the historical data of Black Saturday. The results are analyzed using the frequency approach to determine the optimal evacuation plan. The results show that it would have been possible to evacuate the late evacuees on Black Saturday, even within hard time windows and a maximum population. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We apply Bresnahan and Reiss (J Econom 48(1):57-81, 1991) empirical cooperative game model to estimate household aggregate preference for a dual-earner family, extending their model to identify the individual preferences of husbands and wives by using the share of family chores as an empirical proxy for individual indirect disutilities. Using data from Taiwan, we show that an average household in the sample does not prefer a dual-earner family. The estimates of individual preferences indicate that this aversion comes mainly from the husbands.

This paper employs the Taiwanese panel Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly (SHLSE) to evaluate the impact of losing a spouse on self-assessed health and subjective well-being measured by depression and life satisfaction. Propensity score matching methods are used to generate a hypothetical bereavement date and a weight for the non-bereaved to create a comparable non-bereaved cohort and a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach is used to estimate the impact of spousal bereavement. The results show that spousal bereavement increases depression scale by 1.81 points but this increment decreases by 0.43 points every year after bereavement. It takes approximate 4 years to restore to the level prior to bereavement. We also examine the demographic and socioeconomic differences in the spousal bereavement impact and find that the spousal bereavement impact is greater on the bereaved in the higher income group in terms of self-assessed health and depression. Our results only represent a lower boundary of the possible impact of spousal bereavement on self-assessed health and subjective wellbeing due to data restrictions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our research uses a novel empirical tool - a four-tiered model of conceptual metaphors (Zhabotynska, 2011) to assess how meanings are formed in the construction of EU images in third countries. Using a case-study of Australian and New Zealand elites, the paper contributes to EU foreign policy scholarship through the description of a systematic algorithm for tracing the mapping of emotions' towards the EU from beyond its borders. Metaphors are understood as a cognitive device for translating emotions, but empirical analysis of emotions is nascent in IR studies. Assessing EU external images over time in an empirically-informed and systematic way is a further novel contribution from this body of research.","[Chaban, Natalia; Kelly, Serena] Univ Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Kelly, S (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Natl Ctr Res Europe, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",serena.kelly@canterbury.ac.nz,,,"generosity of the Jean Monnet Life Long Learning Programme [2004-05, 2011-12]",generosity of the Jean Monnet Life Long Learning Programme,The authors wish to thank the generosity of the Jean Monnet Life Long Learning Programme which supported the 2004-05 and 2011-12 projects cited in this article.

It does so through analysing 100 papers sampled from the two leading policy journals in the transportation literature. On applying two different frameworks for understanding policy, the review finds that only 13% of papers consider specific aspects of the policy cycle, that 60% focus on 'tools' for policy, and that two-thirds of papers did not engage with real-world policy examples or policy makers and focussed on quantitative analysis alone. We argue that these findings highlight the persistence of the technical-rational model within the transportation literature. This model, and the numerous traditions and disciplines that have fed into it have an important role to play in developing the transportation evidence base. However, we argue there are important questions of governance; such as context, power, resources and legitimacy, that are largely being ignored in the literature as it stands. The substantial lack of engagement with governance issues and debates means that as a field we are artificially, but more importantly, disproportionately generating a science of applied policy making which is unlikely to be utilised because of the distance between it and the realities on the ground. The paper identifies analytical approaches deployed readily in other fields that could be used to address some of the key deficiencies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines the spatio-temporal relationship between house prices in the twelve provinces of the Netherlands using a recently proposed econometric modelling technique called the Bayesian Graphical Vector Autoregression (BG-VAR). This network approach is suitable for analysing the complex spatial interactions between house prices. It enables a data-driven identification of the most dominant provinces where temporal house price shocks may largely diffuse through the housing market. Using temporal house price volatilities for owner-occupied dwellings from 1995Q1 to 2016Q1, the results show evidence of temporal dependence and house price diffusion patterns in distinct sub periods from different provincial housing sub-markets in the Netherlands. In particular, the results indicate that Noord-Holland was most predominant from 1995Q1 to 2005Q2, while Drenthe became most central in the period 2005Q3-2016Q1.","[Teye, Alfred Larm] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Res Built Environm OTB, Faculty Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, South Holland, Netherlands; [Ahelegbey, Daniel Felix] Boston Univ, Math & Stat Dept, 111 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Delft University of Technology; Boston University,"Teye, AL (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Dept Res Built Environm OTB, Faculty Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, South Holland, Netherlands.",a.l.teye@tudelft.nl,,"Ahelegbey, Daniel Felix/0000-0002-6736-6432",,,,,56,19,19,2,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Toll elasticity has been derived in the existing literature to characterize its effect on travel demand all around the world. However, very few studies have comprehensively analyzed the effect of tolls on freight transportation, which plays an increasingly important role in social and economic activities. To enrich the understanding of freight travel demand, this study conducted a stated preference survey on freight carriers who routinely use toll facilities. A regression model about freight carriers' stated reduction in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on toll roads is then developed. The elasticity value is derived and compared with values in existing literature. Based on the calibrated model, the VMT change in response to hypothetical toll price increases is simulated for New York State. The simulation results reveal important insights that will help policy makers design ideal freight demand management strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These rapid transit services have profoundly impacted mobility habits on medium-long range journeys, and have also brought about social, economic, and environmental changes in the geographical areas involved. HSR has become a successful brand, including not only faster trains, but also a number of other on-board services that increase rail attractiveness (e.g. restaurants, wi-fi connection, free newspapers, cinema, business areas and relaxation lounges). Starting from these considerations, in this research we investigated the conjecture according to which a traveler, in choosing an HSR service to reach a destination (against a traditional rail service, or other competing transport modes), is not only influenced by its original peculiarity as a faster train service, but also takes into account the presence of all the hedonic characteristics of the service. That said, the literature in transportation modeling has yet to analyze the impact of hedonic quality on travelers' behavior by quantifying whether and to what extent it increases their propensity to use HSR services. Aim of this research was twofold: i) to quantify, for the first time in the literature, the hedonic value of an HSR service related to a domestic tourist trip, as compared to more conventional levels of service and attractiveness attributes; ii) investigate the domestic tourist attractiveness of the main Italian cities, evaluating which attributes influence the perception of a city as a domestic tourist destination. The application case study consists in the supply of current rail services (HSR vs. traditional) between the 11 main Italian cities in terms of tourist destination. On the basis of an RP&SP survey, carried out among university students at national scale, a binomial logit model was specified with serial correlation in residuals, estimating whether or not the cities in the panel were perceived as possible destinations for a domestic tourist trips made by train. The estimation results show that city-specific attractiveness attributes (entertainment and restaurant rate; number of sites of interests; crime rate), and level of services variables (e.g. travel time and cost; HSR brand) significantly influence the perception of a city as a possible destination for a domestic tourist trip by train. Furthermore, the average monetary value for the pure preference for the HSR brand (faster trains, high frequency, and on-board services) is about 22 Euros/trip, while the hedonic value relative only to on-board services is about 12 Euros/trip, underlining that the faster train is only one of the perceived attributes of HSR services. Overall, the willingness to pay for an HSR ticket is up to 40% greater than that for a traditional one. Furthermore, tourists are willing to spend 2.2 h more travelling on an HSR train to reach their destinations. The estimation results show that there is also a distance traveled effect; the pure preference for HSR services increases in value from 9 Euros/trip to 13 Euros/trip (+44%) for distances traveled greater than 400 km. If confirmed, these results allow the conclusion to be drawn that the catchment area of cities on HSR networks is larger than that served by traditional rail. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It argues that although this framing has been useful in underscoring important dynamics in the process of decarbonisation, its narrow focus on installed capacity obscures a much broader and more complex process at play. In particular, it overlooks the critical role played by states aggressively investing in R&D and export manufacturing in the renewable energy sector. The paper thus supplements the concept of a green energy race' with that of a green global division of labour', which sees the process of decarbonisation not exclusively as an effort by individual states to install renewables domestically, but rather as a collective and interdependent process by dozens of states, all striving in different ways to promote capital accumulation on their soil. The paper provides an overview of data covering innovation, manufacturing and deployment in the clean energy sector, and offers a theoretical analysis of the trends observed.","[Lachapelle, Erick] Univ Montreal, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [MacNeil, Robert] Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Paterson, Matthew] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Universite de Montreal; University of Sydney; University of Manchester,"MacNeil, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",robert.macneil@sydney.edu.au,"Lachapelle, Erick/AAI-1449-2021",,,,,,65,55,58,4,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This paper constructs a Hausman specification test and one simple equivalent test under a general setting.

In this paper, we assess how adopting these types of assistance programs would change the food insecurity rate in Canada among households with children. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), we first evaluate the causal impact of these programs on food insecurity rates in the US using the Canadian definition of food security. Following other recent evaluations of food assistance programs, we use partial identification methods to address the selection problem that arises because the decision to take up the program is not random. We then combine these estimated impacts for the US with data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) to predict how SNAP and NSLP would impact food insecurity rates in Canada. Partial identification methods are used to address the mixing problem that arises if some eligible Canadian households would participate in SNAP and others would not. The strength of the conclusions depends on the strength of the identifying assumptions. Under the weakest assumptions, we cannot determine whether food insecurity rates would rise or fall. Under our strongest nonparametric assumptions, we find that food insecurity would fall by at least 16% if SNAP were implemented and 11% if NSLP were implemented.","[Gundersen, Craig] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 324 Mumford Hall,1301 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kreider, Brent] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 460C Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Pepper, John] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Monroe Hall,Room 252,237 Monroe Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Tarasuk, Valerie] Univ Toronto, Dept Nutr Sci, 326 Fitzgerald Bldg,150 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Iowa State University; University of Virginia; University of Toronto,"Gundersen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, 324 Mumford Hall,1301 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",cggunder@illinois.edu,,,Programmatic Grant in Health and Health Equity from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [FRN 115208],Programmatic Grant in Health and Health Equity from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"This study was funded by a Programmatic Grant in Health and Health Equity from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (grant no.

This uncertainty can threaten revenue adequacy and challenges both cost of service/rate of return and incentive/performance-based approaches to the remuneration of distribution utilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology to establish allowed utility revenues over a multi-year regulatory period. This method combines several state of the art regulatory tools designed to overcome information asymmetries, manage uncertainty, and align incentives for utilities to cost-effectively integrate distributed energy resources while taking advantage of opportunities to reduce system costs and improve performance. We use a reference network model to simulate a large-scale urban distribution network, demonstrate the practical application of this regulatory method, and illustrate its performance in the face of both benchmark and forecast errors.","[Jenkins, Jesse D.] MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jenkins, Jesse D.] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio J.] Comillas Pontif Univ, Inst Res Technol IIT, Sta Cruz Marcenado 26, Madrid, Spain; [Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio J.] MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Comillas Pontifical University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Jenkins, JD (通讯作者)，MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Jenkins, JD (通讯作者)，MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jessedj@mit.edu,"Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio/ABF-7662-2020","Jenkins, Jesse/0000-0002-9670-7793; Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio/0000-0002-1466-8613",National Science Foundation; MIT Energy Initiative's Utility of the Future Study research consortium,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MIT Energy Initiative's Utility of the Future Study research consortium,"This research was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and funding from the MIT Energy Initiative's Utility of the Future Study research consortium.

In addition to switching water sources, mothers can protect young children from contaminated water by breastfeeding longer. We exploit time series variation in whether children were born before or after a nationwide information campaign and geographic variation in exposure to arsenic. We find that mothers breast-feed children longer in response to the campaign, especially when they have less access to uncontaminated wells, and that infants are more likely to be exclusively breast-fed. We find consistent evidence of lower mortality rates and diarrheal incidence for infants.","[Keskin, Pinar; Shastry, Gauri Kartini] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA; [Willis, Helen] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Wellesley College; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Keskin, P (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA.",,,"Keskin, Pinar/0000-0002-9788-787X",,,,,47,19,21,1,14,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The proposed methodology overcomes the weakness of the conventional Malmquist productivity index, which bears spurious technical change and cannot be applied to unbalanced panel data. To develop the methodology, we integrated the concepts of the sequential production possibility set of Tulkens and Vanden Eeckaut (Eur J Oper Res 80:474-499, 1995) and of the global frontier of Asmild and Tam (J Prod Anal 27:137-148, 2007). The suggested index is applied to analyze unbalanced panel data on electric utilities of Korea and the USA between 2001 and 2010. Using the empirical investigation, we show how the suggested index overcomes the fictitious technical regress phenomenon and can be employed for unbalanced panel data.","[Oh, Yoonhwan; Lee, Jeong-Dong] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Oh, Dong-hyun] Inha Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Inha Ro 100, Incheon 402751, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Inha University,"Oh, DH (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Inha Ro 100, Incheon 402751, South Korea.",oh.donghyun77@gmail.com,"Oh, Yoonhwan/B-5140-2014","Oh, Yoonhwan/0000-0003-4936-7287","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [NRF-2015R1A1A1A05001307]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","The authors are grateful for helpful comments from the participants at the 2014 Asia-Pacific Productivity Conference in Brisbane, Australia on earlier version of this paper.

Non-causal time series methods remain popular tourism forecasting tools due to the accuracy of their forecasting ability and general ease of use. Since tourist arrivals exhibit seasonality, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models are often found to be the most accurate. However, these models assume that the time series is linear. This article compares the baseline seasonal Naive and SARIMA forecasts of a seasonal tourist destination faced with a structural break in the data with alternative non-linear methods, with the aim of determining the accuracy of the various methods. These methods include the unobserved components model, smooth transition autoregressive model and singular spectrum analysis. The results show that the non-linear forecasts outperform the other methods. The linear methods show some superiority in short-term forecasts when there are no structural changes in the time series.","[Saayman, Andrea] North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Botha, Ilse] Univ Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; University of Johannesburg,"Saayman, A (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Private Bag X6001, ZA-2521 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",andrea.saayman@nwu.ac.za,"Saayman, Andrea/A-1603-2018","Saayman, Andrea/0000-0002-9506-8141; Botha, Ilse/0000-0003-3168-1454",National Research Foundation of South Africa [(UID) 85625],National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is based on research supported in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant specific unique reference number (UID) 85625).",,46,17,18,3,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

However, the empirical evidence for the determinants of people's choices to transfer by bicycle as a travel mode remain largely unstudied. This paper investigates this issue, using Beijing and its metro system as a case study. Using a multilevel logistic model, we found that travel distance is the most important influence on rates of cycling for transfer trips between metro stations and home or workplace. There were also socioeconomic influences, with young people being less likely to cycle and more likely to use buses. Middle- and high-income earners were more likely to drive than cycle, while low-income earners were more likely to take the bus. Personal attitudes are also influential those who prefer cheap travel were more likely to cycle. Above results suggest that the increasing city size and urban expansion are great challenges to cycling systems in growing cities. The presence of bicycle-sharing programs, mixed land use, and green parks in metro station areas were associated with greater rates of cycling transfer. In order to promote Bicycle-and-Ride schemes in metro station areas, education initiatives designed to influence behavior should be integrated with investment in bicycle infrastructure.

To illustrate, we construct an investment-based factor model for REITs that consists of a market factor, an investment factor, and a profitability factor. The investment-based model outperforms conventional models in capturing well-known cross-sectional patterns in REIT returns.

Using this logic, we develop a novel approach for handling price endogeneity in land use models. We combine a control function approach with a duration model to identify the impact of prices in influencing land conversion. We find that failure to control for endogeneity results in large differences in elasticities. Specifically, we find an elasticity of 2.06 compared to 0.67 in a model without instrumentation. This difference is significant as it suggests that price-based policies, such as green taxes', are likely more effective in altering development patterns than would be expected from a naive estimation that ignores price endogeneity.

In addition, evidence from national data often does not support the classical assumption of one commodity-one price. This paper introduces a data coherent generalization to the quadratic form of the almost ideal demand system (g-QUAIDS) that incorporates the sources of heterogeneity in the demand function and allows for regional price variation. Aggregation over consumers imposes a linearization to the g-QUAIDS that requires a new set of price indices. The results from an empirical study by using microdata from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of Iran highlight the impact of aggregation bias in relation to the level of aggregation. An investigation of the predictive power of linear versus nonlinear g-QUAIDS in different aggregation levels provides practical recommendations for consumer demand analysis.","[Nia, Arman Bidarbakht] UN, Chiba, Japan",,"Nia, AB (通讯作者)，UN, Chiba, Japan.",bakhtnia@un.org,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The present study evaluates the impacts of network indicators, land use, and road facility on BKT by developing zone-level ridership models. Land use and road facility data were collected for 134 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in the City of Vancouver, Canada. In addition, graph theory was used to obtain bike network indicators for each TAZ, including measures of connectivity, continuity, linearity, slope, and length of the bike network. A full Bayesian approach, accounting for spatial random effects among the TAZs, was used to develop the models. The results suggested that more connected, dense, flat, continuous, recreational, and off-street bike networks yielded higher BKT. Models that accounted for spatial effects were found to have better fit than those that did not incorporate spatial effects, which implies the importance of considering spatial effects while modeling BKT at the aggregate level. The models provide insights about the factors that influence BKT and information about the spatial variability of the bike travel within a city, which can be useful for planning bike networks.

However, the specification of this relationship is not the same as western societies. Thus, this paper investigates the vehicle ownership and usage in three residential neighborhoods of Shiraz, a city in the southwest of Iran and its association to urban form characteristics and development pattern. The data on land use and urban form characteristics were primarily extracted from the existing secondary sources and GIS but in a disaggregated fine-grain method, whereas the data on household characteristics and vehicle ownership were purposefully collected through a household questionnaire survey. A nested logit model (NLM) based on the Discrete Choice Theory (DCT) was then applied to explore the impacts of socio-economic status (SES) and urban form factors on the car ownership choices of households. The results and the associated policy implications can be helpful in defining a strategic framework for community planning and design in order to reduce the level of car ownership and usage.

Three categories of attributes are taken into account including nature, management, and economics. Five model estimations are made using RP, SP, and pooled data, respectively. The random effects negative binomial model is used with the SP data, and the mixed negative binomial model is used with the pooled data. The economic value of each specific park attribute improvement is measured by visitors' marginal willingness to pay that directly addresses the issues of optimal attribute combinations beyond the observed range and scenarios. We survey a sample of the participants on the sites to obtain both revealed and stated behavior data for trips based on a management-relevant park attribute improvement and different park attribute combinations. Recreation demand models are used to derive total consumer surplus. The results indicate that the congestion reduction in the park has a relatively weak effect on the tourist demand, whereas trash reduction and improved seawater visibility appear to have the most important value to the tourists. Furthermore, the estimated consumer surplus at the present park conditions is about US$85 per recreation trip, and this consumer surplus will increase to US$101 as the quality of the park attribute improved. The overall park attribute improvement will increase recreational trip by 1.22 times per person per year from the present condition, and the net increase in consumer surplus reaches to US$205 per participant per year as a result of overall park attribute improvement.","[Wang, Erda; Wei, Jianhua; Zhu, Jiawei] Dalian Univ Technol, Dalian, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,"Wang, ED (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Business Management, 2 Linggong Rd, Dalian 116024, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",edwang@dlut.edu.cn,"chen, gang/JRX-1197-2023","wang, Erda/0000-0003-1856-1378",China National Natural Science Foundation [71271040]; China Ministry of Education [20110041110026],"China National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is funded by China National Natural Science Foundation (Ref.

Given the lack of other viable and consistent desindebtedness alternatives, as well as the concerns with regard to long-term fiscal sustainability, fiscal consolidation emerged as the main option for governments, although the concrete measures implemented varied in both amplitude and content. Against this background, the paper aims to comparatively assess the fiscal consolidation strategies implemented in recent years by the EU countries. In particular, using data reported by the European Commission, we evaluate the incidence and magnitude of fiscal consolidation episodes in the EU countries, in relation to their public debt's dynamics, as well as the composition of fiscal consolidation measures. In this respect, we assess to what extent the fiscal consolidation strategies implemented by the public authorities of the EU Member States focused on reducing public expenditure, increasing budgetary revenue, or a more balanced mix of these alternatives. Given that public debt reduction strategies should be designed so that long-term growth prospects are not affected, the paper also assesses to what extent the potential impact on economic growth has been taken into consideration when deciding the amplitude and composition of fiscal consolidation strategies. Overall, our results emphasize very different approaches of public authorities, although public expenditure (and even public investment) cuts have been common features of many fiscal consolidation strategies, especially in some, more indebted, EU countries.","[Bilan, Irina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Bilan, I (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",irina.bilan@uaic.ro,"Bilan, Irina/R-6316-2016",,,,,,22,2,2,0,2,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,40,52,,,,,,13,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300003,0

Yet, due to the inherent complications of the model, which is traditionally heavily regulated by various legal restrictions, it is the slowest growing of the four most eminent crowdfunding models to gain widespread recognition. Advantages of equity crowdfunding are greater financing options and lower fixed costs as opposed to going public with an IPO, while the biggest disadvantage to investors is the information asymmetry and therefore the danger of a false or fraudulent investment. As the financial regulations for investments went in the direction of increased investor security following the economic crisis of 2007, such development seemingly impaired the development of equity crowdfunding. Today, two opposing visions of crowdfunding development can be seen - regulation camp, seeking to increase the legal restrictions for investments and therefore provide additional security, and liberal camp, seeking to lift the restrictions and therefore improve access to this new innovative source of financing. The clash is nowhere more obvious than in the development of equity crowdfunding. Where direct investments are restricted, new innovative ways to circumvent them were invented. Given the inherent international potential of internet platforms and therefore crowdfunding in general, differentiating legal regulation, especially noticeable on the EU level, prevents the crowdfunding from reaching its full potential. This paper will analyse the advantages and disadvantages of the equity crowdfunding, analyse the regulation on the main crowdfunding markets, gather research data from public sources and conclude that the countries which regulated and allowed investments through the equity crowdfunding model have better chances of successfully funding SME and startup companies through providing alternative financing option of equity crowdfunding.","[Blace, Matija; Grubisic, Anita] Polytech Sibenik, Shibenik, Croatia",,"Blace, M (通讯作者)，Polytech Sibenik, Shibenik, Croatia.",matijablace@gmail.com; anita@vus.hr,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,9,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,443,450,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000045,0

In reviewing the portrayal of the legacy of the 'Hawthorne experiments' (1924 to 1933), it presents two main arguments. First, by building on existing knowledge that the emergence of George Elton Mayo, as the Hawthorne experiments' key spokesman, changed the early focus of the experiments, we argue that he significantly contributed to it, presuming and assuming a 'psychological interpretation', over a 'fact-based' explanatory approach towards work performance. This gained impetus as he founded the Human Relations School (HRS), a predecessor of today's Human Resource Management (HRM). Given that psychology usurped the role originally attributed to framework conditions of work in the Hawthorne studies, our broader argument, grounded on our literature-based analysis of the Hawthorne publication legacy is that the psychology discipline has to date largely failed to adopt the current critical state of evidence towards those experiments, unlike other cognate fields of economics, management, organisational behaviour and sociology.","[Busse, Ronald] FOM Univ Appl Sci, Essen, Germany; [Warner, Malcolm] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Busse, R (通讯作者)，FOM Univ Appl Sci, Essen, Germany.;Warner, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England.",ronaldbusse@gmx.de; m.warner@jbs.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,144,7,13,6,50,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

As a member of the European Union, the Czech Republic was one of the countries that introduced sanctions. These were supposed to affect the economic relations between both economies. We generally recognize three channels by which the sanctions can affect the Czech economy - a decline in exports and outflow of FDI to Russia, a drop in the inflow of investment from Russia and a decrease in number of Russian tourists in the country. It was often argued that the Czech economy depends on exports to Russia, especially exports of mechanical engineering products, which at least partially balanced huge imports of Russian oil and gas. At the same time, there has been supposedly strong inflow of Russian foreign direct investment into the Czech economy, even though the Russian official FDI inflows are declared as negligible. In addition, the Czech Republic has also benefited on a long-term basis from the influx of Russian tourists. Recent political events as well as the decline of the Russian economy may have led to disruption of such economic relations between both countries. For this reason, we aim to provide a complex analysis of the dependence of the Czech economy on the Russian one and the impact of sanctions on mutual relationship. Our analysis will be primarily descriptive, due to nearly total absence of credible data about real Russian investment in the Czech Republic. We found that there was a possible small direct impact of the sanctions on specific Czech exports. Otherwise the impact is highly questionable.","[Coufalova, Lucie; Zidek, Libor] Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Coufalova, L (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic.",174064@mail.muni.cz; 360@mail.muni.cz,"Coufalová, Lucie/ABG-9933-2020; Zidek, Libor/F-2913-2017","Coufalová, Lucie/0000-0001-7602-1981; Zidek, Libor/0000-0002-9099-2095",grant project GA MU Russia in the categories friend-enemy.

Theory and Evidence from OECD Countries,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHY; PANEL; TAXATION; GLOBALIZATION; INTEGRATION; INVESTMENT; LOCATION,"This paper aims at assessing the empirical relevance of new economic geography models of tax competition. We rely on a simple model to specify tax reactions functions, which we estimate with a panel covering (up to) 26 OECD countries over the period 1982 to 2006. We provide striking support for the two main predictions regarding the slope and the constant of the reaction function: national governments seem to adjust their corporate tax rate towards the level chosen in countries that are more populated, and they tend to set higher corporate tax rates when their country enjoys a high real market potential. Through the latter effect, trade integration exerts a positive influence on the level of corporate taxation. However, using a theoretically grounded index of bilateral trade integration, we also show that trade liberalisation gives rise to significant tax interactions in the setting of effective average tax rates in the case of European countries, thus exerting a downward pressure on corporate tax rates.","[Exbrayat, Nelly] Univ Lyon, UJM St Etienne, CNRS, GATE L SE UMR 5824, F-42023 St Etienne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Exbrayat, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, UJM St Etienne, CNRS, GATE L SE UMR 5824, F-42023 St Etienne, France.",,,,German Science Foundation (DFG); French Research Agency (ANR) through the grant 'Competition among Nation States' [KO 1437/9-1],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); French Research Agency (ANR) through the grant 'Competition among Nation States'(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This work was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) and the French Research Agency (ANR) through the grant 'Competition among Nation States' [KO 1437/9-1].,,44,7,7,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2017,40.0,1,,,,,88,115,,10.1111/twec.12405,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EK5CJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393944200005,0

The paper also refers to the assumptions of development economics because the transition in Poland required reconstruction and the creation of new political, economical, organizational and social structures. In the study there were applied analytical methods relating to the gathered empirical data and also analytical methods related to the finances of the public sector. Research methods referred to the theoretical analysis of literature and empirical analysis of the relations between phenomena occurring in the real economy and in the public sector. Preliminary studies showed that it was not possible to conduct economic policies and maximize tax revenue, particularly by escalating tax burden. Budgetary economy should therefore be conducted according to the principles of rationality and efficiency of resource use. The maximizing of the budgetary revenues of these units in the public sector must lead to negative phenomena, and in particular to increasing of the range of the shadow economy.","[Jarosinski, Krzysztof] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Reg & Spatial Dev, Unit Management Publ Sect, 41 Wisniowa St, PL-02520 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Jarosinski, K (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Reg & Spatial Dev, Unit Management Publ Sect, 41 Wisniowa St, PL-02520 Warsaw, Poland.",kjarosi@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,264,273,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300027,0

Some other measures of income inequality have been constructed using differences (or ratios) between population and income quantiles. The concentration curve and corresponding synthetic concentration coefficient proposed by Zenga, are also defined in terms of quantiles. In the paper, selected inequality measures based on deciles and quintiles are considered. The main objective was to compare statistical properties of different estimation methods for quantiles, including Bernstein and Huang Brill estimators, with the classical quantile estimator based on a relevant order statistic. Several Monte Carlo experiments have been conducted to assess biases and mean squared errors of quantile estimators for different sample sizes under the lognormal or Dagum distributions assumed as a population model.

High-skilled migration results from the combination of workers whose abilities are private knowledge, and a production technology that gives incentives to firms for hiring workers of similar ability. In the presence of migration cost, high-skilled workers self-select into the group of migrants. The laissez-faire equilibrium features too much migration, explained by a negative migration externality. We also show that for sufficiently low levels of migration cost the optimal level of migration, while smaller than in the laissez-faire equilibrium, is strictly positive.

It shows that the period of contention accompanying the 2011-2012 elections allowed competing narratives of this concept to emerge. First, the opposition presented it as a means for citizens to hold corrupt authorities accountable to the law; second, the Kremlin promoted it as a means to enhance government efficiency. The article shows that the Kremlin has co-opted the counter-hegemonic discourse into a new law which delimits the possibilities for enacting this concept in a fashion that recalls Soviet governance practices.","[Owen, Catherine] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Cent Asian Studies, Xian, Peoples R China; [Owen, Catherine] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Amory Bldg,Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",Shaanxi Normal University; University of Exeter,"Owen, C (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Normal Univ, Cent Asian Studies, Xian, Peoples R China.;Owen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Amory Bldg,Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",C.A.M.Owen@exeter.ac.uk,,"Owen, Catherine/0000-0003-4520-777X",,,,,53,6,7,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2017,69.0,3,,,,,379,400,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1301882,0.0,,,22,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,EW6JD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402615300001,0

REDD+is a proposed performance-based mechanism in which developed country donors, corporations, non-governmental organizations, and individuals will compensate developing countries for forest emissions reductions. This leads to new carbon economy-the emerging trade in carbon emissions, along with the series of market-based policy instruments designed to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the creation of markets for carbon. Southeast Asia hosts a number of early REDD+ type projects. However, there have been distinctive differences between countries that have been successful in implementing REDD+. Potraying on frameworks of national culture, this article is exploring the applicability of REDD+ in the developing country of Malaysia which has been cited amongst the highest globally in growth of greenhouse gases (GHG), but the involvement in REDD+ project is so limited compared to Indonesia which is leading in REDD+ implementation. Using Hofstede's construct of national culture, social units in Malaysia and Indonesia are investigated where REDD+ is proposed as a culturally dependent strategy. It is recommended that the successful implementation of REDD+ as new carbon economy demands compliance between the strategies that are adopted and the country's cultural characteristics. This study argues that the ability of the new carbon economy to provide real benefits for sustainable development may ultimately be obstructed by the nature of the society itself.","[Rajiani, Ismi] Univ Lambung Mangkurat, Jl Brigjen Haji Hasan Basri, Kayu Tangi 70123, Banjarmasin, Indonesia; [Yunus, Ahmad Rozelan] Univ Tekn Malaysia Melaka, Hang Tuah Jaya Durian Tu 76100, Melaka, Malaysia; [Prastyorini, Juli; Kalangi, Meyti Hanna Esther] Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Adm Kepelabuhanan Barunawati, Jl Perak Barat 173, Surabaya 60177, Indonesia",Universitas Lambung Mangkurat; University Teknikal Malaysia Melaka,"Rajiani, I (通讯作者)，Univ Lambung Mangkurat, Jl Brigjen Haji Hasan Basri, Kayu Tangi 70123, Banjarmasin, Indonesia.",rajiani@unlam.ac.id; rozelan@utem.edu.my; juliprastyorini@gmail.com; meyti.hana@gmail.com,"Rajiani, Ismi/L-9195-2019; Yunus, Ahmad Rozelan/P-8796-2019","Rajiani, Ismi/0000-0002-4316-0501; Yunus, Ahmad Rozelan/0000-0001-8637-9231",,,,,39,0,0,1,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,147,155,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000016,0

We find that neither a concern for security as would be expected from a realist perspective) nor the institutionalization of a norm of cohesion which would be the constructivist expectation) triggered the collective response. Instead, agreement was established due to concurrence over a fundamental breach of the Ukrainians' right to self-determination.

This is the initiative of 12 European Union's members from Central and Eastern Europe. On the one hand, it is an attempt to strengthen this part of the EU which, due to its recent history, is an area of insufficient (quantitatively and qualitatively) transport, energy and communication infrastructure. On the other hand, creation of an alliance within the EU by the least developed countries (Austria is an exception) is a source of doubts raised by economists and politicians about legitimacy of creating new, special relations between the listed EU's members. The paper analyzes the material obtained during literature studies. Based on desk research, the most important premises and objectives of the Three Seas Initiative are presented. For the purpose of analyzing socio-economic development, the socio-economic development indicator (SEDI), presented in the literature, was adapted. This indicator was used to assess changes in the economies in three chosen years. The variables selected for SEDI estimation for different countries concern those areas of the state, which are particularly important for implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy. The level of socio-economic development of the Central and Eastern Europe's countries (EU's members since 2004, 2009 or 2013) is significantly different from the level of development of Austria and the average level of the entire EU economy. The lack of a stable basis of the economy in these countries was manifested by the rapid and definitively negative reaction of SEDI (in 2009) and the improvement of the economic situation did not bring about spectacular changes in the SEDI value (in 2013). The design of the SEDI indicator and the analysis of its value allowed initial assessment of the socio-economic development potential of the new EU states forming the Three Seas Initiative. On the basis of changes in this indicator, it can be concluded that there is no sigma convergence or absolute beta convergence between these countries. Yet, some symptoms of conditional beta convergence can be observed.","[Skrzeszewska, Katarzyna; Kizielewicz, Joanna] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Skrzeszewska, K (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",k.skrzeszewska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; j.kizielewicz@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Kizielewicz, Joanna/K-5784-2019","Kizielewicz, Joanna/0000-0001-7415-9928",,,,,12,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,138,145,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300015,0

An increasingly number of cases concerning the VAT are finally presented to EUCJ; some of them raised the question of the legality of exercising fiscal rights when the supporting documents do not contain all the elements provided by tax and accounting legal framework. Analysing this jurisprudence, the paper points out that the court in Luxembourg focuses primarily on ensuring the prevalence of substance over form in fiscal case law. The general rule of prevalence of form over the substance is reversed, stressing the domestic courts and the national administrative authorities.

With this model, we identify the different effects of the capital constraint on the operations of the supply chain and the corresponding profitability in two different (production) technological settings where the marginal cost is constant and increasing respectively. The results show that (1) in the case of a constant marginal cost, the unconstrained retailer's operations and its profitability are independent of the constrained retailer's working capital, while in the case of an increasing marginal cost, the constrained retailer's working capital have a negative impact on the unconstrained retailer's ordering quantity and profitability; (2) the impact of an change in such working capital on the constrained retailer's operations and profitability is regardless to the feature of the marginal cost; (3) in both setting, the supplier and the constrained retailer benefit from an increase in the constrained retailer's operational capital;(4) in the case of an increasing marginal cost, this produces a conflict between the constrained and the unconstrained channels.

In this sense, the Local Administrations Programs providing education in the state and foundation universities and vocational schools of Turkey which provide vocational and technical training and education in local administrations have been analyzed in this study. The purpose of this study is to determine the current situation of vocational education implemented in local administrations field of Turkey and present the quality of education provided to individuals who will be working in this field becoming increasingly important today with its advantages and problems. In this study, the program profile of local administrations programs, structure of academic members, number of students and curriculums has been established by scanning web pages of all universities providing this education. In the analysis, it is seen that the number of Local Administrations Programs has been increasing parallel to new regulations for local administrations in Turkey, while this rise is not proportionally high as the rising number of vocational schools. Furthermore, competences of these programs theoretically vary based on the conditions provided by universities and cause students to be educated at different levels. In addition to this, another finding of this study is the deficiency of practical training which is an important requirement of vocational training.","[Yucebas, Elif; Arap, Sultan Kavili] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Alsancak, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Yucebas, E (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Alsancak, Turkey.",elif.yucebas@deu.edu.tr; sultan.arap@deu.edu.tr,"Yücebaş, Elif/A-4236-2018",,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,433,440,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300043,0

It draws on theories of intersectionality and colour/cultural racism to argue that the labour market experience of British-Muslim women is multiply determined via criteria of ascription such as ethnicity, migration status, race and religion rather than criteria of achievement. The study uses data from the Labour Force Survey (2002-2013) with a large sample (N=245,391) of women aged 19-65 years. The overarching finding suggests that most Muslim women, regardless of their multiple ascriptive identities, generation and levels of qualifications, still face significant penalties compared with their White-British Christian counterparts. The penalties for some groups, such as Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Black-Muslim women, are harsher than for Indian and White-Muslim women, demonstrating how different social markers and multiple identities have contingent relationships to multiple determinants and outcomes.","[Khattab, Nabil] Doha Inst Grad Studies, Doha, Qatar; [Khattab, Nabil] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Hussein, Shereen] Kings Coll London, London, England",Doha Institute for Graduate Studies; University of Bristol; University of London; King's College London,"Khattab, N (通讯作者)，Doha Inst Grad Studies, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Al Tarfa St,Zone 70, Doha, Qatar.",nabil.khattab@bristol.ac.uk,"Hussein, Shereen/AAZ-7837-2021","Hussein, Shereen/0000-0002-7946-0717",,,,,51,29,31,1,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In order to achieve the optimal solutions, a normal constraint method is used to formulate a mathematical model to meet two objectives: low carbon emissions and low cost.

The government implemented the increasing block tariffs for residential natural gas to settle this issue. However, the relevant researches are still very limited. In this paper, we apply the price-gap approach and welfare evaluation methods to analyze the subsidies and increasing block tariffs for residential natural gas in Henan province in 2013 and find that the subsidies mainly benefited the high-income group, as they accounted for only 20% of the total population but received 32.36% of the total subsidies. The low-income group accounted for 20% of the total population, but obtained only 11.95% of the total subsidies. Residential natural gas subsidies lack fairness and efficiency, which mainly resulted in the excessive gas volume in the first block in Henan province. In addition, we design some schemes of increasing block tariffs for residential natural gas and find that more blocks and larger gap of gas price among different blocks can optimize the subsidy redistribution and improve its fairness and efficiency. The local governments should design proper volume in the first block, enlarge gap of gas price when implementing the increasing block tariffs; they should also enhance the awareness on energy conservation among the high income group.","[Liu, Chang; Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",liuchang1990s@126.com; bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; China National Social Science Fund [15ZD058],Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; China National Social Science Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No. 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No. 1260-Y07200) and China National Social Science Fund (No. 15ZD058).",,22,2,2,2,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

From this perspective, unwaged-work is condemned for not being sufficiently productive; that is, for failing to lift incomes above a poverty threshold. However, insights from the sociology of work reveal a range of unwaged activities that are potentially highly productive in their contribution to self-reliance. The article explores whether these activities are undermined by the promotion of inclusiveness. The case study takes place in Tigray, Ethiopia. Through semi-structured interviews, the activities of different households were classified according to a typology of work based on the work of Gorz, Illich, Wheelock, Taylor, Williams and others.

The focus is on the Nordic region. A survey with stakeholders involved with electric bus demonstration projects is performed for understanding the benefits and drawbacks of each solution, and identifying the main themes emerging from project implementation and upscaling. Advantages of the conductive charging include the maturity of the technology and its higher maximum charging power compared to currently available inductive alternatives. On the other hand, inductive technology entails other benefits, such as the lack of moving parts which could reduce the maintenance costs for infrastructure, as well as minimal visibility of the equipment. The main issues likely to impact the upscaling of electric bus use are related to the maturity, cost-effectiveness, compatibility, and charging efficiency of the available technologies.","[Xylia, Maria; Silveira, Semida] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Energy & Climate Studies Unit, Stockholm, Sweden; [Xylia, Maria] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Integrated Transport Res Lab, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology,"Xylia, M (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Energy & Climate Studies Unit, Stockholm, Sweden.",maria.xylia@energy.kth.se,; /G-4830-2015,"Xylia, Maria/0000-0003-2896-8841; /0000-0001-7123-1824",Swedish Energy Agency [39254-1],Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency),"The research for this paper was financed by the Swedish Energy Agency under the project Wireless Bus Stop Charging (project number 39254-1), which is a collaboration project between KTH, Scania, the Stockholm City Council (SLL), the municipality of Soddertalje and Vattenfall.

The results show that assistant professors subject to the tenure system tend to grade more leniently and fail fewer students, as opposed to assistant professors not affected by the policy. The tenure policy lowers the probability of failing a class by 15%. Teaching effectiveness measured by the valued-added model also falls significantly by 0.32 standard deviation of the average grades in subsequent courses, roughly 6.6% of the sample means. The effect on student effort also is significant. Study time and class absences decline by 3 and 10%, respectively. The results suggest that the tenure system reduces teaching effectiveness and leads to lenient grading. Moreover, although used as a measure of teaching effectiveness in tenure promotion, student evaluation of teaching cannot truly reflect teaching quality.","[Keng, Shao-Hsun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung,"Keng, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",shkeng@nuk.edu.tw,"Keng, Shao-Hsun/W-6172-2019","Keng, Shao-Hsun/0000-0002-7153-5892",Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST-105-2410-H-390-001-MY2],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),The author wishes to thank the Office of Institutional Research at the University of Kaohsiung for sharing the data.

Fund managers pursue incentives to manipulate fund characteristics to invoke future fund inflows. Given this body of evidence, how has the global financial crisis impacted on fund volatility and fee structures with respect to the flow-performance relationship? Using data for the period 1999 to 2011 (disaggregated into three sample periods) for US mutual equity funds, empirical analysis in this study shows mutual funds adopt a low-risk strategy resulting in the greatest flow-performance sensitivity. An incremental dampening effect is observed on flow-performance convexity due to increasing riskiness of portfolios, more significant in the GFC period. In addition, the results indicate that pure operating expense weakens the flow-performance sensitivity, especially in the post-GFC period. Advertising effects trigger greater investor response to past performance, particularly throughout the GFC. It is also documented that front-end load is not a statistically significant in determining the flow-performance relationship; nevertheless, back-end load on average dampens investor response to past performance, and this dampening impact is more evident in the post-GFC period.","[Wang, Yuchen] Natl Australia Bank, Alternat Investment Operat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Watson, John; Wickramanayake, Jayasinghe] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Banking & Finance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Wang, YC (通讯作者)，Natl Australia Bank, Alternat Investment Operat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,"wang, yuchen/AED-4066-2022","Watson, John/0000-0001-6550-243X",,,,,71,6,6,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,3172,3193,,10.1111/twec.12673,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200013,0

Using unique longitudinal data, we estimate workers' vulnerability to income poverty and find a strong negative relationship between vulnerability and life satisfaction, over and above the positive income effect commonly documented in the literature. The result is robust and cannot be reduced to the effect of two-sided uncertainty. A matched behavioral experiment shows that respondents are significantly loss averse. We conclude that downside risk is an important determinant of happiness and of economic decisions under uncertainty.

Specifically, we examine the extent to which recently documented changes in players' compensation structure based on certain types of productivity fits in with the longer term trends in compensation and identify the value of specific output activities in different time periods. We examine free-agent contracts in 3-year periods across three decades and find significant changes to how players' past performances are rewarded in free agency beyond the change in those to on-base percentage seen in the mid-2000s. We find evidence that the compensation strategies of baseball teams increased the rewards to power statistics beyond home runs in the 1990s from a model that focused on successfully reaching base with a batted ball without a significant regard for the number of bases reached. Similarly, we confirm and expand upon the increased financial return to bases on balls in the late 2000s as found in previous research.","[Congdon-Hohman, Joshua M.] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, 1 Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Lanning, Jonathan A.] Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Washington, DC USA",College of the Holy Cross,"Congdon-Hohman, JM (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ & Accounting, 1 Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",jcongdon@holycross.edu,,,May and Stanley Smith Charitable Trust,May and Stanley Smith Charitable Trust,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Congdon-Hohman's work was partially funded by the May and Stanley Smith Charitable Trust.",,17,1,4,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

However, climbing stairs is physically more challenging than level walking and results in a high number of falls, hence substantial medical costs. Understanding the impact of a dynamic environment, such as that of a bus, on people's gait whilst walking on stairs, would enable the reduction, or even the elimination of balance-loss falls. The gait of 29 healthy and regular bus users (20-80 y.o.) was monitored whilst ascending and descending a static and moving staircase. The tasks took place in a real double-decker bus which was initially stationary. When the bus was moving, ascending was tested during medium acceleration (+ 1.5 m/s(2)), while descending during medium deceleration (1.5 m/s(2)), reproducing the most common movements aboard buses. Examining healthy people enables the identification of differences in gait that are accounted for the alteration in the bus environment and gives the opportunity to further consider the challenges mobility impaired passengers are experiencing. After applying the method established in level walking, chi-square tests were performed on participants' step type (resulting from the ground reaction force profile), taking into account participants' age and gender and the bus acceleration. The outcomes revealed that age and gender affect people's gait in a dynamic environment. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between the increase of acceleration and the type of steps passengers use to sustain their balance, as the number of three-peak steps was increasing with the increase of bus acceleration. Hence, the bus environment forces people to use a walking style other than their natural one and older people in particular, unconsciously increase the contact area between their foot and the floor (three-peak steps) to increase balance. Surprisingly, males appear less able than females to control balance. People's stair walking in a moving vehicle was investigated for the first time and has opened-up new horizons for gait analysis in dynamic environments.","[Karekla, Xenia; Tyler, Nick] UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Karekla, X (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",x.karekla@ucl.ac.uk,,"Karekla, Xenia/0000-0001-7889-361X; Tyler, Nick/0000-0001-7079-1301",,,,,25,8,9,0,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

However, empirical evidence for this is largely lacking. This study intends to fill this gap by assessing the impact of business models, in particular battery and vehicle leasing, on Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption. By conducting a stated choice experiment, we examine to what extent car drivers switch their choices between conventional and electric vehicles after business models become available. The results based on the discrete choice model suggest that leasing does not increase EV adoption at the aggregate level. However, a latent transition analysis shows that different groups with internally homogeneous preferences react differently to leasing options at the disaggregate level. The results indicate that 13% of the car drivers changed their preferences, albeit in different ways. Transition probabilities are particularly related to attitudes towards leasing and knowledge of EV. The results show that leasing is useful in facilitating EV adoption for certain groups, which can be identified by their individual characteristics. In addition to these substantial insights, this paper makes a contribution to the literature by demonstrating the potential of latent transition analysis in uncovering heterogeneity in behavioral changes induced by policy or strategy interventions, especially when changes can occur in opposite directions.","[Liao, Fanchao; Molin, Eric; van Wee, Bert] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Timmermans, Harry] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Urban Planning Grp, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Timmermans, Harry] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Dept Air Transportat Management, Jiangjun Ave, Nanjing 211106, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Delft University of Technology; Eindhoven University of Technology; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Liao, F (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",f.liao@tudelft.nl; e.j.e.molin@tudelft.nl; H.J.P.Timmermans@tue.nl; g.p.vanwee@tudelft.nl,,"Timmermans, Harry/0000-0002-8737-4632; Molin, Eric/0000-0003-4486-9608","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), under Grant TRAIL Graduate School [022.005.030]","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), under Grant TRAIL Graduate School(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO))","We would like to thank Maarten Kroesen from Delft University of Technology for reviewing a draft version of this article.

Although numerous academic papers have applied SD models to real estate markets over the past generation, the technique remains relatively unknown and little used both in the academic economics literature and, more to the point, among practitioners and educators in the real estate community. Yet SD has the potential to address key needs among these constituencies, and extend and complement upon traditional economic methods. SD models are focused on modeling market transitions toward long-run equilibria, facilitating the study of the details of causality and the dynamic path of the market and features that are prominent in the history of housing markets in emerging markets. Different from intensive data-driven economic models, SD models are structural-based operational models that can more easily accommodate the actual non-market features and unique institutional components of these emerging real estate markets, where long-range historical data are not readily available. SD can provide intuitive and transparent model structures that should be able to improve pedagogy for educating large numbers of potential real estate entrepreneurs particularly in emerging market countries. For demonstration, in the present paper we choose to focus on the China-specific features of speculative demand' and land financing scheme', and use the newly developed SD model to explore the effects of land supply, command-and-control versus market-driven policies for housing in China. It is important to note, however, that while we chose China for the purposes of our study, the same technique can be applied to any emerging real estate market. Moreover, our research here can be seen as a stepping stone: Before a generalized SD model for emerging markets can be developed, it is both reasonable and appropriate to construct a model that is constrained to a manageable subset of the overall market space.","[Zhang, Xin; Geltner, David; de Neufville, Richard] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhang, Xin; Geltner, David; de Neufville, Richard] MIT, Ctr Real Estate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Zhang, X (通讯作者)，MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Zhang, X (通讯作者)，MIT, Ctr Real Estate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",xinzhang@mit.edu,,,,,,,42,13,14,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Since the fall of 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada, was added to the ever-growing list of metropolises with such ride-hailing companies (RHCs). For cities whose economies are built predominately on the foundations of tourism, questions inevitably have been raised regarding the effects that RHCs have on their respective transportation system operators, in particular, the taxicab industry. In Las Vegas, services such as Uber (Uber Technologies Inc.) and Lyft (Lyft.com) compete directly with the taxicab industry for riders within the resort corridor and across the valley. In this study, a multinomial linear regression analysis used a multi-modal, time-series travel dataset to estimate the effects of RHCs on taxicab ridership. After controlling for a number of explanatory variables, including the total number of monthly visitors, transit ridership, ride-hailing trip counts to/from the airport and several other socioeconomic indicators, the results showed that RHCs do in fact have a negative, and significant, effect on taxicab ridership. A perhaps more profound and counterintuitive finding however was that transit ridership along the resort corridor actually complements (rather than competes with) taxi ridership; this could have significant implications moving forward.","[Contreras, Seth D.] World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Paz, Alexander] Univ Nevada, Transportat Res Ctr, Howard R Hughes Coll Engn Civil & Environm Engn, 4505 Maryland Pkwy,POB 454007, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Contreras, SD (通讯作者)，World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",Seth.Contreras@WRI.org; apaz@UNLV.edu,,"Paz, Alexander/0000-0002-1217-9808",,,,,26,97,110,2,64,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We decompose the time-frequency effects and improve the interpretation of the results by non-expert users in the theory of wavelets. This yields empirical evidence on instability periods and reveals various changes and breaks in the causality relationships for the data available from recent years.

Women working in bars and restaurants were primarily affected by the intervention. In this research, we analyze the effect of this smoking ban on the outcomes of their pregnancies. Using individual live birth, fetal loss, and infant mortality registry data, we examine the probability of live birth, indicators of health at birth, and the probability of death in the first year of life. We apply a difference-in-differences framework and show that the smoking ban has improved health at birth. We observed birth weight to increase by 56 g (95% CI: 4.2 to 106.8) and gestation length by 0.19 weeks (95% CI: 0.02 to 036). Due to the ban, the probability of being born with very low and low birth weight has decreased by 1.2 and 2.2 percentage points, respectively (95% CI: -0.2 to -2.2 and 0.06 to -4.4), and we see a 0.9 percentage points reduction in the chance of being born very preterm (95% CI: -0.03 to -1.9). We also observe a decrease in the probability of being born with a low Ponderal index (decrease of 4.1 percentage points, 95% CI: -0.7 to -7.5). Performing a series of robustness and placebo tests, we provide evidence that supports the causal interpretation of our results. We also show that the ban was more beneficial for newborns of parents with low educational attainment and at the bottom of the fetal health endowment distribution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

For IOs engaged in crisis management operations, acquiring knowledge about strategic errors is necessary for adopting reforms that could save lives. This study seeks to identify the sources that affect whether or not IO elites will contribute knowledge to an IO's institutional memory in crisis management. The study employs a survey experiment in the field on 120 NATO elites who decide on and plan operations. Findings indicate that when the United States introduces knowledge of a strategic error, NATO elites are significantly less likely to share it. This deterrent effect on knowledge-sharing illustrates an unexpected way in which the US influences international crisis management. The study also finds that an IO's secretariat can somewhat increase elites' likelihood of contributing to the IO's institutional memory.","[Hardt, Heidi] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Sci, Dept Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Hardt, H (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Sci, Dept Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",hhardt@uci.edu,,"Hardt, Heidi/0000-0001-5014-4975",Fulbright Commission through my Fulbright Schuman EUI Chair Fellowship,Fulbright Commission through my Fulbright Schuman EUI Chair Fellowship,"I thank the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies at the European University Institute for hosting me as I carried out the majority of the research for this study.

Unlike other studies, the sequence of those extreme days is also taken into account, that is, the impacts of both single and consecutive (i.e. heat waves and cold spells) extreme days are estimated simultaneously. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for the sequence of extreme days. We also disentangle the impacts of those extremes by age and gender. The findings suggest that single hot days increase mortality, while single cold days do not affect mortality. On the other hand, both consecutive hot and consecutive cold days increase mortality in females and males for all age groups, although males are affected more severely. Overall, consecutive days with extreme temperatures impose considerable costs to society in terms of years of life lost. Thus, ignoring the sequences of extreme days that are likely to increase in the future because of climate change may have critical implications for mitigation policies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the industry-level analysis also confirms the similar findings; results indicate significant positive impact of oil price on firms' stock return in full sample, textile, chemical and miscellaneous industry, while the lagged oil price changes negatively affect the stock returns of full sample and all the industries except tobacco, jute and vanaspati industries. The study confirms that rise in oil price transfers a positive signal in the stock market that boosts the firm-level stock returns in Pakistan.

The importance of positive and negative votes in calculating a candidate's net score may be different, so that a negative vote and a positive vote need not cancel out exactly. These rules combine the first-place seeking incentives of plurality with the incentives to avoid being ranked last of antiplurality. We show that, in our simple model, arbitrary best-worst rules admit equilibria, which (except for three candidates) are nonconvergent if and only if the importance of a positive vote exceeds that of a negative vote. The set of equilibria in the latter case is very similar to that of plurality, except the platforms are less extreme due to the moderating effect of negative votes. Moreover: (i) any degree of dispersion between plurality, at one extreme, and full convergence, at the other, can be attained for the correct choice of the weights; and, (ii) when they exist (and there are at least five candidates), there always exist nonconvergent equilibria in which none of the most extreme candidates receive the most electoral support.","[Cahan, Dodge] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Slinko, Arkadii] Univ Auckland, Dept Math, Auckland, New Zealand",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Auckland,"Cahan, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",dcahan@ucsd.edu; a.slinko@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,32,4,4,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2018,51.0,2,,,,,259,279,,10.1007/s00355-018-1115-7,0.0,,,21,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GO4YL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440023800004,0

The aim of the present paper is to study the persistence of sovereign debt within a business cycle perspective. In order to achieve this result, a Keynesian framework is considered where aggregate demand fluctuations generate quantity adjustment within a deflationary environment. Furthermore a regime switching technique, capable of generating bounded and robust endogenous fluctuations, is introduced. The piecewise linearity of the model, along with its discontinuities, obliges to operate with a low dimensional system in order to obtain two analytical results: the robustness of bounded fluctuations, and hence of debt persistence, and the driving role of growth. These results are extended to higher dimensions by means of simulations. Also in this case, the effectiveness of policies is confirmed.","[Ferri, Piero] Univ Bergamo, Via Caniana 2, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy; [Tramontana, Fabio] Catholic Univ, Dept Math Sci Math Finance & Econ, Via Necchi 9, I-20123 Milan, Italy",University of Bergamo; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Tramontana, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ, Dept Math Sci Math Finance & Econ, Via Necchi 9, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",fabio.tramontana@unicatt.it,"Tramontana, Fabio/AAB-2721-2020; Tramontana, Fabio/JHU-2151-2023","TRAMONTANA, Fabio/0000-0002-7299-5524",,,,,31,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Since the mid-2000s, Germany has undergone a paradigm shift in parental leave and childcare policies. Our comparative analysis of East and West Germany provides new evidence on whether the long-standing gender regime differences interact with recent developments of social class inequalities in the changing family policy context. The analyses include pooled binary and multinomial logistic regressions based on 17,764 observations of 8604 children below the age of three years from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). The findings point to growing educational divergence in work-care arrangements in East and West Germany: employment and day-care use increased more strongly among families with medium and highly educated mothers compared to those with low education. This has critical implications for the latter's economic security.

These analyses include (i) a decomposition of changes in multidimensional poverty, which reveals why poverty decreases or increases; (ii) a framework to examine and understand the relationship between the dashboard approach and dimensional contributions and multidimensional poverty in a dynamic setting; (iii) a presentation of methods that illuminate the process of the accumulation of deprivations.

Our purpose is to assess several important attributes of water governance in these developing countries. Specifically: (1) do water-related public services make important contributions to per capita GDP and general livelihood prospects? (2) what factors seem to explain the quite different national commitments to the provision of water-related public services? and (3) do observed variations in water-related public services provide evidence of governance quality? Our diagnostic models suggest that water-related public services indeed contribute to per capita GDP and to improved public health outcomes across these developing countries. We then derive a variable capturing fiscal effort in the provision of quasi-public services - the availability of improved water supply and sanitation services - controlling for variations in national ability to pay (per capita GDP). We call this commitment an index of instrumental governance. With this index of instrumental governance, we conclude that water governance offers an important measure of a proxy for the civic commitment of governments in the world's poorest nations. We conclude that an important aspect of governance is captured by the extent to which governments make difficult financial commitments that will improve per capita GDP and general livelihood prospects of their citizens.","[Bromley, Daniel W.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Anderson, Glen] Abt Associates Inc, Durham, NC USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; ABT Associates,"Bromley, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,,,,,22,5,6,4,9,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2382-624X,2382-6258,,WATER ECON POLICY,Water Econ.

Instead, hash functions are used to transform the distribution of identifiers of experimental units into a uniform distribution.

In addition, the admission records allow us to identify those slaves owned by slave traders. We find relatively high marriage rates among enslaved African Americans but significantly lower marriage rates for those slaves owned by traders, a result we attribute to the demographic composition of traded slaves and marital disruption caused by the slave trade.

To complement regulatory approaches, attention is now also being given to market-based incentives because of their potential cost-effectiveness. This study seeks to provide impetus to the use of the most successful market-based incentives to promote sustainable watershed practices through strengthening and increasing direct participation by local communities and the private sector. To identify proven market-based incentives for use to catalyze local community and private sector participation, a review of a sample of 26 purposively selected case studies from different contexts in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas is conducted. In reviewing those case studies, emphasis is placed on understanding the threats to specific watersheds, the market-based incentives used, the countrywide policy environment, the outcomes from the interventions, the factors for success and failure, and the pertinent policy issues in support of upscaling and the uptake of appropriate market-based approaches. The study identifies seven key policies that Governments should consider to upscale and facilitate the uptake of market-based incentives to promote participation by local communities and the private sector in watershed management.","[Muchapondwa, Edwin] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Muchapondwa, Edwin; Stage, Jesper] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Mungatana, Eric] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Kumar, Pushpam] United Nations Environm, Ecosyst Div, Nairobi 0010, Kenya",University of Cape Town; Lulea University of Technology; University of Pretoria,"Muchapondwa, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.;Muchapondwa, E (通讯作者)，Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",edwin.muchapondwa@uct.ac.za,"Stage, Jesper/B-6718-2009",,"Freshwater Ecosystems Unit, Division of Environmental Policy Implementation, United Nations Environment Programme","Freshwater Ecosystems Unit, Division of Environmental Policy Implementation, United Nations Environment Programme","This study was funded by the Freshwater Ecosystems Unit, Division of Environmental Policy Implementation, United Nations Environment Programme under the control of Thomas Chiramba and Youngsoek Lee.

Energy sector reforms in non-OECD Asia are thus significant for global energy use, sustainability and socio-economic welfare. The region has experienced a slow and difficult reform path and after more than two decades of reform efforts it is time to take stock of their outcomes. Using a novel dataset assembled for this purpose for the period 1990-2013 for 17 non-OECD Asian countries, we apply instrumental variables regression techniques to several electricity sector reform outcome models. We find that the standard reform model has had limited benefits, largely due to sectoral heterogeneity and institutional endowments. We also show empirical evidence of the theoretical trade-offs between technical efficiency, economic and welfare objectives of reforms. The results call for rethinking of the effectiveness of reforms and awareness of the effects of key reform steps on different outcomes. This is useful for balancing the trade-offs among competing reform objectives.","[Sen, Anupama] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, 57 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6FA, England; [Nepal, Rabindra] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Massey Business Sch, Auckland, New Zealand; [Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England",University of Oxford; Massey University; Durham University,"Jamasb, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England.",tooraj.jamasb@durham.ac.uk,"Nepal, Rabindra/J-2027-2019","Nepal, Rabindra/0000-0001-9378-6206",,,,,103,13,13,0,3,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2018,39.0,4,,,,,181,209,,10.5547/01956574.39.4.asen,0.0,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ3NI,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435202100008,0

This study examines how two distinct types of international economic engagement-economic openness and participation in International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs-affect the growth of shadow (informal) sectors. We theorize that increased economic openness will reduce the size of countries' shadow sectors. More specifically, we posit that eliminating market-distorting trade barriers will decrease the incentives for shadow sector activities such as smuggling. Additionally, we posit that increased participation in global production and supply chains is likely to lead to a positive, climb to the top effect on states' regulatory and labor policies that enhance the prospective benefits associated with formal sectors. Conversely, we argue that participation in IMF structural adjustment programs can lead to great shadow sector activity as IMF-imposed structural conditions might cause significant near-term economic hardship and degrade states' regulatory capacity. The results from a panel of 145 countries from 1971 to 2012 indicate that economic openness reduces the size of the shadow economy, while participation in IMF programs is significantly related to a larger shadow economy. These findings have important implications for understanding how the divergent forms of international economic engagement might affect shadow economies.","[Blanton, Robert G.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35487 USA; [Early, Bryan] SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Peksen, Dursun] Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; University of Memphis,"Blanton, RG (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35487 USA.",rgblanton@uab.edu; bearly@albany.edu; dpeksen@memphis.edu,,"Blanton, Robert/0000-0001-7667-2725",,,,,83,31,30,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We document an extraordinary imbalance in the structure of bilateral trade in that China overwhelmingly exports manufactured products to SSA and almost exclusively imports primary products in return. Our principal means of assessing the competitiveness of SSA's manufacturing sector vis-a-vis China are measures of relative unit labour costs (RULC). We find that African RULCs declined over the 2000s as China's wages rose faster than Chinese productivity while the reverse was true for the SSA countries in our sample. Nevertheless, RULCs vis-a-vis China remain very high for many SSA countries. High RULCs along with weaknesses in the business climate suggest that most SSA countries are unlikely to be competitive in labour-intensive manufacturing any time soon.","[Golub, Stephen S.; Prasad, Varun] Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Ceglowski, Janet] Bryn Mawr Coll, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA; [Mbaye, Ahmadou Aly] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Dakar, Senegal",Swarthmore College; Bryn Mawr College; University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar,"Golub, SS (通讯作者)，Swarthmore Coll, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA.",,,,University of Cape Town's Development Policy Research Unit (DPRU); DPRU,University of Cape Town's Development Policy Research Unit (DPRU); DPRU,The authors thank Haroon Bhorat and the University of Cape Town's Development Policy Research Unit (DPRU) for inviting and funding this contribution and participants in the conference on China in Africa in November 2014 sponsored by DPRU for comments.,,46,11,13,3,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2018,41.0,6,,,,,1508,1528,,10.1111/twec.12603,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GI6XL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434646400002,0

It turns out that PCP shocks give rise to IP uncertainty in a sizeable manner, while the further propagation of IP uncertainty to LCP inflation uncertainty is moderate. Moreover, LCP inflation uncertainty increases the uncertainty of IP inflation (measured in local currency). In general, both inflation and its uncertainty are diagnosed as core determinants of pass through variation. Thus, a lack of monetary credibility could serve as a catalyst for the import of foreign price pressures and uncertainty to local prices.","[Herwartz, Helmut] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Roestel, Jan] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Okonometr, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Kiel,"Roestel, J (通讯作者)，Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Stat & Okonometr, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",jr@stat-econ.uni-kiel.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [HE 2188/3-3],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (HE 2188/3-3) is gratefully acknowledged.,,47,0,0,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

We propose here a novel algorithm for the efficient numerical solution of such global optimization problems. The algorithm, DE-N, is a hybrid of Differential Evolution and the Newton method. The latter is widely used for the treatment of GARCH related models, but cannot be used as standalone algorithm in this case as the SOPs contain many local minima. The algorithm is tested and compared to some state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark suite consisting of 42 monthtly agricultural commodities series of the Mexican Consumer Price Index basket as well as on two series related to international prices. The results indicate that DE-N is highly competitive and that it is able to reliably solve SOPs derived from GARCH with trend models.","[Uribe, Lourdes] Ave Inst Politecn Nacl Edif, Mexico City 07738, DF, Mexico; [Hernandez-del-Valle, Gerardo] Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Col Ctr, Ave 5 Mayo 18, Mexico City 06059, DF, Mexico; [Perea, Benjamin; Schutze, Oliver] Ave Inst Politecn Nacl 2508, Mexico City 07360, DF, Mexico",Bank of Mexico,"Uribe, L (通讯作者)，Ave Inst Politecn Nacl Edif, Mexico City 07738, DF, Mexico.",l.uriberichaud@gmail.com; gerardo.hernandez@banxico.org.mx; schuetze@cs.cinvestav.mx,"Uribe, Lourdes/JBJ-7947-2023","Uribe, Lourdes/0000-0002-2547-2288; Hernandez-del-Valle, Gerardo/0000-0001-5199-4517",Conacyt; CONACyT [SIP20162103],Conacyt(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),Benjamin Perea acknowledges support from the Conacyt to pursue his M.Sc. studies at the Cinvestav-IPN.

Against a backdrop of multiple social changes, there is a new era of social reproduction based on the interplay between a politics of post-waged work and a politics of community, involving activities outside the realms of market, state and family. Whereas the implications of family-based care work have long been highlighted, the community-based political economy of the post-wage regime' has yet to be analysed. Taking Germany as an example, the article describes how the state is actively involved in promoting and exploiting post-waged work. At the same time, community projects and grassroots activities contribute to the social reproduction of livelihoods, often becoming an active part of the precarious post-wage regime. The question is raised whether or not these interweaving developments herald a new era of community capitalism.","[van Dyk, Silke] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Polit Sociol, Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"van Dyk, S (通讯作者)，Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Sociol, Carl Zeiss Str 2, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",silke.vandyk@uni-jena.de,,,,,,,102,22,24,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We define and characterize the notion of almost Lorenz dominance (ALD) and illustrate it with the US income data. An income distribution is said to almost Lorenz dominate another distribution when its Lorenz curve lies almost everywhere but not entirely above the other Lorenz curve. We show that this condition is equivalent to requiring that almost all Gini-type inequality measures rank the former distribution to have less inequality than the latter distribution; the condition on the Gini-type inequality measures has a clear interpretation and is easy to apply. We further define an almost composite transfer (ACT) and show that ALD amounts to a sequential application of such transfers. The empirical illustration with the US income data (1967-1986) demonstrates the utility of this generalized notion of inequality ordering.","[Zheng, Buhong] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80202 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Zheng, BH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",buhong.zheng@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2018,51.0,1,,,,,51,63,,10.1007/s00355-017-1106-0,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GG9NE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433027000003,0

This paper investigates whether or not the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11) impacted local preferences for Arab neighbors. We test for changes in preferences using a differences-indifferences approach in a hedonic pricing model. Relative to sales before 9/11, we find properties within 0.1 miles of an Arab homeowner sold at a 1.4% discount (approximately $4133) in the 180 days after 9/11. The results are robust to a number of specifications including time horizon, event date, distance, time, alternative ethnic groups, and the presence of nearby mosques. Previous research has shown price effects at neighborhood levels but has not identified effects at the micro or individual property level, and for good reason: most transaction level data sets do not include ethnic identifiers. Applying methods from the machine learning and biostatistics literature, we develop a binomial classifier using a supervised learning algorithm and identify Arab homeowners based on the name of the buyer. We train the binomial classifier using names from Summer Olympic Rosters for 221 countries during the years 1948-2012. We demonstrate the flexibility of our methodology and perform an interesting counterfactual by identifying Hispanic and Asian homeowners in the data; unlike the statistically significant results for Arab homeowners, we find no meaningful results for Hispanic and Asian homeowners following 9/11.","[Nowak, Adam] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, 1601 Univ Dr,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Sayago-Gomez, Juan] Univ Icesi, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ Studies, Cali, Colombia",West Virginia University; Universidad ICESI,"Nowak, A (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, 1601 Univ Dr,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",adam.d.nowak@gmail.com; jtsayago@icesi.edu.co,"Sayago, Juan Tomas/JJF-0023-2023","Sayago, Juan Tomas/0000-0002-7238-124X",,,,,54,5,8,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

We bridge this gap using a sample of 15 South/South-East Asian countries, given the burgeoning trend of Asian economies towards services preferentialism and the largely WTO+ nature of their preferential services commitments. Our empirical findings suggest that Asian trading dyads with regulatory frameworks that are more similar and more trade restrictive tend to undertake higher levels of WTO+ commitments in their STAs. There is also evidence in our results, including by modes of supply, for WTO+ commitments in Asian STAs being driven by goods trade complementarities, alluding to supply chain dynamics in the region. Such results support the hypothesis that the heightened servicification of production generates a demand to lower services input costs arising from regulatory incidence and heterogeneity.","[Shingal, Anirudh] Univ Bern, European Univ Inst, Florence & World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Roy, Martin] World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Sauve, Pierre] World Bank, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Bern; World Trade Organization; The World Bank,"Shingal, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, European Univ Inst, Florence & World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,54,3,3,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41.0,5,,,,,1223,1250,,10.1111/twec.12574,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432037100004,0

Rather than attempting to identify the true specification, the GFIC chooses from a set of potentially misspecified moment conditions and parameter restrictions to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of a user-specified target parameter. The intent of the GFIC is to formalize a situation common in applied practice. An applied researcher begins with a set of fairly weak baseline assumptions, assumed to be correct, and must decide whether to impose any of a number of stronger, more controversial suspect assumptions that yield parameter restrictions, additional moment conditions, or both. Provided that the baseline assumptions identify the model, we show how to construct an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the asymptotic MSE to select over these suspect assumptions: the GFIC. We go on to provide results for postselection inference and model averaging that can be applied both to the GFIC and various alternative selection criteria. To illustrate how our criterion can be used in practice, we specialize the GFIC to the problem of selecting over exogeneity assumptions and lag lengths in a dynamic panel model, and show that it performs well in simulations. We conclude by applying the GFIC to a dynamic panel data model for the price elasticity of cigarette demand.","[Chang, Minsu; DiTraglia, Francis J.] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"DiTraglia, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, 3718 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",fditra@sas.upenn.edu,,"DiTraglia, Francis/0000-0002-5924-7740",,,,,20,3,3,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

This study aims to assess the predictive power of the agency and pecking order theories in two distinct information environments. The strategy is to compare two similar groups of property firms listed on the Mainland and Hong Kong stock exchanges respectively. Both groups operate in the Mainland property market and are subject to the same tax code, but the degrees of transparency and integrity of the stock markets are weaker for the Mainland-listed firms. We find that factors related to agency conflicts and information asymmetries exert a stronger influence on the capital structure decisions of Mainland-listed firms than on those of the Hong Kong-listed firms. This is confirmed by a test of the agency theory using such corporate governance factors as managerial shareholding and shareholding concentration and by a test of the pecking order theory using an error correction model. A further test on the increments of R-squared in the regression models shows that variables derived from the two theories better explain the variations of the capital structure of Mainland-listed firms than those of Hong Kong-listed firms.","[Deng, Kuang Kuang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wong, Siu Kei; Chau, Kwong Wing] Univ Hong Kong, Ronald Coase Ctr Property Rights Res, HKUrbanLab, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; University of Hong Kong,"Deng, KK (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",dengkuangkuang@126.com; skwongb@hku.hk; hrrbckw@hkucc.hku.hk,"Chau, Kwong Wing/A-4716-2010; /A-4751-2010","/0000-0003-2590-2556; Deng, Kuang Kuang/0000-0003-0071-6546",,,,,46,3,3,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This method is to calculate the profitability of a trading system, applied to specific past period. The data which are used, correspond to that specific past period and are called historical data or training data. There is a plethora of trading systems, which include technical indicators, trend following indicators, oscillators, control indicators of price level, etc. It is common nowadays for calculations of technical indicator values to be used along with the prices of securities or shares, as training data in fuzzy, hybrid and support vector machine/regression (SVM/SVR) systems. Whether the data are used in fuzzy systems, or for SVM and SVR systems training, the historical data period selection on most occasions is devoid of validation (In this research we designate historical data as training data). We substantiate that such an expert trading system, has a profitability edge-with regard to future transactions-over currently applied trading strategies that merely implement parameters' optimization. Thus not profitable trading systems can be turned into profitable. To that end, first and foremost, an optimal historical data period must be determined, secondarily a parameters optimization computation must be completed and finally the right conditions of parameters must be applied for optimal parameters' selection. In this new approach, we develop an integrated dynamic computation algorithm, called the d-BackTest PS Method, for selection of optimal historical data period, periodically. In addition, we test conditions of parameters and values via back-testing, using multi agent technology, integrated in an automated trading expert system based on Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) technical indicator. This dynamic computation algorithm can be used in Technical indicators, Fuzzy, SVR and SVM and hybrid forecasting systems. The outcome crystalizes in an autonomous intelligent trading system.","[Vezeris, D. Th; Schinas, C.

Nevertheless, such policies to mitigate environmental impacts result in a cost for the relevant parties, especially the ports themselves. To analyze the impact of environmental policy on ports, a simulation technique based on system dynamics is introduced with the case of Busan port as an illustration. Results show that both the environmental policies (EPs) and the policy options (POs) create positive effects and negative effects on ports. Although EPs and POs seem to increase the negative effects on the port in the short term, they are helpful to strengthen the competitiveness of ports by the vitalization of port activities and the port cluster.","[Woo, Jong-Kyun] Tong Myong Univ, Busan, South Korea; [Moon, Daniel S.

As a result, various maritime safety measures have been developed, including Port State Control (PSC) inspections. In this paper, we propose a data-driven Bayesian Network (BN) based approach to analyse risk factors influencing PSC inspections, and predict the probability of vessel detention. To do so, inspection data of bulk carriers in seven major European countries from 2005 to 20081 in Paris MoU is collected to identify the relevant risk factors. Meanwhile, the network structure is constructed via TAN learning and subsequently validated by sensitivity analysis. The results reveal two conclusions: first, the key risk factors influencing PSC inspections include number of deficiencies, type of inspection, Recognised Organisation (RO) and vessel age. Second, the model exploits a novel way to predict the detention probabilities under different situations, which effectively help port authorities to rationalise their inspection regulations as well as allocation of the resources. Further effort will be made to conduct contrastive analysis between 'Pre-NIR' period and 'Post-NIR' period to test the impact of NIR started in 2008.","[Yang, Zhisen; Yang, Zaili] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Yin, Jingbo] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Dept Int Shipping, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Liverpool John Moores University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Yang, ZL (通讯作者)，Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",Z.Yang@ljmu.ac.uk,"Yang, Zhisen/JRW-3214-2023; yang, zaili/A-6493-2013; zhao, yang/GXF-4424-2022","yang, zaili/0000-0003-1385-493X;",EU Marie Curie grant [ENRICH - 612546]; Liverpool John Moores University UK,EU Marie Curie grant; Liverpool John Moores University UK,This research was supported by an EU Marie Curie grant (ENRICH - 612546) and PhD scholarship by Liverpool John Moores University UK.,,73,113,119,26,154,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Since 2010, the Chinese government has introduced numerous policies to accelerate the development of the NEV industry. These policies have various effects on NEVs due to several complex factors, such as timing, regional economies, and other demands on the government's attention. This paper investigates NEV policies that were launched by China's national, provincial, and municipal authorities from 2010 to 2016 In terms of their similarities and differences, as well as their successes and failures. By doing so, we trace the evolution of Chinese NEV policies and compare them, in order to advise on the policies that are most beneficial to the future development of the Chinese NEV industry. The main results are as follows: (1) the implementation of NEV policies consisted of a plan-pilot-promotion-subsidy-development process; (2) the coordination mechanisms of central and local governments should be strengthened; (3) future policies should focus on infrastructure construction, research and development (R&D), the recycling of batteries, and private purchase regulations.

Ambassadorial appointments are also portrayed as patronage, used as a reward for domestic political favors. Here, we develop an original database of the tenure of US ambassadors from sources at the US State Department to better understand the determinants of ambassadorial careers. We assess the tenure of both political appointees and career diplomats based on four factors: (1) Political factors, such as leader turnover in the US and the host nation; (2) Personal characteristics of the ambassador, such as age and gender; (3) Characteristics of the host nation such as population, wealth, trade and alignment with the US; and (4) Performance measures, such as improvements in economic, diplomatic and security relations. US Presidential turnover has the greatest effect on ambassadorial tenure, especially for political appointees. Performance measures have little impact on the tenure or future career prospects of ambassadors.","[Arias, Eric; Smith, Alastair] NYU, Dept Polit, 19 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Smith, A (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Polit, 19 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",alastair.smith@nyu.edu,,,,,,,46,11,13,4,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

With the increasing presence of LNG import capability in European ports, this topic is growing in importance, especially for European policy makers. Theoretical results, stemming from an asymmetric Nash Bargaining model, suggest that Russian prices decrease as dependency on Russian gas decreases. The empirical results, obtained from the estimation of a correlated random effects model, corroborate this stipulation by finding a positive relationship between Russian pricing and average dependency on Russian supplied gas. These findings explain the recent phenomenon experienced in the Baltic Region where the presence of an LNG import terminal in Lithuania has secured access to non-Russian suppliers of gas and decreased prices from Gazprom.","[Hinchey, Nathalie] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS22 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Hinchey, Nathalie] Rice Univ, James A Baker III Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX 77005 USA",Rice University; Rice University,"Hinchey, N (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS22 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",nathalie.hinchey@rice.edu,,,Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's James A.

An illustration of its strengths is suggested by using the case study of European tourists visiting France between 2008 and 2013.

We generate complex networks from a cross-correlation matrix such as the threshold network (TN) and the minimal spanning tree (MST). In the threshold network, we assign a threshold value by using the mean and standard deviation of cross-correlation coefficients. When the threshold is equal to the mean of these coefficients, we observe a giant cluster composed of three economic zones in all three periods. We find that during the crisis, the countries in the Asian zone were weakly connected and those in the American zone were tightly linked to the countries in the European zone. At a large threshold, the three economic zones were fragmented. The European countries connected tightly, but the Asian countries bound weakly. The MST constructed from the distance matrix. In the MST, France remained a hub node in all three periods. The size of the MST shrank slightly during the crisis. We observe a scaling relation between the network distance of nodes from the central hub (France) and the geometrical distance. We observe the topological change of the financial network structure during the global financial crisis. The TN and MST are complementary roles to understand the connecting structure of financial complex networks. The TN reveals to observe the clustering effects and robustness of the cluster during the financial crisis. The MST shows the central hub and connecting node among the economic zones.","[Lee, Jae Woo] Inha Univ, Incheon, South Korea; [Nobi, Ashadun] Noakhali Sci & Technol Univ, Sonapur, Bangladesh",Inha University; Noakhali Science & Technology University (NSTU),"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Incheon, South Korea.",jaewlee@inha.ac.kr; ashadunnobi_305@yahoo.com,"Lee, Jae Woo/D-2326-2010",,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [NRF-2014R1A2A1A11051982]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (NRF-2014R1A2A1A11051982).",,35,31,31,2,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The study extrapolates the opinions from experts who resonate that three pivotal cornerstones the differentiate Charter airlines from low-cost long-haul carriers which comprise of its destination expertise, Air Travel Organiser Licence affiliation and its horizontally integrated multifaceted enterprise. A passenger survey directed exclusively at passengers travelling on Charter airlines to long-haul destinations in Latin America found that vacationers aged 56 years and older together with families would not opt to vacation on low-cost long-haul airlines.","[Rodriguez, Andrea Martin; O'Connell, John F.] Cranfield Univ, Bedford, England",Cranfield University,"O'Connell, JF (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Ctr Air Transport, Bedford MK43 0AL, England.",frankie.oconnell@cranfield.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,17,18,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This article addresses a concern of the tourism industry regarding a possible policy change on a tourist visa fee for Chinese nationals that potentially has adverse impacts on the economy. The article demonstrates that the revenue objective of an increase in the visa fee for Chinese visitors is unlikely to be a successful policy, as it will take a long time for the visa revenue to compensate for the losses of gross domestic product.

The study reveals that most Saudi consumers use online channels as information sources compared to offline channels. Saudi consumers tend to use online information sources, which appear to be more important than offline channels to them due to the perceived easy availability of goods and services, convenience, information, available services, and time and cost efficiency. The grounded theory is used to gather and explore primary data. The non-probability sampling technique is applied to collect and analyse opinions from respondents representing the population of Saudi Arabia. The researcher used the semi-structured interview technique to understand consumer behaviour towards online shopping. The results of the study identified that the majority of Saudi consumers like using online channels as information sources, which influences them to use online shopping. Factors influencing Saudi consumers to use online channels, and consequently online shopping, include the perceived easy availability of goods and services, convenience, information, available services, and time and cost efficiency. Although most Saudi consumers prefer using online channels as information sources, security concerns make some consumers hesitant about online purchasing. The growth of online technology in the country has great potential, as it minimizes the costs of services and delivery of goods, and easily reaches geographical boundaries bringing consumers and retailers together. Factors like perceived ease of available services and goods, convenience, information, available services, and time and cost efficiency are vital elements in influencing Saudi consumers to use online purchasing. The study concluded that online usage and purchasing is comfortable, easy, and better than offline channels. Research implications: online retailers and the Saudi government should cooperate to enhance consumer awareness towards online shopping, and they should eradicate risks hindering consumers' use of online shopping. Originality/value: The study revealed that many Saudi nationals are interested in online shopping. However, security risks are a concern to some consumers. The Saudi government and online retailers can benefit from the findings of this study and create appropriate strategies to build customer awareness about online shopping.","[Alatawy, Khald] Najran Univ, Coll Adm Sci, POB 1988, Najran 11001, Saudi Arabia",Najran University,"Alatawy, K (通讯作者)，Najran Univ, Coll Adm Sci, POB 1988, Najran 11001, Saudi Arabia.",ksalatawy@nu.edu.sa,,,,,,,52,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,15,27,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540718700002,0

Using a wide variety of financial development measures, as well as specific indicators capturing the level of state intervention in the financial system and the degree of market-driven financing in the economy, we examine whether limited access to finance acts as a barrier to reducing energy intensity. Our estimations control for variables such as state investment, stock market capitalization and the composition effect. Further, a GMM estimator is used to control for endogeneity in our models. Our results provide evidence that a poorly functioning financial system constrains the reduction of energy intensity across regions. However, the strength of these effects has been gradually declining over time, especially following the implementation of the Green Credit Policy. Limitations in domestic access to finance as well as the misallocation of funds and the efficient use of capital have policy implications, as they can reduce the incentives for investment in the energy sector. These findings are a source of considerable interest in light of the new policy based on green credit, and they highlight new opportunities as well as challenges to sustainable economic growth.","[Aller, Carlos] Univ CEU Cardenal Herrera, Dept Econ & Business, Alfara Del Patriarca, Spain; [Herrerias, Maria Jesus] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Edgbaston B15 2TT, England; [Ordonez, Javier] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Econ Int, Castellon De La Plana, Spain",Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera; University of Birmingham; Universitat Jaume I,"Herrerias, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Edgbaston B15 2TT, England.",m.j.herrerias@bham.ac.uk,"ARRANZ, Carlos ALLER/AAE-3184-2020; Ordonez, Javier/K-3665-2014","Ordonez, Javier/0000-0002-1453-2441","Spanish Ministry of Economics, Industry and Competitiveness [ECO2017-83255-C3-3-P]; PROMETEO's project [PROMETEO II/2014/053]; University Jaume I research project [UJI-B2017-33]; Generalitat Valenciana [Prometeo/2017/158]","Spanish Ministry of Economics, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); PROMETEO's project; University Jaume I research project; Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF))","The authors are grateful for helpful comments from participants at the 5th Meeting on International Economics in Villarreal (Spain) and University of Balearic Islands Business Department seminar, and to professors Lorenzo Ductor and Abel Lucena Pimentel.

Human capital is proxied by individual indicators of basic skills (literacy and numeracy) and of occupational skills. We employ a Mincerian regression approach and find a positive and statistically significant association between skills and average earnings. Although we cannot reliably assess causality in the observed relationship, these findings are robust to conditioning on household composition, job characteristics, and place of residence. Nonetheless, further testing indicates that the earnings gradient associated with literacy is driven mainly by unobservable variables (e.g., ability, family background) that explain both the worker's acquisition of this skill and his earnings. The estimated associations are stronger for urban than for rural workers and are highly heterogeneous across activity sectors. Our analysis reveals that workers with higher skills were not only better remunerated in their main occupation but also more likely to diversify their earnings through by-employment. Finally, quantile regression analysis indicates that earnings disparities between workers with different skills were much smaller at the lower than the upper end of the earnings distribution. This evidence suggests that, in pre-industrial Castile, human capital may have contributed to inequality of earnings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Typically this matrix is fixed a priori by the investigator, which is seldom satisfactory. Recent proposals advocate a more data-driven approach in which W may be estimated. Where panel data are available it may be possible not only to estimate W but also to test its constancy through time. When the time dimension of the panel is large there is a non-negligible risk of breaks in model parameters, including possibly the weights. Ignoring such breaks when they are present will produce at best inefficient parameter estimates, and in most cases, biases. The paper focuses on the stability of W by adapting to the spatial panel context tests for the constancy of covariance matrices developed in the multivariate statistics literature. Information provided by these tests is a prerequisite for a satisfactory analysis of models in which W appears. The utility of our approach is illustrated by two case studies of the contemporary Spanish economy.","[Angulo, Ana; Mur, Jesus] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza, Spain; [Burridge, Peter] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of Zaragoza; University of York - UK,"Mur, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza, Spain.",jmur@unizar.es,"Mur, Jesus/P-4040-2014",,Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO-2015-65758-P],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),The authors thank the referees and editor for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Based on the plans made in the last speech State of the Union Address of the Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, on 13 September 2017 the European Commission presented on 6 December 2017 a set of communications regarding the next steps for further deepening Europe's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

Moreover, Analytical Business Enterprise Research and Development (ANBERD) database provides accurate and internationally comparable information on enterprise R& D expenditures for several industries and timeframes. During 1999-2013, financial innovation grows, especially in Eurozone. Lerner index, adjusted Lerner and Boone indicator represent relevant measures of competitiveness. For the timeframe under scrutiny, there is a drop in competition along with significant variations among countries and across years. As a matter of fact, the changes in competitiveness follow the pattern of general business cycles.

We use the BCP quasi-likelihood ratio test and deal with the new multifold identification problem that arises under the null of the polynomial model. The approach leads to convenient asymptotic theory for inference, has omnibus power against general nonlinear alternatives, and allows estimation of an unknown polynomial degree in a model by way of sequential testing, a technique that is useful in the application of sieve approximations. Simulations show good performance in the sequential test procedure in both identifying and estimating unknown polynomial order. The approach, which can be used empirically to test for misspecification, is applied to a Mincer (Journal of Political Economy, 1958, 66, 281-302; Schooling, Experience and Earnings, Columbia University Press, 1974) equation using data from Card (in Christofides, Grant, and Swidinsky (Eds.), Aspects of Labour Market Behaviour: Essays in Honour of John Vanderkamp, University of Toronto Press, 1995, 201-222) and Bierens and Ginther (Empirical Economics, 2001, 26, 307-324). The results confirm that the standard Mincer log earnings equation is readily shown to be misspecified. The applications consider different datasets and examine the impact of nonlinear effects of experience and schooling on earnings, allowing for flexibility in the respective polynomial representations.","[Cho, Jin Seo] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonse Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Cho, Jin Seo] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Phillips, Peter C.

In this setting, corruption, privatisation and external openness jointly determine the per capita income in the follower economy. This model predicts that economies with higher shares of private ownership, lower corruption, and higher external openness enjoy higher rates of growth. Our empirical verification of these predictions is based on a panel of 29 post-communist countries during the period 1996-2014.

All date palm puree treatments were combined with 3g/L foliar fertilizer. The observed variables were plant heights, number of leaves, number of shoots, the percentage of contamination, browning, life, and rooted explants. The result showed the growth and living performance of G. scriptum in the medium of 50g/L dates palm puree with and without sugar was not significantly different on the VW medium. It indicated that the growth of G. scriptum in this combination of such media was relatively similar with those grown on VW medium.

Past experiences in the Turkish economy indicated that persistent large current account imbalances make financial system more fragile and cause serious currency crises. Therefore, examining the determinants of current account deficit in Turkey becomes a significant research topic. Accordingly, this study aims to analyse the impact of bank credit expansion on current account balance in Turkey. Covering the quarterly data between 2004 and 2017 the relationship between bank credit and current account balance has been investigated in the long run and the short run by ARDL Model. Empirical results show that there is a causal relationship from credit growth to current account deficit. It seems that credit expansion has been one of the leading reasons behind the growing current account deficits in Turkey. Thus, the results indicate that policy-makers in Turkey should take into account the credit expansion while keeping the current account balance as the primary objective to provide financial system soundness and economic stability.","[Karahan, Ozcan] Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Merkez Yerleskesi, TR-10200 Bandirma Balikesir, Turkey; [Yilgor, Metehan; Ondes, Hakan] Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Econometr Dept, Merkez Yerleskesi, TR-10200 Bandirma Balikesir, Turkey",Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University; Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University,"Karahan, Ö (通讯作者)，Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Merkez Yerleskesi, TR-10200 Bandirma Balikesir, Turkey.",okarahan@bandirma.edu.tr; myilgor@bandirma.edu.tr; hondes@bandirma.edu.tr,"yilgor, metehan/ABB-7144-2020; Karahan, Özcan/D-9357-2018",,,,,,18,0,0,2,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,243,250,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800031,0

Capital and liquidity are essential for ensuring bank stability as well as form the basis for successful bank performance. Consequently, bank stability is vital for the economic growth of any country. The objective of this paper is to analyse the capital adequacy and liquidity of Latvian commercial banks in the context of stability. The paper provides analysis of z-score as a measure of stability as well as of capital adequacy, liquidity of Latvian banks in the period from 2008 until 2016. The analysis is done using quantitative and qualitative analysis methods based on the financial statement data of Latvian commercial banks over nine years. The analysis is based on classification of banks into groups depending on the size of bank total assets. The paper reveals the differences in formation of liquid reserves and reserves of capital in different groups of banks. The analysis has shown the dependence between bank size in terms of assets and bank liquidity: small banks maintain higher liquidity standards to preserve its stability. Besides, decrease in bank liquidity is associated with an increase in risk-weighted assets and a decrease in bank stability. This dependence was revealed in all bank groups independently from its size. Moreover, in small banks growth of capital is accompanied by a decrease in liquidity.","[Kudinska, Marina; Romanova, Inna; Joppe, Aina] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Kudinska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Romanova, Inna/AAF-6948-2019; Kudinska, Marina/AAB-7289-2020","Romanova, Inna/0000-0002-0935-7749; Kudinska, Marina/0000-0002-7704-2976",,,,,16,1,1,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,378,386,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500035,0

In particular, for China with a vast territory and a large number of ethnic groups, the integration of various ethnic groups and regions is the important driving force of regional culture and of economic development. Although the current national policies in our country promote the integration and unity among different ethnic groups, there are still some contradictions, disputes and studies among different ethnic groups under the influence of different cultures, living habits and historical development.

Stakeholder theories often come with the normative idea that a business has, at least, a fiduciary duty, and at most, a moral duty, to protect the interests of its stakeholders. Therefore, how a stakeholder is defined usually shapes a stakeholder theory. In this paper, I show that there has been a clear move from acceptance of stakeholdership under the minimum criterion of 'actively participating in and benefiting from the system' towards 'being affected by the system'. I will argue why the reasoning behind this move should not necessarily stay human-centred. What elevates the minimum criterion for humans can be applied to animals used in businesses such as ones in biomedical research and the food industry. This will of course pose challenges as to the limitations on defining what constitutes having a stake in a corporate system in non-human stakeholders. I will respond to these challenges by showing that the above-mentioned move on minimum criterion has only become possible by taking into account what I will call 'outside attributes. Outside attributes are those attributes that manifest themselves outside the primary function of a business. For example, private life interests of an employee count as an outside attribute with respect her workplace. My hypothesis is that looking at outside attributes of laboratory animal models or animals raised for food can qualify them for a status of stakeholdership. The consequence of this change in our attitude would be that our scope of understanding animal welfare in these areas will have to reach beyond attributes observed within the confines of research and food chain.","[Molavi, A.; Meijboom, F.

The transformation and development of degrading industrial territories is one of the most urgent tasks in the sphere of spatial development for each city.

This is due to the mere fact of the Copenhagen process, which for over 15 years has been aiming to improve the quality of education in the European Union. Nevertheless, the state of vocational education in this area is far from expected. In this case, the Polish vocational education system is one of the most negative examples [Polcyn, Gawrysiak 2017, p. 13], both in the context of the level of unemployment, as well as the clarity and coherence of the system itself. The authors have attempted to explore the reasons for this condition in the context of the effectiveness of vocational education in terms of labour market demand, based on the data from 2016 at NTS-4 level. The analysis used the new database of the Occupation Barometer, data prepared by the Polish Central Statistical Office on the number of students trained according to the ISCED-F 2013 international classification, and social and economic measures were taken into account. The results of linear models indicate the lack of a direct relationship between education in five most numerous ISCED-F 2013 narrow fields in Poland and demand on the labour market, according to the data from Occupation Barometer. The authors additionally propose a new measure of effectiveness, based on the collected data, and present an example of its use in the logistic regression method.

As in most developed countries of the world, it is of strategic importance to encourage and stimulate agricultural producers to achieve the maximum added value. Alongside other crops in Croatia, tobacco has, for several decades, occupied an important position in terms of added value, concerning the income it generates for its producers and for the processing tobacco industry. Despite the harmful effects of cigarettes on human health, tobacco is still a very important crop, and all forecasts predict that it will remain so for a long time. To maintain competitiveness in the production of cigarettes and other products, processing tobacco industry in Croatia must pay full attention to the quality of produced raw materials and yields, to be able to compete with the most developed countries of the world. With the application of modern techniques such as crop protection, fertilizing and modern irrigation systems, another important element in the production of tobacco is the human factor, i.e. the knowledge and expertise of the producers. Knowledge of production methods and new technologies cannot be possible without a certain level of education every tobacco producer should attain to be able to follow current trends and achieve a satisfactory level of production. The aim of the paper is to investigate the interrelationship between the quantity and quality of produced products and the level of education of tobacco producers in the cooperative base of Croatian tobacco Inc. Since it is one of the largest tobacco buyers in Croatia, it will be investigated how, and to what extent, the education of agricultural producers has an impact on their production volume and quality. The influence of this factor on the overall agricultural production of tobacco in Croatia will be analyzed, showing its high importance for the entire national economy.","[Ribic, Damir; Plesa Puljic, Nikolina] Coll Management Tourism & Informat, Dept Econ, Virovitica, Croatia",,"Ribic, D (通讯作者)，Coll Management Tourism & Informat, Dept Econ, Virovitica, Croatia.",damir.ribic@vsmti.hr; nikolina.plesa.puljic@vsmti.hr,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,563,578,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300032,0

The foreign enterprises act in more than only one country and that is why they have specific capital structure and specific sources of financing. It confirms polish and international literature. The aim of this article is to compare sources of financing in domestic and foreign small and medium enterprises in Poland. The point is whether the differences between the structure of the financing sources of enterprises operating on an international scale and enterprises operating only within the borders of one country give the first group of enterprises a competitive advantage over the latter. The research was conducted in years 2008-2017 in 300 branches of international enterprises in Poland and in 300 domestic enterprises, using documents prepared by enterprises and questionnaire of inquiry. The research procedure was as follows. After a random selection of enterprises (stratified random sampling with division into small and medium enterprises) and collecting basic data on the selected enterprises from the register of enterprises, a specialized unit dealing with interviews and surveys of enterprises was engaged. Next, employees of this unit met with the managers appointed by the management board of the selected companies and helped them to complete the questionnaire prepared by the author in each company's headquarters. This resulted in 100% of responses in the selected companies that were representatives of the larger group. The empirical findings suggest the differences between sources of financing. The average, in this period, foreign enterprises used mainly two basic sources of financing bank credit and funds created by mother enterprise. They took into account financing by retained profit and venture-capital funds. Two main sources of financing in domestic enterprises, the most popular were bank credit and leasing. So we noticed some typical differences. First of all, branches of foreign enterprises very seldom use leasing as a source of financing, in contrast, in polish enterprises this form is very popular. Secondly, additional support for these branches is financing by mother enterprises - it gives possibilities of faster development and more flexible financing position of their enterprises in host country. Finally the foreign enterprises prefer using alternative sources of financing, rather than traditional ones.","[Rozanski, Jerzy] Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Matejki 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Rózanski, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Matejki 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",jerzy.rozanski@uni.lodz.pl,,"Rozanski, Jerzy/0000-0003-3222-209X",,,,,14,0,0,1,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,583,590,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800075,0

Conclusions vary dramatically. Similar variations and uncertainties are striking with respect to many other dimensions of food security and food systems. The sheer heterogeneity of methods used to explore the futures of food seems to undermine meaningful comparisons and aggregation between studies. These issues and others compromise responsible collective choices vital for humanity, nonhuman animals, and Earth systems. Disagreements on what policies and social actions we should adopt to shape the future of food depend on how we assess the evolution of food security and food systems over the long-term (at least 20 years into the future). Building upon foresight practice and theory, our team borrows tools from economics, STS, and philosophy to shed light on global food futures and food ethics. In this paper, we will introduce readers to some of our unpublished and provisional findings. We will cover two questions: (1) What does a systematic review of global food security modelling and projection studies reveal about predominant methods, food security indicators, drivers of change, and the range of future global food security projections?

Most of the contemporary research carried out on this topic has shown the existence of strong nonlinear relationships between the mentioned factors. Using empirical data this study aims to analyse the impact of monetary and fiscal policy, as the two key leverages of economic policy, on unemployment. As in previous studies, based on statistical methods, but also by the use of self-organizing neural networks, the correlation and non-linearity of these relations has been proven. Research findings suggest that the annual growth rate of money supply is in positive correlation with the unemployment rate, while the indicators of the development of the financial sector and the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector are negatively correlated with the unemployment rate in the Republic of Croatia. The share of general government debt in GDP is positively correlated with unemployment, but the annual growth rate of general government debt is negatively correlated with unemployment. It is also possible to notice the spillover effects between M1 variables on Gross debt and M1 / GDP on Loans / GDP and Loans / GDP on Gross debt / GDP. The paper presents conclusions on the correlation and spillover effects between observed independent variables and proposes a methodology for modelling the nonlinearity of such relations.","[Samodol, Ante; Valcic, Sonja Brlecic] Libertas Int Univ, Dubrovnik, Croatia",,"Samodol, A (通讯作者)，Libertas Int Univ, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",asamodol@libertas.hr; sbrlecic@libertas.hr,,,Croatian Science Foundation [6558],Croatian Science Foundation,This work was supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project 6558 Business and Personal Insolvency.,,19,3,3,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,163,172,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300018,0

Model estimates show that the SO2 allowances market is de facto regionalized due to the regionalization of the electricity market. The national dimension only appears when there are local imbalances in the electricity market that give strong incentives to search for a better deal outside of the generator's regional market. We also identify the importance of counterpart differentiation and the influence on the counterpart choice of the regulatory framework, market evolution and transaction size. These findings are shown to be robust to Enron's abnormal behavior during 2000-2001 and its subsequent bankruptcy. The results suggest that, contrary to received knowledge, abatement costs are not the only consideration when trading pollution allowances: market microstructure can play a crucial role.","[Sanin, Maria Eugenia] Univ Evry, Univ Paris Saclay, EPEE, Evry, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Sanin, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, Univ Paris Saclay, EPEE, Evry, France.",eugenia.sanin@univ-evry.fr,,,Energy and Prosperity Chair,Energy and Prosperity Chair,"We are very grateful to Denny Ellerman for providing access to the database on emission allowance transactions as well as the editors of this journal and two anonymus referees for useful suggestions.

But can these programs play a similar role in the value chains feeding into fast-growing emerging markets like China and India? Most scholars doing research on the topic draw a pessimistic picture. They argue that the scope conditions for private sustainability governance are not yet present in these markets. Our analysis of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil -a leading non-state certification program-in China and India partially confirms this view. At the same time, however, we find that emerging markets are not a unified category. We observe that sustainable palm oil is beginning to gain momentum in China, whereas uptake in India remains much weaker. We trace this back to a number of key market conditions, which we show are more favorable in China. In addition, our analysis highlights the role of the Chinese state in creating awareness of and shaping firms' interests in sustainable palm oil.","[Schleifer, Philip] Univ Amsterdam, Transnatl Governance, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sun, Yixian] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Int Relat Polit Sci, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Amsterdam,"Schleifer, P (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Transnatl Governance, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"Sun, Yixian/T-2388-2019","Sun, Yixian/0000-0003-2415-2327",Swiss National Science Foundation Doc.CH project 'Transnational Private Governance for the Environment in China' [162177],Swiss National Science Foundation Doc.CH project 'Transnational Private Governance for the Environment in China'(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),Yixian Sun's research for this work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation Doc.CH project 'Transnational Private Governance for the Environment in China' [grant number 162177].,,78,58,59,4,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Therefore, the first aim of this study is to examine the finance-growth link and effectiveness of financial systems in promoting sustainable economic growth in developing countries. On the other hand, developing countries have experienced vast changes in their economic and institutional environment in order to integrate with the world economy. Thus, the second aim of this study is to examine the quality of the institutional environment and its role in providing conditions for sustainable growth in developing countries. The proposed analyses are conducted on the sample of Western Balkan countries using indicators provided by the World Bank database. According to the results of panel data analysis the level of financial development, especially the level of banking sector development, significantly influences the level of economic growth.

We argue that this variation is the product of two largely structural factors: the salience of anti-Soviet nationalism and the opportunity for membership in the European Union (EU) that was mostly the product of geography. In Eastern Europe and the Baltic states, anti-Soviet nationalism and the stimulus of EU democratic conditionality contributed to the rise of a non-communist elite that confronted serious internal and external pressure to democratize. By contrast, weaker anti-Soviet nationalism and dearth of pressure from the EU allowed for the persistence of communist elites who faced relatively weak external constraints on autocratic behavior. We argue that these structural factors played a more important role in accounting for variation in democratization across the postcommunist world than factors such as institutional design. At the same time, the different character of structural forces in Eastern Europe and the FSU has likely created greater room for voluntarist factors in determining regime variation within the former Soviet Union than within Eastern Europe.","[Way, Lucan Ahmad; Casey, Adam] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Way, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",lucan.way@utoronto.ca,,,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The authors thank Jean Lachapelle for critical assistance in the statistical analysis.

Perhaps surprisingly, the fraction of inequality attributable to circumstances is usually quite small-in the advanced democracies, approximately 20%. One reason for this is the lack of data on circumstance variables in empirical research. Here, we argue that all behaviors and accomplishments of children should be considered the consequence of circumstances: that is, an individual should not be considered to be responsible for her choices before an age of consent is reached. Using two data sets that contain data on childhood accomplishments, other environmental circumstances and the income as an adult, we calculate that the fraction of income inequality due to circumstances in the US rises from 27 to 43% when accounting for childhood circumstances. In the UK it rises from 18 to 27%.","[Hufe, Paul; Peichl, Andreas; Ungerer, Martin] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Hufe, Paul] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Peichl, Andreas] Univ Mannheim, IZA, Mannheim, Germany; [Peichl, Andreas] CESifo, Mannheim, Germany; [Roemer, John] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT USA; [Ungerer, Martin] Univ Cologne, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Mannheim; University of Mannheim; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut; Yale University; University of Cologne,"Peichl, A (通讯作者)，ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.;Peichl, A (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, IZA, Mannheim, Germany.;Peichl, A (通讯作者)，CESifo, Mannheim, Germany.",hufe@zew.de; peichl@zew.de; john.roemer@yale.edu; ungerer@zew.de,"Peichl, Andreas/D-7829-2018; Hufe, Paul/ABG-3731-2021; Ungerer, Martin/KDN-5083-2024","Hufe, Paul/0000-0002-2264-761X; Ungerer, Martin/0009-0000-4026-6338",Russell Sage Foundation,Russell Sage Foundation,"We are grateful to the Russell Sage Foundation for support.

The structure, which is testable, is used to trace the consequences of a contemporaneously ceteris paribus (or idiosyncratic) change in each variable in the VAR model. The impulse responses to idiosyncratic shocks are shown to be a dynamic representation of the Granger causality. In the analyses of the US monthly data from 1954 to 2011 for four key variables, inflation is found to respond negatively (positively) to an increase in unemployment (the federal funds rate), holding other variables contemporaneously fixed. The real variables (output and unemployment) appear unresponsive to idiosyncratic changes in the nominal variables (the federal funds rate and inflation). A common factor is observed to have a positive effect on unemployment and negative effects on output, inflation and the federal funds rate.","[Yang, Minxian] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Yang, MX (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",m.yang@unsw.edu.au,,"Yang, Minxian/0000-0002-5527-5373",,,,,22,2,2,0,2,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The methodology includes panel data analysis (unit root, cointegration, and Granger causality testing) on a transformed annual time series from 1970 to 2014. The study reveals that negative cycles indicate larger effects than positive cycles. However, these effects are not always present, are of short-term duration, and transitory in naturedepending on the cycle interval, the source country, and the destination. The study indicates the nature of the relationship between business and tourism demand flow cycles, which could help tourism managers and policy makers refine their tourism development strategies.","[Croes, Robertico; Ridderstaat, Jorge] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Ridderstaat, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.;Ridderstaat, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Rosen Coll Hospitality Management, 9907 Universal Blvd, Orlando, FL 32819 USA.",jorge.ridderstaat@ucf.edu,"Ridderstaat, Jorge/D-9592-2017",,,,,,72,22,25,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We use a network distance measure and a local -polynomial-regression approach to identify the CCL impact zone with discontinuity in housing price gradient between a treatment zone and a control zone. We then estimate the spatial difference-in-differences models that account for spatial autocorrelation in housing price changes in the two zones before and after the opening of the CCL. We find that the opening of the CCL increases housing value in the treated neighborhoods located within the 600-metre network distance from the new CCL stations by approximately 8.6%, relative to other properties in the untreated neighborhoods controlling for heterogeneities in housing attributes and local amenities, and spatial and temporal fixed effects. We find significant anticipation effects as early as 1 year prior to the opening of the CCL line, but the effects diminish closer to the actual opening date. The results imply that the inter-dependent spatial structure between the treated and the untreated neighborhoods, if neglected, may lead to over-estimation of the capitalization effects of the new transit lines on housing values.","[Diao, Mi; Leonard, Delon] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore; [Sing, Tien Foo] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Sing, TF (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore.",rstdm@nus.edu.sg; delonleonard@u.nus.edu; rststf@nus.edu.sg,"Diao, Mi/H-8615-2013; Sing, Tien Foo/J-9381-2013","Diao, Mi/0000-0002-0389-4199; Sing, Tien Foo/0000-0002-4101-851X",,,,,51,112,126,16,155,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

First, it investigates tire extent, to which the U.S. fracking boom has caused Arab oil exports to decline since late 2008. Second, tire article quantifies for the first time by how much the U.S. fracking boom has lowered the global price of oil. Using a novel econometric methodology, it is shown that in mid-2014, for example, the Brent price of crude oil was lower by $10 than it would have been in the absence of the fracking boom. Third, the article provides evidence that the decline in Saudi net foreign assets between mid-2014 and August 2015 would have been reduced by 27% in the absence of the fracking boom. Finally, the article discusses the policy choices faced by Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers.","[Kilian, Lutz] Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Kilian, L (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lkilian@umich.edu,,,Economic Research Forum,Economic Research Forum,"I thank Christiane Baumeister, Bassam Fattouh, Ryan Kellogg, Charles Mason, the editor and three anonymous referees for helpful comments and discussion.

China's low initial per capita income relative to its own long-run potential, combined with sound policy factors including a high investment rate, strong human capital, high trade openness and improved institutions, enabled the economy to converge with advanced economies in terms of income level. The shift-share analysis with industry-level data shows that strong labour productivity growth in the manufacturing sector largely contributed to China's overall labour productivity growth. Although labour reallocation from agriculture to the services sector made a positive contribution to aggregate labour productivity growth, labour productivity growth in the services sector itself was negative over the 1980-2010 period. China's average potential GDP growth is predicted to decline significantly in the coming decade, to 5%-6% and fall further to 3%-4%due to the convergence effect and structural problemsunless China substantially upgrades its institutions and policy factors and improves productivity, particularly in its services sector.","[Lee, Jong-Wha] Korea Univ, Asiat Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Asiat Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016","Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961",Korea University [K1709811],Korea University,"The author thanks the associate editor, two reviewers, Robert Barro, Yiping Huang, Harry Wu and seminar participants at the Australian National University, the Brookings Institution and Korea University for their helpful comments and suggestions and Hanol Lee for research assistance.

Previous studies have focused on the ability, or rather inability, of the EU to diffuse any of the core norms behind Ian Manners' concept of 'Normative Power Europe' (NPE) into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while tending to ignore the ability of the EU to shape what is considered normal in many aspects of the conflict - either by making others adopt its policies, or by contributing to creating consensus around an issue. By using Tuomas Forsberg's framework of four different mechanisms of normative power: persuasion, invoking norms, shaping the discourse and the power of example on three important case studies from the conflict (EC/EU's declaratory diplomacy on the need for a just peace in the conflict, the Palestinians' bid for statehood at the UN in 2011 and the emerging ` differentiation strategy'), this article concludes that the EU has much more normative power in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict than the literature has previously acknowledged.","[Persson, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Persson, A (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Ctr European Polit, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.",anders.persson@ifs.ku.dk,,,Swedish Research Council [2015-00295]; Swedish Research Council [2015-00295] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council; Vinnova [2015-00295] Funding Source: Vinnova,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Vinnova(Vinnova),Funding for the research behind the article has been provided by the Swedish Research Council (No. 2015-00295).,,79,14,15,4,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

I find that a history of severe obesity has a large negative effect on the wages of white men. White women face a penalty for a history of being overweight, with some evidence of additional penalties that begin above the threshold for severe obesity. Furthermore, the effects of past wages on current wages imply that past body mass has additional, indirect effects on wages, especially for white women. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, China's foreign investment is growing. Moreover, investment in the accommodation industry is an important component of investment in the B&R. Therefore, analysis is necessary to understand the security of the investment environment, the division of the investment security zone and the selection of optimal investments. This research applies a safety evaluation index system on investment in the accommodation industry using relevant data on 24 countries along the B&R from 2005 to 2014 as study samples. The results of the empirical analysis show that factor analysis based on multidimensional panel data estimated the safety of the investment of the sample countries. The coefficient of variation of the sample countries across 10 years was very large, meaning that the investment environment of sample countries was complex. The samples were divided into high, medium and low regions by means of panel data clustering analysis. Variance analysis showed significant differences among the three regions. The research used the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to identify the optimal country in which to invest. The optimal country was Greece and the worst was Macedonia. Finally, this research provides some analysis on conclusions and data selection.","[Yin, Jie; Yang, Xiaoyan; Zheng, Xiangmin; Jiao, Niantao] Huaqiao Univ, Quanzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",Huaqiao University,"Yin, J (通讯作者)，Huaqiao Univ, Coll Tourism, 269 Cheng Hua Bei Rd, Quanzhou 362021, Fujian, Peoples R China.",15980301687@163.com,"wang, wenxin/JOZ-3291-2023",,,,,,22,10,10,1,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Our approach conceptualizes ridership as a two-stage decision process comprising the discrete choice of whether to use the bike (i.e. the intensive margin) and the continuous choice of how far to ride (i.e. the extensive margin). To the extent that these two choices are related and, moreover, potentially influenced by factors unobservable to the researcher, we explore alternative estimators using two-stage censored regression techniques to assess whether the results are subject to biases from sample selectivity. A key finding is that while higher fuel costs are associated with an increased probability of undertaking non-recreational bike trips, this effect is of a significantly higher magnitude among those residing in an urbanized region. We also find evidence for a positive association with the extent of bike paths, both in increasing the probability of non recreational bike travel, as well as the distance traveled.

Based on the assumption that electricity is a prerequisite for human development, the United Nations has proclaimed the goal of providing electricity to all by 2030. In recent years, Pico-Photovoltaic kits have become a low-cost alternative to investment intensive grid electrification. Using a randomized controlled trial, we examine uptake and impacts of a simple Pico-Photovoltaic kit that barely exceeds the modern energy benchmark defined by the United Nations. We find significant positive effects on household energy expenditures and some indication for effects on health, domestic productivity, and on the environment. Since only parts of these effects are internalized, underinvestment into the technology is likely. In addition, our data show that adoption will be impeded by affordability, suggesting that policy would have to consider more direct promotion strategies such as subsidies or financing schemes to reach the UN goal.","[Grimm, Michael] Univ Passau, Dev Econ, Passau, Germany; [Grimm, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Grimm, Michael] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Munyehirwe, Anicet] IB&C Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda; [Peters, Joerg] RWI, Res Grp Climate Change Developing Countries, Essen, Germany; [Peters, Joerg] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Sievert, Maximiliane] RWI, Essen, Germany",University of Passau; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Witwatersrand,"Sievert, M (通讯作者)，RWI, Essen, Germany.",michael.grimm@uni-passau.de; munyehirwe@gmail.com; joerg.peters@rwi-essen.de; maximiliane.sievert@rwi-essen.de,,"Ankel-Peters, Jorg/0000-0002-7835-8745","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy; Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Research of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia [Sondertatbestand - special grant]","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy; Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Research of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia [Sondertatbestand - special grant]","We thank two anonymous referees and the editor for very valuable comments.

Mortality and industrial employment in Belgian cities at the turn of the twentieth century,EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mortality differences; Urban health; Industrial employment; Cottage industry,REAL WAGES; ENGLAND,"In this article, we reconstruct the sex- and age-specific mortality rates for the 25 largest Belgian cities at the turn of the twentieth century, and we explore their relationship with industrialization. Whereas previous research has focused mainly on the general level of industrial employment, we make a distinction between two production systems: cottage work (i.e., employment at home) and regular industrial production (i.e., centralized employment). Our linear regression models suggest that cities oriented toward cottage industry were more lethal than those oriented toward regular industry. Cities where a substantial percentage of the labor force was engaged in cottage work suffered high mortality rates, which confirms contemporary claims that in Belgium the cottage industry was the most murderous of all industries. Regular industrial employment, on the other hand, appears to have been less harmful for men and women alike, both young and old. We do observe, however, a detrimental effect from female regular industrial employment on infant and child mortality. Using contemporary government reports and sociological works, we were able to gain insights into the possible pathways that created these large health discrepancies between production systems. We argue that the health hazards encountered by cottage workers were due to the absence of labor and wage regulations and to the lack of health and safety standards in cottage work. In many sectors of the regular industry and in heavy industry in particular numerous regulations of this type had already been enforced by emerging labor union organizations, resulting in improvements in working conditions and higher wages. Furthermore, regular heavy industry seems to have attracted the healthiest workers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

One important question thereby is what characterizes and explains the interactions of non-state advocates with policymakers. In order to clarify this matter, we analyse the advocacy strategies of non-state actors, more precisely whether and why they address opponents instead of more like-minded policymakers. For this purpose, we analyse evidence collected through 228 interviews with advocates who attended the WTO Ministerial Conferences (Geneva 2012) and the United Nations Climate Conferences (Durban 2011; Doha 2012). Our results show that transnational advocates predominantly target like-minded policymakers and that their activities are much less focused on their opponents. Variation in advocacy towards opponents or like-minded policymakers is explained by the alignment of non-state actors with policymakers, the salience of topics on the political agenda, group characteristics, and whether or not advocates hail from democratic countries.","[Beyers, Jan; Hanegraaff, Marcel] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Bldg M De Meerminne,Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Hanegraaff, Marcel] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166,Postbus 15578, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Antwerp; University of Amsterdam,"Beyers, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Bldg M De Meerminne,Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",jan.beyers@uantwerpen.be,,"Beyers, Jan/0000-0002-8287-1162",,,,,80,17,18,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

To this end, a research model differentiating between short-term and long-term effects of terrorism on tourism is developed and analyzed for the destination Israel using data on tourists from Germany. The results show both short-term and long-term impacts with a time lag between the terrorist event and the beginning of tourism decline of 1 or up to 6 months.

To characterize this puzzling phenomenon, we quantified firm-specific and macroeconomic parameters and a diverse set of leverage proxies at various time frames with various structures. We further took account of the recent economic upheaval in our analyses so that we can compare firms' leverage behavior as before'' and after'' the major economic turmoil in 2007-2009 periods. The primary themes of our arguments were that firm-specific leverage factors significantly influenced short-term leverage, while long-term leverage was mostly determined by macroeconomic indicators. Beyond that, book leverage was more favorable across firms than market leverage. Last, hospitality and tourism firms substantially extended their borrowing capacities, aggressively grew their leverage ratios, and dramatically increased collateral values leading to lower cost of borrowing due to relaxed lending standards in the aftermath of the recent upheaval. Our article complements previous work by examining whether leverage factors demonstrate discrepancies from the prior findings and by proposing rigorous industry-specific outlook and solution for the financial leverage literature.","[Kizildag, Murat] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Ozdemir, Ozgur] Ozyegin Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Ozyegin University,"Kizildag, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Rosen Coll Hospitality Management, 9907 Univ Blvd, Orlando, FL 32819 USA.",murat.kizildag@ucf.edu,"Kizildag, Murat/Y-6035-2019",,,,,,57,15,15,3,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This theory suggests examining meaning-making processes concerning European civil society by adopting a post-foundational philosophy and an interpretive approach to studying social phenomena. Post-foundational philosophy is anti-essentialist, combines discursive and non-discursive elements, and adopts a constructionist approach to language that recognizes agency as situated. Discourse theorists conduct empirical research by strictly following these philosophical presumptions. So conceived, discourse theory suggests that the conceptual link between NGOs and European civil society does not have any foundational ground or naturalistic explanation. Such a link is not a pre-given fact, and can be best understood as linguistically constructed and articulated; that is, the EU institutions, the European Commission in particular, have defined and constituted NGOs as civil society subjects that would stand for and make Europe's imagined civil society present.","[Kutay, Acar] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Kutay, A (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey.",acar.kutay@emu.edu.tr,"Kutay, Acar/X-1345-2019; Kutay, Acar/HDM-6054-2022","Kutay, Acar/0000-0003-1403-9195;",European Union [CIT4-CT- 2006-028504],European Union(European Union (EU)),This article has benefited from the generous comments of the two anonymous referees.

This approach allows us to obtain energy efficiency measures at country level that are a robust alternative to the energy intensity indicators commonly used for international comparisons. A transitive multilateral price index is constructed for aggregating the diverse energy components employed in the sector. Due to the likely unobserved heterogeneity among countries, the use of a random parameters model is proposed to accommodate these differences and to obtain different income and price elasticities per country. The estimated model is compared with alternative approaches of addressing this issue such as latent class, true fixed effects or true random effects models. This study is the first to use a random parameters stochastic frontier approach in the estimation of energy demand functions. The proposed procedure is applied to Latin America and the Caribbean, where the transport sector represents a large share of total energy consumption.","[Llorca, Manuel] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Banos, Jose; Arbues, Pelayo] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Oviedo, Spain; [Somoza, Jose] Univ Havana, Ctr Marine Res, Havana, Cuba",Durham University; University of Oviedo; Universidad de la Habana,"Llorca, M (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",manuel.llorca@durham.ac.uk; jbanos@uniovi.es; pepes@cim.uh.cu; gonzalezpelayo@uniovi.es,"Baños, José/H-8565-2015","Banos Pino, Jose Francisco/0000-0002-3685-7909","Government of the Principality of Asturias; European Regional Development Fund and Principality of Asturias, Science, Technology and Innovation Plan [FC-15-GRUPIN14-048]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-43925-R]","Government of the Principality of Asturias(Principality of Asturias); European Regional Development Fund and Principality of Asturias, Science, Technology and Innovation Plan; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","This research was partially funded by the Government of the Principality of Asturias through its predoctoral grants program.

We implement recently proposed Bayesian shrinkage techniques based on Bayesian hierarchical modeling, and we evaluate the information content of forty-two (42) monthly macroeconomic and financial variables in terms of point and density forecasting. Alternative competing models employed in the study include Bayesian autoregressions (BARs) and time-varying parameter VARs with stochastic volatility, among others. The empirical results reveal that, overall, medium-scale BVARs enriched with economy-wide variables can considerably and consistently improve short-term inflation forecasts. The information content of financial variables, on the other hand, proves to be beneficial for the lending rate density forecasts across forecasting horizons. Both of the above-mentioned results are robust to alternative specification choices, while for the rest of the variables smaller-scale BVARs, or even univariate BARs, produce superior forecasts. Finally, we find that the popular, data-driven, shrinkage methods produce, on average, inferior forecasts compared to the theoretically grounded method considered here.","[Louzis, Dimitrios P.] Bank Greece, Econ Anal & Res Dept, 21 Leof Eleftheriou Venizelou Str, Athens 10250, Greece",European Central Bank; Bank of Greece,"Louzis, DP (通讯作者)，Bank Greece, Econ Anal & Res Dept, 21 Leof Eleftheriou Venizelou Str, Athens 10250, Greece.",dlouzis@bankofgreece.gr,,,,,,,45,2,2,1,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

However, research on transport habits in emerging adulthood is scarce. This study aimed to examine potential differences in walking, cycling, car use and public transport use between three groups of emerging adults (secondary school students (17-18 yrs), studying young adults (18-25 yrs) and working young adults '(18-25 yrs)), and to investigate differences in choice of transport modes within each of the three groups according to gender, SES and living environment. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to collect self-reported data via an online survey that assessed socio-demographic variables, commuting (to work or school) and transport to other destinations. 1307 emerging adults completed the questionnaire. Zero inflated negative binomial regression models were used. The four dependent variables were minutes per week walking, cycling, car use and public transport use. Results: Compared to the other two groups, secondary school students were most likely to cycle, studying young adults were most likely to walk and use public transport and working young adults were most likely to use a car. In each of the three groups, men were more likely to cycle than women and women were more likely to commute by car to work/ school than men. Female secondary school students were also more likely to use a car to other destinations. In each of the three groups, urban emerging adults were more likely to walk and less likely to use a car than those living in rural areas. Urban studying young adults were more likely to cycle to other destinations and urban working young adults were more likely to cycle to work than their rural counterparts. Urban secondary school students were less likely to use public transport to school, although urban studying young adults and working young adults were more likely to use public transport than their rural counterparts. In each of the three groups, high SES emerging adults were more likely to travel by car to other destinations than those with low SES. Conclusions: Future active transport interventions should focus on female emerging adults and on maintaining the habit of cycling after reaching the age at which it is possible to obtain a driver's license. More research on the travel behavior of working young adults is needed as this often neglected target group was least likely to use active and public transport and most likely to travel by car among the three comparison groups. Encouraging the combined use of active and public transport might help to decrease car use when travelling longer distances. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is not well understood how these impacts differ between different socioeconomic groups (e.g. economically advantaged and disadvantaged people) and how neighborhood planning affects the difference. Using data of public housing and private housing residents in Hong Kong in 2010, this study applies the propensity score matching approach to identify differences in activity-travel behavior under different built environment settings for private and public housing residents respectively. We find that density, accessibility and self-containment collectively affect private housing residents' auto ownership, travel time, trip frequency, and entertainment time spent at home, but have few influences on public housing dwellers. The different built environment effects are partly because the planning standards and guidelines in Hong Kong stipulate the provision of daily facilities and services such as grocery shops/supermarket, primary school and transit in proximity to public housing development. Thus, although economically disadvantaged people have limited transportation resources, neighborhood planning can adequately meet their daily needs even if they are placed in suburban areas.

In order to help address this problem a Markovian information criterion (MIC) is developed that is analogous to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) in its theoretical derivation and yet can be applied to any model able to generate simulated or predicted data, regardless of its methodology. Both the AIC and proposed MIC rely on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance between model predictions and real data as a measure of prediction accuracy. Instead of using the maximum likelihood approach like the AIC, the proposed MIC relies instead on the literal interpretation of the KL distance as the inefficiency of compressing real data using modelled probabilities, and therefore uses the output of a universal compression algorithm to obtain an estimate of the KL distance. Several Monte Carlo tests are carried out in order to (a) confirm the performance of the algorithm and (b) evaluate the ability of the MIC to identify the true data-generating process from a set of alternative models.","[Barde, Sylvain] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England; [Barde, Sylvain] Observ Francais Conjonctures Econ, Paris, France",University of Kent,"Barde, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.;Barde, S (通讯作者)，Observ Francais Conjonctures Econ, Paris, France.",s.barde@kent.ac.uk,,"Barde, Sylvain/0000-0003-1465-8236",,,,,48,25,26,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The time restriction is a heavy truck ban at the morning rush hour. Four groups of scenarios (15 scenarios) are analyzed, taking into consideration the reactions from carriers, which were obtained from a survey. These reactions are changes to truck paths, truck size and operational schedule (off-peak operations), and the use of consolidation centers. Some scenarios also consider road infrastructure improvement as a complementary policy. This paper describes data collection and statistical analysis, the O-D matrix obtained from each scenario and the traffic assignment process. The comparison of scenarios indicates that: (1) The time restriction policy for heavy trucks on the main access corridors has a negative impact on the whole city's total congestion and local emissions; and (2) The implementation of consolidation centers beyond the area of restriction to available land without adequate road infrastructure does not reduce the impact of the time restriction policy.

Costly deliberation lies at the heart of Simon's motivation of satisficing, but he did not formalize the idea. I do so here, studying decision making as a problem of minimax-regret planning in which costly deliberation enables a person to reduce ambiguity.

Within the realm of Expected Utility Theory, religious belief and activity could be interpreted as an insurance both for current life events and for afterlife rewards. Based on that framework, we would expect that risk averse individuals would demand a more generous protection plan which they may do by devoting more effort and resources into religious activities such as church attendance and prayer, which seems to be in accordance with previous empirical results. However, a general concern regards the problems of spurious correlations due to underlying omitted or unobservable characteristics shaping both religious activities and risk attitudes. This paper examines empirically the demand for religion by analysing the association between risk attitudes on the one hand, and church attandance and prayer frequency on the other controlling for unobservable variables using survey data of Danish same-sex twin pairs. We verify the correlation between risk preferences and religion found previously by carrying out cross-sectional analyses. We also show that the association between risk attitudes and religious behaviour is driven by the subgroup of individuals who believe in an afterlife. In addition, when re-analysing our results using panel data analyses which cancel out shared factors among twin pairs, we find that the correlation found between risk aversion and religious behaviour is no longer significant indicating that other factors might explain differences in religious behaviour. Caution is needed in the interpretation of our results as the insignificant association between risk aversion and religious behaviour in the panel data analyses potentially might be due to measurement error causing attenuation bias or lack of variation within twin pairs rather than the actual absence of an association.

This study focused on reliability measures adopted by various studies, the theoretical and mathematical foundation of modeling the valuation of reliability, and the contributing factors that influence the values. Since nearly all the studies in VOR analysis employed stated preference (SP) surveys and the survey design directly affects the study elements and modeling approaches, this synthesis pays close attention to the various survey design components. Through a comparative analysis among existing studies, this paper aims to shed some lights on the potential factors that contribute to the variations in VOR estimation. The results indicated that the estimated VOR values varied largely from one study to another; probably due to the use of different units, reliability measures and survey design approaches. This review showed the complexity and challenges faced when studying freight users' VOR. Insufficient data has also been cited as a major obstacle to advances in the understanding of how the freight industry values travel time reliability. Furthermore, the large variations in the VOR values indicate the need for further research efforts in this area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to the empirical studies which dominate the literature and focus on the case of spot markets, relatively little is known about the returns and the volatility dynamics of the futures markets. To address this deficiency, we employ a time-frequency approach and discover that the co-movements between the international markets manifest especially in the long run. Nevertheless, the contagion phenomenon associated with the very short-run horizon is present in particular in the case of the European markets, due to their higher level of integration. The rolling wavelet correlation increases after severe turbulence episodes, but fluctuates over time and across frequencies.

They also reported occupations with lower 1900 occupational income scores. The children of U.S.-born mothers (who were less susceptible to the disease) were relatively unaffected. Furthermore, I find no evidence that epidemics 3 to 4 years after birth affect adult occupational status, and the results are robust to controlling for local trade during an individual's birth year.","[Saavedra, Martin] Oberlin Coll, Dept Econ, Rice Hall 227,10 N Prof St, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA",University System of Ohio; Oberlin College,"Saavedra, M (通讯作者)，Oberlin Coll, Dept Econ, Rice Hall 227,10 N Prof St, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA.",Martin.Saavedra@oberlin.edu,,,,,,,44,10,10,0,9,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

To provide evidence on these differences, this article exploits a unique data set covering a wide array of characteristics, including cognitive skills, noncognitive skills, and managerial practices, for a large sample of female entrepreneurs in Mexico. Descriptive results show that on average opportunity entrepreneurs have better performance and higher skills than necessity entrepreneurs. A discriminant analysis reveals that discrimination is difficult to achieve based on these observables, which suggests the existence of unobservables driving both the decision to become an opportunity entrepreneur and performance. Thus, an instrumental variables estimation is conducted, using state economic growth in the year the business was set up as an instrument for opportunity, to confirm that opportunity entrepreneurs have higher performance and better management practices.","[Calderon, Gabriela] Stanford Univ, Poverty & Governance, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Iacovone, Leonardo] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Juarez, Laura] Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Ave 5 Mayo 18, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Stanford University; The World Bank; Bank of Mexico,"Juarez, L (通讯作者)，Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Ave 5 Mayo 18, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",gabcal@alumni.stanford.edu; liacovone@worldbank.org; ljuarezg@banxico.org.mx,,"CALDERON-GUEMEZ, GABRIELA/0000-0001-6763-142X","Instituto Nacional del Emprendedor (INADEM) at the Ministry of Economy in Mexico, USAID; World Bank; Instituto Nacional de las Mujeres (INMUJERES)","Instituto Nacional del Emprendedor (INADEM) at the Ministry of Economy in Mexico, USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); World Bank(The World Bank India); Instituto Nacional de las Mujeres (INMUJERES)","We gratefully acknowledge funding from Instituto Nacional del Emprendedor (INADEM) at the Ministry of Economy in Mexico, USAID, The World Bank, and the Instituto Nacional de las Mujeres (INMUJERES).

So, dealing directly with consumers by creating short food supply chains could be a great opportunity for food small and medium enterprises. In this context, the huge increase in the use of social media offers producers the potential to build new short chains for promoting and selling their products in a rapid, low-cost and direct way. Benefits of social networks in this regard are various: they may contribute to reducing market margins by enhancing direct sales; they facilitate the identification of customers' profile, their preferences and the way they perceive certain products.","[Elghannam, Ahmed] Damanhour Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Tor Sinaa Rd, Damanhour, Elbeheira, Egypt; [Escribano, Miguel] Univ Extremadura, Fac Vet Med, Dept Anim Prod & Food Sci, Caceres, Spain; [Elghannam, Ahmed; Mesias, Francisco] Univ Extremadura, Fac Agr, Dept Econ, Badajoz, Spain",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Damanhour University; Universidad de Extremadura; Universidad de Extremadura,"Mesias, F (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Fac Agr, Dept Econ, Badajoz, Spain.",fjmesias@unex.es,"Escribano, Miguel/AAC-9420-2020; Mesias, Francisco J./L-6307-2017; Elghannam, Ahmed/AAE-9194-2019","Escribano, Miguel/0000-0003-1684-1931; Mesias, Francisco J./0000-0001-5334-9554; Elghannam, Ahmed/0000-0002-8095-9275",Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education; Egyptian Sector of Cultural Affairs and Missions,Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education(Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)); Egyptian Sector of Cultural Affairs and Missions,The authors would like to acknowledge the funding provided by the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education and the Egyptian Sector of Cultural Affairs and Missions which made this research possible.,,52,27,27,3,36,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2017,16.0,1,,,,,36,42,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EU8RD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401305300005,0

Using Danish and Nordic data, it investigates the main drivers of the price difference between the intraday and day-ahead markets, and causality between wind forecast errors and their counterparts. Our results show that the wind and conventional generation forecast errors significantly cause the intraday price to differ from the day-ahead price, and that the relative intraday price decreases with the unexpected amount of wind generation. Cross-border electricity exchanges are found to be important to handle wind forecast errors. Additionally, some zonal differences with respect to both causality and impulse responses are detected. This paper provides the first evidence on the persuasive functioning of the intraday market in the case of Denmark, whereby intermittent production deviations are effectively reduced, and wind forecast errors are jointly handled through the responses from demand, conventional generation, and intraday international electricity trade.","[Karanfil, Fatih] Univ Paris Ouest, CNRS, Econ, Dept Econ & EconomiX, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Karanfil, Fatih] Galatasaray Univ, Econ Res Ctr GIAM, TR-34357 Besiktas, Turkey; [Li, Yuanjing] Univ Paris 09, CEEM, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Galatasaray University; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Li, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, CEEM, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",fkaranfil@u-paris10.fr; yuanjing.li@barcelonagse.eu,"Li, Yuan/GXV-1310-2022","Karanfil, Fatih/0000-0002-2094-6528",Chaire European Electricity Markets of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation - RTE; EDF; EPEX Spot; Groupe Caisse des Depots,Chaire European Electricity Markets of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation - RTE; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); EPEX Spot; Groupe Caisse des Depots,"The authors thank Anna Creti, Jan Horst Keppler, Juan-Pablo Montero, and the participants of the Workshop on Renewables and Electricity Prices: Modeling Approaches at University Paris-Dauphine in June, 2015, as well as anonymous referees of this Journal for their insightful comments that helped improve the paper significantly.

This is mainly due to the complexity of the tourism product (a bundle including both complementary and substitute goods and services) and the type of primary resource. Moreover, the planning of tourism and the policy of the destination depend on coordination and cooperation among several agents (private companies, public bodies and hybrid agents) on a plethora of issues. This article deals theoretically with the alternative patterns of strategic interaction that can be played by the different stakeholders of the destination: private agents can either play cooperative or non-cooperative pricing strategies, while the optimal investment policy for the destination management depends on the timing of the game (private and public agents' moves can either be simultaneous or sequential). By jointly considering the two features of cooperation and game timing, the authors are able to identify four different cases for their policy model. They show that the solutions of these cases generally differ and, if private agents are coordinated, the policymaker's choice between simultaneous and sequential moves is irrelevant. On the contrary, if agents are not coordinated, the policymaker prefers to use its first-move advantage in the sequential game in order to reduce the inefficiency stemming from the non-coordination of prices. The results are carefully discussed with respect to the peculiarity of the tourism product (where mainly complementary goods are included) and to the different patterns of destination management which are observed worldwide.","[Andergassen, Rainer; Candela, Guido; Figini, Paolo] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Figini, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.;Figini, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Ctr Adv Studies Tourism, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",paolo.figini@unibo.it,"Figini, Paolo/S-2274-2019; Andergassen, Rainer/AAM-7061-2021","Figini, Paolo/0000-0003-3625-6828;",,,,,21,12,13,1,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Every outcome is associated with a valuation function that maps an agent's type to his value for this outcome. The set of types are assumed to be convex. Our main characterization theorem shows that allocation rules are implementable if and only if they are implementable on any two-dimensional convex subset of the type set. For finite sets of outcomes and continuous valuation functions, they are implementable if and only if they are implementable on every one-dimensional subset of the type set. This extends a characterization result by Saks and Yu (Weak monotonicity suffices for truthfulness on convex domains, pp 286-293, 2005) from models with linear valuation functions to arbitrary continuous valuation functions, and provides a simple proof of their result. Modeling multi-dimensional mechanism design the way we propose it here is of relevance whenever types are given by few parameters, while the set of possible outcomes is large, and when values for outcomes are non-linear functions in types.","[Berger, Andr; Muller, Rudolf; Naeemi, Seyed Hossein] Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Müller, R (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",r.muller@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Herings, P./AAE-5572-2020",,,,,,22,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2017,48.0,2,,,,,367,383,,10.1007/s00355-016-1008-6,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EM0JG,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395004000006,0

The parameters, the probability and size of permanent breaks as well as the size of temporary shocks, are estimated using generalized method of moments estimation. Most shocks are permanent shocks. The Kalman filter is used as a convenient way to obtain forecasts.

Our results suggest that exposure to a temperate one standard deviation relative to the municipality's long-term temperature mean during pregnancy reduces birth weight by 20 g. and increases the probability a child is born with low birth weight by a 0.7 percentage point.

A data set is created that matches convoy movements to German U-boat locations in order to examine the escort composition and the number of merchant ships lost when an engagement occurred. I find that larger escort vessels, such as destroyers and frigates, were between 1.4 and 2.25 more effective than smaller escort vessels, such as corvettes, at preventing the loss of a merchant ship. As an application of these results, I examine the cost faced by the Allies from Canada failing to develop domestic naval manufacturing capabilities prior to World War II. By constructing a counterfactual scenario, I find that developing a Canadian domestic shipbuilding industry would have given the Allies a net benefit of 23.2 million 1940 Canadian dollars.","[Skogstad, Karl] Lakehead Univ, Econ, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada",Lakehead University,"Skogstad, K (通讯作者)，Lakehead Univ, Econ, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.",kaskogst@lakeheadu.ca,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The merit order effect describes the negative impact of renewable energy, typically supplied at the low marginal cost, to the electricity market. We show when thermal generators have a diverse energy portfolio, - meaning that they also control some or all of the renewable supplies, they offset the price declines due to the merit order effect because they strategically reduce their conventional energy supplies when renewable supply is high. In particular, when all renewable supply generates profits for only thermal power generators this offset is complete meaning that the merit order effect is totally neutralized. As a consequence, diversified energy portfolios may be welfare reducing. These results are robust to the presence of forward contracts and incomplete information (with or without correlated types). We further use our full model with incomplete information to study the volatility of energy prices in the presence of intermittent and uncertain renewable supplies.","[Acemoglu, Daron; Kakhbod, Ali] MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ozdaglar, Asuman] MIT, LIDS, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",daron@mit.edu; akakhbod@mit.edu; asuman@mit.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023",,NSF FORCES [1239054]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1239054] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF FORCES; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"We thank seminar participants at MIT, UC Berkeley and the 2014 Allerton Conference for helpful comments.

Estimation results indicate that in the long-run an increase in real effective exchange rate improves trade balance, while an increase in Turkish (foreign) income improves (deteriorates) trade balance. In the short-run, real effective exchange rate has no impact on trade balance, while an increase in domestic and foreign income negatively affects the Turkish trade balance.

In line with prior studies, the aim of this study is also to provide a means for investors helping them predict price movements of stocks from automotive industry by using Markov Chains as it is one of the most commonly applied models. Automotive industry is not only a major and industrial force worldwide, but also is a locomotive power that serves to many other industries. Daily closing stock price data of all 13 automotive companies listed in Borsa Istanbul (BIST) are collected for the calendar year of 2015. By defining three possible states (decrease, increase, and no change), individual state transition probability matrixes are formed for each company. Then, using the probabilities provided with these matrixes, different investment strategies are evaluated in the first five working days of 2016. According to the results of analysis, it is concluded that applying Markov Chains generates a positive income or at least minimizes the loss.","[Ataman, Gorkem; Acar, Ece; Durak, Mustafa Gurol] Yasar Univ, Izmir, Turkey",Yasar University,"Ataman, G (通讯作者)，Yasar Univ, Izmir, Turkey.",gorkem.ataman@yasar.edu.tr; ece.acar@yasar.edu.tr; gurol.durak@yasar.edu.tr,"sariyer, gorkem/AAA-1524-2019; Acar, Ece/AAP-9704-2021; Durak, Mustafa Gürol/D-1605-2017","sariyer, gorkem/0000-0002-8290-2248;",,,,,35,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,228,238,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300024,0

Our paper is an attempt to fill this void by quantifying the spillovers from developed countries on the bond markets of 25 emerging economies. We apply volatility and return spillover models to quantify the extent of the spillovers from developed markets (i.e. the US, UK and Japan) into emerging bond markets. We find that the extent of the return spillovers and volatility spillovers has not been symmetric across emerging markets. We explain these differences using bilateral factors such as trade volume, portfolio investment, cultural and geographical factors. The bilateral trade volume turns out to be the leading explanation for the extent of spillovers between our set of countries.","[Balli, Faruk; Hu, Xuan] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Private Bag 11-222, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Rana, Faisal] Effat Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business, POB 34689, Jeddah 21478, Saudi Arabia",Massey University; Effat University,"Balli, F (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Private Bag 11-222, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",f.balli@massey.ac.nz; farana@effatuniversity.edu.sa,"Balli, Faruk/H-8162-2019","Balli, Faruk/0000-0003-2372-4709",,,,,31,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,205,216,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000021,0

Despite diverse contributions of several areas of knowledge, particularly in the economic area, there is no definitive answer available to this issue. This gap is partly related to the fact that the micro and macroeconomic evidence available is not directly compatible, neither easily integrated. On the other hand, the factors that contribute to explain the evolution of savings over time and differences in savings rates across countries have a markedly multidisciplinary nature - including cultural, demographic and psychological factors. The integration of these areas of learning is important for any research outline, however is not simple. Being a vast and complex topic, the importance of continuing to research this topic in the future appears obvious, since not only savings provide a safeguard for families and society, but they are the main basis for private investment as well. This research aims studying the determinants of savings for the Portuguese families, in the long and very long term, having been built a set of various models of analysis, using multiple linear regression methodology, in order to contribute to this strand of literature and knowledge.

Compared with the previous literature, this paper systematically combs the mode of tea marketing channel alliance with professional cooperatives as the core, and the division of horizontal alliance and vertical alliance for the first time is an extension and development of the previous literature.","[Chen, Song; Yang, Jiangfan] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Song] Wuyi Univ, Wuyishan 354300, Peoples R China","Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Wuyi University, Fujian","Chen, S (通讯作者)，Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Chen, S (通讯作者)，Wuyi Univ, Wuyishan 354300, Peoples R China.",,"Yang, Jiang/HZI-6764-2023",,China Oolong Tea Collaborative Innovation Project [K8015H01C],China Oolong Tea Collaborative Innovation Project,"Program of Foundation: China Oolong Tea Collaborative Innovation Project, 2011(Program Code: K8015H01C).",,6,1,1,1,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-402-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,106.0,,,,,,616,619,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI9GR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416081200140,0

Our essay asks how well the social contract thesis applies in three different types of regimes. We review classic literature on the socialist social contract in light of newly available archival evidence on the Soviet Union. We turn then to reform-era China and Putin's Russia, finding that these post-socialist regimes create distinctive market social contracts'.

Then the insurer is obliged to pay the surrender value of policy. It appears that there is another possibility for the insured to receive prior financial gratification from life insurance. The insured can sell his policy on the secondary market of life insurance (the viatical market). In such a situation he obtains an amount that is greater than the surrender value (and less than the death benefit). Then the viatical company takes a fee for the insurance premiums, and in case of death of the insured gets the death benefits. Such agreements to resell the rights to death benefits are offered to people who have become terminally ill (viatical settlement). The aim of the paper is to study the influence of the moment of falling ill (compared to the age and sex of the insured and duration of insurance) on the expected profit of the viatical company.

A full traceability of products can be realized by the adaptation of numbering and bar code systems, as well as by electronic and biological marking systems, on the basis of their appropriate combination. Identification technologies make the traceability of a product in a product chain possible and their use is relevant during almost every phase of the product line, as it is necessary to provide for the unambiguous identification of each individual product. In order to compare the identification technologies, we have to consider several factors. While there are numerous advantages and disadvantages for each solution in comparison with the other techniques, we still cannot unanimously choose the one that conforms to the requirements of the meat industry product chain the best, as there are different challenges on each step of the product chain. We performed the comparison of the identification technologies on the basis of different characteristics. Our objective was to explore, systemize and analyze those identification technologies applicable for meat industrial product chains. The regulations of identification provide for the continuity and reliability of tracing among independent partners. Our research focused on food tracing systems, utilized identification systems and those which may become applicable in the future. We also studied information technology tools and examined the establishment of Hungarian meat industry enterprises. Based on our survey, we established that the bar code technique is currently the absolute leader in the sector, although modern solutions provide numerous advantages, their profitable application is not possible for the time being.","[Fuzesi, Istvan; Lengyel, Peter; Csoban, Katalin; Szilagyi, Robert] Univ Debrecen, Fac Econ & Business, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Füzesi, I (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Fac Econ & Business, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",fuzesi.istvan@econ.unideb.hu,"Lengyel, Peter/S-3438-2017; Füzesi, István/GSN-2440-2022","Füzesi, István/0000-0003-0832-4694",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,99,109,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.650,0.0,,,11,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200008,0

It has made visible the major faultlines and fissures that underlie the so-called United Kingdom' (UK) and our increasingly globalized world. But the precise nature of those faultlines and fissures requires multiple strands of critical analysis and interpretation. To date, most analyses have highlighted the socio-economic class and immigration or rather race/empire reasons for the Brexit vote neglecting their gendered dimensions. Building on the framework developed in Scandalous Economics we show how gendered analysis both illuminates and complicates dominant explanations of the Brexit vote. We interrogate the agents of Brexit - highlighting the paradox of men's dominance of the Brexit campaign and women's rise in the political crisis that ensued after the referendum vote. We also examine the intersectional inequalities that have made Brexit conceivable from a gender perspective, and its likely impact given the austerity policies and global chains of migrant labour upon which the UK economy depends. We conclude that critical feminist political economy broadens as well as globalizes our analysis of international political economy. Moreover, this analysis of Brexit is a lens which can be used to interrogate the spread of populism aka Trumpism' elsewhere.","[Hozic, Aida A.] Univ Florida, Dept Polit Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [True, Jacqui] Monash Univ, Sch Social Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [True, Jacqui] Peace Res Inst, Oslo, Norway",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Monash University; Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO),"Hozic, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Polit Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,,"True, Jacqui/0000-0002-5412-8929",Australian Research Council [FT140101201]; Australian Research Council [FT140101201] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Australian Research Council Future Fellowship Award; ID: FT140101201.,,53,44,46,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Contrary to stochastic mechanisms, however, lottery mechanisms are commonly used in real life for indivisible goods allocation. To help facilitate the design of practical lottery mechanisms, we provide new tools for obtaining stochastic improvements in lotteries. As applications, we propose lottery mechanisms that improve upon the widely used random serial dictatorship mechanism and a lottery representation of its competitor, the probabilistic serial mechanism. The tools we provide here can be useful in developing welfare-enhanced new lottery mechanisms for practical applications such as school choice.","[Kesten, Onur] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Kurino, Morimitsu] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Engn Informat & Syst, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan; [Nesterov, Alexander S.] WZB, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany",Carnegie Mellon University; University of Tsukuba,"Kesten, O (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",okesten@andrew.cmu.edu; kurino@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp; alexander.nesterov@wzb.eu,"Nesterov, Alexander/F-2416-2018",,"Maastricht University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K13011, 15H03327, 15K13002] Funding Source: KAKEN","Maastricht University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers and seminar participants at various universities and conferences for useful discussions.

It consists of proactiveness, risk-taking, innovativeness, and (in some operationalisations) competitive aggressiveness and autonomy. The main question behind the paper is related to the possibility of employing quantitative data to measure the entrepreneurial orientation. In the paper, that question is examined in relation to one dimension: proactiveness. It is hypothesised, that quantitative data may be used to measure proactiveness. The hypothesis is tested within the sample of 85 small and medium-sized enterprises operating in Malopolska Region in Poland. In the questionnaire, the proactiveness was surveyed with items proposed by Covin and Slevin (1989), in parallel with quantitative items (e.g., number of business-plans, applications and projects implemented and number of employees who found new ideas). The results support the hypothesis and suggest some improvements of the configuration of tested items. In particular, it was found that items related to opportunity identification and employees' participation are highly correlated to proactiveness (measured with items proposed by Covin and Slevin). The recommendations include testing other items related to proactiveness, as well as to other dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation. That can enable to propose a quantitative scale of EO, that would be useful for future research. The paper contributes to the theory of organisational entrepreneurship through proposing some quantitative measures of proactiveness, what develop the research methodology of the field.","[Kusa, Rafal] AGH Univ Sci & Technol Krakow, Krakow, Poland",AGH University of Krakow,"Kusa, R (通讯作者)，AGH Univ Sci & Technol Krakow, Krakow, Poland.",rkusa@zarz.agh.edu.pl,"Kusa, Rafal/C-5746-2017","Kusa, Rafal/0000-0002-9819-897X",Faculty of Management of AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow (MNiSzW) [11/11.200.272],Faculty of Management of AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow (MNiSzW),This paper benefited from discussions with Mateusz Codogni and Joanna Duda from the Faculty of Management of AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow.

An example from the environmental policy process concerning the introduction of the best available technology will be presented. This highly contested policy led to significant opposition from industry groups and disputes between government actors. The case demonstrates that industrial interests in Russia are able to exert considerable influence on the policy process; however, this influence is not absolute and requires closer scrutiny. Political leadership was found to be an important factor in achieving policy outcomes. However, for the most part, the policy process was found to be heavily bureaucratized, and dominated by a range of competing interests.","[Martus, Ellen] Univ New South Wales, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Martus, E (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, Australia.",ellen.martus@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,69,16,17,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The research is based on the role of organizational culture in tourist destination development. The main purpose is to determine whether there is a connection between the main stakeholders' organizational cultures and how they affect the success of a tourist destination management. Tourist destination management based on a cluster model introduces multiple advantages for the stakeholders, thereby implying some organizational changes as well. The research results indicate that common targets, basic values and symbols of the stakeholders lead to the development of a recognizable, successful and competitive tourist destination. The cooperation of stakeholders in a tourist destination requires a continuous, multi-year work and effort to maintain a tourist destination brand. Human resources have the key role particularly in implementing destination projects, promoting basic destination values, strengthening brand identity and increasing guest satisfaction with the tourist destination offer. Higher level of employee motivation to achieve common targets at the level of tourist destination influences a more open and flexible approach of employees to organizational changes. The qualitative research was conducted on the example of the Northwest Istria tourist cluster (Croatia) using the method of interviewing the formal stakeholders' representatives and the survey by a questionnaire applied for the other main offer holders within the Cluster. This research contributes to a better understanding of the role of organizational culture in managing tourist destination development.","[Medica, Antonela Frank; Pavlovic, Danijela Krizman] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Medica, AF (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",antonela.frank@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

However, business praxis is such that only one person is responsible for most business decisions in a company, especially smaller ones. Therefore, export often represents a secondary activity because the management is limited to leading the businesses on the local market. Consequently, the goal of this paper is to test the consistency of organizational capacities involved around export activities, as well as their influence on the export result. Survey, researched on a sample of export companies in Croatia, showed that organizational capacities for export activities have a two sided effect on business. In fact, the support of management in bringing different, risky decisions have a negative effect, while controlling standard procedures and encouraging creativity and efficiency of employers have a positive effect.","[Miloloza, Helena] Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Miloloza, H (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",hmiloloza@efzg.hr,,"Nikolic, Helena/0000-0002-6757-9569",,,,,13,0,0,1,8,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,288,294,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.663,0.0,,,7,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200021,0

Clower's article A Reconsideration of the Microfoundations of Monetary Theory (1967) deeply influenced the course of modern monetary economics. On the one hand, it questioned Don Patinkin's (1956) project to integrate monetary and Walrasian value theory. On the other hand, it was the fountainhead of the cash-in-advance models a la Robert J. Lucas (1980), one of the most widely used approaches to monetary theory since the 1980s. Despite this influence, Clower's project to integrate monetary and value theory remains an enigma. My paper intends to resolve it. This is a difficult task since Clower never completed the monetary theory outlined in his 1967 article. To overcome this difficulty, I characterise the intellectual context from which Clower's contribution emerged and have recourse to a reconstruction of his project. This reconstruction is based on the analysis of published and unpublished materials, written by Clower before and after the 1967 article. It is argued that Clower sought to elaborate a disequilibrium monetary theory whilst retaining the two pillars of Patinkin's integration, i.e., the introduction of money into utility functions and the real-balance effect. I trace the origins, account for the originality, and discuss the challenges of this project.","[Plassard, Romain] Univ Lille, LEM, CNRS, UMR 9221, Lille, France",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Plassard, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, LEM, CNRS, UMR 9221, Lille, France.",plassardromain@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

While scholars have questioned the ability of IOs to address economic and social challenges posed by globalisation, recent experience of the International Labour Organization (ILO) illustrates how supranational governance can mediate between national and international governance of labour standards in cross-border production systems such as GVCs. Briefly examining three cases reveals concrete dimensions in which the ILO is applying its structure and normative framework to create new configurations of coordinated governance and leveraging its convening power to promote social upgrading in national and GVCs: (1) The Protocol on Forced Labour (2014), which strengthens and updates existing ILO core conventions and promotes cross-border cooperation between states; (2) the ILO's response in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza tragedy in April 2013, convening public and private stakeholders at the national and international levels and (3) the Better Work Programme, a partnership between the ILO and the International Finance Corporation, that involves tripartite participation at the national and global levels.","[Posthuma, Anne] Int Labor Org, Brazil Off, Geneva, Switzerland; [Rossi, Arianna] Int Labor Org, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Posthuma, A (通讯作者)，Int Labor Org, Brazil Off, Geneva, Switzerland.",posthuma@ilo.org,,"Rossi, Arianna/0009-0001-7000-2779; Posthuma, Anne Caroline/0000-0001-5401-7703",,,,,56,30,32,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The BBSF cooperation framework combines in a unique model the three main dimensions involved in BBSF cooperation (strategic, management and social) with the internal and external factors influencing business collaboration. Using the developed framework, the author summarizes why BBSF should cooperate, the problems BBSF face adopting collaborative approaches and the factors influencing interfirm collaboration effectiveness. The findings of this work provide some important implications for managers concerned with adopting collaborative approaches. From a managerial perspective, it shows that co-operation between BBSF is a valid approach for improving their performance as long as the success factors are considered, which in turn, reduces the risk of alliance failure.","[Rahab] Jenderal Soedirman Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Management Dept, HR Boenyamin St 708, Purwokerto, Central Java, Indonesia; [Anwar, Nurul] Jenderal Soedirman Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Econ Sci, HR Boenyamin St 708, Purwokerto, Central Java, Indonesia; [Setyawan, Darmanto Sahat] Jenderal Soedirman Univ, Fac Social & Polit Sci, HR Boenyamin St 708, Purwokerto, Central Java, Indonesia",Universitas Jenderal Soedirman; Universitas Jenderal Soedirman; Universitas Jenderal Soedirman,"Rahab (通讯作者)，Jenderal Soedirman Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Management Dept, HR Boenyamin St 708, Purwokerto, Central Java, Indonesia.",rahab240878@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,687,692,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300069,0

Utilising the systems of provision/10Cs approach, which takes as its starting point that the norms and meanings associated with homeownership are complex and conditioned by the contradictory interaction of cultural and material factors, the paper shows how the rise of owner-occupation reflected changes in socially shared images and meanings around housing as well as material benefits associated with the tenure. However, the complex analysis of material culture facilitated by the 10Cs reveals that the culture of owner-occupation is not hegemonic. While housing policy since the 1980s has given material and cultural impetus to owner-occupation in Britain, the reflexive and resistive capacities of consumers, when coupled with the competing meanings attached to housing and the growing dysfunctionality of the current housing model, have constrained the dominance of the ethos of owner-occupation and render its future vulnerable.","[Robertson, Mary] Univ Greenwich, Dept Int Business & Econ, London, England",University of Greenwich,"Robertson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Dept Int Business & Econ, London, England.",maryrobs@googlemail.com,,,,,,,42,9,10,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We draw upon different strands of literature, including scholarship in International Political Economy and Economic Geography on Global Value Chains, literature on finance and law in Institutional Economics, and work from Economic Sociology on network dynamics within markets. This scholarship assists us in highlighting three variables in how GWCs are articulated and change according to: (1) the complexity of transactions, (2) regulatory liability, and (3) innovation capacities among suppliers of products used in wealth chains. We then differentiate five types of GWC governance - Market, Modular, Relational, Captive, and Hierarchy - which range from simple 'off shelf' products shielded from regulators by advantageous international tax laws to highly complex and flexible innovative financial products produced by large financial institutions and corporations. This article highlights how GWCs intersect with value chains, and provides brief case examples of wealth chains and how they interact.","[Seabrooke, Leonard] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Int Polit Econ & Econ Sociol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wigan, Duncan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Int Polit Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Seabrooke, Leonard] Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, Oslo, Norway",Copenhagen Business School; Copenhagen Business School,"Seabrooke, L (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Int Polit Econ & Econ Sociol, Copenhagen, Denmark.;Seabrooke, L (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, Oslo, Norway.",,"Seabrooke, Leonard/F-7091-2013","Seabrooke, Leonard/0000-0001-5581-3293","'STEAL - Systems of Tax Evasion and Laundering' project - Norwegian Research Council, NORGLOBAL Taxation, Capital and Development Programme [212210/H30-STEAL]","'STEAL - Systems of Tax Evasion and Laundering' project - Norwegian Research Council, NORGLOBAL Taxation, Capital and Development Programme","Research support for this article was provided by the 'STEAL - Systems of Tax Evasion and Laundering' project [Grant Number 212210/H30-STEAL] funded by the Norwegian Research Council, NORGLOBAL Taxation, Capital and Development Programme, 2012-2016.",,114,102,104,2,84,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

A Test of the Disjunctive Thesis,REAL ESTATE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROPERTY-VALUES; FORECLOSURES; DECISION; IMPACT,"We test the disjunctive thesis as it relates to mortgage contracts and find that a liquidated damages clause shifts ones view of a mortgage from a promise to perform to either a promise to perform or pay compensatory damages. However, when a strategic mortgage default is responsible for the breach, the perceived immorality of this action overwhelms the liquidated damages clause effect in support of the disjunctive thesis. We also find that people's conscious experimentally stated preference moral stance on installment loan (mortgages, auto loans, credit card debt and even cell phone contracts) default significantly differs from their subconscious experimentally revealed preference moral stance indicating a difference between what people say they believe and what they actually believe.","[Seiler, Michael J.] Coll William & Mary, Raymond A Mason Sch Business, Dept Finance, Williamsburg, VA 23186 USA",William & Mary,"Seiler, MJ (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Raymond A Mason Sch Business, Dept Finance, Williamsburg, VA 23186 USA.",Michael.Seiler@mason.wm.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,31,15,15,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,,2017,45.0,1,,,,,204,230,,10.1111/1540-6229.12142,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,EJ4KH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393185200007,0

The theory of constraints can apply successfully to healthcare organizations, to solve problems of capacity management, reducing the inpatient length of stay and increasing the satisfaction from the offering services as has been proved by international research. In this paper, we study the problem from this point of view.

Reformers in late imperial China called for the modernization of educational institutions, seeing in Western education the skills necessary to develop China's economy. In the late 19th century, the traditional education system was joined by a modern, Western track, which offered teaching in science, math, social science, law, and engineering. In this paper, early 20th century employee records from the Tianjin-Pukou Railroad are analyzed to identify differences in labor market outcomes associated with study in the traditional and modern educational systems. The employee records reveal that modern and traditional education were both associated with wage premiums, but that these were significantly larger for individuals trained at high levels in the modern system, especially those trained in engineering. Individuals trained in the traditional system worked disproportionately in the clerical department of the railroad, while those with modern education were more often in managerial and technical roles. Qualitative and quantitative evidence suggests that these results are not driven by sorting into educational institutions according to ability. These findings indicate that beyond years of schooling, the content of schooling can play an important role in the process of economic development.","[Yuchtman, Noam] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Mail 545 Student Serv Bldg,1900, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Yuchtman, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Mail 545 Student Serv Bldg,1900, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",yuchtman@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,53,15,18,1,27,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

The study obtains the government to choose the latter condition under the two kinds of decision making, which is to maximize the financial income and maximize the social welfare. It also analyzes the policy implications of the land price and the real estate tax rate in order to achieve the stated goal. The study found that the tax rate is greater than the entire social welfare maximization of the real estate tax rate when the government does not consider the interests of real estate developers. When the optimal land leasing that is considered the social welfare maximization by the government is less than or equal to the land leasing without considering the interests of real estate developers land leasing, the government should reduce the collection of land leasing to increase the interests of real estate developers and lower tax rates to increase the interests of consumers. On the contrary, the government should increase the land leasing fee by increasing the land transfer to increase the interests of consumers and higher tax rates to increase government revenue.","[Zhang Xuefeng] North China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",North China University of Technology,"Zhang, XF (通讯作者)，North China Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zxf511@163.com,,,North China University of Technology outstanding young teacher training program; Beijing Social Science Foundation; Foundation for The Excellent Youth Scholars of Beijing [2016000020124G021],North China University of Technology outstanding young teacher training program; Beijing Social Science Foundation; Foundation for The Excellent Youth Scholars of Beijing,"Supported by the North China University of Technology outstanding young teacher training program, funded Beijing Social Science Foundation (Grant No.16LJC008) and Foundation for The Excellent Youth Scholars of Beijing(Grant No.2016000020124G021)",,12,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-379-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,23.0,,,,,,21,24,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Law; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law; Public Administration,BJ6HI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426687800006,0

The paper provides the first systematic analysis of this important development in institutional design using a novel data set on the organization of public communication in 48 IOs between 1950 and 2015. It identifies self-legitimation as a key driver of centralization in the face of increased levels of politicization, that is, public awareness and activism directed at IOs. Empirically, the study suggests that the centralization of public communication significantly increases as transnational civil society organizes and gains access to IO decision-making. Further, politicization in terms of contentious activism and public scandals substantially accounts for varying levels of centralization across IOs.","[Ecker-Ehrhardt, Matthias] Free Univ Berlin, Arbeitsstelle Transnatl Beziehungen Aussen & Sich, Ihnestr 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Ecker-Ehrhardt, M (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Arbeitsstelle Transnatl Beziehungen Aussen & Sich, Ihnestr 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",ecker@zedat.fu-berlin.de,,"Ecker-Ehrhardt, Matthias/0000-0001-8396-1234",German Research Foundation [EC 323/1-2],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Research for this article was funded by the German Research Foundation (EC 323/1-2).

The developmental role of external finance is therefore based on its strategic marginal contribution to relieve such constraints. External debt in particular also allows countries to pursue industrial strategies without reliance on foreign direct investment. These insights are revisited in this paper as a critical input to both mainstream and heterodox contemporary scholarship on debt and development. While the mainstream generally avoids discussion of state-led industrial policy, the heterodox has converged on a view that developing countries should avoid external finance. The contrasting external account histories of South Korea and Brazil are examined to demonstrate the validity of the classic insights and the contemporary fallacies. While the South Korean case speaks much to its geopolitical context, this does not necessarily refute the principle that post-war late development engenders an intensive demand for external finance, which must be met if industrialisation strategies are not to be stymied, as in the case of Brazil, no matter how effectively domestic strategies are conceived and implemented.","[Fischer, Andrew M.] Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands; [Fischer, Andrew M.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Fischer, AM (通讯作者)，Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands.;Fischer, AM (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,"Fischer, Andrew M/ABD-3475-2021","Fischer, Andrew M/0000-0002-4821-9058",AIDSOCPRO project (Aiding Social Protection: the Political Economy of Externally Financing Social Policy in Developing Countries) from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [638647]; European Research Council (ERC) [638647] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),AIDSOCPRO project (Aiding Social Protection: the Political Economy of Externally Financing Social Policy in Developing Countries) from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The author gratefully acknowledges the advice, feedback and/or encouragement on this research over the years from Lavinia Barros de Castro, Gary Dymski, Jayati Ghosh, Jan Kregel, Kari Polanyi Levitt, James Putzel, Ken Shadlen and Andy Sumner, and the generous help in providing historical data from Lavinia Barros de Castro and Ilcheong Yi.

Findings do not support hypotheses that judge favor titleholders or disfavor fighters given point deductions but do support bias toward larger betting favorites, those with insurmountable leads, and the fighter who won the previous round. Findings provide nonexperimental support for possible biases in a relatively opaque decision environment involving substantial complexity.

In contrast with previous research, the analysis is not restricted to hospitality workers, includes all types of occupations, and is based on a nationwide representative sample. The explanatory models of job satisfaction are estimated using ordered logit techniques, considering personal and household characteristics as well as objective and subjective job characteristics. The results indicate that job satisfaction is significantly lower among tourism workers and that in some cases notable differences exist between the factors influencing job satisfaction in the tourism sector compared with the rest of the service sector, which might be relevant for managers and policymakers.","[Lillo-Banuls, Adelaida; Casado-Diaz, Jose M.; Simon, Hipolito] Univ Alicante, Alacant, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Lillo-Bañuls, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, POB 99, Alacant 03690, Spain.",alillo@ua.es,"Casado-Díaz, José M./K-5503-2013; Lillo-Bañuls, Adelaida/K-6570-2014; Simon, Hipolito/K-8807-2014","Casado-Díaz, José M./0000-0001-5310-7678; Lillo-Bañuls, Adelaida/0000-0003-0672-6331; Simon, Hipolito/0000-0001-7668-307X","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [CSO2017-86474-R, CSO2014-55780-C3-2-P]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) under grants CSO2017-86474-R and CSO2014-55780-C3-2-P (National Plan for Research, Development and Innovation) (MINECO/AEI/ERDF, EU).",,63,14,17,4,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

How generous is disputed. Based on standard finance theory and recommendations from the OECD and the IMF, the value that firms attach to future deductions depends on the risks of these, and the companies' after-tax weighted-average cost of capital cannot be applied directly. As an example, a simple model quantifies the difference between pre-tax and post-tax systematic risk when tax deductions are less risky than pre-tax cash flows. Osmundsen et al. (2015) suggest that the difference must be ignored by oil companies, since they cannot find the separate market values of tax deductions. But companies operating in different jurisdictions cannot then appreciate differences in tax systems, not even approximately, which will lead to suboptimal decisions. Tax designers may instead assume that companies have gradually adopted more sophisticated methods of investment decision making.","[Davis, Graham A.] Colorado Sch Mines, Payne Inst Earth Resources, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Davis, Graham A.] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Lund, Diderik] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095, NO-0317 Oslo, Norway",Colorado School of Mines; Colorado School of Mines; University of Oslo,"Davis, GA (通讯作者)，Colorado Sch Mines, Payne Inst Earth Resources, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA.;Davis, GA (通讯作者)，Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",gdavis@mines.edu; diderik.lund@econ.uio.no,,,Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"Lund was a member of the Norwegian public commission on petroleum taxation 1999-2000, but has not participated in the Ministry's work with subsequent reforms of the system.

We synthesize the distribution extracted from a panel of option prices and exploit linear relationships between risk-neutral cumulants and latent factors within the continuous time affine stochastic volatility framework. We find that fitting the Andersen et al. (Journal of Financial Economics, 2015, 117(3), 558-584) option valuation model to risk-neutral moments captures the bulk of the information in option prices. Our estimation strategy is effective, easy to implement, and robust, as it allows for a direct linear filtering of the latent factors and a quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. From a practical perspective, employing risk-neutral moments instead of option prices also helps circumvent several sources of numerical errors and substantially lessens the computational burden inherent in working with a large panel of option contracts.","[Feunou, Bruno] Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada; [Okou, Cedric] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Finance, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Bank of Canada; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Feunou, B (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",feun@bankofcanada.ca,,"Feunou, Bruno/0000-0001-8023-0161",,,,,43,6,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

Different business models have emerged in which travellers can either pre-pay for their mobility services bundled into a MaaS plan, or pay-as-they-go using a smart app linked to the service. This study aims to understand how large the potential market of MaaS would be if travellers are offered this one stop access to a range of mobility services, and how much potential users might value each item included in a MaaS plan. A stated choice survey of 252 individuals administered via a face-to-face method is conducted in Sydney, Australia and a state of the art preference model is estimated to address the research questions. Results indicate that almost half of the sampled respondents would take MaaS offerings, and the potential uptake levels vary significantly across population segments, with infrequent car users being the most likely adopters, and car non-users the least. On average, Sydney travellers are willing to pay $6.40 for an hour of access to car-share, with one-way car-share valued more than station-based car-share. Estimated willingness-to-pay for unlimited use of public transport is $5.90 per day which is much lower than the current daily cap. These findings suggest a careful segmentation of the market and a cross-subsidy strategy is likely to be required by MaaS suppliers to obtain a commercially viable uptake level.","[Ho, Chinh Q.; Hensher, David A.; Mulley, Corinne; Wong, Yale Z.] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, ITLS, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Ho, CQ (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, ITLS, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",chinh.ho@sydney.edu.au; david.hensher@sydney.edu.au; corinne.mulley@sydney.edu.au; yale.wong@sydney.edu.au,"Mulley, Corinne/ACN-0179-2022; Wong, Yale Z/N-9486-2019","Wong, Yale Z/0000-0001-7512-7645; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242; Mulley, Corinne/0000-0001-6411-1269; Ho, Chinh/0000-0001-8006-0123",University of Sydney Business School Pilot Research Scheme,University of Sydney Business School Pilot Research Scheme,"This paper contributes to the research program of the Volvo Research and Education Foundation Bus Rapid Transit (BRT+) Centre of Excellence, as well as the TfNSW program in ITLS associated with the Chair in Public Transport.

The degree of servicification is measured as the share of service value added in manufacturing exports. Service inputs are either from domestic market or from foreign countries, which are measured by the domestic servicification and the foreign servicification, respectively. Using the international input-output tables from 1995 to 2011, we estimate the degree of servicification across 61 countries with a focus on Asian nations which have been rarely studied in previous research. We observed an evident trend of servicification in manufacturing in the Asian countries, especially in the 16 countries associated with Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Asian countries tend to have a lower level of domestic servicification but a higher level of foreign servicification than OECD countries. We also identified five key factors in driving the trend of servicification. Countries with broader participation and lower positions in GVCs tend to have higher levels of foreign servicification in manufacturing. Improvements in information and communication technology (ICT) also raise the level of foreign servicification.

We also examine whether the heterogeneity in environmental regulatory standards between these regions has emboldened Asian airlines to be less eco-friendly and/or more market-share seeking. We find that the environmental performance of European airlines improved continuously between 2007 and 2013, unlike their competitors in Asia. We argue that this improvement in the environmental performance of the European airlines could be an outcome of the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), which set incentives for European airlines to renew their fleets and optimise their operations. Our technological gap ratio estimates also point to some Asian airlines outperforming all other airlines on technological measures, indicating they operate in a more favourable business environment. Overall, our method contributes to the methodological enhancement of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and allows deeper insights into firm operations in general, and environmental efficiency analysis of European and Asian airlines in particular.","[Arjomandi, Amir] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Dakpo, K.

The betweenness axiom is a weaker version of the independence axiom of expected utility theory. Numerous empirical studies documented systematic violations of the betweenness axiom in revealed individual choice under uncertainty. This paper shows that these systematic violations can be linked to another behavioral regularity-choice shifts in a group decision making. Choice shifts are observed if an individual faces the same decision problem but makes a different choice when deciding alone and in a group.","[Blavatskyy, Pavlo R.] Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier 4, France; [Feri, Francesco] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham, Surrey, England",Montpellier Business School; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Blavatskyy, PR (通讯作者)，Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier 4, France.",p.blavatskyy@montpellier-bs.com; Francesco.Feri@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2018,85.0,3-4,,,,,321,331,,10.1007/s11238-018-9664-x,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GY3JH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448446600003,0

The same is true in Clovis, New Mexico, which is a small town in arid eastern New Mexico, whose sole water source is from the dwindling southern Ogallala Aquifer. Using premises-level monthly panel data from 2006 to 2015 combined with climate data and additional controls, we apply a fixed effects instrumental variable approach to estimate municipal water demand. Results indicate that utility-controlled actions such as price increases and rebates for xeriscaping and water saving technology have contributed to the decline. Overall water demand was found to be price inelastic and in the neighborhood of similar to 0.50; however, premises receiving toilet and washing machine rebates were relatively more price inelastic and premises receiving landscaping rebates were more price elastic, though still inelastic. In addition, the average premises receiving its first toilet rebate reduced water use by 8.4%, washing machine rebates lowered use by 9.2%, and the average landscaping rebate reduced water use by less than 5.0%. From the utility's perspective, and assuming a 5.0% discount rate, levelized cost analysis indicates that toilet rebates are 34% more cost effective than washing machine rebates and nearly 800% more cost effective than landscaping rebates over their respective lives per volume of water conserved. While this research focuses on Clovis, estimation results can be leveraged by other small to mid-sized cities experiencing declining supplies, confronting climate change, and with little opportunity for near-term supply enhancement.","[O'Donnell, Michael; Berrens, Robert P.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [O'Donnell, Michael] Univ New Mexico, Bur Business & Econ Res, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico; University of New Mexico,"O'Donnell, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.;O'Donnell, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Bur Business & Econ Res, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",mo8684@unm.edu,,"O'Donnell, Michael/0000-0002-4146-8668",,,,,84,1,1,0,14,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2382-624X,2382-6258,,WATER ECON POLICY,Water Econ.

The two cohorts weigh learning Japanese in the context of internal and external opportunities, and pursue different strategies - deliberative acquisition and deliberative opposition. Exploring the broader meanings of language learning beyond skill acquisition, the article suggests that language is more than an individual asset or a common code for workers to build collective power. Social reproduction of language is embedded in workers' choice of pathways for social mobility which was created in the social transition and has shifted over time in China. These findings make a contribution to the sociology of language training in work, by challenging structural and cultural theories that underplay the agency of workers in assessing language as a resource for labour power development.","[Zheng, Yu] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Management, Asian Business & Int Human Resource Management, Egham, Surrey, England; [Zheng, Yu] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Management, Org Studies & Comparat Management, Egham, Surrey, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Zheng, Y (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Management, Egham Hill, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",yu.zheng@rhul.ac.uk,,"Zheng, Yu/0000-0002-5885-2674",,,,,44,5,5,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

However, the high price of gluten-free substitute foods is likely to generate a welfare loss for consumers who drop gluten from their diet. Using original data on retail prices in four major UK supermarkets and consumption data from the UK Living Cost and Food Survey, we simulate the welfare change associated to a switch to the gluten-free diet. Within the Bread and Cereals category, retail price data show that the average price of gluten-free products is 1.12 pound/100g relative to pound 0.59/100g of gluten-containing products. Our estimates indicate that on average in the UK coeliac consumers have to pay an extra pound 10 per week to maintain their utility levels prior to the dietary switch. This correspond to 29% of the weekly food budget. Results by income quartile are suggestive of regressive effects and the welfare loss for low-income consumers is estimated at 36% of their food budget compared to 24% of high-income consumers.

It allows for fixed and time effects (FE-TE) and derives a general formula for the bias of the FE-TE estimator which generalizes the well-known Nickell bias formula derived for the pure autoregressive dynamic panel data models. It shows that in the presence of weakly exogenous regressors inference based on the FE-TE estimator will result in size distortions unless N/T is sufficiently small. To deal with the bias and size distortion of the FE-TE estimator the use of a half-panel jackknife FE-TE estimator is considered and its asymptotic distribution is derived. It is shown that the bias of the half-panel jackknife FE-TE estimator is of order T-2, and for valid inference it is only required that N/T(3)0, as N,T jointly. Extension to unbalanced panel data models is also provided. The theoretical results are illustrated with Monte Carlo evidence. It is shown that the FE-TE estimator can suffer from large size distortions when N>T, with the half-panel jackknife FE-TE estimator showing little size distortions. The use of half-panel jackknife FE-TE estimator is illustrated with two empirical applications from the literature.","[Chudik, Alexander] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Pesaran, M.

Building on transnational perspectives, the European Parliament is conceptualized as an actor capable of pursuing autonomous diplomatic behaviour through cross-border agency over its elected representatives, its bureaucracy, as well as through European party federations. A novel framework is proposed, built around the hypothesis that parliamentary and executive actors co-operate by exchanging institutional, information, legitimacy and access resources in order to reach their goals more effectively. To demonstrate the argument empirically, the article studies EU-facilitated mediation talks in Macedonia (2015-17). Building on semi-structured interviews with 27 key stakeholders, the analysis shows how during the different stages of the mediation, executive and parliamentary actors exchanged crucial diplomatic resources in order to effectively conclude and implement the so-called Prino-agreements between the government and opposition parties.","[Fonck, Daan] Fac Social Sci, Leuven Int & European Studies, Pk Str 45,Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",,"Fonck, D (通讯作者)，Fac Social Sci, Leuven Int & European Studies, Pk Str 45,Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",daan.fonck@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,54,7,7,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The natural yield curve extends the idea of the natural rate of interest defined at a single maturity to one defined for all maturities. If the actual real yield curve matches the natural yield curve, the output gap will converge to zero. An empirical analysis using data for Japan shows that past monetary easing programs expanded the gap between the actual real yield curve and the natural yield curve mainly for short and medium maturities and led to accommodative financial conditions. By contrast, the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing policy has expanded the gap for long maturities as well as short and medium maturities. The natural yield curve is expected to provide a useful benchmark in the conduct of both conventional monetary policy and unconventional monetary policy aiming to influence the entire yield curve.","[Imakubo, Kei; Kojima, Haruki] Bank Japan, Chuo Ku, 2-1-1 Nihonbashi Hongokucho, Tokyo 1030021, Japan; [Nakajima, Jouchi] Bank Int Settlements, Cent Bahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",Bank of Japan; Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Nakajima, J (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Cent Bahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",jouchi.nakajima@bis.org,,,,,,,16,4,4,1,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Although scholarly interest in the ECI is strong, only isolated studies have examined the factors that shape the intention to use it. This article fills a gap in the literature by examining how personal benefits from the EU, value-based assessments of the EU, and political efficacy (internal and external) may trigger potential use of the ECI. It develops a model that is tested with recent Eurobarometer data. Results show that personal benefits from the EU are key determinants of the intention to use the ECI while considerations based on democratic values play a less important role. In addition, internal political efficacy emerges as a strong predictor of potential use.

However, studies examining the health dynamics of same-sex relationships are sparser because few nationally representative longitudinal datasets collect information on adults' sexual identity. Using newly available data on sexual minorities from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, we estimate the effects of Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual (LGB) identification and same-sex relationships on health dynamics. We document two key findings. First, sexual minorities in Australia are more likely to engage in risky health behaviors and report worse health than their heterosexual counterparts. Second, after exploiting the longitudinal nature of the HILDA and accounting for selection into relationships using the dynamic panel approach of Kohn and Averett (2014), we find that while opposite-sex partnerships are associated with a 3 to 7 percentage-point decline in risky health behaviors and improved physical and mental health, the health benefits of same-sex relationships are weaker, particularly for men.

Ensuring rider's satisfaction in such an environment has led several public transit agencies to adopt different marketing strategies. For example, market segmentation analyses are commonly employed by transit agencies to identify groups of users, which are subsequently used as a base for developing policies and strategies aimed at improving customer satisfaction. However, previous studies adopting this market segmentation approach have predominantly ignored spatial and contextual factors related to the transit network and the built environment of where a user resides, resulting in network-wide policies that are difficult to implement especially for agencies with scarce resources. This study presents a new segmentation approach that incorporates spatial and contextual factors in addition to other rider's preferences and satisfaction levels with commuter rail service in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, Canada. Including these factors in a market segmentation analysis has enabled us to recommend service interventions at a local and finer scale compared to previous studies, while at the same time providing the greatest impact on a specified segment of riders. This research provides transit planners and policy makers with a spatial segmentation approach, which can be used to maximize the benefits of service improvements intended to increase satisfaction with public transit among certain groups of users in a region.","[Grise, Emily; El-Geneidy, Ahmed] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C2, Canada",McGill University,"El-Geneidy, A (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Suite 400,815 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C2, Canada.",emily.grise@mail.mcgill.ca; ahmed.elgeneidy@mcgill.ca,"El-Geneidy, Ahmed/N-3904-2013","El-Geneidy, Ahmed/0000-0002-0942-4016",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We wish to thank Joshua Engel-Yan, Reiner Kravis and Tatiana Noguera from Metrolinx for the survey data and support.

We analyse bilateral exchange rates using panel data of China and 182 RMB settlement countries, or areas, from 2009 to 2014. We find that, regardless the choice stage or scale stage of RMB cross-border trade settlement, the appreciation of the RMB does not necessarily promote RMB cross-border trade settlement. This result holds when we take geographic differences into account and split the settlement of cross-border trade into merchandise and service trade. We further investigate the channels through which exchange rate influences the cross-border trade settlement of RMB, and we find that the appreciation of RMB impedes enterprises from choosing RMB as their settlement currency by reducing the scale of export to RMB settlement areas, whereas it speeds up RMB cross-border trade settlement by increasing the scale of China's import from RMB settlement areas. We find that China's economic strength supports the development of RMB cross-border trade settlement. However, the geographical distance between China and the RMB settlement areas may inhibit cross-border trade settlement in RMB.","[Huo, Weidong; Deng, Fuhua] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jiandong] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Huo, WD (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",,"chen, jiandong/AAM-3236-2020","chen, jiandong/0000-0002-8279-5497","Innovation Team Project of Sichuan Provincial Education Department [JBK130504, JBK150508]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JBK141117, JBK1507145, JBK1607162]",Innovation Team Project of Sichuan Provincial Education Department; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We thank seminar participants in the Seventh International Economics and Finance Society (IEFS) China annual conference.

Yet, after 30 years of existence, environmental economists became aware that they were not implementing the PPP, and therefore were not aiming at reducing pollution through economic efficiency. Behind the purported success story, which still attracts visitors from abroad, a crisis has been recently growing. Initially based on the model of the German (rather than Dutch) waterboards, the French system always remained fragile and quasi-unconstitutional. It failed to choose between two legal, economic and institutional conceptions of river basin management. These principles differ on the definition of the PPP, and on the role of levies paid by water users. After presenting these two contrasting visions, the paper revisits the history of the French Agences, to show that, unwilling to modify the Constitution to make room for specific institutions to manage common pool resources, Parliament and administrative elites brought the system to levels of complexity and incoherence which might doom the experiment.","[Barraque, Bernard O.; Laigneau, Patrick; Formiga-Johnsson, Rosa Maria] CIRED, Paris, France",AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech,"Barraqué, BO (通讯作者)，CIRED, Paris, France.",bernard.barraque@agroparistech.fr,"Formiga-Johnsson, Rosa Maria/AAW-5925-2020; Formiga-Johnsson, Rosa Maria/JCP-4734-2023; Formiga-Johnsson, Rosa Maria/G-4354-2012","Formiga-Johnsson, Rosa Maria/0000-0003-2047-9912; Formiga-Johnsson, Rosa Maria/0000-0003-2047-9912;",Urban Waste Water Directive (UWWD) of the European Commission [EC 271/91]; Urban Waste Water Directive (UWWD) of the European Council [EC 271/91]; Agences de l'eau,Urban Waste Water Directive (UWWD) of the European Commission; Urban Waste Water Directive (UWWD) of the European Council; Agences de l'eau,"According to the 1964 law and subsequent decrees, the Agences de l'eau may impose levies on all those who abstract and consume water, on those who discharge waste water in rivers, on those who modify the flow regime of rivers, and more generally on all those who need the financial support of the Agences.

We build a unique microregional data set of 452 Prussian counties for 1816 to 1821 and 1869 to 1871, when religiousness was still pervasive. Exploiting the concentric dispersion of Protestantism around Wittenberg, our instrumental variable model finds that Protestantism had a substantial positive effect on suicide. Results are corroborated in first-difference models.

Using information from the 464 districts existent in mid-19th century Spain, this paper confirms that there is a negative relationship between the fraction of farm labourers and male literacy rates. This result does not disappear when a large set of potential confounding factors are included in the analysis. The use of the Reconquest as a quasi-natural experiment allows us to rule out further concerns about potential endogeneity. In addition, controlling for different sources of spatial dependence does not explain away this result either. By analysing the rural urban divide and the gender-specific information on the number of schools and teachers, as well as schooling enrolment rates, this paper also explores the mechanisms behind the observed relationship. As well as supply factors, our results show that demand effects also played a significant role in explaining the negative impact of inequality on education. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Data from emerging data sources provide new opportunities to examine repeated trip making on the road network. Point-to-point sensor data, for example from Bluetooth detectors, is collected using fixed detectors installed next to roads which can record unique identifiers of passing vehicles or travellers which can then be matched across space and time. Such data is used in this research to segment road users based on their repeated trip making behaviour, as has been done in public transportation research using smart card data to understand different categories of users. Rather than deciding on traveller segmentation based on a priori assumptions, the method provides a data driven approach to cluster together travellers who have similar trip regularity and variability between days. Measures which account for the strengths and weaknesses of point-to-point sensor data are presented for (a) spatial variability, using Sequence Alignment, and (b) time of day variability, using Model Based Clustering. The proposed method is also applied to one year of data from 23 fixed Bluetooth detectors in a town in northwest England. The data consists of almost 7.5 million trips made by over 300,000 travellers. Applying the proposed methods allows three traveller user classes to be identified: infrequent, frequent, and very frequent. Interestingly, the spatial and time of day variability characteristics of each user class are distinct and are not linearly correlated with trip frequency. The frequent travellers are observed 1-5 times per week on average and make up 57% of the trips recorded during the year. Focusing on these frequent travellers, it is shown that these can be further separated into those with high spatial and time of day variability and those with low spatial and time of day variability. Understanding the distribution of travellers and trips across these user classes, as well as the repeated trip characteristics of each user class, can inform further data collection and the development of policies targeting the needs of specific travellers.","[Crawford, F.] Univ West England, Ctr Transport & Soc, Bristol, Avon, England; [Watling, D.

Using a panel of United States firms from 1985 to 2013, we document that real estate risk is negatively associated with firms' long-term investments and long-term external financing in equity and debt. The results are robust to different risk measurements and in particular salient during the financial crisis period when the endogeneity between risk and investment is less of a concern. The effect on firm leverage, however, depends on risk measures. Overall, in contrast to previously documented positive effects of the real estate value, real estate risk exposure exhibits mostly the opposite effects on investment, financing and capital structure. This difference is consistent with option value determinants. Findings in this paper shed new lights on the impact of real estate holding on corporate decisions, offer a new explanation for the underperformance of hedge funds' real estate strategies, and confirm the theoretical predictions in Deng et al.

In this paper, we develop an expected utility theory in a context of non-classical (quantum) uncertainty. We replace the classical state space with a Hilbert space which allows introducing the concept of quantum lottery. Within that framework, we formulate axioms on preferences over quantum lotteries to establish a representation theorem. We show that demanding the consistency of choice behavior conditional on new information is equivalent to the von Neumann-Luders postulate applied to beliefs. A dynamically consistent quantum-like agent may violate dynamic recursive consistency, however.

Uncertainty about human lives is thus treated as uncertainty about monetary consequences. In this paper, we question whether people risk human lives as they risk money. We present an experiment comparing risk attitudes towards human lives and towards money under prospect theory. The results show that respondents treat the two attributes differently when losses are involved. Specifically, the decisions involving human lives are characterized by less elevated probability weighting in the loss domain and higher loss aversion compared to decisions involving money. These findings suggest that public preferences may differ from the cost-benefit analysis recommendations.","[Kemel, Emmanuel] HEC Paris, CNRS, GREGHEC, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France; [Paraschiv, Corina] Paris Descartes Univ, Inst Univ France, 143 Ave Versailles, F-75016 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Universite Paris Cite; Institut Universitaire de France,"Kemel, E (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, CNRS, GREGHEC, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France.",kemel@hec.fr; corina.paraschiv@parisdescartes.fr,,"Paraschiv, Corina/0000-0001-8762-9482",,,,,45,7,9,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2018,51.0,1,,,,,163,192,,10.1007/s00355-018-1111-y,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GG9NE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000433027000008,0

This paper explores exports as an additional channel through which tourism affects domestic economic activity. Using bilateral tourist and trade flows, the paper explores the causal effect of tourist flows on exports. To deal with endogeneity, two instruments are constructed and subsequently used on two different sets of exporters, one of the instruments being the number of casualties due to terrorism in a country. We find that tourism affects mainly the exports of differentiated products. Specifically, we find that tourism benefits the exports from non-OECD exporters of processed food products and this effect is only estimated for South-North trade with an elasticity close to 1. For European countries, the findings point in the same direction; tourism affects differentiated consumer products and processed food with elasticity close to 1, which adds plausibility to the earlier results. We also find a lagged effect for tourism mainly on the export of consumer goods (for the two samples) and processed food products (for European countries). The results suggest that exporting is an additional channel through which tourism can stimulate domestic economic activity in the tourist destination.","[El-Sahli, Zouheir] Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, Inst Tax Law & Econ, Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"El-Sahli, Z (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, Inst Tax Law & Econ, Leiden, Netherlands.",,,"El-Sahli, Zouheir/0000-0002-2963-5929",,,,,24,3,4,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41.0,5,,,,,1457,1475,,10.1111/twec.12597,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432037100013,0

The number of cows per person turned out to be a useful proxy where milk consumption had not been documented. Re-analyses of agricultural production and average male heights in early 19th-century central Europe show that indicators of agricultural suitability and potential for food production constructed from modern agro-ecological data are strongly correlated with historical agricultural specialisation. This paper uses a dataset of estimated heights and evidence on circumstances of the burial of about 2200 individuals who had lived in southwestern Germany during the 5th-8th centuries to assess the usefulness of modern proxy variables for explanations of regional differences in living standards in the distant past. Assuming some continuity in the relative suitability of smaller areas, the results suggest similar responses to environmental and climatic constraints, even though population density, agricultural technology, market integration, and consumption patterns of subsistence farming were very different from 19th-century conditions.

Nevertheless, previous studies provide little evidence of how public service spillover effects influence consolidation decisions. This study empirically tests the hypothesis that spillovers induce consolidation, using voting data on the consolidation of Japanese municipalities. The extent of spillovers is measured by estimating the demand function for public goods with externalities. It is found that residents of the municipalities that can internalize a large amount of public goods spillovers through municipal consolidation tend to favor consolidation. This result supports the theoretical inference that spillovers in local public goods affect utility gains from jurisdiction integration, thus serving as one of the key impetuses for boundary reform. Moreover, after controlling for the spillover effects, economies of scale, population share, differences in median income, and unconditional grants can help explain consolidation preference.","[Miyazaki, Takeshi] Kyushu Univ, Dept Econ, Higashi Ku, 6-19-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan",Kyushu University,"Miyazaki, T (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Dept Econ, Higashi Ku, 6-19-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",tmiyazak@econ.kyushu-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [22730256]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730256] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I would like to thank Nobuo Akai, Haruaki Hirota, Kazuko Nakata, and the participants at the seminar at Doshisha University, Kyoto (February, 2012), the 68th Congress of the International Institute of Public Finance at Technische Universitat, Dresden (August, 2012), and the 2012 Autumn Japanese Economic Association Meeting at Kyushu Sangyo University, Fukuoka (October, 2012) for their helpful comments.

Nevertheless, this qualitative attribute has not been adequately considered in infrastructure design preference models. Even though the use of perceptual latent variable may be suitable for this, they have not been used, likely because of their high data collection and estimation costs. We propose a change to the classic Integrated Choice and Latent Variables (ICLV) framework that reduces these costs. This methodology is used with data from a stated preferences survey carried out in Santiago (Chile), which collected choice and psychometric indicators. With these, we estimate models with a latent variable that describes perceived safety and latent classes. Results show perceived safety has a positive and relevant effect on infrastructure design preferences. Moreover, heterogeneous preferences are shown to exist, with some users putting a significantly higher weight on perceived safety.","[Rossetti, Tomas; Galilea, Patricia; Hurtubia, Ricardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Santiago, Chile; [Rossetti, Tomas; Galilea, Patricia; Hurtubia, Ricardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Sustainable Urban Dev CEDEUS, Santiago, Chile; [Guevara, C.

This study aims to examine the enablers and performance outcomes of resilience capability in maritime firms from a relational perspective. Data collected from a questionnaire survey and a structural equation modeling (SEM) was subsequently performed to test the research hypotheses. Results indicate that relationship orientation is positively related to maritime firms' security management practices and resilience capability, whereas security management practices are positively associated with maritime firms' resilience capability and cargo operational performance. Moreover, results reveal that resilience capability is positively associated with cargo operational performance. Although the direct impact of relationship orientation on cargo operational performance was not found in this study, security management practices are found to play a mediating role. The finding implies that relationship orientation indirectly affects cargo operational performance via security management practices and resilience capability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that the focus on one issue area can help us to discover more specific voting patterns than those that have previously been found in EU legislative studies. Indeed, based on a dataset comprising all authorization requests voted on in the Council between 2004 and 2014, we find that ministers' voting behaviour is significantly influenced by important national factors such as public opinion, party politics, and structural as well as sectoral interests.","[Muehlboeck, Monika] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Tosun, Jale] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany",University of Vienna; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Tosun, J (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",jale.tosun@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de,"Mühlböck, Monika/ABA-9977-2020","Mühlböck, Monika/0000-0002-0418-1959",,,,,51,34,34,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The results suggest that the association between financial and debt cycles is asymmetric. Debt expansions preceded by overheating in credit and financial markets tend to last longer than other expansions, but there is no significant association between financial cycles and debt contractions. There is strong evidence of duration dependence in both phases of the cycle, with the likelihood of expansions and contractions to end increasing with the length of their respective spells. Higher initial level of debt increases the spell of contractions (persistence of adjustment effort hypothesis) and reduces the spell of expansions (debt sustainability hypothesis). The results are robust to the inclusion of global factors, openness, political stability, and debt crisis indicators as additional controls.","[Poghosyan, Tigran] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Poghosyan, T (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",tpoghosyan@imf.org,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

On average, CRH accessibility positively affects regional tourism economies, reflected in a 12% net increase in tourism revenue for a region. By dividing the database into different subsets, this study demonstrates that the significantly positive impacts only occur for regions where the overall level of accessibility is low. Moreover, this study reveals that among regions connected by CRH networks, the regions of which the levels of tourism development are comparatively low will experience a bigger jump in tourism economy than the regions of which the levels of tourism development are already high, and hence the dispersion effect of CRH networks is demonstrated. This study also concludes the lagged effects of CRH accessibility are much greater than its immediate effects. By virtue of these conclusions, this study suggests the ways for governments and tourism organizations to take advantage of the development of high-speed trains in China.","[Zhou Bo; Li Ningqiao] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Zhou, B (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Management Sch, Dept Tourism & Hotel Adm, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",friendzhoubo@xmu.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [71773101, 71172048]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (the number of the project is 71773101 and 71172048).",,34,31,33,7,153,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The main feature of this model is that both its coefficients and directional vector are allowed to vary across firms, thus allowing different firms to have different production technologies and to follow different growth paths. Our Bayes factor analysis indicates that this model is strongly favored over the commonly used fixed-coefficient DODF model. Our results obtained from this model suggest that the average annual shadow price of emissions ranges from $61.62 to $105.72 (in 2001 dollars) with an average of $83.12. The results also suggest that the firm-specific average shadow price differs significantly across electric utilities.

In countries where informal payments to teachers are common migration could therefore increase petty corruption in education. To test this hypothesis, we investigate the effect of migration on educational inputs. We use an instrumental variables approach on survey data and matched administrative records from the World Bank's Open Budget Initiative (BOOST) from Moldova, one of the countries with the highest emigration rates. Contrary to the positive income effect, we find that the strongest migration-related response in private education expenditure is a substantial decrease in informal payments to public school teachers. Any positive income effect due to migration must hence be overcompensated by some payment-reducing effects. We discuss a number of potential explanations at the family level, school level or community level. We furthermore rule out several of these explanations and highlight possible interpretations for future research.","[Hoeckel, Lisa Sofie] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Essen, Germany; [Hoeckel, Lisa Sofie] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Silva, Manuel Santos] Univ Goettingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Stoehr, Tobias] Kiel Inst World Econ IfW, Kiel, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ruhr University Bochum; University of Gottingen; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Stöhr, T (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ IfW, Kiel, Germany.",lisa.hoeckel@rwi-essen.de; santos.silva@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de; stoehr@ifw-kiel.de,,"Heidland, Tobias/0000-0001-9646-1132; Santos Silva, Manuel/0000-0001-6673-4283",EuropeAid project [DCI-MIGR/210/229-604],EuropeAid project,"He acknowledges funding from EuropeAid project DCI-MIGR/210/229-604.

This paper considers the association between age at menarche and body size of university students born before, during and after WWII and father's level of education, a commonly used indicator of family economic status in Poland. Subjects were 518 university students surveyed between 1955 and 1972, birth years 1931 through 1951. The sample was divided into three birth cohorts: before (n = 237), during (n = 247) and after (n = 34) WWII. Age at menarche was compared among birth cohorts, and by weight status and father's level of education. Age at menarche increased slightly but significantly among women born during WWII (14.4 yrs) compared to those born before (14.2 yrs) and after (13.9 yrs) the war. Controlling for year of birth and age of the student, age at menarche was significantly earlier in overweight (13.42 +/- 0.35 yrs) than in normal weight (14.33 +/- 0.06 yrs) and thin (14.54 +/- 0.21 yrs) women. Adjusted mean ages at menarche in small samples of overweight women did not differ by father's level of education, and were earlier than corresponding ages of thin and normal weight women. Adjusted mean ages at menarche did not differ between thin and normal weight women with fathers having primary or no education, but were slightly later in thin than in normal weight women with fathers having a vocational, secondary or higher education. Although age at menarche was associated with father's level of education, young adult weight status was a somewhat more important correlate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the individual, household and contextual circumstances under which mothers of children of different ages are likely to be employed is crucial to develop strategies capable of increasing maternal employment. This article takes a comparative approach to investigating the characteristics associated with maternal employment in the presence of children aged 0-2, 3-5, 6-9 and 10-12 years. We model the probability of being employed full-time, part-time or being a homemaker using EU-SILC data (2004 to 2007) from Germany, Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom - four countries belonging to different gender and welfare regimes. The results indicate that individual and household characteristics are more relevant in determining mothers' employment in countries where the state is less supportive towards maternal employment: Italy and to a lesser extent Germany and the UK - for the period observed.","[Sani, Giulia M.

Information in the right place at the right time is in this electronic business era one of the most important resources that could mean the difference between company survival or failure. Strategic advantages of companies are no longer based solely on physical resources or good management, but on the company's knowledge and information that the company acquires from the market. This information has to be processed to become part of the company's knowledge or the basis for decision-making in the company. Companies need to rely more on business intelligence systems to be able to keep up with the competition. The emphasis in this paper is the presentation of knowledge acquisition from data in business intelligence models. The two main knowledge acquisition models are data mining and OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing) which will be the main subjects of analysis. The aim of the paper is to point out the importance of business intelligence that is, along with benchmarking, focused on the competition and visions of the future. The starting point of the paper is to point out the objective of business intelligence directed to the collection and processing of data and information on current and future activities of the competition in order to optimise concept of development and improve protection of one's own data, all in order to create competitive advantage in the economic market.","[Badurina, Edvard] Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia",,"Badurina, E (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia.",edvard.badurina@gmail.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,353,372,,,,,,20,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300020,0

We provide an endogenous economic growth model subject to the physical limits of the real world, meaning that nonrenewable and renewable energy production costs have functional forms that respect physical constraints, and that technological level is precisely defined as the efficiency of primary-to-useful exergy conversion. The model supports the evidence that historical productions of renewable and nonrenewable energy have greatly influenced past economic growth. Indeed, from an initial almost-renewable-only supply regime we reproduce the increasing reliance on nonrenewable energy that has allowed the global economy to leave the state of economic stagnation that had characterized the largest part of its history. We then study the inevitable transition towards complete renewable energy that human will have to deal with in a not-too-far future since nonrenewable energy comes by definition from a finite stock. Through simulation we study in which circumstances this transition could have negative impacts on economic growth (peak followed by degrowth phase). We show that the implementation of a carbon price can partially smooth such unfortunate dynamics, depending on the ways of use of the income generated by the carbon pricing.","[Court, Victor; Jouvet, Pierre-Andre] Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX, UMR 7235, UPL, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Court, Victor; Jouvet, Pierre-Andre] Palais Brongniart, Chaire Econ Climat, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France; [Court, Victor; Lantz, Frederic] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); IFP Energies Nouvelles,"Court, V (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX, UMR 7235, UPL, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.;Court, V (通讯作者)，Palais Brongniart, Chaire Econ Climat, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France.;Court, V (通讯作者)，IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France.",victorcourt@free.fr,"DEV, Direction Economie/C-1705-2013",,,,,,59,17,17,2,61,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2018,39.0,1,,,,,29,57,,10.5547/01956574.39.1.vcou,0.0,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FS0PR,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419476700002,0

Using transition analysis, it is assessed how people switch between different travel patterns over time. Data from the first three waves of the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN) are used to reveal different travel patterns and analyse transitions between these patterns over time. Six different meaningful travel patterns are revealed. Four exogenous variables and six life events within the household, employment and residential biography are included to assess their effects on people's transitions between the travel patterns over time. For all life events significant effects are found, indicating that there might indeed be 'windows of opportunity' to change travel behaviour when a life event occurs. The results show that, on average, people who only use a single mode are less likely to change their travel pattern compared to multimodal travellers. In addition, the effects of life events and exogenous variables depend on the initial travel pattern. In general, single-mode travellers are less affected by life events than multimodal travellers. This indicates that it is important to include past travel behaviour within mobility biographies studies.","[de Haas, M. C.; Scheepers, C. E.; Harms, L. W.
