Using an empirical gravity model of trade and direct investment, we forecast that, when the two Koreas pursue economic integration and cooperation without military conflicts, North Korea's trade with South Korea can increase by up to 36 percent of North Korea's GDP and its foreign direct investment (FDI) flows from South Korea by up to 6 percent of GDP. Overall, by promoting trade and FDI integration with South Korea, North Korea can boost its GDP growth by approximately 3 percentage points per year. Combined with a market-oriented reform, the North Korean economy could grow by approximately 4.7 percent per year over the coming decades. Conversely, if more rigid sanctions imposed on North Korea become effective, its trade and investment will decrease and its GDP growth rate is expected to fall by approximately 2 percentage points per year.","[Lee, Jong-Wha] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Pyun, Ju Hyun] Korea Univ, Business Sch, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University,"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",jongwha@korea.ac.kr,"Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016","Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961; PYUN, JU HYUN/0000-0001-6815-3976",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2008-362-A00001]; Australian Research Council [DP150103821],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors thank Creina Day, Tomohiko Inui, Warwick McKibbin, Marcus Noland and Deok Ryong Yoon for their helpful comments on an earlier draft.

The paper first explains how computers and machine learning automate workplace tasks. Automated tasks help to both create and eliminate jobs and I show why job elimination centres in blue-collar and clerical work-impacts similar to those of manufactured imports and offshored services. I sketch the near-term evolution of three technologies aimed at blue-collar and clerical occupations: autonomous long-distance trucks, automated customer service responses, and industrial robotics. I estimate that in the next 5-7 years, the jobs lost to each of these technologies will be modest but visible. I then outline the structure of populist politics. Populist surges are rare but a populist candidate who pits 'the people' (truck drivers, call centre operators, factory operatives) against 'the elite' (software developers, etc.) will be mining many of the US regional and education fault lines that were part of the 2016 presidential election.","[Levy, Frank] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Levy, Frank] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Levy, Frank] Duke Robot, Boston, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Levy, F (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Levy, F (通讯作者)，Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Levy, F (通讯作者)，Duke Robot, Boston, MA USA.",flevy@mit.edu,,,Russell Sage Foundation,Russell Sage Foundation,"Thanks go to Ryan Hill and Eric Huntly for research assistance, the MIT CSAIL AI-PI Friday lunch for extensive conversation, and Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, Roy Bahat, Gordon Berlin, Jack Citrin, Henrik Christensen, Ron Friedmann, Jed Kolko, John Leonard, Becca Levy, Mac McCorkle, John Markoff, Eric Patashnik, Giorgio Presidente, Andrea Salvatori, Aaron Smith, Kathy Swartz, Moshe Vardi, Fred Yang, and several software developers and call centre managers who requested anonymity.

In this article, I examine the effect of a reduction of foreign tariffs on the productivity of supplier industries of exporters. Using a panel of Chilean plants during a period of trade liberalization with the European Union, the United States, and the Republic of Korea, I show that the average reduction in the foreign tariff faced by downstream industries (1.1 percentage points) increases the productivity of intermediate input suppliers industries by 1.5 percent. The increase in productivity among supplier industries accounts for 22.5 percent of aggregate productivity gains. I find that tariff cuts induce firms to acquire new machinery and pay higher wages to skilled workers. The results are robust when I control for the change in domestic competition and the access to foreign inputs that could potentially drive productivity growth following output and input tariff elimination.","[Linarello, Andrea] Bank Italy, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Linarello, A (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",andrea.linarello@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,38,10,10,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We find that wealth inequality increased after 2007 and that more unequal bank holdings and housing appear to be important drivers. We also evaluate the performance of the capitalization method by contrasting its estimates and their dispersion with observed stocks in register data up to 2007. The goodness-of-fit varies tremendously across assets and we conclude that although capitalized wealth estimates may well approximate overall inequality levels and trends, they are highly sensitive to assumptions and the quality of the underlying data sources.","[Lundberg, Jacob] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Waldenstroem, Daniel] Res Inst Ind Econ, Paris, France; [Waldenstroem, Daniel] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France",Uppsala University; Paris School of Economics,"Waldenström, D (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",daniel.waldenstrom@psemail.eu,,,,,,,20,24,25,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The model sheds light on the ambiguous empirical results reported in the literature regarding the growth effects of the policy of devolving fiscal responsibility to local governments. We find that the distribution of civicness within a country determines the magnitude of the effects of decentralization on its regional convergence, as well as whether decentralization fosters or dampens the country's national growth. We perform a series of simulated reforms using Monte Carlo methods parameterized using OECD countries data set. We then test our findings using a panel data set of 23 OECD countries covering the period 1975-2010. We find that the short and the long run growth effect of decentralization policy depends on the size of the policy reform and can range from extremely negative to positive depending on the rule of law, the level of social capital and its regional dispersion, in line with the model predictions.

Intuitively, in these equilibria, players exchange favors by taking individually suboptimal actions if these actions create a gain for the opponent larger than the player's loss from taking them. In exchange, the player who provides a favor implicitly obtains from the opponent a chip that entitles the player to receiving a favor at some future date. Players are initially endowed with a number of chips, and a player who runs out of chips is no longer entitled to receive any favors until she provides a favor to the opponent, in which case she receives one chip back. We show that such simple chip strategies approximate efficient outcomes in a class of repeated symmetric games with incomplete information, in which each player has two possible types, when discounting vanishes. This class includes many important applications, studied in numerous previous papers, such as the favor-exchange model of Mobius (), repeated auctions, and the repeated version of Spulber duopolies of Athey and Bagwell (), among others. We also show the limitation of chip strategies. For example, if players have more than two types, then such simple chip strategies may not approximate efficient outcomes even in symmetric games.","[Olszewski, Wojciech] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Safronov, Mikhail] Univ Cambridge, Dept Econ, Cambridge, England",Northwestern University; University of Cambridge,"Olszewski, W (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",wo@northwestern.edu; mikhailsafronov2014@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,28,3,6,1,2,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

We consider the effects on employment, decent job and wages. Some theories suggest that previous informal job experience may extend informality later and negatively impact decent employment and wages, while others argue that informal jobs may provide training, networks and working attitudes to young workers hence improving their formal employment and wage potential. We rely on the newly-produced School to Work Transition Surveys for seven transition economies of Southeast Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Our results robustly suggest that early informality of youth is negative for the later labor-market outcomes. However, for the wage, there is limited evidence that the negative effect potentially turns positive for long informal job experiences. The negative effect of informal job on later outcomes is stronger for females, while any differences between the two regions of transition economies are neither systematic nor robust.","[Petreski, Marjan] Univ Amer, Coll Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia",,"Petreski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amer, Coll Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia.",marjan.petreski@uacs.edu.mk,"Petreski, Marjan/A-6336-2018","Petreski, Marjan/0000-0002-2675-8325",,,,,13,3,4,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The study develops a spatially augmented Green Solow model by taking into consideration technological externalities and interdependence in the process of production, which ultimately implies that CO2 emissions in an economy are affected by the economic characteristics in neighboring countries. The empirical model predicts convergence in CO2 emissions among countries which is examined by means of modern dynamic spatial panel econometric techniques. The multimodal distribution of the CO2 emissions is consistent with the existence of three spatial clubs. The space-time dynamics of the three clubs are analyzed by means of the Local Directional Moran Scatterplot and spatial panel model with heterogeneous parameters. Our analysis reveals the hypothesis of spatial convergence clubs is more consistent with the data than the hypothesis of conditional convergence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A fundamental departure from previous empirical literature is that we do not consider only subsidiaries of foreign MNEs but also domestic owned MNEs active in the observed country. First, the whole subset of firms active in Italy represented by multinationals-both foreign and domestic MNEs-exhibits the highest propensity to R&D cooperation. Second, foreign MNEs are better at R&D cooperating with foreign partners, but it is domestic owned MNEs that exhibit the highest propensity to R&D collaboration with local firms. By contrast, foreign MNEs have much the same propensity to enter local R&D cooperation as non-MNEs. This might reveal that the multinationality advantages of foreign MNEs-their superior technology and economies of common governance-are more than compensated by their liabilities of foreignness due to the extra-costs and risks of dealing with a relatively unfamiliar context. Third, when considering international R&D cooperation, foreign MNEs exhibit the highest premium, while domestic owned MNEs appear to have a lower propensity to collaborate abroad. Altogether, our results for Italy show that it is not foreignness but the specific combination of advantages and disadvantages of multinationality that explain R&D cooperation with both local and international partners.","[Cozza, Claudio] Ist Ric, Area Sci Pk,Padriciano 99, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Perani, Giulio] ISTAT, Via Balbo 16, Rome, Italy; [Zanfei, Antonello] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, DESP, Via Saffi 42, Urbino, Italy",University of Urbino,"Cozza, C (通讯作者)，Ist Ric, Area Sci Pk,Padriciano 99, I-34149 Trieste, Italy.",claudio.cozza@areasciencepark.it,"Cozza, Claudio/AAE-6091-2020","Cozza, Claudio/0000-0001-7407-3497; ZANFEI, Antonello/0000-0001-6758-626X","Department of Economics, Society and Politics (University of Urbino)","Department of Economics, Society and Politics (University of Urbino)","The authors would like to thank Bernard Dachs and Bernardo Balboni for useful and encouraging comments on previous versions of this paper.

We propose a theoretical model in which a politician faces a conflict between her constituents' interests and the party line. Party loyalty is electorally costly for the politician and is therefore rewarded by the party leader with greater amounts of discretionary spending allocated to the politician's constituency. This effect is greater the more intense the conflict between the voters' and the party's interests. Using data on party discipline in the U.S. House of Representatives and federal payments to congressional districts between 1986 and 2010, we provide evidence that increases in legislators' party discipline raise the amounts of discretionary spending their districts receive. The rewards for discipline are larger the greater the gap between the constituents' and party's preferences (i.e., in conservative-leaning districts represented by Democrats or liberal-leaning districts represented by Republicans).

Our proposed model, a threshold vector autoregression with stochastic volatility, assumes that changes in government debt-to-GDP ratios drive the transition between regimes, capturing low and high debt regimes. The introduction of hierarchical priors enables us to flexibly shrink the empirical model towards the moments implied by a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. In the empirical application, we analyze regime-specific monetary policy shocks. Our findings indicate that the effect of monetary policy is less pronounced in 'high' debt regimes, pointing towards differences in the underlying monetary policy transmission mechanisms. Forecast error variance decompositions enable us to shed further light on the relative importance of monetary policy shocks within different debt regimes in terms of explaining the variance of forecast errors.

These hiring decisions of firms aggregate into an index of economy-wide recruiting intensity. We study how aggregate shocks transmit to recruiting intensity, and whether this channel can account for the dynamics of aggregate matching efficiency during the Great Recession. Productivity and financial shocks lead to sizable procyclical fluctuations in matching efficiency through recruiting effort.

A better understanding of rebound effect, especially the underling mechanisms, has important implications for energy efficiency policies to achieve the goal of sustainability. Previous studies usually ignore additional capital costs for adopting energy-efficient equipment and indirect carbon emissions for providing new consumption bundles. Also, the precise mechanisms of how living standard affects rebound effect are unknown. Using almost ideal demand system (AIDS) model and input-output relationships among sectors, this paper builds a method to estimate the rebound effect that allows for additional capital costs and carbon emission changes of all other goods and services due to backward-forward linkages. We find that rebound effect is over 100% for transportation in rural China even though additional capital costs would indeed reduce the magnitude, and the results are quite robust to alternative settings. As for the mechanisms, rebound effect is divided into substitution and income channels by Slutsky decomposition. Here we show that both of these two channels are dependent on living standard because of subsistence consumption and unmet demand. Carbon emissions of poor households will rebound more through income channel of unmet demand, while rich households usually do not restricted by subsistence consumption, and thus through substitution channel, rebound of carbon emissions would be larger for rich households. The opposite directions of mechanisms dig more information about the non linearity of rebound effect to income levels. Furthermore, given the estimating results, this paper gains several insights in terms of welfare benefits, rather than just focuses on carbon reduction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, it is shown that probabilities of business failure for geographically close firms are correlated. A firm-level empirical application based on 3125 industrial small and medium firms (SMEs) located on the Madrid metropolitan area (Spain) confirms that the geographical proximity between firms, external economic agents and transport facilities has a determinant impact on business failure among these companies.

The study focuses on three main goals. First, we identify and compare the phases and the main features of the female and male immigrant employment cycles and the business cycle by means of their turning points. This target also includes the analysis of the differences in the cyclical pattern between immigrants' and natives' employment. Second, we wonder to what extent the global financial crisis initiated in the middle of 2007 modified the cyclical fluctuations of immigrants' employment and whether female and male employment presents significant differences. Finally, we study whether immigrants' origin plays some role in employment fluctuations during the pre- and crisis periods. We find that in the Spanish economic upturns, the labour market is more prone to create immigrant males' employment than females', while in the downturns females' employment shows more resilience. With regard to the natives, immigrants remain unemployed longer in downturns and are laid off before the economy reaches its peak. However, a stronger gain of immigrants' employment appears to be present in periods of expansion and a weaker loss in periods of contraction. In the contraction periods, immigrant females present the highest chances of keeping their employment.","[Sala-Rios, Merce; Torres-Sole, Teresa; Farre-Perdiguer, Mariona] Univ Lleida, Dept Econ Aplicada, Carrer Jaume 2,73 Campus Cappont, Lleida 25001, Spain",Universitat de Lleida,"Sala-Rios, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lleida, Dept Econ Aplicada, Carrer Jaume 2,73 Campus Cappont, Lleida 25001, Spain.",mercesa@econap.udl.cat; torres@econap.udl.cat; Mariona.farre@econap.udl.cat,"Farré-Perdiguer, Mariona/K-5781-2016; Torres-Solé, Teresa/A-6130-2016; Sala-Rios, Mercè/A-6978-2016","Farré-Perdiguer, Mariona/0000-0002-2105-1101; Torres-Solé, Teresa/0000-0002-2861-5213; Sala-Rios, Mercè/0000-0001-7634-5951",,,,,64,1,2,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We used autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity based models to estimate the volatility of the nominal exchange rate. To determine the short and long run relationships, we used pooled mean group estimators. The results show that, in the long run, nominal exchange rate volatility has a significant dampening impact on India's export rates to the U.S., Germany, and China along with imports from the U.S. and China. However, in the short run, the effects of the nominal exchange rate volatility on India's exports and imports were rather mixed. The study also tested the asymmetric effects of exchange rate volatility on India's trade using aggregated data. Although the results do not show much of an asymmetric effect, they do indicate that positive and negative effects differ in terms of their impact on trade volume. Policy recommendations are therefore suggested on the basis of these results.","[Sharma, Chandan; Pal, Debdatta] Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Lucknow 226013, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Pal, D (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Lucknow 226013, Uttar Pradesh, India.",debdatta@iiml.ac.in,"Sharma, Chandan/AAC-4084-2019","Sharma, Chandan/0000-0002-0625-5237",,,,,72,31,32,1,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

By constructing dynamic investment decision-making model, we find corporate investment heterogeneity in China due to their different dynamic shifts of objective functions, demonstrated by our simulations. Empirical tests imply that the expansion of investment improves financial performance, but does not play a positive role on solving social employment. POEs expanded investment much more than SOEs did, even in the transitional period, but both of them reduced their investment significantly in new normal. Mechanisms are explored by 3-stage structural models for non-matched control group and nearest neighbor PSM matched control group. Although investment inefficiency of SOEs are concerned, executive stock ownership and equity finance could be exotic methods to stimulate efficient investment. Investment efficiency of POEs has been recovered in new normal but POEs have shifted away from 'profit-driving' they used to be in the old normal.","[Zhang, Xiaoqian] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Res Private Econ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; Zhejiang Univ, Acad Financial Res, Coll Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Zhang, XQ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Res Private Econ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",develop21cn@zju.edu.cn,"张, 小茜/K-5057-2019","Shi, Jinchuan/0000-0002-0265-3211; Zhang, Xiaoqian/0000-0003-1631-4971",Ministry of Education's key research base major project [14JJD790010]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472167]; Ministry of Education youth project [10YJC790387],Ministry of Education's key research base major project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education youth project,"We thank the editor, Belton Fleisher, and guest editor, Zhijie Xiao, an anonymous referee, Qian Sun, Justin Yifu Lin and Loren Brandt for very helpful comments and suggestions.

This paper illustrates these three channels by a simplified theoretical general equilibrium model. It confirms the common concern that the competitiveness and demand channels as a whole cause relocation of energy-intensive production, and the energy channel leads to increased carbon-intensity in other regions, resulting in positive leakage. We propose an approach, combining computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and decomposition analysis, to decompose overall carbon leakage into three channels. The numerical simulation using the multi-region CGE model in China to study the carbon leakage from Hubei Pilot ETS is presented. The results show that (a) the competitiveness channel is the main source of carbon leakage, while the demand channel is smallest one; (b) carbon leakage rate through the energy channel is modest due to limited energy price fall. Policy implications of this study are also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

By employing the theory of planned behaviour, the authors evaluate how personal attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control can affect one's intentions to become an entrepreneur. Additionally, the innovative cognitive style is tested as a potentially significant determinant of entrepreneurial intentions. A questionnaire survey was done using the sample of 330 bachelor and master students in economics and business from Slovenia. Research propositions were tested using linear hierarchical regression modelling. The results suggest that personal attitudes towards entrepreneurship, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control are positively related to one's entrepreneurial intentions. The innovative cognitive style has also been found to be significant in creating one's intention to become an entrepreneur. The paper extends the current knowledge on entrepreneurial intentions by analysing the exclusive and mutual influence of different factors recognised by the theory of planned behaviour and the innovative cognitive style on entrepreneurial intentions, as well as providing useful insights into antecedents of entrepreneurial intentions in the Slovenian context.","[Pejic Bach, Mirjana; Aleksic, Ana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia; [Marjana, Merkac-Skok] Fac Commercial & Business Sci, Celje, Slovenia",University of Zagreb,"Pejic Bach, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",mpejic@efzg.hr,"Bach, Mirjana Pejić/E-7313-2012; Aleksic, Ana/H-7548-2018","Bach, Mirjana Pejić/0000-0003-3899-6707; Aleksic, Ana/0000-0002-9702-6703",,,,,70,78,84,2,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In particular, the existence is postulated, in relation to the level of evasion, of different individual taxpayer behaviors. The effects of the mentioned different behaviors on shape and features of the emerging income distribution profile are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. Numerical solutions show that the Gini inequality index of the total population increases when the evasion level is higher, but does not depend significantly on the evasion spread. For fixed spread, the relative difference between the average incomes of the worst evaders and honest taxpayers increases approximately as a quadratic function of the evasion level.","[Bertotti, M.

Instead, childhood wealth seems to proxy for intergenerational correlation in savings behaviour and additional transfers from parents.","[Boserup, Simon Halphen] Univ Copenhagen, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; Columbia Univ, CEPR, New York, NY 10027 USA; NBER, London, England; CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of Copenhagen; Columbia University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Kreiner, CT (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",ctk@econ.ku.dk,,"Boserup, Simon Halphen/0000-0001-5692-9298; Kopczuk, Wojciech/0000-0001-8678-275X; Kreiner, Claus Thustrup/0000-0001-6421-492X",Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN); Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF - 1329-00046],Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN); Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),Financial support from the Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN) and the Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF - 1329-00046) is gratefully acknowledged.,,28,27,28,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

This has been attributed to macroeconomic policy, social spending, and increased returns to education. This paper explores this issue from a gender perspective by econometrically evaluating how changes in economic structure and policy have impacted gendered employment and unemployment rates, as well as gender inequality in these variables, using country-level panel data for a set of 18 Latin American countries between 1990 and 2010. Three variables stand out as having consistent gender-equalizing effects in the labor market: social spending, minimum wages, and public investment. Less important or consistent were the effects of external factors (such as terms of trade), economic structure, and GDP growth.","[Braunstein, Elissa] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Seguino, Stephanie] Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, Burlington, VT USA",Colorado State University; University of Vermont,"Braunstein, E (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",,,,International Labour Organization,International Labour Organization,"We are grateful for helpful comments from Sarah Gammage, an anonymous referee, and the editors of Review of Keynesian Economics, and for financial support from the International Labour Organization.",,37,16,25,4,12,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In equilibrium, the risk premium decreases after a positive shock and, therefore, trend chasing young agents lose wealth relative to old agents who behave as contrarians.

We use population censuses and largescale household surveys to compile detailed data on the ethnolinguistic composition of each region and match all reported ethnicities to Ethnologue, a comprehensive catalog of world languages. This matching allows us to standardize the notion of an ethnolinguistic group and account for relatedness between language pairs, a correlate of shared history and culture, when calculating diversity indices. Exploiting within-country variation provided by our new dataset, we find that local public goods provision, as reflected in metrics of education, health, and electricity access, is negatively related to ethnolinguistic diversity, but only if the underlying basic languages are first aggregated into larger families or if linguistic distances between groups are taken into consideration. In other words, only deep-rooted diversity, based on cleavages formed in the distant past, is strongly inversely associated with a range of regional development indicators. Furthermore, we show that subnational diversity has been remarkably persistent over the past two-three decades implying that population sorting in the short to medium run is unlikely to bias our main findings.","[Gershman, Boris; Rivera, Diego] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Gershman, B (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",boris.gershman@american.edu,,"Gershman, Boris/0000-0002-7688-053X",,,,,59,19,23,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

First, parents collectively choose the amount of labor to supply and, in a second step, they each choose the amount of childcare as the outcome of a Cournot game. Non-cooperative behavior stems from the lack of a credible commitment between spouses regarding the amount of childcare they each supply. The theoretical model is able to reproduce the fact that parental time with children increases both with an individual's education and with that of his/her partner. The limited commitment problem leads to an underinvestment in childcare and, hence, child quality: compared to the efficient provision of childcare, the semi-cooperative framework leads to an amount of child quality that is 45% lower.

The results of GMM analysis show that corruption is used by FDI investors to overcome the region's weak democratic regulatory and institutional status and thus the 'helping hand' is more prevalent. However, the results further show that as democratic capital accumulates, this association may outlive its usefulness and thus corruption as a 'helping hand' in time becomes a 'grabbing hand' instead. These results imply that SSA countries should focus on integrating into the international economy so as to take advantage of existing financial enforcement legislation while reconstructing and strengthening domestic constitutional anti-corruption legislation and institutions.

Contrary to earlier results for Poland, we found positive selection into employment in both sectors, with positive average treatment effect on the treated and negative average treatment effect on the untreated.

In the case of Argentina, the most recent experiences with DST occurred during the austral summer periods of 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, when the policy was finally abandoned. However, the benefits of DST and the size of the (potential) energy savings are still part of an ongoing discussion in a country where energy subsidies imply a heavy fiscal burden. Methodology: Using a difference-in-differences framework that exploits the quasi-experimental nature of the program implementation, we use hourly data for the 2005-2010 period at the province level and estimate the impact of DST on electricity consumption and on peak demand. Results: The application of DST increased total electricity consumption between 0.4% and 0.6%, but decreased aggregate national peak demand between 2.4% and 2.9%. In monetary terms, DST represented extra generation costs of 10.9 and 18 million USD during summers 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, respectively. Finally, the application of DST increased the emissions of air pollutants during those periods. Conclusion: The rationale for DST is questionable. The policy outcomes in terms of energy consumption and energy peak demand seem to go in opposite directions, at least in the latest experience in Argentina. A case-by-case study is the safest way of proceeding, and this paper is a piece of evidence that contributes to an open debate.","[Hancevic, Pedro] CIDE, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Margulis, Diego] Co Adm Mercado Mayorista Elect Cammesa, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Margulis, Diego] UBA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

A comparison is conducted between China and the USA. National GVN and GEN show that shares of value-added and CO2 emissions from China in its GVN and GEN both decreased first then increased after 2006, while shares from the USA in its GVN and GEN generally decreased. Sectoral GVN and GEN show that among China's exports, electrical and optical equipment and electricity, gas and water supply were, respectively, the sectors that obtained the most value-added and emitted the most CO2. National-sectoral GVN and GEN for China exhibited reciprocal and disassortative patterns, and in-strengths and out-strengths of GVN and GEN for China's exports were mainly captured by several domestic country-sector pairs.","[Liu, Ya; Zhao, Yuhuan; Li, Hao; Wang, Song; Zhang, Yongfeng; Cao, Ye] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology,"Zhao, YH (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lybjlggy@163.com; zhaoyuhuan@bit.edu.cn; ncepulh@126.com; 452789007@qq.com; 16531730@qq.com; 15733221284@163.com,"Wang, Song/P-8816-2015; Wang, Song/AFR-4964-2022","Wang, Song/0000-0002-7790-6527; Wang, Song/0000-0002-7790-6527",Beijing Social Science Foundation [17JDYJB010]; Special Fund for Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education,Beijing Social Science Foundation; Special Fund for Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education,This study was financially supported by the Beijing Social Science Foundation (No. 17JDYJB010) and the Special Fund for Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.,,35,12,12,4,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2018,26.0,4,,,,,106,132,,10.1111/cwe.12251,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN3GV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000438893100006,0

The first challenge is the current slowdown in trade, which has been due to cyclical and structural factors such as the decline in productivity and the maturation of global value chains. The rise in protectionism as measured by rising trade restrictiveness has not impacted on trade, but political and policy uncertainty regarding the direction of trade policy seems to have begun to impact on trade growth. The policy stance of increased protectionism and a retreat from the multilateral rules-based trading system is linked to the pockets of the population who have not seen their incomes improve and who have blamed their plight and increased inequality on globalization. In fact, the issue is more about the lack of effective responses to manage the costs of trade liberalization. East Asian economies need to respond to these challenges by upholding the multilateral rules-based trading system, continuing the various pathways to regional economic integration, and ensuring better globalization through effective capacity building and policies to address the negative effects of trade liberalization.","[Pangestu, Mari] Univ Indonesia, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Ing, Lili Yan] Minist Trade Indonesia, Cent Jakarta, Indonesia; [Hadiwidjaja, Gracia] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia ERIA, Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Indonesia; Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia,"Pangestu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Fac Econ, Kampus Baru UI Depot, Jawa Barat 1646, Indonesia.",mari.pangestu@ui.ac.edu,,,,,,,63,4,4,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

In particular, it considers the ex-post efficient policy response to a banking crisis as part of the dynamic equilibrium analysis. It is shown that the trajectory of real output following a panic episode crucially depends on the cost of converting long-term assets into liquid funds. For small values of the liquidation cost, the recession associated with a banking panic is protracted as a result of the premature liquidation of a large fraction of productive banking assets to respond to a panic. For intermediate values, the recession is more severe but short-lived. For relatively large values, the contemporaneous decline in real output in the event of a panic is substantial but followed by a vigorous rebound in real activity above the long-run level.

Risk-taking is conducive to enhancing firm value and is one of the important channels through which state-pyramidal layers increase firm value.

This paper investigates the structure of schools' priority rankings which guarantees stability. First, we show that there always exists a fair and non-wasteful assignment if for each type of students, schools have common priority rankings over a certain number of bottom students. Next, we show that the pairwise version of this condition characterizes the maximal domain of two schools' priority rankings over same type students to guarantee the existence of stable assignments. To prove the existence theorem, we propose a new mechanism Deferred Acceptance with Precedence Lists (DAPL), which is feasible, non-wasteful, strictly PL-fair and group strategy-proof for any priority rankings. Strict PL-fairness is weaker than fairness, but DAPL satisfies fairness under our sufficient condition. We also show that there is no strategy-proof mechanism that Pareto dominates DAPL whenever the outcome of DAPL is Pareto dominated by a stable assignment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, we consider a model where a population of agents play a coordination game over time, choosing both the action and the network of agents with whom to interact. The main modeling novelties with respect to the existing literature are: (1) Agents come in two distinct types, (2) the interaction with a different type is costly, and (3) an agent's type is unobservable prior to interaction. We show that when the cost of interacting with a different type is small with respect to the payoff of coordination, the payoff-dominant convention is the only stochastically stable convention; instead, when the cost of interacting with a different type is large, the only stochastically stable conventions are those where all agents of one type play the payoff-dominant action and all agents of the other type play the risk-dominant action.","[Bilancini, Ennio] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dipartimento Econ Marco Biagi, Viale Berengario 51,43 Ovest, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Boncinelli, Leonardo] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; University of Florence,"Boncinelli, L (通讯作者)，Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",ennio.bilancini@unimore.it; leonardo.boncinelli@unifi.it,"Bilancini, Ennio/J-6405-2019","Bilancini, Ennio/0000-0002-2027-3992; Boncinelli, Leonardo/0000-0003-0626-5133",,,,,46,13,13,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We use a laboratory experiment without strategy confounds to isolate the impact of beliefs about relative skill on risky choices. We find that low (high) skill individuals are more (less) willing to take risks on gambles where the probabilities depend on relative skill than on gambles with exogenously given probabilities. This happens because low (high) skill individuals overestimate (underestimate) their relative skill. Consequently, the wrong people may engage in risky activities where performance is based on relative skill while the right people may be crowded out. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

While most studies focus on the intra-jurisdictional effects of fiscal rules, vertical effects on the finances of other levels of government have yet to be explored thoroughly. From a theoretical point of view, vertical effects could work in opposite directions, i.e., improve and burden other levels' finances. This paper is the first formally investigating the influence of Swiss debt brakes, which primarily target the cantonal level, on municipal finances. A difference-in-differences estimation (two-way fixed effects) of aggregated and disaggregated local panel data provides unique evidence that suggests little effect of budget constraints at the cantonal level on average municipal finances and fiscal decentralization. The results are confirmed by a wide range of robustness tests. If anything, cantonal debt brakes are associated with improved local finances and fiscal centralization. These findings run counter to popular fears and emphasize the possibility of positive spillover effects of fiscal rules.","[Burret, Heiko T.; Feld, Lars P.] Univ Freiburg, Walter Eucken Inst, Goethestr 10, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Feld, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Walter Eucken Inst, Goethestr 10, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",burret@eucken.de; feld@eucken.de,,"Burret, Heiko/0000-0003-2483-9049",,,,,107,14,14,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

However, explicit and implicit barriers to movement both within and between countries can hinder migration, potentially affecting welfare improvement. In this article, we use a unique panel dataset of tracked migrants and non-migrants that originate from 18 peasant associations in Ethiopia to examine the welfare impacts of internal migration. Using several techniques, we measure the association of migration with improved welfare among migrants relative non-migrants. We find that migrant welfare improves in a number of different ways; their non-food consumption rises by at least 145%, and we find that migrants also have improved diets relative to non-migrants. Gains are larger among male and urban migrants, as well as migrants who left a longer time in the past. The large welfare contribution of migration, conditional on migrating for employment, suggest that barriers exist, even within countries such as Ethiopia, against the free movement of people to places where they would be objectively better off.","[de Brauw, Alan; Mueller, Valerie] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Mueller, Valerie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Woldehanna, Tassew] Addis Ababa Univ, POB 170175, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Addis Ababa University,"de Brauw, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",a.debrauw@cgiar.org,,,,,,,33,15,17,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The modern entrepreneurial approach is, therefore, more and more focused on the identification and actualization of new opportunities, like emerging on the international scene, rather than being based on a rational combination of know-how and of marketing expectations. Nowadays, the phenomena of internationalization affects every type of organization: private and public, for-profit and nonprofit, and large and small. As a consequence of the above, international entrepreneurship (IE) has recently emerged as a research field and this article aims at exploring some its implications. IE may be considered a set of new and innovative activities aiming at the creation of value and growth beyond national borders, by the combination of innovative, proactive, and risk-seeking behaviors that crosses national borders. In this context, we focus on a specific case: knowledge-based firms. In order to achieve this scope, after a preliminary section delineating the research field, we have developed our study in a number of steps that approach the research topic. Firstly, we explore and summarize the literature about research on the emerging area of international entrepreneurship. Then, we present the accumulated knowledge stemming from the relationship between knowledge and internationalization, looking at the phenomena of international start-ups. After this, we explore international entrepreneurship by academic context, identifying the main factors that influence the choice of the market on the part of the knowledge-based firms. Lastly, we characterize knowledge-based entrepreneurship as a virtuous combination of knowledge and entrepreneurship. Finally, we draw conclusions identifying the factors able to boost capacities for such expansion of firms originating from innovation and that have operations suited to a widely ultra-national context.","[Dell'Anno, Davide] Univ Naples 2, Dept Econ, Corso Granpriorato Malta, I-81043 Capua, CE, Italy; [Evangelista, Federica] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy; [Del Giudice, Manlio] Univ Rome Link Campus, Rome, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; University of Cassino,"Dell'Anno, D (通讯作者)，Univ Naples 2, Dept Econ, Corso Granpriorato Malta, I-81043 Capua, CE, Italy.",davide.dellanno@unina2.it; f.evangelista@unicas.it; m.delgiudice@unilink.it,"DEL GIUDICE, MANLIO/JQV-3207-2023","DEL GIUDICE, MANLIO/0000-0002-2389-4495",,,,,47,6,7,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

The papers use extensive data that enable the models to provide a rich picture of how academic institutions, companies, and regional governments contribute to regional development. As a result, these studies provide new perspectives on regional entrepreneurial transformation. Theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and their application to several contexts provide an advancement of our understanding about Geography and Entrepreneurship. Perspectives on R&D and knowledge, internationalization strategies, high-growth businesses, technological entrepreneurs, university spin-offs, transnational entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial networks are dominant themes included in this special issue.

The technological progress will enable us to completely delegate to machines processes that were once a prerogative for humans. Progress in fields like autonomous driving promises huge benefits on both economical and ethical scales. Yet, there is little research that investigates the utilization of machines to perform tasks that are in the moral domain. This study explores whether subjects are willing to delegate tasks that affect third parties to machines as well as how this decision is evaluated by an impartial observer. We examined two possible factors that might coin attitudes regarding machine use-perceived utility of and trust in the automated device. We found that people are hesitant to delegate to a machine and that observers judge such delegations in relatively critical light. Neither perceived utility nor trust, however, can account for this pattern. Alternative explanations that we test in a post-experimental survey also do not find support. We may thus observe an aversion per se against machine use in the moral domain.","[Gogoll, Jan; Uhl, Matthias] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Governance, ZD B Jr Res Grp Eth Digitizat, Richard Wagner Str 1, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Gogoll, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Governance, ZD B Jr Res Grp Eth Digitizat, Richard Wagner Str 1, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",jan.gogoll@tum.de; m.uhl@tum.de,,"Gogoll, Jan/0000-0002-0705-2191",,,,,26,32,37,7,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

We use subsidized housing as a source of variation for housing location individuals in subsidized housing live much closer to the city center than individuals in the control group. We exploit a change in the eligibility for subsidized housing generated by China's housing reforms to address the potential endogeneity of subsidized housing. We find that subsidized housing substantially reduces distances traveled for commuting and discretionary trips and that subsidized individuals are less likely to drive but have similar rates of automobile ownership.

This paper estimates the impact of pollution reduction on labor demand in China's manufacturing sector in the period 2001-2007. We conduct this research by using a sample with unbalanced panel data matched from two unique datasets of environmental statistics and an industrial economic database. Using the environmental performance of peer firms as the instrumental variable, our overall results show that improvements in environmental performance through reductions in emissions and COD emissions led to a statistically significant reduction in employment. On average, a 1% reduction in (COD) emissions causes a reduction in labor demand of approximately 0.018-0.019% (0.012-0.013%). We complement existing studies by carefully examining the impacts of firms' different abatement strategies on labor demand. We find that pollution reduction through pollution prevention has substitutive effects on employment and that pollution reduction through pollution control at the end of the production process may require additional workers and thus has positive but not significant effects on labor demand. Finally, pollution control has heterogeneous effects on labor demand by different types of polluting firms (e.g., ownership, region, and industry).","[Liu, Mengdi] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bing; Geng, Qiang] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Nanjing University,"Zhang, B (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhangb@nju.edu.cn,"Liu, Mengdi/HHN-2325-2022; ZHU, BIN/IYJ-3847-2023","Liu, Mengdi/0000-0002-0013-8064","National Science Foundation of China [71322303, 71433007]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is supported by the National Science Foundation of China (71322303 and 71433007).,,34,22,23,8,68,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In addition to offer flexibility benefits, random parameter models allow researchers to make conditional (posterior) inference on preference parameters at the individual-specific level. In this paper we extend the individual-specific experimental approach, that was conducted by Revelt and Train (2000) for the continuous heterogeneity distributions of a mixed logit, to the discrete case of the latent class logit model. Our Monte Carlo study results confirm the expectation that for a given number of individuals, the density of the conditional means converges to the conditional population as the number of choice situations increases. We also add to the analysis the behavior of interval estimates using two methods for the derivation of standard errors of the individual-specific estimates. In general, as we have more information of the choices made by the individuals, we are in better shape to identify individual-specific preferences. Our main conclusion is that accurate individual-specific estimation is possible - including correct assignment to classes, but a large number of choice situations is needed to correctly approximate the true underlying distribution.","[Sarrias, Mauricio] Univ Catolica Norte, IDEAR, Dept Econ, Antofagasta, Chile; [Daziano, Ricardo A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Universidad Catolica del Norte; Cornell University,"Sarrias, M (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Norte, IDEAR, Dept Econ, Antofagasta, Chile.",mauricio.sarrias@ucn.cl; daziano@cornell.edu,"Daziano, Ricardo A/N-4604-2014; Sarrias, Mauricio/L-7627-2018","Sarrias, Mauricio/0000-0001-5932-4817",National Science Foundation CAREER Award [CBET-1253475]; FONDECYT [11160104],National Science Foundation CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation CAREER Award CBET-1253475 and FONDECYT Grant 11160104.,,35,20,21,1,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

A switching regression approach is used to distinguish different regimes when government spending, i.e. fiscal policy has more or less impact on economic growth during different cycles. In the second part, the structural VAR model is used to analyse the dynamic effects of government spending on domestic demand in Croatia. To observe the public debt effects on a fiscal policy, a closed model is compared with an extended model which includes a debt-to-GDP indicator. Results show a negative impact of recession on public debt sustainability and confirm the main thesis that public debt level significantly affects and reduces the effectiveness of fiscal policy in Croatia.","[Simovic, Hrvoje] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Simovic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",hsimovic@efzg.hr,,,Croatian Science Foundation under project Public Finance Sustainability on the Path to the Monetary Union - PuFiSuMU [IP-2016-06-4609],Croatian Science Foundation under project Public Finance Sustainability on the Path to the Monetary Union - PuFiSuMU,This work has been supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under project Public Finance Sustainability on the Path to the Monetary Union - PuFiSuMU No. IP-2016-06-4609.,,25,2,2,1,13,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We combine data on media coverage of economic news with information on the self-stated willingness to take risks from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study. The average daily frequency of economic news reports is measured for different time frames preceding the date of the risk attitude elicitation. We find that while a short term increase in good news is positively related to the willingness to take risks, the relation is negative if we consider a long term increase. An increase in negative economic news coverage is negatively related to individuals' willingness to take risks, irrespective of the time frame. A positive (negative) correlation between bad (good) news coverage and individuals' worries about the economic state suggests that changes in risk perception may partly mediate the relation between news coverage and risk attitudes.

An important aim is to measure and compare the speed of mean reversion and half-life of volatility shocks of emerging and developed markets. For this purpose, we have selected five developed and seven emerging markets, and used daily market indices for the period of 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2016. We employed autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity - Lagrange multiplier (A.R.C.H.-L.M.), generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (G.A.R.C.H.) (1, 1), and half-life volatility shock techniques to carry out this research. The results of the study confirmed the mean-reverting process in developed and emerging markets. The South Korean market has the slowest mean reversion, and thus has the highest comparative volatility over a longer period of time. However, the Pakistan stock exchange exhibited the fastest mean reverting process. It is also concluded that the relative volatilities are higher in emerging markets, whereas the comparative volatilities are higher in developed markets. Therefore, it is further concluded that the mean reversion process is much faster in emerging indices except the South Korean and Chinese markets. The study recommends that if investors want higher returns in a shorter period of time then they should invest in emerging markets.","[Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem] Indus Univ, Fac Management Sci, Gulshan, Pakistan; [Vveinhardt, Jolita; Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Channar, Zahid Ali] Sindh Madressa Tul Islam Univ, Dept Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan",Lithuanian Sports University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania.",Dalia.Streimikiene@lei.lt,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Channar, Prof Dr Zahid Ali/GWZ-6386-2022; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502; Channar, Prof Dr Zahid Ali/0000-0002-0363-1487",,,,,48,10,11,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We compare two treatments in which subjects have opportunities to exchange free-form messages to one without such opportunities, finding that most subjects allocate far less to theft and most groups achieve much greater efficiency in the presence of communication. Ease of identifying who has engaged in theft varies across the two communication treatments, but is of minor importance to the outcome. We find several coding-amenable elements of message content to be statistically significant predictors of group and individual outcomes. Contributing to the literature on culture, norms, and preferences, we find that the degree to which communication fosters cooperation varies among countries in a manner correlated with variation in survey based trust and with desistance from theft at the outset of our communication-free experiment treatment.

Previous literature has considered only linear commuting cost, where in equilibrium, all workers are indifferent about their workplace location. We show that this no longer holds for nonlinear commuting cost. The equilibrium commuting pattern is completely determined by the concavity or convexity of commuting cost as a function of distance. We show that a monocentric equilibrium exists when the ratio of the firm agglomeration externality to commuting cost is sufficiently high. We also show that equilibrium residential land rent is decreasing and convex in distance to the business district under concave commuting cost given that the total land used for offices is smaller than that used for housing.

Moreover, I find that the magnitude of inflation's distributional impact depends not only on wealth distribution but also, and importantly, on the curvature and height of the money demand curve. Indeed, a higher and less elastic money demand leads to more regressive effects of inflation, thus implying such effects are not necessarily stronger in a country with a more unequal wealth distribution.

In a month-long experiment with Indian manufacturing workers, we randomize whether coworkers within production units receive the same flat daily wage or differential wages according to their (baseline) productivity ranks. When coworkers' productivity is difficult to observe, pay inequality reduces output by 0.45 standard deviations and attendance by 18 percentage points. It also lowers coworkers' ability to cooperate in their own self-interest. However, when workers can clearly perceive that their higher-paid peers are more productive than themselves, pay disparity has no discernible effect on output, attendance, or group cohesion. These findings help inform our understanding of when pay compression is more likely to arise in the labor market.","[Breza, Emily] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Breza, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Shamdasani, Yogita/GNM-5606-2022","Breza, Emily/0000-0002-4745-4689; Shamdasani, Yogita/0000-0002-9633-9476",JPAL South Asia; National Science Foundation; IZA Growth and Labor Markets in Low Income Countries (GLM-LIC) program; Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL) initiative; AEA RCT Registry [0000569],JPAL South Asia; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); IZA Growth and Labor Markets in Low Income Countries (GLM-LIC) program; Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL) initiative; AEA RCT Registry,"We gratefully acknowledge operational support from JPAL South Asia and financial support from the National Science Foundation, the IZA Growth and Labor Markets in Low Income Countries (GLM-LIC) program, and the Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL) initiative.

The first factor in the price process captures the normal variations; the second accounts for spikes. The two-component volatility allows for a flexible autocorrelation structure. Instead of using various filtering techniques for splitting the factors, as often found in the literature, we estimate the model in one step using the particle MCMC method. We fit the models to both the spot market and the forward market for UK natural gas.

For the first time the analysis is carried out using comparable and representative sets of data sourced by official business registers of an important number of countries. We show that there exists a robust negative relation between growth volatility and size with an average elasticity equal to -0.18. We check the robustness of this result against a number of potential sources of bias and in particular with respect to sectoral disaggregation and against the inclusion of firm age. Our result is consistent with the idea that independently from specific country characteristics there exists a common underlying mechanism driving the elasticity between size and growth volatility. We then propose two mechanisms able to explain our result and we conclude discussing its relevance with respect to the recent literature on granularity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The interest on such topic is mainly due to its potential positive impact on economic development; thus, understanding the determinants of creativity becomes important in terms of policy decisions. Although the existing literature has identified some determinants of creativity, evidence on the specific impact of such determinants on particular creative talents and on the degree of creative complexity within a local area is still scant. This work tries to fill this gap starting from the thought that the mental cross-fertilization of talents in different fields is what stimulates the best and most original ideas. By considering artistic, scientific, and economic creativities as the main modes in which creativity can show itself, the paper explores empirically the relation between local socio-economic characteristics and the concurrent presence of multiple creative talents.","[Cerisola, Silvia] Politecn Milan, ABC Dept, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Cerisola, S (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, ABC Dept, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",silvia.cerisola@polimi.it,"Cerisola, Silvia/AAW-8104-2020",,,,,,65,10,11,3,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Firms face a choice between two modes of competition: make their networks incompatible and compete fiercely for market dominance, or make their networks compatible and have mild competition. By incentivizing firms to harvest their locked-in consumers rather than price aggressively for market dominance, switching costs tip the balance in favor of compatible networks and mild competition. A public policy that reduces switching costs also tends to make networks incompatible, and results in small efficiency gains at best. Combining the policy with a mandatory compatibility policy, however, can lead to sizable efficiency gains. (C)2018 Elsevier B.V.

The probability of a country being chosen as the location for a new foreign affiliate is found to be negatively associated with higher corporate tax rates and geographic distance but increases with the size and financial development of the host country.

We argue that the input from economics to both sides of the debate, as well as to independent analysis, was constrained by a mainstream economics framing. The result was a focus on calculable outcomes predicated on unchanging institutions and behaviour, and the question of currency arrangements that assumes the status quo is an optimal currency area. As the consequences of constitutional change for institutions and behaviour are uncertain, an equilibrium framework treats anything beyond calculable prediction as a shock, inducing fear of the unknown. In contrast, a political economy approach is tailored to analysing uncertain developments and encompassing the broader issues relating to values, democracy and power, and is thus better suited to the analysis of constitutional change.","[Dow, Sheila] Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [McMaster, Robert; Cumbers, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Stirling; University of Glasgow,"Dow, S (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",s.c.dow@stir.ac.uk; mcmaster@glasgow.ac.uk; Andrew.Cumbers@glasgow.ac.uk,,,,,,,87,4,4,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

While regular calibration can be guaranteed only by randomized forecasting procedures, we show that smooth calibration can be guaranteed by deterministic procedures. As a consequence, it does not matter if the forecasts are leaked, i.e., made known in advance: smooth calibration can nevertheless be guaranteed (while regular calibration cannot). Moreover, our procedure has finite recall, is stationary, and all forecasts lie on a finite grid. To construct the procedure, we deal also with the related setups of online linear regression and weak calibration. Finally, we show that smooth calibration yields uncoupled finite-memory dynamics in n-person games-smooth calibrated learning in which the players play approximate Nash equilibria in almost all periods (by contrast, calibrated learning, which uses regular calibration, yields only that the time averages of play are approximate correlated equilibria).

Optimal host country regulation of expatriate NGO workers,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COMPETITION; CHARITIES; NONPROFITS; DONATIONS; MARKETS; DONORS,"Motivated by interventions in poor countries to increase the use of local labor in foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), we address the behavior of these organizations under host government regulation. We extend existing NGO models by distinguishing between local workers and expatriates. The model covers both NGO monopoly and competition in the market for donations. Assuming that NGOs maximize output, we show that regulations in the form of a quota on the number of expatriates or a work permit fee for foreigners reduces NGO output, but increases employment of locals. The optimal quota is more likely to bind in the market structure generating the highest total fundraising surplus. An optimal work permit fee is equivalent to an optimal quota in both the monopoly and duopoly cases. For both instruments, the optimal tightness of regulation is decreasing in the weight the government attaches to the public good relative to domestic incomes and in the importance of NGO output to the supply of the public good. Aggregate NGO output and the level of the public good produced could be higher with a monopoly NGO.","[Glazer, Amihai] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA; [Hagen, Rune Jansen] Univ Bergen, Bergen, Norway; [Rattso, Jorn] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Bergen; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Rattso, J (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Dragvoll Campus, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",jorn.rattso@svt.ntnu.no,"Hagen, Rune Jansen/I-8522-2019",,,,,,23,1,1,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

As a result, access to justice for victims, pretrial bargaining, and potential injurers' precaution might be affected. We study civil litigation using a model that allows for asymmetric information, financially-constrained lawyers, third-party lawyer lending, and a continuum of plaintiffs types. We contribute to the economic analysis of law by generalizing seminal models of litigation (Bebchuk, 1984, 1988; Katz, 1990), offering the first formal definition of access to justice, and presenting comprehensive social welfare analysis of relevant public policy. We provide complete equilibrium characterization and identify necessary conditions for the existence of the mixed- and pure-strategy PBE. Access to justice is denied to some victims under the mixed-strategy equilibrium. We then study the social welfare effects of policies aimed at relaxing lawyers' financial constraints, and identify a necessary and sufficient condition for a welfare-enhancing effect.

For instance, feudal lords in the medieval period supported monarchies which kept in check their mutual predatory tendencies. Contemporary nation states invest in the United Nations and NATO to contain conflicts between themselves. This paper experimentally investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of such an institution. We modify the two-agent ratio-form rent-seeking model to incorporate a pre-conflict stage in which participants voluntarily choose a level of public investment towards the establishment of the peacekeeping mechanism. A modified Tullock contest is played in the second stage, where the aggregate investment made in the first stage assists the victim in the case of a unilateral aggression. We find that the peacekeeping mechanism is effective in reducing conflict expenditures, and is least effective when the contestants initially have close but unequal endowments, as opposed to equal or widely unequal endowments.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between financial integration and industry and firm-specific characteristics through analysing cross-listing premiums (determined by the price difference between American Depositary Receipts (A.D.R.s) and their underlining stocks) in Japan. Employing autoregressive models to examine convergence speeds of a shock to the price difference and non-linear Band-threshold autoregressive models to identify non-arbitrage bands, we find that firms integrate well when they are larger in size, sales growth, turnover, performance, institutional holdings, or marked by merger activity, overseas subsidiaries, industrial or consumer goods industries, and a longer history of A.D.R. listing. That is, the A.D.R. with the above-mentioned characteristics tends to have less scope for arbitrage. However, cross-market premiums for firms which have large shareholders and a larger extent of earnings management converge more slowly and have longer half-lives, implying more arbitrage opportunities exist. The explanatory variables applied explain over 35% of variance of premium, and most of the variables remain significant determinants of half-lives whether autoregressive or threshold autoregressive modules are used, but firm leverage is not. The results show that the metals and mining industry converges notably slower than other industries, indicating arbitrage is possible.","[Chen, Mei-Ping] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Accounting Informat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chung, Dai-Tzung] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lin, Yu-Hui] Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Caotun, Nantou, Taiwan",National Taichung University of Science & Technology; National Sun Yat Sen University; Nan Kai University Technology,"Lin, YH (通讯作者)，Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Caotun, Nantou, Taiwan.",lin2138@nkut.edu.tw,"Yan, Jing/JFA-6705-2023",,,,,,51,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The hypothesis is that the monetary institutions inhibited economic growth, rather than being effective at controlling inflation, whose main causes are related to structural and institutional factors, indexation process and domestic and external shocks. The main results of the ITR, embodied in the highly restrictive monetary policy, are the following negative effects: A reduction in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates, a rise in the stock of public debt and an appreciation of the domestic currency. Likewise, the ITR has not been successful in maintaining inflation rate below its target. In this respect, revisions in the Brazilian monetary institutions would be essential to improve the results of the ITR, both in terms of actual inflation and economic performance.","[Araujo, Elisangela; Araujo, Eliane] Univ Estadual Maringa, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Araujo, Eliane; Ferrari Filho, Fernando] CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Ferrari Filho, Fernando] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Maringa; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Araujo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Maringa, Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",elisangela15.araujo@gmail.com,,"Araujo, Elisangela/0000-0001-7456-1693",,,,,42,6,9,0,6,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

We examine the effect of (1) standard incentives; (2) behavioural factors like social preferences and reference dependence; and (3) non-monetary inducements from psychology. We find that (1) monetary incentives work largely as expected, including a very low piece rate treatment which does not crowd out effort; (2) the evidence is partly consistent with standard behavioural models, including warm glow, though we do not find evidence of probability weighting; (3) the psychological motivators are effective, but less so than incentives. We then compare the results to forecasts by 208 academic experts. On average, the experts anticipate several key features, like the effectiveness of psychological motivators. A sizeable share of experts, however, expects crowd-out, probability weighting, and pure altruism, counterfactually. As a further comparison, we present a meta-analysis of similar treatments in the literature.

Although both the REH and behavioral-finance approaches offer relevant insights for understanding participants' expectations, neither of these distinct model classes is consistent with time-series data. The paper's findings also suggest that structural change gives rise to ambiguity about the correct quantitative model driving outcomes.

We argue that employees also develop skills that are associated with their occupation within an industry, and that success as an entrepreneur, therefore, is also contingent on the relation between the entrepreneurs' previous occupation and the industry in which they operate as self-employed. Using matched employer-employee data, we develop a measure, occupational spin-offs, that accounts for this relation. An occupational spin-off is defined as a start-up in the most common industry, given the previous occupation of the founder. We then show that entrepreneurs starting occupational spinoffs enjoy above average income from self-employment and have longer spells as business owners.","[Koster, Sierdjan] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Groningen, Netherlands; [Andersson, Martin] Blekinge Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ, Karlskrona, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] Lund Univ, Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Lund, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden",University of Groningen; Blekinge Institute Technology; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Lund University; Lund University,"Koster, S (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Groningen, Netherlands.",sierdjan.koster@rug.nl; martin.andersson@bth.se,"Andersson, Martin/AAB-5164-2021","koster, sierdjan/0000-0001-6047-920X",,,,,37,4,6,2,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

To check the potentially differentiated effects throughout wage distribution authors analyse the impact of minimum wage increase separately for different age and educational groups. Innovative methodological approach which combines the non-parametric approach of DiNardo et al. (1996) with Oaxaca (1973) - Blinder (1973) decomposition is proposed. The results indicate that the significant decrease in gender wage gaps observed among younger workers in Poland in 2006-2010 could be attributed to an increase in the minimum wage level. The effects of minimum wage increases were negligible for the middle-aged workers. Changes in gender wage gaps among educational groups were much smaller. The results confirm that minimum wage policy could be an appropriate tool for decreasing the existing differentials in pay between men and women, however potential disemployment effects should be considered.","[Majchrowska, Aleksandra] Univ Lodz, Inst Econ, Fac Econ & Sociol, Lodz, Poland; [Strawinski, Pawel] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Lodz; University of Warsaw,"Strawinski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",aleksandra.majchrowska@uni.lodz.pl; pstrawinski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Strawinski, Pawel/X-7785-2019","Strawinski, Pawel/0000-0003-2247-1658; Majchrowska, Aleksandra/0000-0002-9759-0830","National Science Centre, Poland [2015/19/B/HS4/03231]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The paper was financed by the National Science Centre, Poland, grant 2015/19/B/HS4/03231.

Simultaneous equations models are used to study social interactions, strategic interactions between firms, and market equilibrium. Random coefficient models allow for heterogeneous marginal effects. I show that random coefficient seemingly unrelated regression models with common regressors are not point identified, which implies random coefficient simultaneous equations models are not point identified. Important features of these models, however, can be identified. For two-equation systems, I give two sets of sufficient conditions for point identification of the coefficients' marginal distributions conditional on exogenous covariates. The first allows for small support continuous instruments under tail restrictions on the distributions of unobservables which are necessary for point identification. The second requires full support instruments, but allows for nearly arbitrary distributions of unobservables. I discuss how to generalize these results to many equation systems, where I focus on linear-in-means models with heterogeneous endogenous social interaction effects. I give sufficient conditions for point identification of the distributions of these endogenous social effects. I propose a consistent nonparametric kernel estimator for these distributions based on the identification arguments. I apply my results to the Add Health data to analyse peer effects in education.","[Masten, Matthew A.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Masten, MA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,University Research Grants Committee at Northwestern University; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R01 HD040428-02]; National Science Foundation [REC-0126167]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Health and Child Development [5 R24 HD042849],University Research Grants Committee at Northwestern University; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Health and Child Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"This is a revised version of my November 3, 2012 job market paper (chapter 1 of my Northwestern University Ph.D. dissertation, Masten, 2013b).

We model a baseline for the Vietnamese economy to the year 2035, and then consider how a limited reform of SOEs might affect the structure of output, trade and employment. The SOE reform modeled assumes a gradual and partial approach: SOEs that are considered strategic are excluded from reform, while SOEs that are profitable and perform better than their non-SOE counterparts are assumed to stay in state hands. Of the remaining SOEs, we assume only 50 percent are reformed over a five-year period from 2016. Our results suggest that even this limited SOE reform could increase cumulative baseline real GDP by nearly nine percent for Vietnam in 2035. Wages for all occupation groups are found to increase and investment in Vietnam is projected to rise by up to 16 percent, relative to the baseline. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Our findings suggest that both the private information held by the largest blockholder and the public information provided by financial analysts have an impact on market liquidity. The percentage of shares owned by the controlling shareholder harms market liquidity, whereas analyst coverage improves it. The study demonstrates that the results differ with the stock market setting. We find that the effects of these two key variables are significantly lower in a specialist market than in a non-specialist market. These results emphasize the importance of distinguishing between auction and specialist market structures when studying the impact of corporate governance and analyst coverage on market liquidity. Notably, the study demonstrates that the sign and the intensity of the effect of analyst coverage on market liquidity changes according to the varying levels of ownership concentration, suggesting that private information and public information may act as complements.","[Stagliano, Raffaele] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier 4, France; [La Rocca, Maurizio] Univ Calabria, Dept Business Adm & Law, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Gerace, Dionigi] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",Montpellier Business School; University of Calabria; University of Wollongong,"La Rocca, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Business Adm & Law, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",r.stagliano@montpellier-bs.com; m.larocca@unical.it; dionigi@uow.edu.au,"La Rocca, Maurizio/L-3143-2019","La Rocca, Maurizio/0000-0002-2097-2865; Stagliano, Raffaele/0000-0001-6709-461X",,,,,64,6,9,1,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The agent uses a Bayesian learning algorithm with a bias towards recent observations to assign probability to each process. While the true process is stationary, the consumer's beliefs change as he misinterprets a drift in dividends from their steady state value as an increased likelihood that the dividend process is non-stationary. Belief changes result in large swings in asset prices which are subsequently reversed. The model then is consistent with a broad array of asset pricing puzzles. It predicts the negative correlation between current returns and future returns and the PE ratio and future returns. Consistent with the data, I also find that consumption growth negatively correlates with future returns and the PE ratio and consumption growth forecast future consumption growth. The model amplifies return volatility over the benchmark rational expectations case and exactly matches the standard deviation of consumption. Finally, the model generates time varying volatility consistent with the data on quarterly equity returns. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The LRV estimator is based on the (almost) exactly unbiased autocovariance estimator proposed by Vogelsang and Yang (2016). Whereas using fixed-b critical values is known to correct downward bias in LRV estimates generated by demeaning the data, the approach we take also corrects the classic Parzen bias that is not captured by the fixed-b approach. When applied to the tests of the null hypothesis of the mean in a simple location model, a simulation study shows that the proposed LRV estimator leads to tests with less over-rejections while maintaining power at least as high and often higher as the standard robust t test based on fixed-b critical values. These simulations suggest further theoretical analysis of the bias reduction approach is warranted. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using panel data from Tanzania, we estimate the impact of agricultural shocks on pregnancies, births, and contraception use. The likelihood of pregnancies and childbirth are significantly lower for households that experience a crop shock. Furthermore, women have significantly higher contraception use after crop losses. The increase in contraceptive use comes almost entirely from traditional contraceptive methods, such as abstinence and the rhythm method. We argue that these changes in behavior are the result of deliberate decisions of the households rather than the shocks' effects on other factors that influence fertility, such as women's health status, the absence or migration of a spouse, the dissolution of partnerships, or the number of hours worked. We also show that, although traditional contraceptives have low overall efficacy, households with a strong incentive to postpone fertility are very effective at using them.","[Alam, Shamma Adeeb] Dickinson Coll, Dept Int Studies, 28 N Coll St, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA; [Poertner, Claus C.] Seattle Univ, Albers Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, POB 222000, Seattle, WA 98122 USA; [Poertner, Claus C.] Univ Washington, Ctr Studies Demog & Ecol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Dickinson College; Seattle University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Pörtner, CC (通讯作者)，Seattle Univ, Albers Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, POB 222000, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",alams@dickinson.edu; cportner@seattleu.edu,,"Portner, Claus/0000-0001-8052-9462",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development research infrastructure grant [5R24HD042828],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development research infrastructure grant,"Partial support for this research came from a Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development research infrastructure grant, 5R24HD042828, to the Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology at the University of Washington.",,31,21,24,3,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

A possible explanation is that central banks have used unconventional monetary policies to pursue dual objectives: to stabilize the financial system and to stimulate the economy. While achieving the latter objective may result in a positive spillover of base money into money growth, this does not necessarily hold for the former objective. This paper aims to disentangle these effects by estimating a state space model in which the monetary base is adjusted for distortions arising from the instability in financial markets. We find that stress in money and bond markets, measured by various indicators, has significantly affected the relationship between base growth and money growth in the EA, but not in the US.","[Arnold, Ivo J.

We explore the asymmetric impact of oil price on Islamic stocks from a sectoral perspective using non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag cointegration methodology. The main advantage of this methodology relies on its ability to simultaneously capture the short- and long-run asymmetries through both positive and negative oil price shocks. Our results show weak linkages between oil price changes and the Islamic composite index. However, the nature and sensitivity of the reaction of stock prices to oil price shocks vary considerably across different sectors. In the longer horizon, the relationships between oil price and many Islamic sectoral stocks tend to follow a nonlinear pattern. Furthermore, the behavior of the real economic sectors indices reflects the performance of the composite index that is oil price-resistant. During the turbulent period after 2008, the response of the sectoral indices to oil price movements witnessed notable changes where the sectoral gains from oil price drop that have been observed during the period of study have been found to diminish after 2008. Our finding is in line with the argument that the Islamic composite index is grounded more on and within the real sectors. These findings are robust when considering different oil proxies and different data time-frequencies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In equilibrium, productivity is Pareto distributed with a shape parameter that depends on industry-level characteristics.

When more productive firms pay higher wages, trade amplifies wage dispersion by making firms more unequal. These results are consistent with how firm size, innovation and wage heterogeneity vary in a panel of US industries and states.","Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; CEPR, Barcelona, Spain; Catholic Univ Milan, Milan, Italy; CESifo, Barcelona, Spain; CREI, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI),"Gancia, G (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, CREI, Barcelona 08005, Spain.;Gancia, G (通讯作者)，CEPR, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",ggancia@crei.cat,"Bonfiglioli, Alessandra/P-4534-2019; Gancia, Gino/F-8132-2013; Bonfiglioli, Alessandra/J-8861-2012","Gancia, Gino/0000-0002-9375-261X; Bonfiglioli, Alessandra/0000-0002-2165-0067","Barcelona GSE; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-55555-P, ECO2014-59805-P]; Fundacion Ramon Areces",Barcelona GSE; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Fundacion Ramon Areces,"We thank Gregor Schubert and Oriol Anguera for research assistance and Alejandro Cunat, Gene Grossman, Nobuhiro Kiyotaki, Kiminori Matsuyama, Gianmarco Ottaviano, Markus Poschke, Fabrizio Zilibotti and seminar participants at ERWIT (Paris, 2015), Barcelona GSE Summer Forum (2015), EEA Annual Meeting (Mannheim, 2015), INSEAD, ECARES, CREI, Ivie (Workshop on Trade and Growth) and Banco de Espana for comments.

The results show that the beneficial effects of forward guidance increase if a central bank pursues price-level targeting instead of inflation targeting. Output and inflation respond more favorably to forward guidance with price-level targeting than inflation targeting. A monetary policy rule that aggressively reacts to inflation and includes interest rate inertia narrows the performance gap between the two policy regimes. However, forward guidance with price-level targeting is still preferred to forward guidance with inflation targeting after performing multiple robustness checks.","[Cole, Stephen J.] Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",Marquette University,"Cole, SJ (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",stephen.cole@marquette.edu,,,,,,,49,7,9,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

By contrast, this study accounts for this factor and constructs an overlapping-generations model that includes entrepreneurial innovation and the occupational choice of becoming an entrepreneur or a worker. For the role of entrepreneurs, even a policy intended to encourage innovation can negatively affect economic growth. For the effect of such policies, I focus on the role of R&D subsidies. I show that while R&D subsidies promote entrepreneurs' R&D activities, they increase workers' wages by boosting labor demand. Thus, it is more attractive to be a worker, which reduces the number of entrepreneurs. Subsidies can have both a negative and positive effect on growth, which results in an inverted U-shaped relationship between R&D subsidies and growth. In addition, a growth-maximizing R&D subsidy rate exists, although this rate is too high to maximize the welfare level of any one generation. When individuals are heterogeneous in their abilities, R&D subsidies reduce intra-generational inequalities.","[Morimoto, Takaaki] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan; [Morimoto, Takaaki] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Osaka, Ibaraki 5670047, Japan",Osaka University; Osaka University,"Morimoto, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan.;Morimoto, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Osaka, Ibaraki 5670047, Japan.",qge020mt@student.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP15J04580],"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","During this study, I interacted with several individuals and their knowledge and ideas have significantly contributed to the analysis.

Given that Indian manufacturing sector is one of the world's most polluting sectors in terms of CO2 emissions; we arrive at firm level determinants of energy and carbon dioxide emission intensities from consumption of three primary sources of energy, namely (1) Coal, (2) Natural Gas and (3) Petroleum. The results of the regression analysis suggest that there are inter-firm differences in energy and emission intensity. The results indicate that smaller and larger firms are both energy and emission intensive compared to medium sized firms. Similarly, firms spending more in research and development activities are found to be energy and emission efficient, compare to others. Hence, in the global competitive business environment, Government of India should carefully formulate policies suitable for the medium sized firms to make them energy and emission efficient.","[Sahu, Santosh K.] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Mehta, Deepanjali] Madras Sch Econ, Gandhi Mandapam Rd, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Madras School of Economics,"Sahu, SK (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",santosh@iitm.ac.in; aqfdeepanjali@mse.ac.in,"Sahu, Santosh Kumar/C-2873-2015","Sahu, Santosh Kumar/0000-0003-3480-6507",,,,,17,8,8,2,18,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The study makes two original contributions: it examines inland Japan where gasoline prices at proximate stations theoretically should be identical, and it analyzes retail transaction and list prices for gasoline. Empirical analysis yields three results. First, the concentration of stations correlates negatively with gasoline prices, but its effects are attenuated by increased numbers of uninformed consumers. Second, stations should set retail prices that include markups based on location, their service features, and brand affiliation. Third, they should charge different markups for different grades of gasoline based on concentration of stations and location. Our findings suggest that consumers' search for stations that set lower price could significantly influence pricing and that providing price information could reduce search costs and gasoline prices, thereby raising social welfare.

Household intertemporal deprivations in these dimensions are estimated using measures which are sensitive to the precise sequence in which poor and non-poor spells occur. A generalised recursive selection model is then proposed to investigate the determinants of intertemporal deprivation in each dimension, allowing for the possibility that correlated unobservables drive the dual deprivations. Improvement in agricultural production is crucial for reducing both dimensions of intertemporal deprivation. We find evidence suggestive of intertemporal income-nutrition poverty traps. Higher labour productivity, especially in agriculture rather than local off-farm activities or out-migration, holds much potential for breaking the vicious circle. Agricultural innovation and mechanisation, regarded by the government as indispensable, yield mixed outcomes for alleviating intertemporal multi-dimensional deprivations.","[You, Jing; Wang, Sangui] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [You, Jing; Wang, Sangui] Renmin Univ China, China Antipoverty Res Inst, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Roope, Laurence] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; University of Oxford,"Wang, SG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.;Wang, SG (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Antipoverty Res Inst, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",jing.you@ruc.edu.cn; wangsg@ruc.edu.cn; laurence.roope@dph.ox.ac.uk,,"Roope, Laurence/0000-0001-9098-9331; You, Jing/0000-0002-0152-0724","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403282, 71673283]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDC026]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"The authors are extremely grateful to Stephan Klasen and Christophe Muller, for helpful comments on an earlier draft.

However, the problem remains to be solved of how to achieve the trade-off between reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining economic growth when switching from various fuels to electricity under the policy support. In view of this, after analyzing the effects of exogenous shocks in various fuel demands based on impulse response functions of several vector autoregression models, this paper measures the current and long-term impacts of electrification on GDP and CO2 emissions. Finally, some typical cases of replacement of fossil-fueled appliances by electrical counterparts encouraged by the government are assessed. The main findings are: (1) Almost all of the exogenous shocks in fuel demands have positive effects on both GDP and CO2 emissions, while the gas shock has a slightly negative effect on GDP; (2) Carbon intensity decreases and even CO2 emission reductions with increased GDP are potentially achieved, in both current and permanent periods, for coal-electricity and oil electricity switching, while gas-electricity switching is not a wise choice in view of CO2 emission reduction in the long run; (3) The alternative electric appliances for electrification have very different impacts on CO2 emission reduction.

This paper examines the volatility forecasting performance of a wide variety of GARCH-based models in the context of biofuel feedstock markets in the presence of structural breaks. Our sample is also extended to several non-renewable energy commodities to evaluate comparatively the volatility forecasting performance across various commodity markets. The model specifications allow for different conditional distribution functions in the rolling window estimations. A break detection algorithm finds significant evidence of structural breaks in the unconditional variance of all commodity returns under study. The out-of-sample analysis, which is based on an up-to-date model comparison testing procedure, reveals that volatility models accommodating structural breaks in the data provide the best volatility forecasts for most cases. Regarding the relevance of distribution functions, the skewed normal distribution dominates in the model confidence sets. Nevertheless, the complex distribution functions do not always outperform simpler ones, although true return distribution is asymmetric and heavy-tailed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This effect depends on income levels and openness to trade. Using annual manufacturing data and rainfall shocks as the instrument for crop yields (proxy for agricultural productivity), I find that an exogenous decline in yield decreases manufacturing output as well as employment and capital investment in manufacturing. Overall, crop yield variation can explain up to 44% of industrial output fluctuations in developing countries (rainfall shocks cause 31% of the fluctuations). Lastly, this paper shows that such perverse phenomena, in which resources move toward the sector with declining productivity, can lead to a significant reduction in aggregate productivity.

In an influential study,Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan, and Volosovych (AKV) argue that cross-country variation in institutional quality can fully explain the Paradox, contending that if institutional quality is included in regression models explaining international capital inflows, a country's level of economic development is no longer statistically significant. We replicate AKV's results using their cross-sectional IFS capital flow data. Motivated by the importance of conducting inference in statistically adequate models, we focus on misspecification testing of alternative functional forms of their empirical model of capital flows. We show that their resolution of the Paradox relies on inference in a misspecified model. In models that do not fail basic misspecification tests, even though institutional quality is a significant determinant of capital inflows, a country's level of economic development also remains a significant predictor. The same conclusions are reached using an extended dataset covering more recent IFS international capital flow data, first-differenced capital stock data and additional controls.","[Akhtaruzzaman, Muhammad] Toi Ohomai Inst Technol, Dept Business, Rotorua, New Zealand; [Akhtaruzzaman, Muhammad] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Sylhet, Bangladesh; [Hajzler, Christopher] Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hajzler, Christopher] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Owen, P.

This raises the question of whether this market is experiencing a rational bubble or not. In this paper, we apply a battery of tests to detect explosive behavior in the art markets from 1998 to 2015. According to the Markov Switching ADF test, two regimes exist for all the indices, but no bubble is found. However, applying the right- tailed ADF, we detect more than one bubble with most of the bubbles happening in the period 2002-2005. Then, accounting for the volatility shifts, we apply the bootstrap tests and find similar results. We argue that the market has been going through some adjustment after the 2008 financial crisis and becoming more sensitive to economic and geopolitical events, with the artworks demonstrating a level of maturity similar to other alternative investment classes. Our findings have important implications in recognizing the cause of bubbles and to take steps in reducing their impact on the economy.","[Assaf, Ata] Univ Balamand, Fac Business & Management, POB 100, Tripoli, Lebanon",University Balamand,"Assaf, A (通讯作者)，Univ Balamand, Fac Business & Management, POB 100, Tripoli, Lebanon.",ata.assaf@balamand.edu.lb,,"Assaf, Ata/0000-0001-6296-2086",,,,,57,14,14,2,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the structured credit market froze, issuance of corporate bonds declined, and secondary credit markets became highly illiquid. In this paper, we analyze liquidity in bond markets during financial crises and compare two main theories of liquidity in markets: (1) asymmetric information and adverse selection, and (2) heterogenous beliefs. Analyzing the 1873 financial crisis as well as the 2008-2009 crisis, we find that when bond value deteriorates, bond illiquidity increases, consistent with an adverse-selection model of the information sensitivity of debt contracts.

Most euro area members benefit from these measures but with substantial heterogeneity, whose extent has been evolving over time and peaked with the sovereign debt crisis. Cross-country spillovers account for a sizable fraction of such dispersion, and substantially amplify effects. Countries with more fragile banking systems benefit the least from unconventional monetary policy measures, and especially so in terms of output gains. Importantly, this heterogeneity implies that the effects on real activity of the whole currency union get substantially dampened. In this respect, we also document that UMP shocks imply significantly smaller and less persistent effects than those arising from conventional interest rate surprises. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While there is extensive evidence that capture can result in stakeholder manipulation of inputs, there are also claims that the analysis is inherently theoretically bias in favour of over acceptance. The article shows that, contrary to these latter claims, treating projects in isolation is unlikely to produce such bias; indeed, it is as likely as not to lead to suboptimally low acceptance rates. The reason for excessive acceptance of projects therefore is largely due to institutional capture of the analysis for either self-interest or natural human over-optimism.","[Button, Kenneth J.] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Eklund, Johan E.] Blekinge Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Eklund, Johan E.] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Stockholm, Sweden",George Mason University; Blekinge Institute Technology,"Button, KJ (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",kbutton@gmu.edu,"Eklund, Johan/HPC-9141-2023",,,,,,9,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

There are, however, many regression discontinuity cases where multiple scores have to cross all of their cutoffs to get treated. One approach to deal with these cases is one-dimensional localization using a single score on the subpopulation with all the other scores already crossing the cutoffs (conditional one-dimensional localization approach, CON), which is, however, inconsistent when partial effects are present which occur when some, but not all, scores cross their cutoffs. Another approach is multidimensional localization explicitly allowing for partial effects, which is, however, less efficient than CON due to more localizations than in CON. We propose a minimum distance estimator that is at least as efficient as CON, yet consistent even when partial effects are present.

While there is a general consensus that returns to education are positive, studies use various datasets and methodologies and consequently present varying estimates of returns to education. We perform a meta-analysis of these estimates of the returns to education in China, addressing issues of heterogeneity in the existing literature and examining whether variations in reported estimates can be explained by study characteristics such as dataset and estimation methods, among others. The meta-regression results show that variations in reported estimates can be accounted for by study characteristics such as data source, estimation method and sample period, among others.

In spite of this, subjects are remarkably good at reaching a stable match, even when the payoffs of others are not publicly observed. More information does, however, speed up convergence thanks to self-censoring.

In addition, a fiscal stimulus package was implemented.

An asset is characterized by a vector of binary i.i.d. attributes, and its worth to a player is equal to a weighted sum of the attributes' values (where weights differ across players). The seller is initially uninformed about the attributes' values, and each period he decides whether to make a price offer or to costlessly inspect an attribute's value. The buyer does not know the attributes' values, but he may or may not observe which inspections were performed (we consider both cases). We study the seller's strategic scheduling of inspections and its effect on the realized gains from trade in equilibrium.

Surprisingly, it has been observed that a large number of workers do not use all of their entitled vacation days. This paper provides a novel set of facts about the gender differences in taking vacation time using the Canadian Workplace Employee Survey, which is a linked longitudinal employer-employee dataset. The results show considerable differences between men and women in the estimated effects of some demographic characteristics after controlling for job and workplace characteristics. However, they reveal significant implications of work arrangements (e.g., part-time work, flexible work schedules, and home-based work), job promotion, supervisory tasks, and union membership for vacation use, for both men and women.

We find that the birth of sons rather than daughters significantly reduces maternal time spent on household chores, which we argue represents an increase in maternal intra-household bargaining power.

Using mortality data that covers the entire U.S. population and includes exact dates of birth and death, we document a robust two percent increase in male mortality immediately after age 62. The change in female mortality is smaller and imprecisely estimated. Additional analysis suggests that the increase in male mortality is connected to retirement from the labor force and associated lifestyle changes.","[Fitzpatrick, Maria D.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Fitzpatrick, Maria D.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Moore, Timothy J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Melbourne,"Moore, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",maria.d.fitzpatrick@cornell.edu; timothy.moore@unimelb.edu.au,"Fitzpatrick, Maria Donovan/A-7099-2012","Fitzpatrick, Maria/0000-0001-5341-1629",Alfred P.

The procedure that we adopt is data envelopment analysis (DEA). We express overall efficiency as a weighted average of the two sub-process efficiencies and assess overall efficiency conditional on their relative importance. We demonstrate application of our model using a sample of Australian superannuation funds. By appraising performance in two sample periods; crisis (2008) and relatively non-crisis (2014), we show that some findings of previous studies may be explained further through the proposed multi-stage framework. The best overall performer in 2008 is public sector funds and in 2014 it is corporate funds. Decomposition of overall efficiency reveals that public sector funds, on average, outperform all other fund categories in OM. However, no specific fund category dominates PM performance in both assessment periods. The driving force behind the observed inverse association between superannuation fund size and performance appears to be PM performance. Number of investment options offered is not associated with overall, OM and PM performance. Here, we demonstrate that performance appraisal from different aspects of management provide insightful information to superannuation fund managers.","[Galagedera, Don U.

However, concerns may be raised about whether the four components should be constrained to exerting the same influence in a forecasting model of household consumption. Also, in this context, it would seem to be appropriate to permit a role to other information that is obtained from the EU survey. Consequently, in this article, different regression functions are specified in order to assess whether there is any gain to be achieved in predictive accuracy from adopting a more flexible approach towards using the data from the EU questionnaire. With an emphasis upon parsimony, an econometric analysis is performed in conjunction with UK quarterly data on household consumption expenditure. For two categories of spending, it is discovered that the quality of forecasts benefits from having undertaken disaggregation involving survey data beyond those which contribute towards the calculation of the CCI. Indeed, the respective consumption variables (relating to non-durable goods and durable goods excluding vehicles) are seen to be associated with relatively volatile behaviour over the forecast interval, 2008-2013.","[Gausden, Robert] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Econ & Finance, Richmond Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England; [Hasan, Mohammad S.] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Portsmouth; University of Kent,"Gausden, R (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Econ & Finance, Richmond Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England.",Robert.Gausden@port.ac.uk,,"Gausden, Robert/0000-0003-2013-9504",,,,,23,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, it is still controversial whether PIN measures exclusively the risk of firm-specific private information or it also captures the private interpretation of market wide public information. This article examines the relevance of PIN to the delayed response of stock prices to market-wide information. We find that PIN significantly explains individual stock price delay even controlling for size, liquidity and risk, and low-PIN stock prices adjust to market information more rapidly not only because of a notably high level of informed trading but also an even much higher level of uninformed trading. Our findings support the notion that PIN also captures the private skilled interpretation of public common factor information by sophisticated investors, and provide new empirical evidence on how information-based trading affects the speed at which stock prices adjust to information.","[Gordon, Narelle] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wu, Qiongbing] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University; Western Sydney University,"Wu, QB (通讯作者)，Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",q.wu@uws.edu.au,,"Wu, Qiongbing/0000-0003-4576-7531",,,,,50,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Several economic researchers consider agro-holdings either as a transitory phenomenon or as a major innovation that enables economies of scale and scope. However, their sustainability does not support the idea of a transitory organizational form. Meanwhile, important aspects of their activity, as with the financing of social infrastructures and the partnership with public institutions, cannot be explained by the aim of productive efficiency. I argue that applying John R. Commons' concepts of strategic transactions, going concerns, and futurity offers an insight enabling the understanding of agro-holdings in Russia as the result of actors' capacity to form new working rules and compromises, reflected in going concerns that incorporate both the productive and distributive dimensions of their activity.","[Grouiez, Pascal] Univ Paris Diderot, Econ, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France",Universite Paris Cite,"Grouiez, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Diderot, Econ, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.",,"Grouiez, Pascal/GLU-7152-2022","Grouiez, Pascal/0000-0002-1631-7737",,,,,46,5,5,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

It then introduces an ethnography of the GD implementation by a Japanese multinational firm (2013-2017). It analyzes the firm's pedagogical effort to correct the unconscious cultural bias to retool the existing habitus of managers and employees. The firm's cultural strategies parallel its human resources (HR) reforms in its attempt to change organizational norms regarding how corporate men and women should work. Deploying theoretical perspectives of cultural neuroscience, semiotics, learning theory and interpretive anthropology, the author then identifies seven strategic foci for this firm's cultural transformation, and terms this habitus-shifting program as MRS-PARC: M=magical messages and messengers; R=rites of passage and rituals; S=signs and symbols; P=rewarding and punishing task performances; A=clarifying alternatives and affordance; R=dealing with unexpected results, resistance and rear guards; and C=communication, complexity and continuity. Once MRS-PARC starts, corporate social drama and critical incidents lead the observer to the nexus of symbolic resistance and representation that in turn helps clarify how to modify the existing accommodation-and-redress mechanism for reform. MRS-PARC offers an empirically derived, action-oriented, process-based, analysis for those interested in moderating the people's referential frameworks and cognitive/emotional orientations for organizational transformation.","[Hamada, Tomoko] Coll William & Mary, Dept Anthropol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",William & Mary,"Hamada, T (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Anthropol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",thamad@wm.edu,,,,,,,21,4,4,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Violence will continue to grow at a rate faster than the military's ability to cope without a change in purposeful planning. Two concerns stressed at the week-long consortium, in which I recently participated at the U.S. Army War College, were (i) the substantial military burden due to climate change and (ii) the need to use the principles of complex systems in planning. Thus, the military needs to reach into areas devastated by climate change in order to reduce the likelihood of violence, and to use the correct understanding of complex systems principles for military planning to prevent war.","[Hayden, F.

Design/methodology/approach The authors use partial equilibrium analysis based on unique multi-regional input-output (IO) data in measuring the second-round spillover effects of higher tariffs, also investigating the scenario of plausible substitutability across import sources as well as sectors based on historical import intensity data. Findings Higher tariffs do not only have a direct impact, but also a significant indirect impactthrough forward and backward linkages. Indirect effects can be extensive across economies and sectorsboth in forward and backward linkages such as in transportwhen value chains are longer and more complex. When possible substitution effects between different import sources and sectors are considered, negative forward linkage effects can be smaller, while negative backward linkage effects become more pronounced. Nevertheless, both negative effects are still found to be much bigger in indirect impacts compared with direct impacts. Research limitations/implications This implies that higher tariffs, including administrative trade measures such as anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties could ironically entail rather greater negative impact on the tariff-imposing importing economies by damaging their exports of domestic sectors using the targeted imports as intermediate inputs, which could be severe if the importing sector has a long value chain in particular through deep forward linkages. Originality/value This paper uses unique multi-regional IO data covering 45 economies' 35 sectors in analyzing the second-round spillover effects across countries and sectors and employs comparative statics under different scenarios.","[Kang, Jong Woo; Dagli, Suzette] Asian Dev Bank, Y Mandaluyong City, Philippines",,"Kang, JW (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Y Mandaluyong City, Philippines.",jkang@adb.org,,"DAGLI, SUZETTE/0009-0004-8665-4327",,,,,13,2,2,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The novelty of our paper lies in two aspects. The first is to use a composite overall indicator (the Sun MP index) to tackle the measurement uncertainty and hence the model selection problem (i.e., a Taylor versus McCallum rule). The second is to capture nonlinearities in the PBC's policy responses with the multiple-regime threshold regression model. We find strong evidence that the PBC's policy reaction function is asymmetric during the post-2000 period and switches across three different regimes. When expecting high inflation, the PBC tightens by adjusting various policy tools; while facing an expected economic slowdown, it eases. However, it is tolerant to low inflation and economic overheating; it barely reacts to them. These findings highlight the importance of allowing for regime switches in modelling the policy response function of a young and fast evolving central bank in emerging countries like China.","[Klingelhoefer, Jan] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, Aachen, Germany; [Sun, Rongrong] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",RWTH Aachen University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China,"Sun, RR (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",klingelhoefer@vwl1.rwth-aachen.de; Rongrong.Sun@nottingham.edu.cn,"Sun, Rongrong/B-3634-2008","Sun, Rongrong/0000-0002-1835-6246",,,,,43,15,16,2,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

To this end, the article (a) highlights trends in growth and class distribution of income in India; (b) constructs a post Keynesian macro model that links short run growth with profit share, where the latter is itself driven by movements in output and real exchange rate; (c) discusses and, wherever required, estimates key parameters relevant to the Indian case; and (d) simulates the model and discusses the effect of shocks to distributive as well as autonomous demand variables on growth performance. The article finds that, although a possibility of wage-led growth in India cannot be ruled out, by and large, distributive shocks do not have a strong impact on output growth. On the other hand, an increase in public expenditure growth, although it has a strong effect on output growth, tilts income distribution toward profit earners. A comprehensive agenda involving greater public expenditure and higher wages to stimulate growth and improve distribution is therefore recommended.","[Kohli, Vineet] Tata Inst Social Sci, Sch Dev Studies, Ctr Study Developing Econ, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",Tata Institute of Social Sciences,"Kohli, V (通讯作者)，Tata Inst Social Sci, Sch Dev Studies, Ctr Study Developing Econ, Bombay, Maharashtra, India.",,,,,,,,31,4,4,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Therefore, the objective of the article is to identify relationships between the economic performance and the pro-innovation factors, which represents intensity of research and development at the level of national economy of the EU Member States. At their regional level, NUTS 2, the economic performance is compared with the pro-innovation factors, which are represented on the one hand as the proportion of employed persons with higher education or persons working in the field of science and technology, and on the other hand as the proportion of persons employed in the high-tech sector. Research has shown that the contribution of R&D spending to economic performance is not invariant, that there is probably a certain degree of saturation for which the increase in these expenditures is associated with lower increases in economic performance in the country. The results of the regional analysis can be used to infer the higher importance of persons employed in research and university-educated workers for the country's economic performance compared to the share of those employed in the high-tech sector.","[Kraftova, Ivana] Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic; [Kraft, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice; Technical University Liberec,"Kraftova, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",ivana.kraftova@upce.cz; jiri.kraft@tul.cz,"Kraftova, Ivana/G-8935-2017; Kraft, Jiri/P-2722-2017","Kraft, Jiri/0000-0002-4269-0009; Kraftova, Ivana/0000-0003-0740-2670",University of Pardubice; Technical University in Liberec,University of Pardubice; Technical University in Liberec,This work was supported by the University of Pardubice and Technical University in Liberec in the framework of solving the project Regional Development of the Czech Republic in the Context of the Onset of the 4th Industrial Revolution.,,34,8,9,0,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, behind the protective wall the industry was able to develop production capacities, substitute imports of components, and even export to some extent to less demanding markets in Europe.

As such, It is another example of rejection of international division of labor which contributed (in long-term) to fundamental restructuring of national industrial structure.","[Krpec, Oldrich; Hodulak, Vladan] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Int Relat & European Studies, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Krpec, O (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Int Relat & European Studies, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",okrpec@gmail.com; hodulakv@gmail.com,"Krpec, Oldrich/C-6670-2013; Hodulak, Vladan/W-5422-2019","Krpec, Oldrich/0000-0003-4892-7086; Hodulak, Vladan/0000-0002-6988-0048",,,,,55,0,0,0,6,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The unique, internal dataset we use covers the universe of debt sustainability analyses conducted between December 2006 and January 2015 for low-income countries. These data allow us to identify cases where the risk rating implied by the application of the DSF's mechanical rules was overridden to assign a different official rating. Our results show that both political interests and bureaucratic incentives influence the decision to intervene in the mechanical decision-making process. Countries that are politically aligned with the institutions' major shareholders are more likely to receive an improved rating; especially in election years and when the mechanical assessment is not clear-cut. These results suggest that the room for discretion international financial institutions have can be a channel for informal governance and a source of biased decision-making.","[Lang, Valentin F.] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Presbitero, Andrea F.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Presbitero, Andrea F.] MoFiR, Milan, Italy",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; International Monetary Fund,"Presbitero, AF (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",valentin.lang@awi.uni-heidelberg.de; apresbitero@imf.org,"Lang, Valentin/AAB-8422-2021","Lang, Valentin/0000-0002-5719-418X",,,,,60,23,23,2,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

In a theoretical model, we demonstrate that, in the presence of regime-dependent macro feedback relations, a highly leveraged banking system can result in instabilities and downward spirals. To investigate this question empirically, we analyze time series from eight advanced economies on industrial production and the components of the country-specific financial stress indices constructed by the IMF. Employing nonlinear, multiregime vector autoregressions, we examine how industrial production is affected by the individual risk drivers making up the indices. Our results strongly suggest that financial-sector stress has a substantial, nonlinear influence on economic activity and that individual risk drivers affect output rather differently across stress regimes and across groups of countries.","[Mittnik, Stefan] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany; [Semmler, Willi] New Sch Social Res, 79 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Semmler, Willi] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Semmler, Willi] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; [Semmler, Willi] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Munich; The New School; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Bielefeld; European Central Bank,"Semmler, W (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, 79 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA.",semmlerw@newschool.edu,,"Mittnik, Stefan/0009-0006-9558-2729; Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159",Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW),Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW),"A previous version, entitled Estimating a Banking-Macro Model for Europe Using a Multi-regime VAR, was presented at a conference on The Future of the Euro and Europe, Sapienza University, Rome, July 2013, organized by Giovanni Di Bartolomeo, at the 7th International Conference on Computational and Financial Econometrics, University of London, December 2013, and at the conference of the Society of Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics, New York, April 2014.

The scale increases consistently with household size, thus showing larger economies of scale than would be shown if the OECD approach was used. We compare the poverty rates based on the subjective scale with those obtained using expert approach. The overall poverty rates are not much different, but the choice of weighting methods leads to a significantly different distribution of poverty when different types of households are considered. In particular, according to the subjective approach, the one-person households are mostly at risk of financial poverty. This is opposite to the OECD approach, according to which larger households are more at risk. The results are consistent with those for the euro zone countries discussed in Bishop et al.

The Case of a Small Open Economy,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,investment; growth; employment; cointegration,COINTEGRATION,"Background: Investment is a key factor to analyze an economy's growth, as it increases the productive capacity, either by expanding the capital stock or by incorporating new technology that makes the production process more efficient. In Uruguay, investment has substantially increased in recent years, both overall and in the sectoral domain. This would have occurred because of strong growth in the period, as well as on account of government policies on investment promotion. Growth and investment evolution, together with employment, have undergone a long history in economic theory, with some empirical studies supporting the principle that investment precedes growth, and others providing evidence to the hypothesis that growth determines investment. Methods: Through a model with vector error correction (vEcM), we found a long-term relationship between non-agricultural GDP, investment, and urban workers of Uruguay. Results: In this model, we observe a positive relationship between GDP and the other two variables, where GDP precedes both urban workers and investment. Conclusions: The relationship between employment and investment is not so clear and, in some cases, appears to be negative, which could be showing a phenomenon of saving labor investment, or investment in less labor-intensive sectors. Uruguay, as a small open economy, depends on FDI to increase investment, and this kind of investment is mostly attracted by high growth rates.","[Mordecki, Gabriela; Ramirez, Lucia] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Inst Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Mordecki, G (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Inst Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay.",gabriela@iecon.ccee.edu.uy; lramirez@iecon.ccee.edu.uy,,,,,,,17,1,1,1,5,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Prior research demonstrates the effects of switching costs on competition, but ignores the influence of switching costs to firm innovation. So the purpose of this study is to reveal the relationships between switching costs and cost-reducing innovation by considering brand loyalty. All our theoretical conclusions are captured by game theory based on a two-stage duopoly model. The conclusions of this study show that under moderate conditions, switching costs improve competition. Strong firms implement lower price when switching costs are present than when they are not present. Second, at the asymmetric equilibrium, lower-efficiency firms with switching costs launch less innovative investments than do those without switching costs, while higher-efficiency firms with switching costs launch more innovation. But under symmetric equilibrium, switching costs have no effect on innovative investment.

Health care is considered as a bundle of mild and severe illness treatments. A free national health service (NHS) offering universal coverage and preferred for severe illnesses treatments, but congested for mild ones, competes with a private health service which is not congested and preferred for mild illnesses care. Either an exclusive subscription regulation, where users are forced to demand health care from only one service; or a non-exclusive subscription regulation that allows choosing for each kind of illness a different health service can be implemented. The move from an exclusive to a non-exclusive regulation implies some users shifting to the private provider for mild illnesses only. This leads to an overall reduction of congestion in the NHS that always benefits users and leads to a less costly NHS under some conditions. Under the latter regulation the private service specializes in mild illnesses with higher profits, while all severe cases are treated by the NHS. Finally, social welfare is also higher under the non-exclusive regulation, even assuming a positive social cost of raising funds to cover the public health care, if such inefficiency is moderate or the NHS is less costly.","[Pardo-Garcia, Cristina] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Dels Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Campus Dels Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] Univ Valencia, ERI CES, Campus Dels Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] CORE UCL, Voie Du Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",University of Valencia; University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Pardo-Garcia, C (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Dels Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain.",Cristina.Pardo-Garcia@uv.es; Jose.J.Sempere@uv.es,"Sempere-Monerris, Jose J./E-6234-2016; Pardo-Garcia, Cristina/K-8197-2017; Pardo-García, Cristina/AAZ-8024-2020","Sempere-Monerris, Jose J./0000-0001-6759-2117; Pardo-García, Cristina/0000-0002-8068-3256",Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/2014/054],Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),"We would like to thank the very useful comments and suggestions made by the editor, the referees as well as those by Xavier Martinez-Giralt and Rafael Moner-Colonques.

Distinguishing among different expenditure concepts, the association between social expenditure and income inequality may be different in the emerging Member States as compared to the rest of the States. In the emerging States, spending on health and spending on social protection are negatively associated with income inequality, and in the rest of States, this redistributive function is carried out only by spending on social protection.

We analyze product innovation by a firm that engages in research and development designed to improve an existing product, the outcome of which is uncertain. If the firm adopts the innovation its modified product appears to consumers as new and improved, but consumers do not immediately know whether or how much the product is better. We find that new products are on average improved and therefore command a pricing premium. This induces some types to exploit the innovation signal by selling new versions that are only trivially different from their older version or that require inefficiently high upgrade costs. Nevertheless, the incentive to show off by introducing a new product may improve total welfare by inducing more innovation adoption and thereby mitigating the standard monopoly underinvestment problem.

The aim of the research is to find out if the mergers have met the expectations of the management and the owners of the merging companies. The methodology of the solution is based on the determination of the success factors of mergers, the classification of the level achieved by the mergers, the separation of the successful ones from the unsuccessful ones, the identification of the problems and the formulation of the hypotheses. The object of the analysis is a representative sample of mergers of all those carried out in the Czech territory at the interval of 6 years. The effect of the company size on the success of mergers is also examined. The results were verified testing the hypotheses with empirical data. The tests performed with the data taken from financial statements of the recent 7 years have confirmed that failure of mergers can be expected in 55 %-68 % of the basic set, i.e. all mergers implemented in the monitored period, with 95 % reliability. Research has found no direct correlation between the size of the acquiring company and the success of the merger. The results of the questionnaire research lead us to the conclusion that the highest risk in merger implementation in the Czech conditions is maintaining of employees and customers; on the other hand, a merger that follows an acquisition and thus represents finishing of the transformation process of a company seems to be trouble free.","[Sedlacek, Jaroslav; Valouch, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Sedlacek, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",sedl@econ.muni.cz; valouch@econ.muni.cz,"Sedláček, Jaroslav/AAF-8051-2021; Valouch, Petr/O-4251-2014","Sedláček, Jaroslav/0000-0001-6238-8619;",Grant Agency Czech Republic [403/11/0447],Grant Agency Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government),"The paper is an outcome of the research project The Analysis of Taxation and Accounting Procedures during Mergers, funded by the Grant Agency Czech Republic, registration number 403/11/0447.

It is based on the daily value of the volatility index and stock indices for the period from 2009 to 2015. Findings suggest a strong negative correlation between daily changes in the NVIX and stock returns. This relationship is more prominent when NVIX is higher and more volatile. However, there is an asymmetry between India NVIX and the stock returns and the magnitude of asymmetry is not identical. Due to this asymmetry, NVIX is more of a gauge of investors' fear and portfolio insurance price than investor positive sentiment. The impact of changes in the stock returns on India NVIX is greater when there are negative returns as compared to positive returns. Indeed, there is a spillover effect of CBOEs' VIX and SPX index on the Indian securities market. The empirical outcome explains that the significant increase in the VIX (U.S.) index results into the momentous climb in the Nifty volatility index. Hence, Nifty volatility index is the best measure of the stock market turmoil on investors' fear. The empirical results clearly indicate that this happens due to the market rally. These results have potential implications for the portfolio diversification, volatility traders and options trading-timing in the equity markets. The key evidence enables the stock exchange to introduce volatility products as an asset class to manage stock market volatility risk.","[Shaikh, Imlak] MDI Gurgaon, Gurgaon 122007, Haryana, India",Management Development Institute (MDI),"Shaikh, I (通讯作者)，MDI Gurgaon, Gurgaon 122007, Haryana, India.",imlak786@gmail.com,"Shaikh, Imlak/U-5399-2019","SHAIKH, IMLAK/0000-0001-5704-9938",,,,,33,7,7,1,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

A wide range of potential factors impacting the design and use of SPMS and MCS has been studied by proponents of the contingency theory since the 1980s who soon found strategy to be one of the most dominant contingencies. But recent reviews of contingency theory provide mixed, sometimes even conflicting evidence, partly because of inconsistent definitions of MCS and SPMS, partly because of exploring contingencies in isolation from other context factors and components. This article addresses both of these challenges. Firstly, it introduces four distinctive features of SPMS and complements them with often neglected Beliefs and Boundaries controls from the influential MCS framework Levers of Control devised by Simons (1995). Secondly, the resulting MCS concept is tested by PLS-SEM whether or not it is influenced by contingency factors of size, industry and especially by two opposing Porter's generic strategic priorities - differentiation and/or cost-leadership (low prices). Surprisingly, only the former is found to be positively connected to the features of SPMS, however, the link is not direct but mediated by improvements in Boundaries and Beliefs. So the study broadens current knowledge on antecedents of SPA/Es, that are applied in the medium-sized and large companies. At the same time, the study urges managers trying to implement differentiation strategy not only to establish the SPMS with all analyzed features, but concurrently to promote values and other belief controls as well as to set organizational rules and boundaries. In other words, the implementation of differentiation strategy has to be accompanied by establishment of the MCS incl. Beliefs and Boundaries, not just SPMS. Contrary to this implication, in case of low price strategy, the detailed analysis proves that Belief and Boundary components of MCS are not very important tools for achieving cost-leadership.","[Siska, Ladislav] Masaryk Univ, Lipova 41a, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Siska, L (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Lipova 41a, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic.",ladislav.siska@econ.muni.cz,"Siska, Ladislav/R-4644-2019; Siska, Ladislav/R-4652-2019","Siska, Ladislav/0000-0003-1136-1605; Siska, Ladislav/0000-0003-1136-1605",Faculty of Economics and Administration; Grant Agency of Masaryk University [MUNI/A/1001/2016]; IGA VSE Prague [F1/13/2015],Faculty of Economics and Administration; Grant Agency of Masaryk University; IGA VSE Prague,"This paper was co-financed by internal funds of Faculty of Economics and Administration, Grant Agency of Masaryk University (MUNI/A/1001/2016) and IGA VSE Prague (F1/13/2015).",,58,2,9,1,8,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The study also incorporates investment and trade openness into the model. The empirical findings show that trade openness has positive effects on growth in both the short run and the long run; investment has positively contributed to growth in the long run while foreign aid has positive impact on growth only for the short run. On the contrary, in the long run, it has negative impact on investment and growth. This can be suggested that dependence on foreign aid for long periods of time does not positively contribute to investment and growth in Cambodia. In order to achieve sustainable growth and enhanced industrialization, policy-makers should move from aid dependence to promote investments through elevating domestic and foreign capital in the country.","[Sothan, Seng] Life Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Coll Business Management, Sihanoukville, Cambodia",,"Sothan, S (通讯作者)，Life Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Coll Business Management, Sihanoukville, Cambodia.",sothans@yahoo.com,"Sothan, Seng/AAF-4288-2019","Sothan, Seng/0000-0001-9208-7411",,,,,63,33,34,3,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

For instance, by allowing expectations about the future to become more harmonized and orderly, they act as stabilizers for the provision of liquidity. Conventions might, of course, change at any time. Nonetheless, by being attached to the daily trading routine and/or integrated within the institutional structure, the confidence in their relevance and validity can be long-lasting. In the foreign exchange market, in particular, where prices are quoted to end-users on demand, market-making banks rely on a convention to quote prices to each other to maintain liquidity. However, the rise of algorithmic and high-frequency trading poses a practical as well as a theoretical challenge to such conventions. By reacting ultra-fast to new information, including to new limit orders submitted by others, markets largely populated with algorithmic traders have become susceptible to a withdrawal of liquidity at an unprecedented speed and scale. Using a high-frequency dataset provided by Electronic Broking Services (EBS), we investigate the process of liquidity withdrawal from the foreign exchange spot market. By doing so, we consider the crowding out of conventions associated with liquidity provision, traditionally upheld through mutual understanding among financial institutions - in other words, reciprocity and trust among humans.","[Stenfors, Alexis] Univ Portsmouth, Econ & Finance, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Susai, Masayuki] Nagasaki Univ, Int Finance, Nagasaki, Japan",University of Portsmouth; Nagasaki University,"Stenfors, A (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Econ & Finance, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",,,"Stenfors, Alexis/0000-0002-1266-7051",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285070] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,26,5,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Past papers artificially divided socio-economic status into binary groups of high and low, in order to employ the decomposition. Socio-economic status is innately a continuous variable. Therefore, we implement a continuous version of the Oaxaca decomposition. Higher socio-economic students are both slightly better prepared in terms of observable characteristics and have better returns to their characteristics than lower socio-economic students. Notable differences across results obtained from the binary and continuous decomposition methods are discussed.","[Ulrick, Shawn W.] US Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC USA; [Mongeon, Kevin P.] Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Giannetto, Michael P.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA",Brock University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ulrick, SW (通讯作者)，600 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",sulrick@ftc.gov,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Even though economic development is not the aim of climate finance, climate-related disbursements will generate an economic impact on recipient countries' economies. This impact will also reach other countries (including climate finance donors) through induced international trade. In this paper, we apply a structural decomposition analysis to study why the economic impact of climate finance varies between countries. We focus on specific climate actions and quantify the contribution of four drivers: value-added intensity, domestic multiplier, foreign multiplier and trade structure. The paper helps identifying the factors with the greatest potential to enhance the economic gains of climate finance in each country. This information can be useful for policy-makers trying to design national strategies that exploit the synergies between climate action and economic development.","[Victoria Roman, Maria; Arto, Inaki] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa, Spain; [Ansuategi, Alberto] Univ Basque Country, Fdn Econ Anal Dept, Bilbao, Spain",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country,"Román, MV (通讯作者)，Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa, Spain.",mavi.roman@bc3research.org,"Ansuategi, Alberto/B-9754-2009","Ansuategi, Alberto/0000-0003-1408-3807; Roman, Maria Victoria/0000-0003-1442-0287",Norges Forskningsrad (Research Council of Norway - CICEP project),Norges Forskningsrad (Research Council of Norway - CICEP project),This work was supported by Norges Forskningsrad (Research Council of Norway - CICEP project).,,71,3,3,1,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Using the carbon footprint of the EU-28 in 2011 as an example, we analyse the differences between EXIOBASE, Eora, GTAP and WIOD. Identical environmental data are used across all MRIO databases. In all model comparisons, variations in domestic blocks have a more significant impact on the carbon footprint than variations in trade blocks.

However, business practice shows that while companies have quite highly developed skills in the area of strategy formulation, at the same time they are characterized by a surprisingly low level of skills in the scope of the effective implementation of the strategy. Various factors that affect the effectiveness of the implementation process are mentioned, including poorly developed leadership skills among management staff, the improper allocation of decision-making powers, the incompetent communication of the strategy, the lack of ability to manage changes, and the lack of appropriate motivators associated with the strategy being implemented. It is worth considering whether the companies that achieve market success are also facing such problems in the strategy implementation process. This paper is based on the results of the research conducted as part of the project entitled The implementation of the strategy in the organization model, determinants and implications'. It presents five key problems faced in the strategy implementation process by small and large companies that can be considered to be effective in implementing their development concepts. It appears that the implementation of the strategy in such companies is usually hindered by two problems: management staff overloaded with current problems and attention of employees focused on operational activities.

CLSC management allows companies to manage their recovery and recycling activities of end products. Due to the latest developments in the world, producers are responsible for the collection, refurbishing, repairing and disassembly of end products at the end of their lives. This paper develops a mixed-integer CLSC model that is inspired by the automotive industry. In this model, we consider three Decision Makers (DM): Plant, Dismantler Center and Customer. Each DM has individual objectives and is responsible for only its own objective function under same constraints. In order to tackle the trade-offs among the objectives, we used four different Interactive Fuzzy Programming (IFP) approaches. The applications of the model and solution techniques are investigated in conjectural data.

Arguably, most of the distributional studies of that kind focus on social welfare defined as a function - typically inequality or poverty indices - of household equivalized income. In parallel, economic research has made considerable progress in the measurement of welfare along several dimensions. Distinct but related branches of the literature have attempted (i) to model different behavior (in a way that matter for incidence and redistribution of tax-benefit policies), (ii) to go beyond income, (iii) to better define and estimate equivalence scales, (iv) to open the household black box and measure welfare at the individual level. I suggest a general framework to critically review these streams of literatures and to discuss whether recent advances in each of these fields have been or could be readily operationalized in welfare analyses and policy simulations.","[Bargain, Olivier] Bordeaux Univ, Bordeaux, France; [Bargain, Olivier] Inst Univ France, Paris, France",Institut Universitaire de France,"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，Bordeaux Univ, Bordeaux, France.;Bargain, O (通讯作者)，Inst Univ France, Paris, France.",olivier.bargain@u-bordeaux.fr,"Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019",,,,,,133,2,2,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Though firms are ex ante identical, one obtains a unique asymmetric equilibrium (pair) in R&D investments, leading to interfirm heterogeneity in the industry. R&D cooperation by means of a joint lab is considered and compared to the non cooperative solution. The main part of the paper provides a second-best welfare analysis in which we show that the joint lab yields a socially optimal R&D level subject to an equal treatment (of firms) constraint, which also coincides with the noncooperative solution in the absence of spillovers. We also investigate the welfare costs of this equal treatment constraint and find that they can be quite significant.","[Cosandier, Charlene] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [De Feo, Giuseppe] Strathclyde Univ, Dept Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Knauff, Malgorzata] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",University of Iowa; University of Strathclyde; Warsaw School of Economics,"Cosandier, C (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",charlene-cosandier@uiowa.edu; giuseppe.defeo@strath.ac.uk; mknauff@sgh.waw.pl,"De feo, Giuseppe/ABA-5200-2020","De feo, Giuseppe/0000-0002-2085-1756; Knauff, Malgorzata/0000-0002-0749-4870",,,,,34,9,10,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Using large-scale Japanese interfirm transaction network data, this paper investigates the features of both direct and indirect exporters as well as international wholesalers. As predicted by a simple Melitz-type trade model with indirect export alternative, the sorting pattern is confirmed in our data, and the distributions of sales and labor productivity are ordered for direct, indirect, and non-exporters in terms of first order stochastic dominance. Multinomial logit analysis is also consistent with the model, which assumes lower fixed cost and higher marginal cost for indirect exporters compared to direct exporters. We also find that the number of suppliers raises the probability of direct exporting implying a cost sharing mechanism of firms with more suppliers. On the other hand, the number of customers raises the probability of exporting in general (both indirect and direct) implying a higher product appeal and broader demand base for firms who have more customers.

Advertising provides verifiable match value information. It modifies the consumers' reference point and hence their willingness to pay for the product. We show that the optimal advertising strategy pools different consumer types so that some consumers engage in ex ante unfavorable trade. Incomplete informative advertising thus has a persuasive effect. This provides a rationale for policies that force the monopolist to disclose important product characteristics, not only at the point of sale, but also in all promotional materials.","[Karle, Heiko] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany; [Schumacher, Heiner] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; KU Leuven,"Karle, H (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany.",h.karle@fs.de; heiner.schumacher@kuleuven.be,,"Karle, Heiko/0000-0002-8418-1018",National Bank of Belgium; ARC,National Bank of Belgium; ARC(Australian Research Council),"A previous version of this article was circulated under the title Creating attachment through advertising: loss aversion and prepurchase information.

Voters can observe candidates' pro-social behavior and their score in a cognitive ability test prior to the election, and this fact is known to candidates. Therefore, self-interested candidates have incentives to act in a pro-social manner, i.e. to pretend to be public-spirited leaders. We find that both truly pro-social and egoistic leaders co-exist, but that political selection is ineffective in choosing public-spirited leaders. The main reason is that egoistic candidates strategically pretend to be pro-social to increase their chances of winning the election. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

By distinguishing two components of innovative activitiesresearch and development (R&D) investments and embedded innovative capacitythe paper develops and tests an integrative moderated moderation model. The results suggest that in Chinese high-tech SMEs innovation-support policies positively moderate the relationship between R&D investments and performance, but this positive effect diminishes when there are higher levels of embedded innovative capacity. These results highlight that the relationship between government innovation policies and a firm's own R&D investments is not only reciprocal but also more complex than the one so far analyzed in the literature. The results show in particular that the effects of innovation-support policies on R&D investments is not as neat as it seems, because of the internal balance within the firm between investment in R&D and other sources of innovation. Therefore, although innovation support policies have been found to help Chinese SMEs in high-tech sectors benefit from their R&D investments, these policies are particularly effective only when R&D investments are significantly driving firms' innovative activities. This highlights the relevance of both government support and a firm's own efforts in the competitive modernization of Chinese SMEs.","[Petti, Claudio] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Ed A Romano Campus Ecotekne,Via Monteroni SN, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Rubini, Lauretta] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Podetti, Silvia] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Management, Management & Hlth Lab, Via San Zeno 2, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Podetti, Silvia] Univ Florence, Dept Stat Informat & Applicat DiSIA, Viale Morgagni 59, I-50134 Florence, Italy",University of Salento; University of Ferrara; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Florence,"Petti, C (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Ed A Romano Campus Ecotekne,Via Monteroni SN, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",claudio.petti@unisalento.it; lauretta.rubini@unife.it; s.podetti@sssup.it,"Petti, Claudio/L-8735-2015; Rubini, Lauretta/D-9573-2018","Petti, Claudio/0000-0002-0628-5145; Rubini, Lauretta/0000-0003-3014-6871; Podetti, Silvia/0000-0002-4602-4636",European Union under REA [610350],European Union under REA,"Part of the research leading to these results was supported by the financial contribution of the European Union under an FP7/2007-2013 Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme under REA grant agreement n. 610350, Project E.N.T.I.C.E. - Explaining the Nature of Technological Innovation in Chinese Enterprises.

Our model also addresses the market failure in the development of clean energy which leads to an under-provision of renewable energy, delays the transition time to the carbon-free era and reduces the amount of dirty fuels locked up in situ. Optimal policy requires an aggressive renewables subsidy in the near term and a gradually rising carbon tax which falls in long run.

The main purpose of this paper is to explore whether five post-communist member states of the EU are mature enough to adopt the euro. We used nominal exchange rates in the error correction model with asymmetric power ARCH (ECM-APARCH). Our results highlight that EU membership positively increased the impact of the euro on the currency of each of these countries in the short-run. In contrast, the long-term effect of the euro on each currency is negative for the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Croatia. Wholly different results were obtained for Poland and Romania. The APARCH model showed that the negative responses of the euro had a greater or neutral effect on the conditional variance of each currency instead of the positive responses. The debt crisis of the euro area had no impact on the dynamic linkages between the currencies. Our research concludes that Croatia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary are not ready to join the euro area in the near future.

Future growth will depend, by necessity, more on the generation of increased productivity, and domestic innovation will play an important part in this. In this paper, we assess the likelihood that China can make the necessary transition. Using data on expenditure on research and development, and patent applications, receipts, and citations, we show that the Chinese economy has become increasingly innovative. We will argue that rising wages and expanding markets are among the important drivers of China's growth in innovation. On the other hand, we find evidence of resource misallocation in the innovation area: while state-owned firms receive more subsidies, private firms exhibit more innovation results. Innovation can presumably progress even faster if resource misallocation can be tackled.","[Wei, Shang-Jin] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wei, Shang-Jin] China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xie, Zhuan] State Adm Foreign Exchange SAFE China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaobo] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaobo] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Columbia University; Peking University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Wei, SJ (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Wei, SJ (通讯作者)，China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023","zhang, xiaobo/0000-0002-4981-9565",Natural Science Foundation of China [71350002]; National Science Foundation [7675172]; key research base of China Ministry of Education [14JJD790027],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); key research base of China Ministry of Education,"We thank the editors Gordon Hanson, Enrico Moretti, and especially Timothy Taylor for very helpful comments and suggestions.

Having discussed and chosen an appropriate analytical framework, it addresses the issue of model uncertainty regarding the equilibrium exchange rate model before estimating currency misalignments. The results show that misalignments have a negative and asymmetric impact on the current account. While overvaluation of the CFA franc deteriorates the current account, undervaluation does not improve it. Finally, our results highlight that the export concentration tends to exacerbate the overall negative impact of currency misalignments.","[Gnimassoun, Blaise] Univ Loraine, BETA, CNRS, EconomiX, Nancy, France",Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Gnimassoun, B (通讯作者)，Univ Loraine, BETA, CNRS, EconomiX, Nancy, France.",blaise.gnimassoun@univ-lorraine.fr,,,,,,,72,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In particular, some recent contributions analyzed oligopoly dynamics when considering production adjustment costs. Although this is a step in building more realistic models, adjustment costs may be different depending on the adjustment direction. In fact, when quantity decreases, firms may decide to lay off workers; by contrast, when quantity increases, new workers need to be hired and this entails searching and selection costs. In this paper, dynamic single-product oligopolies without product differentiation are first examined and then we study how this dynamic is affected by the additional adjustment costs.

Following a summary of the main ideas and arguments, the review zeroes in a key apparent puzzle-namely why despite the sensibility and feasibility of Holland's analysis and proposals, in the main these have not been taken up as yet by European policy makers. We submit that Holland downplays or displaces a key reason for this, namely the pursuit of self-interest and also corruption broadly defined to include concentration of power and conflicts of interest, by key European actors. These have rendered 'austerity' preferable to Holland-type proposals and measures at least for the time being. We suggest that augmenting Holland's 'displacement' view with one that pays more attention to self-interest and corruption, is in line with and enriches his own analysis and understanding of the future of Europe, capitalism and the book's very proposals.","[Pitelis, C.] Univ Brunel, London, England; [Pitelis, C.] Univ Athens, Athens, Greece",Brunel University; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Pitelis, C (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Eastern Gateway Bldg,Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",cnp1000@cam.ac.uk,"Pitelis, Christos N./O-3145-2015",,,,,,46,3,3,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Ignoring structural breaks in a model can lead to misspecification issues and false conclusions. This paper proposes a new Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ADL) cointegration test in the presence of nonlinear breaks approximated by a Fourier function. The test offers a simple way to capture smooth structural change in time series data. Exact break dates are not required, and the suggested methodology can accommodate unknown number and form of gradual structural change. The testing procedure circumvents the potential power loss which can result from adding more dummy variables in the testing equation. Simulation results show that our procedure has good size and power properties. We demonstrate our test on the empirical example of real oil prices, oil production, and real economic activity, which are subject to structural breaks. The new test suggests that variables are cointegrated, while a conventional ADL test ignores structural breaks and concludes the opposite. This result casts some doubt on conventional oil price models.","[Banerjee, Piyali] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Arcabic, Vladimir] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Arcabic, Vladimir] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Lee, Hyejin] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Informat Syst, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Zagreb; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Banerjee, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",pbanerjee@crimson.ua.edu; varcabic@efzg.hr; hyejin.lee@utrgv.edu,"Arčabić, Vladimir/H-8434-2018","Arčabić, Vladimir/0000-0003-4173-8637",summer research grant by University of Alabama; European Social Fund under the project SPIRITH; Croatian Science Foundation [7031],summer research grant by University of Alabama; European Social Fund under the project SPIRITH; Croatian Science Foundation,"This work has been partially supported by the summer research grant by University of Alabama, the European Social Fund under the project SPIRITH, and the Croatian Science Foundation under the project 7031.",,42,82,84,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Motivated by this observation, we build a tractable general equilibrium model where households face persistent idiosyncratic returns to study the US wealth distribution. We show theoretically that the wealth distribution in the model admits a Pareto tail and characterize how the tail index depends on salient equilibrium variables including capital-output ratio, labor share, interest rate, and growth rate. Quantitatively, to match the observed US wealth distribution it requires significant heterogeneity in returns, consistent with our empirical findings. Finally, we show in the model that financial deregulation and a reduction in US corporate tax rates can generate the joint evolution of rising wealth inequality, rising capital-output ratio and declining labor share since the 1980s.

We embed a stylized pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system into a DSGE model with overlapping generations to assess the macroeconomic effects of aging in a small Euro Area economy. The simulations suggest large negative impacts on GDP and private consumption. In addition, external imbalances may widen significantly under the PAYG system. All results are conditional on the policy options addressing debt sustainability-the impacts tend to be very large if the government finances the aging with higher social security premia instead of lower replacement ratios. Sensitivity analysis reveals that GDP and private consumption impacts are less robust than those on external imbalances. Results also imply that supranational policy coordination may be crucial if the objective is to preserve economic and financial stability in the Euro Area.","[Castro, Gabriela; Maria, Jose R.; Felix, Ricardo Mourinho; Braz, Claudia Rodrigues] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal,"Maria, JR (通讯作者)，Rua Francisco Ribeiro 2, P-1150165 Lisbon, Portugal.",jrmaria@bportugal.pt,,,,,,,45,8,8,2,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The traditional regression approach is extended to a vector autoregressive framework, in which the predictive power of squared index returns for the cross-sectional dispersion of equity returns is tested using a Granger causality test. Macroeconomic news announcements and the aggregate number of firm-level news items are treated as conditioning variables, while the average sentiment of firm-level news is treated as jointly determined. The testing algorithm allows the change points in the causal relationships between the cross-sectional dispersion of returns and squared index returns to be determined endogenously rather than being chosen arbitrarily a priori. Evidence of herding is detected in the constituent stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the onset of the subprime mortgage crisis, during the European debt and the U.S. debt-ceiling crises and the Chinese stock market crash of 2015. These results contrast with those obtained from the traditional methods where little evidence of herding is found in the US stock market.","[Clements, Adam; Hurn, Stan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Business, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Shi, Shuping] Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Macquarie University,"Clements, A (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Business, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",a.clements@qut.edu.au; s.hurn@qut.edu.au; shuping.shi@mq.edu.au,"Clements, Adam E/I-9812-2012","Clements, Adam/0000-0002-4232-0323; Shi, Shuping/0000-0001-8571-3066",Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects funding scheme [DP150101716],Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects funding scheme(Australian Research Council),This research was supported under Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects funding scheme (DP150101716).

Instead, very few schools of thought have shifted their positions. Part of the reason is no doubt because, as Einstein once said, theory determines what we see (Salam 1990, p. 99). To illustrate this point while at the same time educating students about the Greek financial crisis, this paper outlines a classroom lesson built around two competing graphical analyses of exchange rates and the balance of payments: the Monetary model and the post-Keynesian open-economy/Z-D model. Each one offers an internally consistent explanation of developments in the peripheral EU countries, but suggests a different cause and solution.

In addition, most of the studies that examine the effect of ambient scents fail on one or both of these criteria: to properly control the influence of nuisance factors and/or to elicit preferences under real monetary incentives. We collected data from a laboratory experiment where we varied on a between subjects design the dispersion of a citrus fragrance. We then elicited subjects' willingness to pay for two unbranded products - a mug and a chocolate - by having subjects participate in a 2nd price Vickrey auction. We also elicited subjects' risk preferences using lottery choice tasks. Our results show a statistically and economically significant effect on subjects' willingness to pay: valuations increased up to 49% for subjects who were exposed to a citrus scent as compared to the control group.

From a policy perspective, it is important to understand the underlying causes of those correlations. Educational policy changes may have significant impacts on intergenerational mobility. The last several decades have witnessed a remarkable expansion of higher education around the world. In this paper, we examine the effect of higher education expansion on intergenerational mobility in China. We find that the higher education expansion in China has weakened the advantage of cadres' children in higher education participation, and has strengthened the intergenerational educational correlation. One explanation for these results might be that, along with the process of economic reform started in 1979, the cadre selection mechanism has placed more and more weight on candidate's education and abilities.","[Li, Zhi] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Hai] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Li, Z (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhong, H (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lizhi@cueb.edu.cn; haizhong@cufe.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673314],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We would like to thank Alexandra Roulet and an anonymous referee for comments that substantially improve the paper.

The separation theorem holds in that the firm's optimal output level depends neither on the firm's attitude towards ambiguity nor on the incident to the underlying ambiguity. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which the full-hedging theorem holds and thus options are not used. When these conditions are violated, we show that the firm optimally uses options for hedging purposes if ambiguity is introduced to the price and background risk by means of mean-preserving spreads.

To illustrate, the temperature responses to given emission reduction paths implied by the climate modules of the well-known integrated assessments models DICE, FUND and PAGE are described and compared. A dummy temperature module based on the climate denialists' view is added. Using a simple welfare-maximising growth model of the global economy, the sensitivity of the optimal carbon price, renewable energy subsidy and energy transition to each of these climate models is discussed. The paper then derives max-min, max-max and min-max regret policies to deal with this particular form of climate (model) uncertainty and with climate scepticism. The max-min or min-max regret climate policies rely on a non-sceptic view of global warming and lead to a substantial and moderate amount of caution, respectively.

Under these circumstances excessive reliance on forecast evaluation metrics that ignores this instability in forecasting accuracy, like squared errors averaged over the whole forecast evaluation sample, masks important information regarding the temporal evolution of relative forecasting performance of competing models. In this paper we suggest an approach based on the combination of the Cumulated Sum of Squared Forecast Error Differential (CSSFED) of Welch and Goyal (2008) and the Bayesian change point analysis of Barry and Hartigan (1993) that tracks the contribution of forecast errors to the aggregate measures of forecast accuracy observation by observation. In doing so, it allows one to track the evolution of the relative forecasting performance over time.

The private sector, both international and local, has been a major beneficiary of state construction subsidies. The private sector, however, has been reluctant to provide its own financing and invest in real estate due to weak land tenure and the lack of legislative reforms to make a functional land market. Solving the problems around land may be a way to stimulate the engagement of private-sector participation in providing financing for housing. The successes and failures of 'land-value capture', a method that provided financing for the growth of Chinese cities, should be studied and could be adapted to finance the large backlog in urban upgrading of basic service infrastructure and housing for the poor for cities like Luanda.","[Cain, Allan] Dev Workshop, Idaho Falls, ID 83402 USA",,"Cain, A (通讯作者)，Dev Workshop, Idaho Falls, ID 83402 USA.",allan.devworks@angonet.org,"Cain, Allan/GXH-2007-2022","Cain, Allan/0000-0003-3598-3193",Rockefeller Foundation,Rockefeller Foundation,The author thanks the Rockefeller Foundation for a Bellagio Centre Fellowship to prepare this paper.

Internal R&D is most efficient in foreign firms, followed by private firms and then state-owned enterprises.

Comparing the new networks obtained for the society after the arrival of a new agent with the initially pairwise stable network, we propose four different population invariance properties of a network: link invariance, distance invariance, connectedness invariance, and network invariance. We show that pairwise stability is incompatible with link invariance under certain assumptions on the allocation rule. However, if we consider specific models, positive results can be obtained.

Other workers, with fragmented and therefore short employment had to work until reaching the ever rising NRA. A peculiar consequence of these rules is the strong negative correlation between the retirement age and the length of contribution.

Evidence from high frequency data,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Deterrence; Public and private law enforcement; Community enforcement; Norm conformance,IN-DIFFERENCES; COOPERATION,"A substantial theoretical literature identifies two general approaches to deterring non norm conforming behavior: public law enforcement to monitor and punish proscribed behavior, and private (community) enforcement to discourage both illegal and legal norm defying activities. Recent papers highlight the importance of both enforcement approaches but empirical identification of their relative effects has been challenging. Utilizing a novel, event-level database from the National Hockey League, we examine the separate and interactive effects of law enforcement (referees) and community, vigilante justice (fighting) on non-conforming behavior. We find that the timing of events is crucial in determining the effectiveness of the different types of enforcement. Community enforcement is effective only when law enforcement is lacking. Conversely, law enforcement actions are effective both independently and in conjunction with community enforcement.

The NAIRU is a poor proxy for 'structural unemployment'. Labor market institutions - employment protection legislation, union density, tax wedge, minimum wages - underperform in explaining the NAIRU, while cyclical variables capital accumulation and boom-bust patterns in housing markets - play an important role. This finding is policy-relevant since the NAIRU is used to compute potential output and structural budget balances and, hence, has a direct impact on scope and evaluation of fiscal policies in Europe.

Using natural disasters in the United States as an exogenous variation diminishing media attention, the link appears causal. One additional article is suggested to produce 1.4 attacks over the following week, equivalent to three casualties on average.

Based on micro-level student data from an anonymous province from 2004 to 2007, we find that adopting a one-exam system is likely to significantly help the humanities students in their probability of being admitted to their first choice institutions.","[Li, Feng] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Secur & Futures, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Gan, Li] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Gan, Li] Natl Bur Econ Res, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Li, F (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Secur & Futures, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",lifeng@swufe.edu.cn; ganli@tamu.edu,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,21,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

As reading is crucial for continuous investment in human capital throughout a person's life, it is important that children acquire the habit of reading. This habit may be developed through both cultural and educational transfers from parents to children, and through imitative behaviours. Imitation is of particular interest, as it suggests that parents can have a direct influence on the formation of their children's preferences and habits, and that active policies promoting good parenting behaviours might therefore be desirable. We investigate the short-run imitative behaviour of children using a household fixed-effects model in which we identify the impact of the parents' role model by exploiting the differences in the exposure of siblings to their parents' example within the same household. We find robust evidence of the existence of an imitation effect: on the day of the survey, children were more likely to had read after seeing either their mother or their father reading.","[Mancini, Anna Laura] Bank Italy, Turin, Italy; [Mancini, Anna Laura; Pasqua, Silvia] CHILD Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy; [Monfardini, Chiara] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, IZA, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Monfardini, Chiara] CHILD Coll Carlo Alberto, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Pasqua, Silvia] Univ Turin, Turin, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; University of Bologna; University of Turin,"Monfardini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Econ, IZA, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.;Monfardini, C (通讯作者)，CHILD Coll Carlo Alberto, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",chiara.monfardini@unibo.it,,,"Collegio Carlo Alberto (the The Parental and Public Investments and Child Outcomes Project); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Collegio Carlo Alberto (the The Parental and Public Investments and Child Outcomes Project); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank Elena Argentesi, Pedro Carneiro, Margherita Fort, Virginia Hernanz, Andrea Ichino, Cheti Nicoletti, and Giulio Zanella; as well as the participants at the Iza/Sole 10th Transatlantic Meeting, the Zew Labour Market Seminar, the ISER JESS Seminar, the EALE 2011 Conference, the ChilD Conference Parental and Public Investments and Child Outcomes.

How did this tremendous increase in trade affect economic development? This work isolates a causality channel by exploiting the fact that the introduction of the steamship in the shipping industry produced an asymmetric change in trade distances among countries. Before this invention, trade routes depended on wind patterns. The steamship reduced shipping costs and time in a disproportionate manner across countries and trade routes. Using this source of variation and novel data on shipping, trade, and development, I find that (i) the adoption of the steamship had a major impact on patterns of trade worldwide; (ii) only a small number of countries, characterized by more inclusive institutions, benefited from trade integration; and (iii) globalization was the major driver of the economic divergence between the rich and the poor portions of the world in the years 1850-1900.","[Pascali, Luigi] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Econ, Ramon Trias Fargas 25, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Pascali, Luigi] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Pascali, Luigi] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Pascali, Luigi] CAGE, London, England; [Pascali, Luigi] CEPR, London, England",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; University of Warwick; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Pascali, L (通讯作者)，Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Econ, Ramon Trias Fargas 25, Barcelona 08005, Spain.;Pascali, L (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.;Pascali, L (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England.;Pascali, L (通讯作者)，CAGE, London, England.;Pascali, L (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",luigi.pascali@upf.edu,"Pascali, Luigi/ABD-8983-2020; Pascali, Luigi/N-8778-2019","Pascali, Luigi/0000-0003-0486-495X;","CAGE; Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of RD Excellence [ECO2011-25272, SEV-2011-0075]; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish",CAGE; Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of RD Excellence; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from CAGE and Spanish research grants ECO2011-25272 and SEV-2011-0075 (Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of R&D Excellence).,,57,71,81,3,62,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

This is an important feature, since policy related models are the only relevant yardstick and emerging economies (such as Colombia) have been historically more vulnerable to financial imbalances. Unlike previous works, finance-neutral gaps were evaluated in a monetary policy context exactly as it is routinely performed by a central bank. The distribution of output gap revisions is analyzed and a metric to compare real-time robustness across models is developed. This metric constitutes a novel way to summarize the distribution of real-time uncertainty around output gaps, and policymakers should employ it for comparison purposes. Also, the real-time policy performance of finance-neutral gaps is studied, separating suggested ex post from operational ex ante usefulness. The results suggest that finance-neutral gaps are neither more robust in real time nor more operationally useful than the benchmark estimates. These results have important implications for policymakers and for the relevant literature.","[Sebastian Amador-Torres, J.] Banco Republ, Bogota, Colombia",Banco de la Republica Colombia,"Amador-Torres, JS (通讯作者)，Banco Republ, Bogota, Colombia.",sebastian_amador@me.com,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

A buyer employs a Bayesian update mechanism to acquire information from past auction bidding data to formulate his estimation of the expected future price, and thus his procurement decision depends on both his expected future price and the current auction price. The cartel can both increase its profits and mask its presence by manipulating the information transmitted to the buyer. In fact, by employing some informational strategies, the cartel can misinform the buyer and skew the intertemporal procurement decision to its advantage. Finally, we find that imposing a bidding ceiling that exceeds the observed current auction price may be a feasible weapon that allows the buyer to reduce the adverse effects of bidder collusion.

However, the empirical evidence of the effectiveness of such policies in improving air quality remains mixed (e.g., Davis, 2008; Viard & Fu, 2015). Individuals may change their commute schedules/routes or hire/purchase additional vehicles to circumvent such restrictions. This paper addresses this possibility by utilizing hourly measurements of air pollutants from monitoring stations at Lanzhou, one of the most polluted cities in China. Utilizing a regression discontinuity design (RD) approach, we concluded that the driving restrictions in Lanzhou are ineffective in improving its air quality. Specific hour and location results suggest that drivers shift their travel schedules, take detours, and acquire alternative vehicles. The results are robust after considering alternative model specifications and sample restrictions.","[Ye, Jingjing] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Ye, JJ (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",jingjingye@swufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,21,20,24,4,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

This interpretation reveals several compositions and compromises between different orders of worth (Boltanski & Thevenot, 1991), their mutual redefinition and transformation, as well as tensions between the worth of inspiration (Art and Culture) and practical logic of market viability. The latter doesn't form any worth but contributes to undermining these entrepreneurs' capacity to find a legitimate qualification of their action. The grand dichotomy between Art and Business arises through clubs' entrepreneurs' relationships with theirs investors; it's also analyzed through an international partnership aiming at implementing the creative industries model in the region of St. Petersburg (2002-2003). In the second half of the 2000's, under the impetus given by new actors and new types of venues emerging on the market, original compromises are established between several grandeurs redefined and up-dated, providing this entrepreneurship with flexible and plural forms of justification. For instance, a form of compromise is found between a renewed worth of inspiration and the market worth, through the representation of a regular customer which would be solvent and, at the same time, culturally valid (creative intelligentsia).","[Zaytseva, Anna] Univ Toulouse 2 Jean Jaures, Toulouse, France; [Zaytseva, Anna] CREATIS EA 4152, Lab Lettres Langages & Arts, Paris, France; [Zaytseva, Anna] CERCEC CNRS EHESS, Paris, France",Universite de Toulouse; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Zaytseva, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse 2 Jean Jaures, Toulouse, France.;Zaytseva, A (通讯作者)，CREATIS EA 4152, Lab Lettres Langages & Arts, Paris, France.;Zaytseva, A (通讯作者)，CERCEC CNRS EHESS, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,7,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

The analysis covers the period between 1999:01 and 2013:12, split into pre-crisis and financial crisis periods using a structural break test. In addition, a number of specifications are examined, including those in which only positive or negative policy rate changes are used as the dependent variable. An ordered probit model is used as it is deemed more appropriate for modelling discrete economic behaviour, such as policy rate changes, than continuous time series methods. The results from the pre-crisis period show that, although the monetary aggregate was significant in models that incorporate all the policy changes, but when considering just positive policy rate changes, the coefficient for monetary growth is not only small, but also statistically insignificant. Hence, this casts doubt on the extent to which monetary growth influenced the ECB policy rate decisions prior to the financial crisis. The monetary growth coefficients for the crisis period are also found to be insignificant. However, unlike during the pre-crisis period, the coefficient for inflation is found to be both positive and statistically significant, thus confirming qualitative perceptions that the ECB prioritised its price-stability mandate over concerns that the Euro Area sovereign debt crisis.","[Ahmad, Ahmad Hassan] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Brown, Stephen] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",Loughborough University; University of Bath,"Ahmad, AH (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",A.H.Ahmad@lboro.ac.uk,"Ahmad, Ahmad Hassan/S-7906-2019","Ahmad, Ahmad Hassan/0000-0002-6004-0181",,,,,28,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2017,44.0,3,,,,,585,607,,10.1007/s10663-016-9339-1,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FC2FA,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406651500010,0

This paper revisits the empirical evidence by exploiting heterogeneity in firms' environmental image. While locating in countries with weak environmental standards is likely to be detrimental for a firm's image and reputation, investing in corporate environmental responsibility can help firms to convince consumers that they have good environmental practices, even when investing in the dirty countries. Exploiting an original database that records an index of environmental responsibility for large European firms, we find that the firms viewed as environment-friendly are more often than others located in countries with weak environmental regulations. We show that our findings are not likely to be driven by omitted variables bias, specific sectors nor particular countries.

Another type of non-convexity arises in economies with sectors whenever individuals can work in only one sector at a time. I introduce this restriction into an open economy model with a tradeable and a non-tradeable sector, and I use lotteries to convexify the consumption possibilities set. This approach implies that the aggregate elasticity of labour supply becomes infinite. I compare the performance of the model with an analogous model in which the labour supply elasticity is finite. I find that there is a disconnect between the response of wages to monetary shocks and the open economy variables. The labour supply elasticity plays a more important role in the transmission of technology and government expenditure shocks to the real exchange rate and the terms of trade.","[Povoledo, Laura] Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England",University of West England,"Povoledo, L (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England.",Laura.Povoledo@uwe.ac.uk,,"Povoledo, Laura/0000-0003-0558-1652",,,,,38,2,2,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The suggested method takes into account responses to the changing nature of financial markets and allows for the possibility of observing negative interest rates. Our approach enables to find particular values of switching points between alternative regimes. After showing main theoretical steps, an investigation of the dependence of such points on key parameters of bonds is provided. An empirical illustration follows, accompanied by a discussion of theoretical and practical effects of this bond property. This approach offers both theorists and interested practitioners a way of overcoming difficulties associated with computations because of the complicated theoretical background. The results can be generalised, so that they apply both to the life of a bond and to the behaviour of a portfolio of bonds at a point of time.","[Stadnik, Bohumil] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic; [Zd'arek, Vaclav] Skoda Auto Vysoka Skola Ops, Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Skoda Auto University,"Stádník, B (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic.",bohumil.stadnik@vse.cz; vaclav.zdarek@savs.cz,,,Institutional Grant VSE [IP 100040]; GA [16-21506S],Institutional Grant VSE; GA,The research has been supported by the Institutional Grant VSE IP 100040 and by GA 16-21506S.,,33,1,1,0,0,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

We show that a vertical merger has two main effects. On the one hand, it increases the total collusive profits, increasing the stakes of collusion. On the other hand, it creates an asymmetry between the integrated firm and the unintegrated competitors. The integrated firm, accessing the input at marginal cost, faces higher profits in the deviation phase and in the non-cooperative equilibrium, which potentially harms collusion. As we show, the optimal collusive profit-sharing agreement takes care of the increased incentive to deviate of the integrated firm, while optimal punishment erases the difficulty related to the asymmetries in the non-cooperative state. As a result, vertical integration generally favors collusion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The economy is populated with two sets of infinitesimal agents, buyers and sellers, who have private information about their own valuations of the object. In each period, buyers and sellers in the pool are matched to draw randomly a pair of expected payoffs, which will realize if the long term relationship is formed. Each player decides whether or not to agree to form a long term relationship, conditioned on his private information. If both parties agree, then they leave the pool, receiving the expected payoff in each period while the long term relationship continues. The existing long term relationship is terminated either by will or by a random shock, upon which both parties return to the respective pools of agents. We quantify the amount of friction by the time span of each period. We demonstrate that as the friction vanishes, any sequence of stationary equilibrium outcomes, in which trade occurs with a positive probability, converges to the competitive equilibrium, under a general two sided incomplete information about the private valuation of each agent.

Previous studies have examined costs using cross-sectional or low frequency data and thus cannot capture dynamic macroeconomic effects across time. We fill this gap by examining U.S. intermediation costs using a quarterly, bank-level dataset from 1993 through 2012. This data set allows for the separation of microeconomic and macroeconomic factors affecting the cyclicality of costs. The analysis shows that house prices are the main driving source of this countercyclicality. Because housing is used as collateral, a price decline leads banks to increase their operating costs for monitoring, screening and litigation costs which cause a credit crunch in the economy.","[Jaremski, Matthew; Sapci, Ayse] Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Jaremski, M (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",mjaremski@colgate.edu; asapci@colgate.edu,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Affirmative action increases the black share of employees over time: in 5 years after an establishment is first regulated, the black share of employees increases by an average of 0.8 percentage points. Strikingly, the black share continues to grow at a similar pace even after an establishment is deregulated.

Using data from a large representative household survey, we employ a triple difference approach (using boys and the neighboring state of Jharkhand as comparison groups) and find that being in a cohort that was exposed to the Cycle program increased girls' age-appropriate enrollment in secondary school by 32 percent and reduced the corresponding gender gap by 40 percent. We also find an 18 percent increase in the number of girls who appear for the high-stakes secondary school certificate exam, and a 12 percent increase in the number of girls who pass it. Parametric and non-parametric decompositions of the triple-difference estimate as a function of distance to the nearest secondary school show that the increases in enrollment mostly took place in villages that were further away from a secondary school, suggesting that the mechanism of impact was the reduction in the time and safety cost of school attendance made possible by the bicycle. We also find that the Cycle program was much more cost effective at increasing girls' secondary school enrollment than comparable conditional cash transfer programs in South Asia.","[Muralidharan, Karthik] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr,0508, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Muralidharan, Karthik] NBER BREAD & J PAL, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Prakash, Nishith] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Prakash, Nishith] Univ Connecticut, Human Rights Inst, 365 Fairfield Way, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Prakash, Nishith] IZA HiCN & CReAM, Bonn, Germany",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Muralidharan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr,0508, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;Muralidharan, K (通讯作者)，NBER BREAD & J PAL, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kamurali@ucsd.edu; nishith.prakash@uconn.edu,,,International Growth Center (IGC) [CPR-INB-HUM-2011-CPP-34006],International Growth Center (IGC),"This project greatly benefited from financial and logistical support from the International Growth Center (IGC) Grant: CPR-INB-HUM-2011-CPP-34006 for the research as well as its dissemination.

In this way, the monopolist's charge for input co-determines downstream market conduct. We spell out some consequences of this, for example, that an increase of downstream capacity costs can result in increased output.

The heterogeneity of interaction is defined in two models. First, agents in a network are restricted to interacting with only their neighbors (local interaction). Second, agents are allowed to adopt different IPD strategies against different opponents (discriminative interaction). These two heterogeneous interaction scenarios are different to the classical evolutionary game, in which each agent interacts with every other agent in the population by adopting the same strategy against all opponents. Moreover, agents adapt their risk attitudes while engaging in interactions. Agents with payoffs above (or below) their aspirations will become more risk averse (or risk seeking) in subsequent interactions, wherein risk is defined as the standard deviation of one-move payoffs in the IPD game. In simulation experiments with agents using only own historical payoffs as aspirations (historical comparison), we find that the whole population can achieve a high level of cooperation via the risk attitude adaptation mechanism, in the cases of either local or discriminative interaction models. Meanwhile, when agents use the population's average payoff as aspirations (social comparison) for adapting risk attitudes, the high level of cooperation can only be sustained in a portion of the population (i.e., partial cooperation). This finding also holds true in both of the heterogeneous scenarios. Considering that payoffs cannot be precisely estimated in a realistic IPD game, simulation experiments are also conducted with a Gaussian disturbance added to the game payoffs. The results reveal that partial cooperation in the population under social comparison is more robust to the variation in payoffs than the global cooperation under historical comparison.","[Zeng, Weijun; Li, Minqiang; Feng, Nan] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Weijun] Hainan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Hainan University,"Li, MQ (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",wjzeng@tju.edu.cn; mqli@tju.edu.cn; fengnan@tju.edu.cn,"FENG, NAN/HGD-3255-2022",,"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China [70925005]; General Program of the National Science Foundation of China [71371135]; Key Program of the National Science Foundation of China [71131007]; Science Foundation of Hainan Province, China [20167244]; Scientific Research Foundation of Hainan University, China [kyqd1529]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Teams in Universities of China (PCSIRT)","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); General Program of the National Science Foundation of China; Key Program of the National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Foundation of Hainan Province, China; Scientific Research Foundation of Hainan University, China; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Teams in Universities of China (PCSIRT)(Program for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT))","This study was supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (Grant No. 70925005), the General Program of the National Science Foundation of China (No. 71371135), the Key Program of the National Science Foundation of China (No. 71131007), the Science Foundation of Hainan Province, China (No. 20167244), and the Scientific Research Foundation of Hainan University, China (No. kyqd1529).

Using data from the New Earnings Survey Panel Dataset, a mandatory survey of British employers' payroll records, we show there was no dip in the earnings density at the ceiling in either period, suggesting that the earnings of those near the ceiling were unresponsive to the change in tax rates. The absence of such a dip allows us to test which of labour cost, gross earnings or net earnings are smooth around the threshold. As shown by Alvaredo et al. (De Econ, 2017. doi:10.1007/s10645-017-9294-7 Address=10.1007/s10645-017-9294-7 TargetType=DOI), this is informative about the incidence of the change in tax rates at the threshold on those located nearby. We cannot reject the hypothesis that it is gross earnings that are smooth around the threshold, which may reflect a substantive role for statutory incidence in determining economic incidence. However, a lack of statistical power means that, while in some cases we can reject the hypotheses that the full economic incidence of NICs are borne by one side of the market, our results taken alone are also consistent with a wide range of less extreme incidence shares.","[Adam, Stuart; Roantree, Barra; Phillips, David] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Roantree, Barra] UCL, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"Roantree, B (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.;Roantree, B (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",barra_r@ifs.org.uk,,"Roantree, Barra/0000-0002-8738-8225","European Research Council [ERC-2010-AdG-269440-WSCWTBDS]; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy based at the Institute for Fiscal Studies [ES/M010147/1]; ESRC [ES/K006185/1]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/K006185/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1, ES/K006185/1] Funding Source: researchfish",European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy based at the Institute for Fiscal Studies(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are grateful to Casper van Ewijk for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper and to colleagues at DIW Berlin, CPB Netherlands and IPP Paris School of Economics, working with us on the broader project on 'The impact of social security contributions on earnings' of which this paper is a part, for many helpful discussions throughout the course of the project.

We find that speculative activities in the oil market, rather than oil price movements, are positively correlated with anti-herding in the stock markets of major exporters. We argue that traders take the speculative signals from the oil market as a sign of positive expectations and try to generate superior profits by going against the crowd in their local market. While this pattern largely holds during calm (low volatility) market periods, we also find that significant herd behavior takes place during high volatility (or crisis) periods. The findings suggest that policy makers who are concerned about stability in their stock markets should monitor measures of speculative activities in the energy market in order to model and monitor volatility and/or risk transmissions into their markets.

I propose three measures of workers' incentives to accumulate skills. These incentives correlate with wage growth conditional on hours worked and past wages, implying that significant components of wage growth are not accounted for by the LBD model. This suggests that wage growth is costly and that workers face a trade-off between current and future earnings. This trade-off has ramifications for wage subsidy policies and for understanding women's decisions about children and career.","[Belley, Philippe] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Belley, P (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

This paper argues that hereditary leadership is like a relational contract which improves policy incentives. We assemble a unique dataset on leaders between 1874 and 2004 in which we classify them as hereditary leaders based on their family history. The core empirical finding is that economic growth is higher in polities with hereditary leaders but only if executive constraints are weak. Moreover, this holds across of a range of specifications. The finding is also mirrored in policy outcomes which affect growth. In addition, we find that hereditary leadership is more likely to come to an end when the growth performance under the incumbent leader is poor.","[Besley, Timothy] LSE, London, England; [Besley, Timothy] CIFAR, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Reynal-Querol, Marta] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Reynal-Querol, Marta] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Reynal-Querol, Marta] BarcelonaGSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Reynal-Querol, Marta] IPEG, Barcelona, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA,"Reynal-Querol, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.;Reynal-Querol, M (通讯作者)，ICREA, Barcelona, Spain.;Reynal-Querol, M (通讯作者)，BarcelonaGSE, Barcelona, Spain.;Reynal-Querol, M (通讯作者)，IPEG, Barcelona, Spain.",marta.reynal@upf.edu,"Reynal-Querol, Marta/L-7038-2014","Reynal-Querol, Marta/0000-0002-0293-5446",ESRC; CIFAR; European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (ERC) [647514]; Spanish Ministerio de Educacion [ECO2014-55555-P]; Barcelona GSE Research Network; Government of Catalonia; ICREA Funding Source: Custom; European Research Council (ERC) [647514] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); CIFAR(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)); European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (ERC); Spanish Ministerio de Educacion(Spanish Government); Barcelona GSE Research Network; Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya); ICREA(ICREA); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Besley is grateful for funding from Martin Newson, the ESRC and CIFAR.

Methods: To achieve presented target, the authors designed the questionnaire survey submitted to employees of companies in the Czech Republic. Findings & Value added: The first part of this paper displays the state of knowledge on budgeting, the following part presents results of the survey.

We use a regression discontinuity approach exploiting exogenous variation in the compulsory school enrollment rule caused by the reform. Our results reveal positive short-term effects on labor supply (approximately five percentage points) and on earnings (about 12600/1350 NOK/Euro). Subgroup analyses show that the positive effects are much stronger for mothers with low wage potential, a group of mothers that were less likely to use formal childcare prior to the reform. The positive effects for this subgroup of mothers suggest that expanding child-care can be an effective tool for increasing labor supply of mothers who previously had relatively low labor market earnings potential.","[Finseraas, Henning; Hardoy, Ines; Schone, Pal] Inst Social Res, P Box 3233 Elisenberg, N-0208 Oslo, Norway",,"Schone, P (通讯作者)，Inst Social Res, P Box 3233 Elisenberg, N-0208 Oslo, Norway.",pal.schone@samfunnsforskning.no,,,Norwegian research council; Center for Research on Gender Equality (CORE),Norwegian research council(Research Council of Norway); Center for Research on Gender Equality (CORE),"This research was supported by two Norwegian research council projects, Trygd i kontekst and Center for Research on Gender Equality (CORE).

It is not mere chance that economics is surrounded by methodological debates. If its relevance is at stake, this can be either refuted or proven most efficiently at a methodological level. Arguments for and against mainstream economics underline the methodological homogeneity of mainstream economics, while serious, though almost neglected, arguments can be found for a view according to which the long history of mainstream economics can be described as a sequence of methodological breaks. I argue, firstly, for a sharp demarcation by new classical macroeconomics from the Friedmanian instrumentalism and, secondly, for the realism of new classicals. I strive to identify the epistemological principles underlying Lucas' models and to highlight the signs of that demarcation as well. I concentrate on the techniques by which new classicals could set their models into an indirect relationship with reality. It is also highlighted that the common terminology, according to which the assumptions of abstract economic models are uniformly regarded as unrealistic, actually refers to two different techniques. From these approaches, there is only one which can be justifiably labelled as realist.","[Galbacs, Peter] Budapest Business Sch, Inst Econ & Methodol, Budapest, Hungary",Budapest Business University,"Galbács, P (通讯作者)，Budapest Business Sch, Inst Econ & Methodol, Budapest, Hungary.",Galbacs.Peter@uni-bge.hu,"Galbács, Peter/AAK-7169-2021","Galbács, Peter/0000-0003-0381-5486",,,,,51,2,2,0,8,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We distinguish between the policies pursued by (a) a non-optimizing, and (b) an optimizing government. For both cases, corruption leads to higher income tax and inflation rates and a lower level of government spending, thus hindering growth. In the circumstances, an activist government could allocate its resources in attempting to reduce the type of corruption that harms growth the most.

It focuses on public-private wage gaps at the onset of and during the crisis, decomposed into structural and composition effects using an extension to the Oaxaca-Blinder method based on Recentered Influence Function (RIF) regressions and reweighting. The main results indicate that at the beginning of the crisis public sector workers in both countries enjoyed a significant wage premium, with the premium in Serbia being about three times higher than in Croatia. During the crisis, both countries experienced a similar increase of the premium, with Croatia reaching the size of gap usually estimated for EU countries, while Serbia stayed largely ahead. The results also show that the wage distribution in the public sector is more compressed than in the private sector in both countries, which is further exacerbated by the crisis. Despite the introduced austerity measures, public sector workers continue to enjoy well-protected and privileged jobs in terms of wages relative to their private sector counterparts. Structural reforms undertaken prior to the crisis played a decisive role in determining the countries' responses to the crisis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We analytically show that while the immigration-induced increase in the size increases the relative wages, employment and output shares of the skill intensive sector, changes in the skill distribution lead to analytically ambiguous effects. We derive quantitative results for the US economy under different counter-factual scenarios with respect to immigration-induced changes in size and skill distribution of the labor force, where these changes resemble those of U.S. as a whole, New York, California and Canada, and reflect different immigration policy regimes. For example, immigration increases the mass of workers at the lower range of the skill distribution in the U.S., and the upper range in Canada. Regardless of these differences across scenarios, our quantitative results indicate that immigration increases the relative average wages of the skill intensive sector. Further, real wages of all workers increase due to reduced prices caused by the increased size of the labor force. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In order to compete, firms are obliged to introduce new technologies, products, services or organizational systems and are forced to seek competitive advantages in innovativeness. Technology transfer becomes a major opportunity to enhance competitiveness and innovativeness of enterprises. The use of technology transfer and implementation of innovations allows companies to meet the requirements of the market and international competition. This paper discusses innovation activity occurring in industrial enterprises in Poland at present. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to determine the level of innovativeness in gaining the competitive position of surveyed Polish enterprises. The purpose of the article is to determine the occurring innovation activity and the novelty level of innovations implemented in the group of surveyed firms. Methods: The study is based on a survey on industrial firms (n=100) located in Poland. Data was collected during 100 individual interviews with high-and medium-level managers of randomly selected companies. Findings & Value added: The research has determined the level of innovativeness in gaining the competitive position of the surveyed firms. As the survey showed, enterprises pre-vailed the range of implementation of material innovation - product and process. Rarely firms implement non-material innovations. The study pointed to low activity in the field of patenting and implementing innovations with a high level of novelty. According to the obtained results, there is a dominant introducing new form the companies side innovations, which causes low competitiveness of surveyed enterprises. These findings suggest that measurement of innovativeness in gaining the competitiveness should be developed. The findings support the need for Polish enterprises to participate in advanced forms of technology and knowledge procurement.","[Sachpazidu-Wojcicka, Karina] Univ Bialystok, M Sklodowskiej Curie 14 St, PL-15097 Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok,"Sachpazidu-Wójcicka, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bialystok, M Sklodowskiej Curie 14 St, PL-15097 Bialystok, Poland.",sachpazidu@uwb.edu.pl,"Sachpazidu, Karina/GNH-6319-2022",,project titled Technology transfer and competitive advantage of companies in Poland [UMO-2015/17/N/HS4/02108],project titled Technology transfer and competitive advantage of companies in Poland,"The article is the result of the project of National Science Centre in Poland.

Spatial Economic Analysis. Although there is an abundant regional labour market literature taking a spatial perspective, only a few studies have explored extending the analysis of labour force participation with spatial effects. This paper revisits this important issue, proposing a time-space recursive modelling approach that builds on and appraises Fogli and Veldkamp's methodology from 2011 and finding for the United States that participation rates vary with past values in nearby regions. Major shortcomings in their study are corrected for, including stationarity and the control for endogenous regressors other than the time and space-time-lagged dependent variable using system generalized method of moments (GMM). The paper also highlights interaction effects among explanatory variables for the first time in this context. Using a panel of 108 regions across the European Union over 1986-2010, the results for total, male and female participation rates throw a new light on the socio-economic relevance of different determinants. Importantly, characteristics in neighbouring regions play a significant role, and neglecting endogeneity is found to have serious consequences, underlining increased attention on the specification and estimation of spatial econometric models with endogenous regressors.","[Vega, Solmaria Halleck] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Vega, Solmaria Halleck; Elhorst, J.

In fact, it began as barter, but was based on the social organization that Sogdians developed in their communities when migrating east. Their particular way of generating trust and institutionalized cooperation was by social leverage, involving third parties as contract witnesses and/or guarantors. These usually had own commercial relations with the contractors, facilitating crediting and exchange - and credible threat to defectors. While Greif (1989) had been criticized for overlooking courts in the Maghribi case, we discuss a differentiated (latent) role for courts. We also discuss property rights versus possession, transactions costs and price implications. We analyze the mechanism in historical cases and game-theoretical reconstructions, and explain trade flourishing under strong uncertainty.","[Zhang, Yanlong] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Elsner, Wolfram] Univ Bremen, Iino Inst Inst & Innovat Econ, Bremen, Germany",Tsinghua University; University of Bremen,"Zhang, YL (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhang.yanlong@hotmail.com; welsner@uni-bremen.de,,,,,,,37,5,6,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Hence, we combine a multivariate ARMA-GARCH model and wavelet multiresolution analysis to study this phenomenon. A bivariate ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1)-cDCC-Student-t model was joined with MODWT filter to capture a broad range of possible spillover effects in mean and variances of level prices at various time horizons. Generally, empirical results provide strong evidence of time-varying volatility in all markets under study. However, our proposed approach shows that oil price and stock market prices are directly affected by their own news and volatilities and indirectly affected by the volatilities of other prices and wavelet scale. The results show also, that mean and volatility spillover effects was decomposed into many sub-spillovers on different time scales according to heterogeneous investors and market participants. The practical implications of this study are critical, innovative and useful for the local and international investors and also for the portfolio managers. They can utilize this study to formulate the optimal oil-BRICKS stock portfolios as well as lead to more accurate predictions of volatility spillovers patterns also in developing their hedging strategies.

Deploying nuclear power plants, however, may be challenging when uncertainty in long-term electricity demand and more importantly public acceptance are considered. This is true especially for emerging economies (e.g., India, China) concerned with reducing their carbon footprint in the context of growing economic development, while accommodating a growing population and significantly changing demographics, as well as recent events that may affect the public's perception of nuclear technology. In the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster, public acceptance has come to play a central role in continued operations and deployment of new nuclear power systems worldwide. In countries seeing importantlong-term demographic changes, it may be difficult to determine the future capacity needed, when and where to deploy it over time, and in the most economic manner. Existing studies on capacity deployment typically do not consider such uncertainty drivers in long-term capacity deployment analyses (e.g., +40 years). To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel approach to nuclear power systems design and capacity deployment under uncertainty that exploits the idea of strategic flexibility and managerial decision rules. The approach enables dealing more pro-actively with uncertainty and helps identify the most economic deployment paths for new nuclear capacity deployment over multiple sites. One novelty of the study lies in the explicit recognition of public acceptance as an important uncertainty driver affecting economic performance, along with long-term electricity demand. Another novelty is in how the concept of flexibility is exploited to deal with uncertainty and improve expected lifecycle performance (e.g. cost). New design and deployment strategies are developed and analyzed through a multistage stochastic programming framework where decision rules are represented as non-anticipative constraints. This approach provides a new way to devise and analyze adaptation strategies in view of long-term uncertainty fluctuations that is more intuitive and readily usable by system operators than typical solutions obtained from standard real options analysis techniques, which are typically used to analyze flexibility in large-scale, irreversible investment projects. The study considers three flexibility strategies subject to uncertainty in electricity demand and public acceptance: 1) phasing (or staging) capacity deployment over time and space, 2) on-site capacity expansion, and 3) life extension. Numerical analysis shows that flexible designs perform better than rigid optimal design deployment strategies, and the most flexible design combining the above strategies outperforms both more rigid and less flexible design alternatives. It is also demonstrated that a flexible design benefits from the strategies of phasing and capacity expansion most significantly across all three strategies studied. The results provide useful insights for policy and decision-making in countries that are considering new nuclear facility deployment, in light of ongoing challenges surrounding new nuclear builds worldwide.

However, we also find that leverage, director interlocking, concentrated ownership, and the presence of managers on the board mitigate the use of committees, suggesting that committee use is limited by the existence of alternative governance mechanisms.

Two views prevail. Donors are perceived either as ideologically motivated consumers or as privilege-seeking investors. To investigate differences in donor motivation between corporations and individuals, we analyze data from Germany. For the period from 1994 to 2014, we find that corporations act more like investors than individuals do. First, we test whether corporations or individuals are more inclined to give more to incumbent parties than to parties outside the governing coalition. Giving to incumbent parties whose representatives hold public offices may be more attractive for investing donors. Second, we test for differences between corporations and individuals in the relative increase in donations from non-election years to election years. Investor donations may be more volatile than consumer donations. We find that only corporations donate more to incumbent parties and that corporations increase their party donations from non-election years to election years more than individuals do. These differences in the behavior of corporate and individual donors provide some evidence for potentially undesirable exchanges between corporations as investors and parties. Further, the differences between individual and corporate donors tend to be more consistent for parties to the right on the political spectrum.","[Fink, Alexander] Univ Leipzig, Inst Wirtschaftspolit, Grimma Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Fink, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Wirtschaftspolit, Grimma Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",alexander.fink@uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,68,4,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2017,70.0,2,,,,,220,255,,10.1111/kykl.12136,0.0,,,36,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ER5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398843600003,0

A strategy has one-period recall if actions in a particular period are only conditioned on information in the previous and the current period. We show that if players are sufficiently patient, given any proposal in the space of possible agreements, there exists a subgame perfect equilibrium such that the given proposal is made and unanimously accepted in period zero. As a corollary we derive that also perpetual delay can be sustained as a subgame perfect equilibrium. Our strategies are pure and have one-period recall, and we do not make use of a public randomization device. The players' discount factors are allowed to be heterogeneous.

Evidence on the Flypaper Effect of Highway Grants in the 2009 Recovery Act,AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,AMERICAN RECOVERY,This paper examines how state governments adjusted spending in response to the large temporary increase in federal highway grants under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The mechanism used to apportion ARRA highway grants to states allows one to isolate exogenous changes in these grants. The results indicate that states increased highway spending over 2009 to 2011 more than dollar-for-dollar with the ARRA grants they received. Rent-seeking efforts are shown to help explain this result: states with more political contributions from the public works sector to the governor and state legislators tended to spend more out of their ARRA highway funds than other states.,"[Leduc, Sylvain] Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada; [Wilson, Daniel] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, 101 Market St,Mail Stop 1130, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",Bank of Canada; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Leduc, S (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",SLeduc@bank-banque-canada.ca; daniel.wilson@sf.frb.org,,,,,,,43,32,43,0,5,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

While there are widespread concerns among China's trading partners about the effect of the slowdown in China's growth on their exports, China's structural changes are also likely to have a significant impact: for example, China will import fewer machines and more cosmetics. The central objective of the present paper is to empirically examine the effect of China's structural transformation on the exports of East Asian economies, which have close trade linkages with China. We find that economies that have failed to increase the share of consumption goods in their exports to China have suffered larger declines in their quantities of exports to China. In addition, economies that have suffered losses in their shares of China's parts and components imports have faced reductions in their shares in China's total imports.","[Lee, Hyun-Hoon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Int Trade & Business, Chunchon, South Korea; [Park, Donghyun] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Philippines; [Shin, Kwanho] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Kangwon National University; Asian Development Bank; Korea University,"Lee, HH (通讯作者)，Kangwon Natl Univ, Int Trade & Business, Chunchon, South Korea.",hhlee@kangwon.ac.kr; dpark@adb.org; khshin@korea.ac.kr,"Shin, Kwanho/AAL-7502-2021","Shin, Kwanho/0000-0001-9747-7603",Asian Development Bank; Kangwon National University [520150022],Asian Development Bank; Kangwon National University,The authors thank financial support from the Asian Development Bank.

To better assess the true differences within each causal relationship, all panel data has been separated into one Full panel and three subpanels of High, Middle, and Low income. The empirical framework used consists of various tests that identify the existence of cross-sectional dependency, a Pesaran panel unit root test, a Westerlund panel cointegration test, and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin method of the Granger causality test. Furthermore, this paper utilizes DOLS to estimate any long-run elastic relations between real GDP and residential or non-residential electricity consumption. Based on the results, this paper determines that no long-run relationship exists between non-residential electricity consumption and economic growth throughout and that the relationship between residential electricity consumption and economic growth possesses unit elastic behavior in the long run.

Grid scale energy storage projects are major investments which call for rigorous valuation and risk analysis. This paper provides a stochastic energy storage valuation framework in wholesale power markets which considers all key revenue streams simultaneously. As part of this framework, an operational optimization model is developed to determine the energy storage system's optimal dispatch sequences. A future curve model is built to capture the volatilities of electricity prices. In addition, a frequency regulation service price forecasting model is developed. Simulation results with a realistic battery storage system reveal that the majority of the market revenues comes from frequency regulation services. Simulation results also show that both round-trip efficiency and power-to-energy ratio are crucial to the cost effectiveness of energy storage systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper shows that at the level of the products used in constructing national price levels, the relationship is present in both 'services' and 'manufactures' and the specification of the relationship is different for the two. It further offers a new candidate explanation for the B-S relationship in manufactures, which is based on an appeal to product quality. This explanation yields a second, distinctive, testable prediction: controlling for per capita income, a non-monotonic relationship should exist between a country's income inequality and its national price level. The second prediction is shown to be consistent with empirical evidence. The explanation also implies that mismeasured quality exaggerates the B-S relationship and hence the observed cross-country income differences are likely to be underestimated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The event has gradually increased in relevance since its first edition in 2011. However, there is no formal analysis that assess the effect of the event on prices, mainly because of the lack of relevant information. Methods: This article analyzes the pricing policy during the Buen Fin in Mexico for a sample of urban establishments in the country. Using the database Who's Who in prices? of the Federal Consumer Protection Agency, an unbalanced panel of weekly prices for electronic products in 525 establishments during 2010-2015 is built. An event study design is further implemented in order to analyze the effects of the Buen Fin over average and specific prices of products and establishments and over the strategic pricing policies from participating companies. Results: The Buen Fin reduces the average prices of electronics items in 7% when compared with the prices observed in September before the event. Only 52% of the products in the sample effectively reduced their prices during the event. Accounting only for discounted products, an average discount of 15% is observed. There is also evidence of a systematic increase in electronic prices weeks before the event, on average, 2%; some establishments have adopted practices to make discounts more salient for consumers. Conclusions: The Buen Fin cannot be considered as an event of widespread sales and discounts. The discounts offered by different chains have significant differences. In some cases, several establishments have taken strategic practices to make more evident the deals offered during the event.","[Campos Vazquez, Raymundo M.; Medina Cortina, Eduardo M.] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudio Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Vázquez, RMC (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudio Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",rmcampos@colmex.mx; emedina@colmex.mx,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We construct a data set that covers Tsarist Russia during 1885-1913 and Soviet Union during 1928-1940. We develop a methodology that allows us to identify the types of frictions and economic mechanisms that had the largest quantitative impact on Russian economic development. We find that entry barriers and monopoly power in the non-agricultural sector were the most important reason for Tsarist Russia's failure to industrialize before World War I. Soviet industrial transformation after 1928 was achieved primarily by reducing such frictions, albeit coinciding with a significantly lower performance of productivity in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. We find no evidence that Tsarist agricultural institutions were a significant barrier to labour reallocation to manufacturing, or that Big Push mechanisms were a major driver of Soviet growth.","[Cheremukhin, Anton] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Golosov, Mikhail] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Guriev, Sergei] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Tsyvinski, Aleh] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Princeton University; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Yale University,"Cheremukhin, A (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",,"Tsyvinski, Aleh/T-3287-2019; Guriev, Sergei/AAE-4596-2020","Guriev, Sergei/0000-0001-6048-2169",NSF,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors thank Mark Aguiar, Paco Buera, V.V.

First, we suggest a misspecification problem in his approach regarding the order of integration in the inequality index, which shows evidence of nonstationarity only for the post-1980 data. Second, we demonstrate that his findings are not reliable because the panel cointegration test he used requires cross-section independence, which is inappropriate for the U.S. state-level data.

Existing research emphasizes the non-distorting properties of land taxes (when fixed factors are taxed) as well as growth-enhancing impacts (when asset portfolios are shifted to reproducible capital). This paper furthers the neoclassical perspective on land taxes by endogenizing land allocation decisions in a multi-sector growth model. Based on von Thunen's observation, agricultural land is created from wilderness through conversion and cultivation, both of which are associated with costs. In the steady state of our general equilibrium model, land taxes not only may reduce land consumption (associated with environmental benefits) but may also affect overall economic output, while leaving wages and interest rates unaffected. When labor productivity is higher in the manufacturing than in the agricultural sector and agricultural and manufactured goods are substitutes (or the economy is open to world trade), land taxes increase aggregate economic output. There is a complex interplay of conservation policy, technological change and land taxes, depending on consumer preferences, sectoral labor productivities and openness-to-trade. Our model introduces a new perspective on land taxes in current policy debates on development, tax reforms as well as forest conservation.","[Kalkuhl, Matthias; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Kalkuhl, Matthias] Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, August Bebel Str 89, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Str 17,Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",University of Potsdam; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Kalkuhl, M (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.;Kalkuhl, M (通讯作者)，Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, August Bebel Str 89, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany.",kalkuhl@mcc-berlin.net,"; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Kalkuhl, Matthias/0000-0003-4797-6628; Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,,59,10,12,3,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

To study the optimal accumulation of a generation capacity for renewable energy (backstop) and the trade-off between capital investments, backstop capacity investments and consumption, we develop a capital-energy economy with exhaustible fossil fuels. It turns out that optimal economic evolution and, therefore, the steady-state levels of capital, backstop capacity, and consumption depend on the capital endowment and the time preference rate. If the latter is low and the former is high, an intertemporal consumption trade-off renders the accumulation of an excess capacity optimal. In contrast, given a low capital endowment and a high time preference rate, the trade-off is not beneficial, so that capacity investments are nil for all points of time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In autarky, the (equivalent) pollution tax is set equal to the marginal damage from own emissions. If the strategic policy instrument is a tax, leakage occurs under trade and tends to lower the tax. The net terms of trade effect, due to the exportable and importable varieties of the differentiated good, tends to increase the tax. We derive conditions under which pollution taxes under trade are higher than the marginal damage from own emissions, i.e., higher than the Pigouvian tax and than that under autarky. Then, pollution falls under trade relative to autarky. When countries use quotas/permits to regulate pollution, there is no leakage, while the net terms of trade effect tends to make pollution policy stricter. The equivalent tax is always higher than the marginal damage from own emissions, i.e., always higher than the Pigouvian tax and than that under autarky; hence, pollution always falls under trade. Our analysis provides some insight into the findings in the empirical literature that trade might be good for the environment.","[Lapan, Harvey E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 283 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Sikdar, Shiva] Keele Univ, Keele Management Sch, Darwin Bldg, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England",Iowa State University; Keele University,"Lapan, HE (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 283 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",hlapan@iastate.edu; shivasikdar@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,6,6,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We show that these results do not necessarily hold when mixed strategies are allowed. In particular, we construct an equilibrium for k >= 4 in which the second-highest valued player wins the auction and makes an expected payment strictly less than her value. This equilibrium-which exists for any generic draw of player valuations-involves only one player using a nondegenerate mixed strategy, for which the amount of mixing can be made arbitrarily small.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A different approach starts one step further back with inquiry into the type of institutions that would produce such evolutionary growth. You then ask how those same institutions would shape consumption. I argue that the future of consumption depends on income and innovation, which themselves depend on the evolution of institutions. I suggest that this is an evolutionary economic approach to the future of consumption.","[Potts, Jason] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Potts, J (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",jason.potts@rmit.edu.au,"potts, jason/L-6530-2015",,,,,,36,1,2,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In contrast to existing studies, we explicitly account for external developments in European Monetary Union (EMU) countries and in other acceding countries. We do so by using factor-augmented vector autoregressive models that employ information from nonstationary factor time series. One set of VAR models includes factors obtained from a large cross section of time series from EMU countries, whereas another set includes factors obtained from other acceding countries. We find that including EMU factors does change impulse response patterns in some but not all acceding countries. In contrast, including factors from other acceding countries leads to substantial changes in impulse responses and to economically more plausible results.

Since the Great Recession, however, U.S. borders have become a far less active place when it comes to the net arrival of foreign workers. The number of undocumented immigrants has declined in absolute terms, while the overall population of low-skilled, foreign-born workers has remained stable. We examine how the scale and composition of low-skilled immigration in the United States have evolved over time, and how relative income growth and demographic shifts in the Western Hemisphere have contributed to the recent immigration slowdown. Because major source countries for U.S. immigration are now seeing and will continue to see weak growth of the labor supply relative to the United States, future immigration rates of young, low-skilled workers appear unlikely to rebound, whether or not U.S. immigration policies tighten further.","[Hanson, Gordon; Liu, Chen; Mcintosh, Craig] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Hanson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",,,,"Center on Global Transformation at the University of California, San Diego","Center on Global Transformation at the University of California, San Diego","We thank Janice Eberly, Adriana Kugler, Edward Lazear, James Stock, and the participants in the Spring 2017 Brookings Panel on Economic Activity for helpful comments on a draft of this paper; Daniel Leff for excellent research assistance; and the Center on Global Transformation at the University of California, San Diego, for financial support.",,107,13,16,0,15,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

This increase occurred in an environment that, even now, still has little experience with or expertise in financialization. Given that financialization occurred simultaneously with the growth and evolution of other political and economic institutions, the question arises: What was the effect on these other nascent institutions like property rights? This article empirically analyzes the relationship between financialization and property rights in transition countries. Using a unique monthly database of twenty transition countries over a period from 1989 to 2012, this article finds that the influence of financialization depends on which definition of financialization is used. In particular, increases in basic financial intermediation improved property rights. However, higher-order financialization, proxied here by the size of capital markets and the wages in the financial sector, appeared to have a negative impact on the development of broad-based property rights in transition.","[Hartwell, Christopher] Kozminski Univ, Ctr Soc & Econ Res CASE, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Hartwell, C (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Ctr Soc & Econ Res CASE, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Hartwell, Christopher A./J-1542-2019","Hartwell, Christopher A./0000-0003-3340-1276",,,,,80,6,7,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Similarly, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson later wrote that in the English Middle Ages there was a lack of property rights for landowners, merchants and proto-industrialists' and the strengthening' of property rights in the late 17th century spurred a process of financial and commercial expansion'. There are several problems with these arguments. Property rights in England were relatively secure from the 13th century. A major developmental problem was not the security of rights but their feudal nature, including widespread entails' and strict settlements'. 1688 had no obvious direct effect on property rights. Given these criticisms, what changes promoted the rise of capitalism? A more plausible answer is found by addressing the post-1688 Financial and Administrative Revolutions, which were pressured by the enhanced needs of war and Britain's expanding global role. Guided by a more powerful Parliament, this new financial system stimulated reforms to landed property rights, the growth of collateralizable property and saleable debt, and thus enabled the Industrial Revolution.","[Hodgson, Geoffrey M.] Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Hodgson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",g.m.hodgson@herts.ac.uk,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021",,,,,,117,34,36,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This relationship is of strong interest to analysts, investors and policymakers in the United States and other countries. We empirically verify the impact of changes in oil prices on rig counts, which has lags up to one quarter. This evidence is stable across time and over different linear and non-linear models. The analysis also suggests that the relationship is non-linear, which is verified by both the quantile regression and quantile-on-quantile models.

Evaluation of a Welfare Reform in the Netherlands,ECONOMIST-NETHERLANDS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Decentralisation; Welfare caseload; Financial incentive; Principal agent,PUBLIC-SECTOR; GENEROSITY; EARNINGS,"Since 2004, most municipalities in the Netherlands receive lump sum payments from the state for the payment of social assistance allowances. As municipalities had no authority to change the eligibility rules for social assistance, the effects of the welfare reform are solely due to the efforts of municipalities to decrease the number of welfare recipients. Using variation in the timing of policy changes, this paper uses a difference-in-difference approach to assess the effectiveness of the incentive for municipalities. Based on individual panel data from administrative records, we show that the high-powered scheme led to a decline of the welfare caseload of 14% up till 2008. The reform has been most effective for those with the highest welfare dependency: single mothers and singles from non-western origin. In line with standard economic predictions, the reform does not give an incentive for cream skimming: the welfare caseload declined as well for easy to place recipients as for difficult to place recipients.","[Kok, Lucy; Tempelman, Caren; Kroon, Lennart] Univ Amsterdam, SEO Amsterdam Econ, Roetersstr 29, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre] Leiden Univ, Steenschuur 25, NL-2311 ES Leiden, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre] Tinbergen Inst, Gustav Mahlerpl 117, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre] IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Berden, Caroline] Dutch Healthcare Author, Newtonlaan 1-41, NL-3584 BX Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Tinbergen Institute; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kok, L (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, SEO Amsterdam Econ, Roetersstr 29, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",l.kok@seo.nl; c.tempelman@seo.nl; p.w.c.koning@vu.nl; l.kroon@seo.nl; cberden@nza.nl,,"Koning, Pierre/0000-0002-8808-9497; Kok, Lucy/0000-0002-6011-1728",,,,,25,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2017,165.0,1,,,,,23,42,,10.1007/s10645-017-9292-9,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EM0JF,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395003900002,0

Such choices require individuals to process large amounts of information, shown to trigger partial information strategies in participants. We develop a new framework in which information processing is treated as a latent (unobservable) process. Testing our approach by combining CE and visual attention (VA) data gathered from eye-tracking, we show that treating information processing as a latent process (LIP) outperforms models assuming full information processing (FIP) or binary information processing (BIP). Our modelling of VA results in a number of key findings. We show that the relationship between VA and individuals' preferences depends on the type of product attribute. More specifically, preferences for easier to process attributes appear to be less influenced by changes in underlying level of VA than harder to process attributes. In turn this impacts on willingness-to-pay estimates, with the LIP model resulting in smaller values than those obtained with the FIP model. Our results have implications for CE designers. More time should be spent getting subjects to understand more complicated attributes of the CE. Our results are likely to extend beyond experimental choices (stated preferences) to actual choices (revealed preferences). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We derive and estimate an extended open-economy NKPC equation, accounting explicitly for time-varying trend inflation. Our preferred, best-fitting estimates based on the closed-form specification with two indexation lags indicate a significant degree of indexation to past inflation. Thus, in contrast to the result for the US economy, our estimates suggest that accounting for time variation in trend inflation in the NKPC cannot explain away the inertia in the Australian inflation data. The estimates suggest that lagged inflation and future expectations of inflation enter the NKPC with almost equal weights. Finally, notwithstanding the previous results, we find a marked decline in the role of the backward-looking inflation terms since the adoption of an inflation-targeting regime by the Reserve Bank in 1993.","[Lie, Denny] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yadav, Anirudh S.] Reserve Bank Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; Reserve Bank of Australia,"Lie, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Rm 370 Merewether H04, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",denny.lie@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

COMMONS; INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS; POLITICAL EMBEDDEDNESS; STRUCTURAL EMBEDDEDNESS; SOCIAL EMBEDDEDNESS; CREDIT; MARKET; MICROFINANCE; COMMITMENT,"Following the recent financial crisis, institutional economists have issued a call for institutionalist research on alternative financial systems. While suggestions have been forthcoming, (for example, in Volume 48, Issue 4 of the Journal of Economic Issues), most have centered on national-level innovations in advanced capitalist countries, prompting further calls for community and individual level anti-capitalist financial relations. With this article, we respond to such calls. We show how networks of finance in Cameroon bridge the formal/informal dualisms in lending/savings activities. We demonstrate that any debates about whether to formalize informal financial institutions or leave them alone weaken in Cameroon because, through networks, people access both formal and informal financial institutions for different purposes and at various stages in the life of these institutions. This dynamism explains why, in spite of the growth of money markets in Cameroon, informal financial institutions have not disappeared, nor declined. In fact, they have expanded, contrary to predictions in existing new institutional economics research. While informal institutions have evolved, they have not necessarily become formal banks, microfinance, or stock markets. Rather, the informal financial institutions have adopted and adapted in terms of both lending and saving practices in a country where growing formal financialization has become the norm. Our findings challenge neoclassical and new institutional economics theories about money, credit, and the actors in the money market.","[Ojong, Nathanael] Tyndale Univ Coll, Dept Business Adm & Int Dev, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Obeng-Odoom, Franklin] Univ Technol Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Ojong, N (通讯作者)，Tyndale Univ Coll, Dept Business Adm & Int Dev, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,"Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/G-2644-2017","Ojong, Nathanael/0000-0001-6333-6335; Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/0000-0003-3997-7751",,,,,106,12,13,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In order to illustrate the practical significance of our methodology, the paper also contains an application in which we generate a large subsample distribution from the 2010 CSWL.

It is well known that while a roommate problem may not have a stable proper matching, each roommate problem does have an stable improper matching. In a random utility model with types from Dagsvik (2000) and Menzel (2015), we show that all improper stable matchings are asymptotically close to being a proper stable matching. Moreover, the distribution of types in stable matchings (proper or not) converges to the unique maximizer of an expression that is a sum of two terms: the average welfare of the matching and the Shannon entropy of the distribution. In the noiseless limit, when the random component of the utility is reduced to zero, the distribution of types of matched pairs converges to the outcome of the transferable utility model.

The empirical results show that the exchange rate pass-through displays a nonlinear and smooth transition process, depending on each period of debt ratio of the export country in different regimes. That is, the pass-through is nonlinear and varies with time and across countries. The larger the debt ratio is, the lower the pass-through would be.

We study differences between Asian-father and Asian-mother only families, controlling for observable child, parental and residential characteristics, as well as unobservable selection into intermarriage. Despite the higher average education and income levels of intermarried families, the children of Asian-father-native-mother households have higher dropout rates compared to both Asian intra-married and Asian-mother-native-father households.

In this work we consider the features of two fundamental, large-scale, innovation surveys: the European CIS and the American SIRD/BRDIS. Innovation surveys are the main tool through which innovation data are gathered, and these data become more and more important to test theories and to provide ground for innovation policy. Once the characteristics of both surveys have been identified, we carry on with our analysis in two ways. First,we match the surveys with the theories; second we provide a comparison between the two surveys.

Such domestic or transborder acquisitions are the reverse of privatizations, where SOEs are the target of private investors. The question we ask is whether, because of the specific objectives and risks faced by governments, SOEs deviate from the benchmark of deals involving private firms on both sides of the merger and acquisition (M&A) transaction. To answer this new research question, we focus on a set of firm-level characteristics of the targets and acquirers involved in the deals. We built an original dataset of 31,479 deals in 138 countries drawing from Zephyr and Orbis (Bureau Van Dijk) data. Empirical results of multinomial logit and OLS models show that deals involving SOEs are clearly different from the benchmark of private-private deals. This is mainly due to the greater assets, higher solvency ratios, broader experience of deals, and closer proximity to targets of the acquirers (both public and private) under public-private, public-public, and private-public deals compared to private-private deals.

Policy makers need to understand both the environmental and economic impacts of fiscal and regulatory policies regarding the energy sector. Transitioning to lower-carbon energy will entail a contraction of the fossil fuel sector, along with a loss of jobs. An important question is whether clean energy will create more jobs than will be lost in fossil fuels. This article presents a method of using Input-Output (I-O) tables to create synthetic industries - namely clean energy industries that do not currently exist in I-O tables. This approach allows researchers to evaluate public and private spending in clean energy and compare it to the effects of spending on fossil fuels. Here we focus on employment impacts in the short-to-medium term, and leave aside the long-term comparison of operations and maintenance employment. We find that on average, 2.65 full-time-equivalent (FIT) jobs are created from $1 million spending in fossil fuels, while that same amount of spending would create 7.49 or 7.72 FTE jobs in renewables or energy efficiency. Thus each $1 million shifted from brown to green energy will create a net increase of 5 jobs.","[Garrett-Peltier, Heidi] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Polit Econ Res Inst, 418 N Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Garrett-Peltier, H (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Polit Econ Res Inst, 418 N Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",hpeltier@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,26,169,177,12,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Specifically, we investigate the dynamics of return and volatility spillover indices to reveal the intensity and direction of transmission during the recent global financial and European sovereign debt crises. Our empirical results are as follows. First, we estimate a positive equicorrelation between commodity futures market returns and find that it increased sharply during the crises. This effect can persist during periods of economic and financial turmoil, diminishing the benefits of international portfolio diversification for investors. Second, we identify bidirectional return and volatility spillovers across commodity futures markets, and find more pronounced trends in their levels in the post-crisis period. This indicates the strong impact of spillovers during crisis periods. Third, both gold and silver are information transmitters to other commodity futures markets, while the remaining four commodity futures investigated were receivers of spillovers during recent periods of financial stress. Finally, we analyse the optimal portfolio weights and time-varying hedge ratios between metal and other commodities futures markets. Overall, our findings provide new insights into channels of information transmission, which may improve investment decisions and inform portfolio investors' trading strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a particular type of efficient risk-sharing model with no commitment we demonstrate that second-best coordination improvements can be achieved with low to moderate risks of participants leaving the agreement. In the absence of an impartial market operator who can observe production fluctuations in connected power systems, establishing quasi-markets for trading excess electricity helps to achieve some cooperation in mutually beneficial electricity sharing.","[Nikandrova, Arina] Birkbeck Univ London, London, England; [Steinbuks, Jevgenijs] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of London; Birkbeck University London; The World Bank,"Steinbuks, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",a.nikandrova@bbk.ac.uk; jsteinbuks@worldbank.org,,"Stenbuks, Jevgenijs/0000-0003-3548-2196",Australian Agency for International Development; Partnership for South Asia Regional Integration Programmatic Trust Fund,Australian Agency for International Development(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Partnership for South Asia Regional Integration Programmatic Trust Fund,"The authors thank Javier Bustos-Salvagno, Deb Chattopadhyay, Avinash Dixit, Ethan Ligon, Romans Pancs, Paul Preckel, Vladimir Parail, Michael Pollitt, Michael Toman, two anonymous reviewers and the participants of the International Industrial Organization Annual Conference, the Royal Economic Society Annual Conference, and research seminars at the University of Alicante and the World Bank for their helpful suggestions and comments.

Monthly price data spanning from January 1990 to February 2016 were used for the analysis. The Johansen cointegration test conducted within the time domain confirmed the statistically significant cointegrated relationship between crude oil prices and the price indices of food and its sub-categories, such as dairy, cereals, vegetable oil, and sugar; however, frequency information was not accounted for. To incorporate both the time and frequency features of the data, we used a wavelet method that has shown that the world food prices, along with the prices of cereals, vegetable oils, and sugar, co-move with and are led by crude oil prices, results that remain relevant from the short-run policy perspective. The outcome of Toda-Yamamoto causality confirmed the spillover of crude oil price changes to the world food price index also in the long run.

We propose a copula model for the joint behavior of prices and wind power production, which is estimated to data from the Danish power market. We find that the marginal behavior of the individual variables is best described by ARMA-GARCH models with non-Gaussian error distributions, and the preferred copula model is a time-varying Gaussian copula. As an application of our joint model, we consider the case of an energy trading company entering into longer-term agreements with wind power producers, where the fluctuating future wind power production is bought at a predetermined fixed price. We find that assuming independence between prices and wind power production leads to an underestimation of risk, as the profit distribution becomes left-skewed when the negative dependence that we find in the data is accounted for. By performing a simple static hedge in the forward market, we show that the risk can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, an out-of-sample study shows that the choice of copula influences the price of correlation risk, and that time-varying copulas are superior to the constant ones when comparing actual profits generated with different models.

Most importantly, I show that the returns to workers' inter-firm mobility are higher in a trade equilibrium than in autarky. Intuitively, by favoring large and productive firms, international trade amplifies the disparities in profitability between small and large firms. Hence, the returns to labor reallocation across firms rise. In view of the empirically observed higher inter-firm mobility among high-skill workers, this suggests a skill-biased impact of trade liberalization.","[Stijepic, Damir] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Econ, D-55122 Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Stijepic, D (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Econ, D-55122 Mainz, Germany.",mail@damir.stijepic.com,,,Goethe Graduate Academy (GRADE); Cluster of Excellence Formation of Normative Orders at the Goethe University; Forschungstopf of the Department of Economics and Business Administration at the Goethe University,Goethe Graduate Academy (GRADE); Cluster of Excellence Formation of Normative Orders at the Goethe University; Forschungstopf of the Department of Economics and Business Administration at the Goethe University,"The author also gratefully acknowledges support from the Goethe Graduate Academy (GRADE), the Cluster of Excellence Formation of Normative Orders at the Goethe University, and the Forschungstopf of the Department of Economics and Business Administration at the Goethe University.

By exploiting a large dataset that covers different sectors, we find that in the middle-income stage, manufacturing pulls along all the other sectors, including the services sector. A decline in manufacturing growth negatively affects the growth of all the other sectors, in both the short-run and long-run. Additionally, we attempt to identify the underlying mechanisms of the essential role played by manufacturing during this development stage. We find that a larger share of manufacturing in the economy not only promotes gross private saving ratio but also accelerates the pace of technological accumulation.

In this article, I examine the determinants of multinational firms' location and production decisions and the welfare implications of multinational production. The few existing quantitative general equilibrium models that incorporate multinational firms achieve tractability by assuming away export platforms-that is, they do not allow foreign affiliates of multinationals to export-or by ignoring fixed costs associated with foreign investment. I develop a quantifiable multicountry general equilibrium model, which tractably handles multinational firms that engage in export platform sales and that face fixed costs of foreign investment. I first estimate the model using German firm-level data to uncover the size and nature of costs of multinational enterprise and show that the fixed costs of foreign investment are large. Second, I calibrate the model to data on trade and multinational production for twelve European and North American countries. Counterfactual analysis reveals that multinationals play an important role in transmitting technological improvements to foreign countries and that the pending Canada-EU trade and investment agreement could divert a sizable fraction of the production of EU multinationals from the U.S. to Canada.","[Tintelnot, Felix] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Tintelnot, Felix] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Tintelnot, F (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Tintelnot, F (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1459950]; Andrew and Betsy Rosenfield Program in Economics, Public Policy, and Law at the Becker Friedman Institute","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Andrew and Betsy Rosenfield Program in Economics, Public Policy, and Law at the Becker Friedman Institute","I am grateful to my advisors Jonathan Eaton and Stephen Yeaple for their guidance, encouragement, and support.

It is often argued that left-wing governments in Latin America have implemented pro-labor policies. In this paper we put these claims to an empirical test using 37 aspects of de facto (practices) and de jure (laws) violations of labor rights. Using panel data on 26 Latin American and Caribbean countries during the period 1985-2002, we do not find any effect of left-leaning chief executives on labor rights. While left-leaning chief executives do legislate laws protecting labor rights, the enforcement of these laws is abysmally weak. Further evidence suggests that cohesive left-wing governments are more likely to legislate laws protecting labor rights than diverse governments. These results are robust to alternative measures of ideology, estimation methods, and controlling for endogeneity. The policy implications suggest that irrespective of the political ideology, upholding labor rights in Latin America requires strengthening the enforcement capacity.","[Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway; [Tamazian, Artur] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Sch Social Work, Santiago, Spain",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Vadlamannati, KC (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway.",krishna.c.vadlamannati@svt.ntnu.no; artur.tamazian@usc.es,,"Tamazian, Artur/0000-0002-1087-9296; Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya/0000-0001-5999-1126",,,,,74,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2017,70.0,1,,,,,129,160,,10.1111/kykl.12133,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EM6FP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395408500006,0

To improve the forecasting accuracy, this paper introduces a dynamic model averaging (DMA) method to forecast the growth rate of house prices in 30 major Chinese cities. The advantage of DMA is that this method allows both the sets of predictors (forecasting models) as well as their coefficients to change over time. Both recursive and rolling forecasting modes are applied to compare the performance of DMA with other traditional forecasting models. Furthermore, a model, confidence set (MCS) test is used to statistically evaluate the forecasting efficiency of different models. The empirical results reveal that DMA generally outperforms other models, such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA), information-theoretic model averaging (ITMA) and equal weighted averaging (EW), in both recursive and rolling forecasting modes. In addition, in recent years it is found that the Google search index, instead of fundamental macroeconomic or monetary indicators, has developed greater predictive power for house price in China.","[Wei, Yu; Cao, Yang] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Southwest Jiaotong University,"Wei, Y (通讯作者)，First Sect Northern Second Ring Rd 111, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",weiyusy@126.com,,"Cao, Yang/0000-0001-5020-6275","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371157, 71671145]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education [14YJC790073, 15YJA790031, 16YJA790062]; Young Scholar Fund of Science & Technology Department of Sichuan Province [2015JQO010]; fund of high-level social science research team of Sichuan Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [26816WCX02]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education; Young Scholar Fund of Science & Technology Department of Sichuan Province; fund of high-level social science research team of Sichuan Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We would like to show our sincere gratitude to an anonymous reviewer, as well as Professor Sushanta Mallick, Co-Editor-in-Chief of Economic Modelling, whose comments and suggestions greatly improved the quality of this paper.

We explore a unique dataset of environmental statistics, which contains 31380 polluting manufacturing firms newly established in the period 2006-2010. Our conditional logit model provides strong evidence for the changes of new polluting firms' location choice from the coastal provinces, which have strict environmental mandates, to the western provinces, which have lax environmental mandates, and demonstrates the distinct location patterns of heterogeneous polluting firms. While foreign polluting firms were generally driven by the mandates, domestic polluting firms were more resistant and were driven to the western provinces only after 2007. As a result, the potential pollution transfer would threaten the more fragile water environments and public health in western provinces. We thus posit a perverse incentive of current environmental policy and recommend integrated water management as well as close coordination of local governments to improve the efficacy of environmental regulation in China.

US markets, however, predominantly react to deviations from the long-run equilibrium which indicates a rising impact of European agricultural markets on a global scale.","[Adaemmer, Philipp; Bohl, Martin T.] Univ Munster, Munster, Germany; [von Ledebur, Ernst-Oliver] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Braunschweig, Germany",University of Munster; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Bohl, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Dept Econ, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",martin.bohl@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,,,German Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) through the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE),German Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) through the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE),"The study was financially supported by the German Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) through the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE).

We then follow-up with some empirical evidence to address the linkages between macroeconomic developments and central bank credibility. The empirical results reveal high and low credibility cycles with an average duration of 2years over the study period. Particularly, higher levels of credibility were associated with stable domestic currency and lower nominal interest rates. This reinforces the notion that efficient monetary policy delivers higher central bank credibility with better outcomes for macroeconomic variables. In contrast, the level of credibility tends to worsen in the wake of weakening macro fundamentals which are not adequately countered by monetary policy decisions. There is therefore the need for efficient monetary policy formulation to achieve a stable macroeconomic environment in Ghana. This will in the long-run build policy credibility towards attaining the central bank's medium-term inflation target.","[Akosah, Nana Kwame] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Akosah, Nana Kwame; Acquaye, Ivy; Loloh, Francis White] Bank Ghana, Res Dept, Accra, Ghana",University of Witwatersrand,"Akosah, NK (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa.;Akosah, NK (通讯作者)，Bank Ghana, Res Dept, Accra, Ghana.",akosahk@gmail.com,"akosah, nana/AAH-8877-2021","akosah, nana/0000-0003-0630-4235",,,,,9,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Recently developed indices, based on partially ordered set theory, are used to quantify the stringency of fiscal rules. Identification of their effects is achieved by exploiting the exogeneity of institutional variables (checks and balances, government fragmentation, inflation targeting), which are found to be relevant determinants of fiscal rules. Our two-stage least squares estimates for (up to) 74 countries over the period 1985-2012 provide strong evidence that countries with more stringent fiscal rules have higher fiscal balances (lower deficits), lower interest rate spreads on government bonds, and lower output volatility.","[Badinger, Harald; Reuter, Wolf Heinrich] WU Vienna, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Badinger, Harald] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Badinger, Harald] CESifo, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut,"Reuter, WH (通讯作者)，WU Vienna, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",harald.badinger@wu.ac.at; wolf.reuter@wu.ac.at,,"Badinger, Harald/0000-0002-7238-5136",Austrian Central Bank (OeNB Anniversary Fund) [15469],Austrian Central Bank (OeNB Anniversary Fund),"Financial support by the Austrian Central Bank (OeNB, Anniversary Fund, project number: 15469) is gratefully acknowledged.",,46,44,50,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Sen's name is so widely associated with the concept of capability that commentators often assume that his contribution to the study of justice amounts to a capability theory, albeit underdeveloped. We argue that such a reading is misleading. Taking Sen's reticence about operationalization seriously, we show that his contribution is inconsistent with a capability theory. Instead, we defend the idea that the capability approach plays a heuristic role: capability is a step in his argument against alternative materials, but is not meant as a definitive end. Sen defends a critical perspective primarily to encourage public reasoning and respect for agency as regards the definition of what should count in the evaluation of social states.","[Baujard, Antoinette] Univ Jean Monnet, Univ Lyon, CNRS, GATE L SE,UMR 5824, F-42023 St Etienne, France; [Gilardone, Muriel] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, CNRS, CREM,UMR 6211, F-14000 Caen, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Caen Normandie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Baujard, A (通讯作者)，Univ Jean Monnet, Univ Lyon, CNRS, GATE L SE,UMR 5824, F-42023 St Etienne, France.",antoinette.baujard@univ-st-etienne.fr,,"Gilardone, Muriel/0000-0001-5205-7461; Baujard, Antoinette/0000-0002-4156-7527",CREM; Welfare Economics Chair CNRS & University Jean Monnet [Chaire d'excellence 'Welfare Economics'],CREM; Welfare Economics Chair CNRS & University Jean Monnet [Chaire d'excellence 'Welfare Economics'],This work was supported by the CREM and by a grant linked to the Welfare Economics Chair CNRS & University Jean Monnet [Chaire d'excellence 'Welfare Economics'] and CREM.,,52,14,14,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

When producing a high quality product rather than a low quality one is relatively costly with respect to the increase in quality, optimal signalling is by price alone. But when the cost differential is lower, it will be optimal to set a low first-period price, not to serve all would-be consumers at this price (selective distribution) and raise the price afterwards. Paradoxically, this strategy allows a larger customer base to be reached than in the case of pure price signalling.","[Ben Elhadj, Nada] Univ Tunis, Inst Super Gest Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia; [Laussel, Didier] Aix Marseille Univ AMSE, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Grp Rech Econ Quantitat Aix Marseille, Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Marseille, France",Universite de Tunis; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Ben Elhadj, N (通讯作者)，41 Ave Liberte, Cite Bouchoucha 2000, Le Bardo, Tunisia.",nadabelhadj@yahoo.com,,"Belhadj, Nada/0000-0003-2301-3683",Groupement de Recherche en Economie Quantitative d'Aix-Marseille (GREQAM),Groupement de Recherche en Economie Quantitative d'Aix-Marseille (GREQAM),Financial support from Groupement de Recherche en Economie Quantitative d'Aix-Marseille (GREQAM) is gratefully acknowledged.,,13,0,0,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These main factors determine organizational possibilities to explore the benefits of digital process excellence and to communicate the value of process improvement to company's stakeholders. Current body of knowledge focuses mainly on industrial digitalization or Industry 4.0. The exploration of a service company brings new perspectives to the non-material process flow at the industry. The research has a quantitative approach with qualitative supporting data. It reviews project documentation to determine process performance improvements. Semi-structured interviews with key project office team members complement the findings from the available documents. The data assessment of processes determines the digital preparedness. It is expected that a higher level of digitalization implies higher level of process performance. The process preparedness analysis determines the processes value contributors. The paper results contribute with the discussion on agile trends of project life cycle and its role within the fourth industrial revolution at service companies.

While the conventional narrative is based on the notion of financial development as a positive change, this paper argues that pension funds may induce demand-led pressures on the financial system, generating potential for systemic risk and instability. The rise of pension funds is therefore important for the process of financialisation, as these institutions' demand for assets continuously sparks growth and innovation in financial markets. In the current context pension funds are attempting to reduce risk by rebalancing their allocations away from equities towards alternatives', such as hedge funds and private equity. Coupled with the current regulatory trends towards risk-based funding regulation, we argue that pension funds are unlikely to be a stabilising force in financial markets today.","[Bonizzi, Bruno] Univ Winchester, Winchester, Hants, England; [Churchill, Jennifer] Univ London, London, England",University of Winchester; University of London,"Bonizzi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Winchester, Winchester, Hants, England.",bruno.bonizzi@winchester.ac.uk; jc75@soas.ac.uk,,"Bonizzi, Bruno/0000-0003-0122-8739",,,,,39,9,10,0,13,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Given that the individual firm behaviour has a cumulative effect on regional economic performance, we expect greater stability across those regions with a larger share of women-owned and managed businesses. We test this hypothesis using US county data during the period from 2007 to 2013 at the US county level.

On the other hand small number of deaths and living persons could be very problematic for the analysis of mortality at very high ages (say over 90). And also it should be taken into consideration that data about deaths and living persons could be influenced by errors. This is one of possible reasons for the modelling of the force of mortality at ages 60+. Here could be used several approaches. One of these are analytical functions. Among the most famous ones could be included the Gompertz-Makeham function, Kannisto or Thatcher model. The aim of this paper is the analysis of mortality in the Czech Republic and in Bulgaria. The Gompertz-Makeham function and Weibull model will be used for the modelling of the force of mortality. The benefit of this paper is quantitative comparison of results for both mentioned models with the empirical values of mortality.

We find that although during IPOs firms sell, on average, quite the same fraction of firm ownership regardless of the year of the IPO, they raise much more capital in hot rather than in cold market conditions. We also find that firms going public in hot and cold markets as well as before and after the legal changes in 2005 do not differ significantly with regard to their profitability, leverage or liquidity ratios. The amount of money raised in hot and cold-market conditions is, however, determined by different factors. In cold-market conditions only the terms of share issue determine the amount of money raised at IPO. In hot-issue markets the size of the company is the most important factor and the financial situation of the companies and investor optimism also have a significant impact on the amount of money raised at IPO. On the other hand, contrary to the cold-market conditions, the terms of share issue are almost insignificant. The changes in the law did not affect the market timing phenomenon, but after 2005 an increasing role of profitability and investor optimism in the investors' evaluation of new share issues was observed.","[Dudycz, Tadeusz; Brycz, Bogumila] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Management, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Dudycz, T (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Comp Sci & Management, Wroclaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,26,5,5,3,11,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

It is argued that the two phenomena are the result of trade creation and trade diversion effects generated by the euro introduction and by globalisation-induced changes in trade patterns. Trade creation and trade diversion effects are estimated as structural changes in the relation between trade flows and financial opening, growth, prices, and measures of globalization. While most of these effects point to the increase in imbalances, financial opening is found to positively affect intra-EMU trade. On the other hand, GDP growth and global changes in production technology reduced intra-EMU trade. The results suggest that policies aimed at rebalancing the EMU should be strengthened and supported by measures aimed at improving the competitiveness of the single market as a whole.","[Esposito, Piero] LUISS Sch European Polit Econ, Via Villa Emiliani 14, I-00197 Rome, Italy",,"Esposito, P (通讯作者)，LUISS Sch European Polit Econ, Via Villa Emiliani 14, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",pesposito@luiss.it,"Esposito, Piero/AAK-7776-2020","Esposito, Piero/0000-0002-5616-8545",,,,,57,12,12,0,41,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The implications for policy of these two perspectives are discussed in relation to Schumpeter's ambiguous stance on economic policy issues.

Intuitively weak ties might be less useful because people communicate less often with them, or more useful because they provide novel information. Granovetter's early work showed that more job-seekers get help via acquaintances than friends (Granovetter, 1973). However, recent work on job-finding (Gee et al., 2017) shows an apparent paradox of weak ties in the United States: most people are helped through one of their numerous weak ties, but a single stronger tie is significantly more valuable at the margin. Although some studies have addressed the importance of weak ties in job finding within specific countries, this is the first paper to use a single dataset and methodology to compare the importance of weak ties across countries. Here, we use de-identified data from almost 17 million social ties in 55 countries to document the widespread existence of this paradox of weak ties across many societies. More people get jobs where their weak ties work. However, this is not because weak ties are more helpful than strong ties - it is because they are more numerous. In every country, the likelihood of going to work where an individual friend works is increasing not decreasing - with tie strength. Yet, there is substantial variation in the added value of a strong tie at the margin across these countries. We show that the level of income inequality in a country is positively correlated with the added value of a strong tie, so that individual strong ties matter more when there is greater income inequality.

However, we find no evidence that this change in turnout affected government spending patterns (in levels or composition) or electoral outcomes. Individual-level data on turnout and political preferences suggest that these results occur because the impacts of compulsory voting on turnolit are larger among those who are non-partisan, who have low interest in politics, and who are uninformed.

The Lorenz curve and nine numerical concentration measures applied mostly show a slight decrease of a moderate concentration for both types of insurance over time, with only the Rosenbluth index being an exception, showing a mild increase of concentration. The concentration of gross premium is slightly stronger for non-life then for life insurance. The standard errors of the trend models for the entropy indexes are smaller, and coefficients of determination are higher for the quadratic compared to the linear trend models for both types of insurances, life and non-life. Since the forecasts' quality measures for both types of insurance show that the quadratic trend is superior compared to the simple linear trend model, it was used for short-term forecasting of the entropy indexes. The quadratic trend model gave forecasts showing digressive-progressive dynamics for non-life, and progressive-digressive for life insurance entropy indexes.","[Jakovcevic, Drago; Andelinovic, Mihovil] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Zagreb, Croatia; [Dumicic, Ksenija] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Jakovcevic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Zagreb, Croatia.",djakovcevic@efzg.hr,"Dumičić, Ksenija/X-8866-2019","Dumičić, Ksenija/0000-0001-7131-9455; Andelinovic, Mihovil/0000-0003-2061-0693",,,,,17,4,5,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We consider three different schedules: FixMin, requiring the same absolute contributions, RelMin, requiring the same relative contributions, and ProgMin, requiring minimum contributions that progressively increase with the endowment. We find that minimum contributions exert norm-giving character and may lead to an increase in average group contributions. This is especially true for the progressive schedule. On the individual level, this schedule leads to higher relative contributions by the wealthier players and thus violates the fair-share norm. On the group level, it leads to the highest contribution level and the lowest inequality in total profits as measured by the Gini index. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The paper shows that exporting firms are larger, pay better wages and are more productive than non-exporters. Foreign firms are also more likely to export than domestic firms in both countries. However, foreign firms in Kenya are more labour intensive than those in Malaysia. Firms in Malaysia are more profitable, with higher wages and higher productivity, than firms in Kenya. There are contrasting results with regard to export spillovers. In Malaysia, there is evidence of positive spillovers largely from backward linkages and negative spillovers from competition effects and information channels.

This paper aims to shed light on the controversial relationship between labor market flexibility and innovation in Indonesia. A set of hypotheses concerning the context-dependent relationship between labor market flexibility and innovation have been formulated by combining the main results of the theoretical literature concerning this topic. Non-parametric models and dynamic structural specification of panel data have been estimated to test the hypotheses. The results will show that in sectoral and regional context labor flexibility has (or does not have) a positive influence on innovation plays a key role in the decisions of policy makers.","[Krismadewi, Laurencia S.] Univ Econ, Namesti Winstona Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Krismadewi, LS (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Namesti Winstona Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",kril02@vse.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,781,791,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300078,0

This perspective overlooks how innovation can lower physical risks borne by healthy patients facing the prospect of future disease. We present an alternative framework that accounts for all these sources of value and links them to the value of healthcare insurance. We show that any innovation worth buying reduces overall risk and generates positive insurance value on its own. We conduct a stylized numerical exercise to assess the potential empirical significance of our insights. Our calculations suggest that conventional methods meaningfully understate the value of historical health gains and disproportionately undervalue treatments for the most severe illnesses, where physical risk to consumers is the costliest. These calculations also suggest that the value of physical insurance from new technologies may exceed the financial spending risk that they pose. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Such an evolution of the central bank policy stems from the endogenous process of growing securities markets, financial innovations, and market-based credit intermediation. This article examines how changes in the structure of the banking and financial system transforms the central bank policy in financial stability. It considers the separation or integration of the LLR and MMLR functions, revisits the debate opposing lend-to-market and lend-to-institution theses, and discusses the LLR standard rule and its transposition to the MMLR rule. Inasmuch as private securities markets and financial innovations determine the structure of the credit system, central banks endogenously adopt the integrated approach, so that the extensive LLR policy prevails.","[Le Maux, Laurent] Univ Western Brittany, Econ, Brest, France; [Le Maux, Laurent] Univ Paris St Denis, St Denis, Reunion, France",Universite de Bretagne Occidentale,"Le Maux, L (通讯作者)，Univ Western Brittany, Econ, Brest, France.;Le Maux, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris St Denis, St Denis, Reunion, France.",,,,,,,,70,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Inspired by labour market research, we formulate three hypotheses on how uncertainty about the usefulness of individuals' (more productive) specific skills affects their investment in (more flexible) general skills. The empirical analysis is based on unique panel data on school grades, soccer evaluations, and sociodemographic characteristics of 90 elite players from the youth academy of a German Bundesliga club. We find that senior and long-serving players, who are comparably certain that their (soccer) specific capital will be sufficient to pursue a lucrative professional career, invest less in general HC at school. Expected soccer performance, in contrast, has a counterintuitive positive effect. Our results expand knowledge on the factors influencing HC specificity from the macro to the subject level and highlight practical implications for institutions that train gifted individuals.","[Merkel, Steffen] DFL Deutsch Fussball Liga GmbH, Guiollettstr 44-46, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmidt, Sascha L.] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Schmidt, Sascha L.; Torgler, Benno] Ctr Res Econ Management & Arts, Zurich, Switzerland; [Torgler, Benno] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Merkel, S (通讯作者)，DFL Deutsch Fussball Liga GmbH, Guiollettstr 44-46, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",steffen.merkel@gmail.com,"Torgler, Benno/W-4556-2019","Torgler, Benno/0000-0002-9809-963X",,,,,60,3,3,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using a new nationally-representative panel dataset of schools across 1297 villages in India, we show that the large public investments in education over the past decade have led to substantial improvements in input-based measures of school quality, but only a modest reduction in inefficiency as measured by teacher absence. In our data, 23.6% of teachers were absent during unannounced school visits, and we estimate that the salary cost of unauthorized teacher absence is $1.5 billion/year. We find two robust correlations in the nationally-representative panel data that corroborate findings from smaller-scale experiments. First, reductions in student-teacher ratios are correlated with increased teacher absence. Second, increases in the frequency of school monitoring are strongly correlated with lower teacher absence. Using these results, we show that reducing inefficiencies by increasing the frequency of monitoring could be over ten times more cost effective at increasing the effective student-teacher ratio than hiring more teachers. Thus, policies that decrease the inefficiency of public education spending are likely to yield substantially higher marginal returns than those that augment inputs. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We find the following: (1) considering atmospheric transport changes the distribution of demand-induced impact as compared to conventional emissions footprinting, (2) the supply chain paths with the greatest impact on PM2.5-induced human health problems in the region are centered around agricultural technologies in China, and (3) the transportation sector of China plays a major role in the supply chain paths that generate relatively large impacts on human health.

We used the Agricultural Trade and Policy Simulation Model to estimate the potential effects of agricultural trade liberalization, mainly in the US and EU, on the world-market prices of agricultural commodities. We then used the estimated price changes to assess the impact of these reforms on net-food importers as well as other Sub-Saharan African countries that enjoy preferential trade agreements with the EU and US. The results indicate that the world market prices of all commodities imported by Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to rise while the prices of the key export commodities of the region would either decline or remain unchanged. Given that the prices of major food commodities are expected to rise, net-food-importing countries will experience increasing import bill, thus leading to welfare loss. Major Sub-Saharan Africa sugar exporters who are beneficiaries of preferential agreements such as the EU sugar protocol and US AGOA initiative will become losers as preferences erode due to global liberalization. Thus, the region is expected to generally become a net loser from the current WTO reform modalities.","[Nuetah, J.

While existing studies have primarily focused on average effects, we employ quantile regression to estimate the effects of natural resource abundance for different corruption levels. We consider the effects of natural resource rents, mainly oil rents and then compare them with those of total and non-oil natural resources rents. The estimation results show that, generally, more oil rents increase corruption. Specifically, impacts are larger in countries with an intermediate level of corruption and smaller in highly corrupt countries. While total resource rents increase corruption significantly, non-oil resource rents do not. This may be due to non-oil resource rent management ( mainly inland) being more subject to public scrutiny. Non-oil natural resources are concentrated in the less-developed sub-Saharan African countries, where corruption is prevalent; therefore, the impacts of natural resource rents are unremarkable.","[Okada, Keisuke] Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, Osaka, Japan; [Samreth, Sovannroeun] Saitama Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Saitama, Japan",Kansai University; Saitama University,"Okada, K (通讯作者)，Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, Osaka, Japan.",k_okada@kansai-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [JP26780163, JP15H03354, JP16H02026, JP15K17043]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H02026, 15H03354, 17K13740, 26780163, 15K17043] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work has received financial support from JSPS KAKENHI [Grant Numbers JP26780163, JP15H03354, JP16H02026 and JP15K17043]",,10,22,23,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Even though preferences need not be additive and/or homothetic, the market outcome is still driven by the sole variable elasticity of substitution. We impose elementary conditions on this function to guarantee empirically relevant properties of a free-entry equilibrium. Comparative statics with respect to market size and productivity shocks are characterized through necessary and sufficient conditions. Furthermore, we show that the attention to the CES based on its normative implications was misguided: we propose a new class of preferences, which express consumers' uncertainty about their love for variety, that yield variable markups and may sustain the optimum. Last, we show how our approach can cope with heterogeneous firms once it is recognized that the elasticity of substitution is firm-specific. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In order to understand the potential role of dark pools in times of stress and implications for financial stability, it is essential to investigate the relationship between investor trading preferences and market volatility. For our analysis, we use data on daily trading volumes of FTSE100 stocks on dark and lit order books. We find evidence that dark pool trading has explanatory power in predicting volatility, implying that dark pools may affect the dynamics of price formation through liquidity. Our findings suggest that increased use of dark pools does not increase volatility, but may in fact lower it. Thus, dark pools may not be significantly detrimental to market stability in times of stress. This highlights the need for further analysis of the effects that shifting financial market structure might have on financial stability.","[Petrescu, Monica; Wedow, Michael; Lari, Natalia] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Wedow, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",Michael.wedow@ecb.int,,"Wedow, Michael/0000-0002-6482-8187",,,,,4,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The most appropriated way relies on the sustainability concept as the axis of sustainability is resource preservation, reproduction and regeneration. The sustainable HRM is designed for enhancing organization's profit, minimizing ecological footprint and reducing the harm on employees. However, the employment of sustainable HRM in daily organization's life is still challenging and calls businesses to search for new pathways. The paper argues that smart power (the concept mostly used in political science) could be used for contributing to sustainable HRM field. The paper describes smart power (soft and hard power) and elaborates how smart power could be applied in business context and in the area of sustainable HRM. The paper provides initial insights on power utilization in human resource development, human resource regeneration and human resource preservation practices. The theoretical findings provide some examples how soft and hard power could be used for career management, training programmes for sustainability capacities, and keeping the workforce fit. The use of smart power for work-life balance, management of employees' relations, and stress management is described. In the future, the research area could be expanded by empirically testing theoretical insights and contributing to extremely relevant topic-the use of smart power for employing the sustainable HRM practices.","[Savaneviciene, Asta; Stankeviciute, Zivile] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Savaneviciene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",asta.savaneviciene@ktu.lt; zivile.stankeviciute@ktu.lt,"Savanevičienė, Asta/I-8581-2019; Stankevičiūtė, Živilė/I-6551-2018","Savanevičienė, Asta/0000-0003-3132-860X; Stankevičiūtė, Živilė/0000-0002-5578-4645",,,,,58,7,10,2,42,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The main research methods were analysis, synthesis and comparative analysis. All types of tax incentives were broken down into groups and the purpose of each group was identified in relation to the type of the SEZ. The authors prove that there is a prevalence of technology development zones that take the form of science and industry clusters aimed at the creation of hi-tech production facilities. The authors argue that fiscal instruments have become an indispensable part of a package of measures for luring investors in SEZs. A conclusion is drawn that today tax incentives in special economic zones play a much bigger role in investment decision making than in previous years. The underlying causes of this development are analyzed. The authors show that the size of tax incentives and the duration of tax holidays for investment projects have been growing; they also observe that nontax barriers are being removed, thus facilitating trade liberalization and capital mobility. A conclusion is made that each class of special economic zones employ specific tax incentives that are best suited for their goals. It is shown that as a result of competition between the countries of the Asia-Pacific Region, they offer a nearly standardized package of tax incentives that tends to be further unified.","[Sinenko, Olga; Mayburov, Igor] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Suhanova St 8, Vladivostok 690950, Russia; [Mayburov, Igor] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Far Eastern Federal University; Ural Federal University,"Sinenko, O (通讯作者)，Far Eastern Fed Univ, Suhanova St 8, Vladivostok 690950, Russia.",sinenko.olga@gmail.com; mayburov.home@gmail.com,"Sinenko, Olga Andreevna/AAS-8125-2020; MAYBUROV, IGOR/Q-2807-2016; Mayburov, Igor/AAQ-4302-2020","Sinenko, Olga Andreevna/0000-0001-7497-9475; Mayburov, Igor/0000-0001-8791-665X",Humanitarian Scientific Foundation of the Russian Federation [17-22-21001],Humanitarian Scientific Foundation of the Russian Federation,"The work was supported by the Humanitarian Scientific Foundation of the Russian Federation, contract No 17-22-21001.",,13,6,6,1,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1421,1430,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300142,0

With structural changes existing, we find that long-run relationship using full-sample data is unstable, suggesting that traditional Granger causality test is not reliable. However, we further find an unstable short-run relationship between ICF and HP when assessing the stability of the parameters and there are bidirectional causal relationships between ICF and HP for several sub-periods. Additionally, our findings indicate both positive and negative bidirectional causal relations between the series. Based on the arbitrage of ICF, the results suggest that the rise of Chinese HP is the underlying force for the inflows of international capital. Meanwhile, a surge in capital inflows may be accompanied by a rise in the price of housing. This confirms the theoretical analysis that there is an interconnected transmission mechanism between the ICF and the HP, which is diverse and depends both on the flow of ICF and on other factors.","[Su, Chi Wei; Wang, Zhi-Feng] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Nian, Rui] Ocean Univ China, Dept Elect Engn, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yanping] Ocean Univ China, Dept Int Trade, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China,"Zhao, YP (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Dept Int Trade, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",qupipizyp@163.com,"zhao, yan/GWC-9174-2022; Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021",,National Social Science Foundation [15BJY155]; Chinese Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [201413072]; New Century Excellent Talents in Education Ministry [NCET-13-0533],National Social Science Foundation; Chinese Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; New Century Excellent Talents in Education Ministry(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation [Grant Number 15BJY155]; Chinese Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [Grant Number: 201413072]; New Century Excellent Talents in Education Ministry [Grant Number: NCET-13-0533].,,38,8,8,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We advocate a three-way definition of inflation targeting based on perfect, imperfect and zero credibility and advance the analysis by incorporating a fully-fledged adoption of inflation targeting. In doing so, we offer new insights by showing that the credibility of inflation targeting and the alternative monetary policy frameworks in Asia are imperfect, except for Malaysia and South Korea under a fully-fledged adoption of inflation targeting. In contrast to past studies that focus on the mean-reversion in inflation rates, we also consider trend-reversion and find that Asian inflation targeting countries have been building up their monetary policy credibility more than the non- inflation targeting countries in terms of a faster rate of decline in inflation rate changes. Our results generally indicate the presence of mean reversion at the lower quantiles only. Where stationarity is present, we find evidence of a varied speed of adjustment process across the quantiles. Finally, we determine the threshold levels whereby inflation becomes stationary and demonstrate that Asian inflation rates generally display stationary behavior during periods of inflation declining or slowing down.","[Valera, Harold Glenn A.; Holmes, Mark J.; Hassan, Gazi M.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",University of Waikato,"Valera, HGA (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",hgvrungl7@gmail.com,"Hassan, Gazi/AAI-3282-2020; Valera, Harold Glenn/ABB-8603-2020; Holmes, Mark/A-4117-2010","Hassan, Gazi/0000-0003-3861-8191; Holmes, Mark/0000-0002-1771-9324",New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) [DEVSCH:PHL:8070],New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT),"We are grateful for helpful suggestions made by two anonymous referees and participants at the 2016 meeting of the New Zealand Association of Economists (NZAE), and for financial support from the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) (DEVSCH:PHL:8070).

Using the hypothetical example of a prune producing company, the analysis reveals significant differences between traditional and ABC cost prices of products, highlighting the benefits of ABC approach. Tracing costs to various production-related activities within a company, the ABC model gives a detailed insight into the types and amounts of costs of attaining specific product characteristics and satisfying different customer demands. This way, the ABC provides the management with considerable discretionary power for pricing decisions, setting a sound basis for product and customer profitability management as well as for the creation of long-term value for shareholders.","[Vasilic, Marina] Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, 6 Nemanjina St, Belgrade 11080, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Vasilic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, 6 Nemanjina St, Belgrade 11080, Serbia.",marina.vasilic@agrif.bg.ac.rs,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1718,1728,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300171,0

This exposes a feedback loop between the upper and lower level of the hierarchy, which allows for more than full use of otherwise dormant capital, but that also increases inherent instabilities manifested in asset booms and busts. From the perspective of hierarchical money, we find that the call to ban banks from creating money neglects the significant role of securities-based financing in the global financial markets at the lower level, as well as the money creation capacity of central banks at the highest level of the hierarchy. Moreover, the inherently expansive nature of the hierarchy of money contradicts the long-term feasibility of full-reserve banking.","[von der Becke, Susanne] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Entrepreneurial Risks, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"von der Becke, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,45,5,5,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This paper investigated the effect of possible climate tipping events on optimal carbon taxation and energy pricing, taking into account the strategic behavior of energy consumers/producers and the uncertainty of tipping points through a stochastic dynamic game. The game was solved numerically to get some insights into the equilibrium carbon taxation and energy pricing strategies under the threat of possible tipping events. The results suggest that the sudden occurrence of tipping events will shift the carbon tax upwards but shift the (wellhead) fuel price downwards, which generates an overall effect of a sudden increase in the consumer price. The irreversibility of the damage caused by a tipping point implies more aggressive carbon taxation. Moreover, the design of climate policy should adjust to tipping probabilities, damage uncertainty, and types of tipping events.","[Zhang, Xiao-Bing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Lei] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Beihang University,"Zhu, L (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",xbzhmail@gmail.com; lions85509050@gmail.com,"Zhang, Xiao-Bing/IAQ-6426-2023","Zhu, Lei/0000-0002-7501-4904; Zhang, Xiao-Bing/0000-0001-8155-5769","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71210005, 71503242, 71273253]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Renmin University of China [16XNF014]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Renmin University of China,"The authors would like to thank the Editor Prof. Sushanta Mallick and three anonymous referees their helpful comments and suggestions on this paper, according to which the content was improved.

We demonstrate that firms are often able to identify the offers of specific rivals by offer patterns adopted by those firms. For one of these firms, these patterns are associated with higher offer prices. This is consistent with allegations by Alberta's Market Surveillance Administrator that firms may be utilizing unique bidding patterns to reveal their identities to their rivals to elevate market prices. We show that certain firms respond to rival offer changes with a lag consistent with responding to information revealed through the HTR, and that they respond differently to different firms, suggesting that they are able to infer identification.","[Brown, David P.; Eckert, Andrew] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Lin, James] Govt Alberta, Alberta Dept Energy, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Brown, DP (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",dpbrown@ualberta.ca; aeckert@ualberta.ca; jlin1@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,50,12,12,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

FE can be decomposed into three components. Discretionary FE quantifies the effect of discretionary or legislated policy changes on aggregate demand. Cyclical FE captures the effect of the automatic stabilizerschanges in government taxes and spending arising from the business cycle. Residual FE measures the effect of all changes in government revenues and outlays which cannot be categorized as either discretionary or cyclical; for example, it captures the effect of the secular increase in entitlement program spending due to the aging of the population. Unlike other approaches, FE is a bottom-up approach that allows for differential effects on aggregate demand depending on the type and length of the policy change. Thus, FE is arguably the most detailed and comprehensive measure available of the stance of US fiscal policy in relation to aggregate demand. We use our new metric to examine the contribution of fiscal policy to growth in real GDP over the course of the Great Recession and current expansion. We compare this contribution to the contributions to growth in aggregate demand made by fiscal policy over past business cycles. In doing so, we highlight that the relatively strong support of government policy to GDP growth during the Great Recession was followed by a historically weak contribution over the course of the current expansion.","[Cashin, David; Lenney, Jamie; Lutz, Byron; Peterman, William] Board Governors Fed Reserve, C St NW & 20th St NW, Washington, DC 20245 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Lutz, B (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve, C St NW & 20th St NW, Washington, DC 20245 USA.",byron.f.lutz@frb.gov,,,,,,,80,4,4,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Based on data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, the paper uses the mandatory retirement ages and different policy enforcement between the public and private sectors as instruments for retirement status. The analysis finds substantial gender heterogeneity in the effect of retirement on cognition, with a positive and significant effect for males, but a negative and less significant effect for females. The beneficial effects on cognition are stronger for male blue-collar workers, who are likely to pursue a more active lifestyle at retirement. Further investigation shows that the results are partly driven by differential behavioral changes at retirement, and the gender difference in retirement ages may also play a potential role.","[Lei Xiaoyan] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu Hong] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, H (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liuhong@cufe.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673313, 71490732]; Training Program for Major Fundamental Research of the Central University of Finance and Economics [14ZZD001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Training Program for Major Fundamental Research of the Central University of Finance and Economics,"The authors appreciate comments from Gordon Liu, Yaohui Zhao, and participants in seminars at Kobe University, Peking University and Central University of Finance and Economics, 2017 Econometric Society Asian Meeting, and CCER 2017 Summer Institute.

We show that if firm risk is ambiguous, while stocks always induce the agent to perceive a high risk, options can induce him to perceive a low risk. As a result, options can be less costly in incentivizing the agent than stocks in the presence of ambiguity. In addition, we show that providing the agent with more incentives would induce the agent to perceive a higher risk, and there is a discontinuous jump in the compensation cost as incentives increase, which makes the principal reluctant to reset contracts frequently when underlying fundamentals change. Thus, compensation contracts exhibit an inertia property. Lastly, the model sheds some light on the use of relative performance evaluation and provides a rationale for the puzzle of pay-for-luck in the presence of ambiguity.","[Liu, Qi] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lei] Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Sun, Bo] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA",Peking University; University of Manitoba; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Liu, Q (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qiliu@gsm.pku.edu.cn; Lei.Lu@umanitoba.ca; bo.sun@frb.gov,"Lu, Lei/GLS-7419-2022",,,,,,48,4,4,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The impact of monetary policy is found to be broadly comparable for China, the US, the Eurozone, and Japan. Identifying a role for the financial sector is essential to unpacking various channels through which monetary policy operates. Global factors play a significant role and their impact is strongest for China and weakest for Japan. China's impact is significant with the Eurozone displaying the most interdependence and Japan the least. Time-varying VARs suggest that contrasts in the responses to monetary policy shocks persist highlighting some of the remaining differences in the transmission mechanism.

The joint impacts of off-farm work participation and smartphone use on household income are also analyzed using a control function method. The results show that participation in off-farm work increases the probability of smartphone use significantly.

Does income inequality impact residential choices and community segregation? To answer these questions, I develop a two-community general equilibrium framework of school quality, residential choice, and tax decision with probabilistic voting. The model predicts that an equilibrium with income mixing in which households segregate across public schools and low- and high-income households choose to live in the same community might emerge in highly unequal societies. In this particular equilibrium, income-mixing communities perform lower public school quality than communities populated by middle-income households. The effect of inequality on the quality of public schooling in the income-mixing community is ambiguous and depends on the relative endowments of private goods, such as housing, in the two communities.","[Melindi-Ghidi, Paolo] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Univ Paris Nanterre, Economix,EHESS,Cent Marseille,AMSE, Ave Repub 200, F-92100 Nanterre, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Melindi-Ghidi, P (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Univ Paris Nanterre, Economix,EHESS,Cent Marseille,AMSE, Ave Repub 200, F-92100 Nanterre, France.",paolo.melindighidi@parisnanterre.fr,,"melindi-ghidi, paolo/0000-0002-0708-9621",,,,,37,3,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We focus on the banking sector to investigate the degree of integration that has been achieved, both within ASEAN (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia) and externally with global markets (Japan, Hong Kong, China, India, and the USA). Specifically, we look at bank stock indexes and test for both correlation and causality across markets. Data are for the period 2000-2012 at daily frequency. Applying a dynamic conditional correlation (DEC) GARCH framework, we find evidence of rising correlation in market movements over time, both internal and external to ASEAN, although correlation coefficients remain low to moderate. Granger-causality tests show wide ranging transmission of volatility, with Singapore transmitting to all four other ASEAN markets and the USA to all five markets and Hong Kong to four. A quantile-based test for causality in conditional asymmetry finds more isolated occurrence of transmission. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Transformations of their mobilizations are governed by: the changing context of immigration opportunities in the UK; the technological advancements of new modes of communication; larger political shifts in both Russia and the UK; and significantly, the availability of specific opportunity structures for mobilization. The principal opportunity structures available to these migrants in the 2000s fostered their mobilization as a culturally-defined minority migrant community and encouraged them to become part of a global network of Russian compatriots. A new opportunity structure emerged in the early 2010s in the form of a transnational protest movement against political corruption in the Russian Federation. However, as the Russian government introduced policies effecting a growing disenfranchisement of Russians resident abroad from political developments in Russia itself, many Russians in the UK have started to look for new ways to engage. The politics of Brexit have become one new opportunity structure for them.","[Morgunova, Oksana] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Moscow, Russia; [Morgunova, Oksana] Higher Sch Econ Res Univ, Integrated Commun, Moscow, Russia; [Byford, Andy] Univ Durham, Russian, Durham, England",Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Durham University,"Morgunova, O (通讯作者)，Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Moscow, Russia.;Morgunova, O (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ Res Univ, Integrated Commun, Moscow, Russia.",o_morgunova@hotmail.com; andy.byford@durham.ac.uk,"Morgunova, Oksana/AAY-6952-2020","Morgunova, Oksana/0000-0003-2607-5599",,,,,45,2,2,0,3,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

This paper analyzes the likely impact of the program-which is a subsidy provided to new, innovative firms-on Start, Growth, and Survival. The projects are supported by sponsors in the application process. Results of our analysis indicate that, controlling for observed characteristics, projects that received the subsidy had a 9.5 percentage point higher probability of starting to sell. Among created firms, subsidized (Treated) firms showed a 17 percentage point higher probability of significant Growth (in sales) and a similar effect on Survival. The analysis also examined a change in the program rules in 2011, whereby sponsors were paid based on performance instead of fixed fees, as it was before 2011. For projects affected by the policy change, results indicate no overall association of the program with the probability of Start and a positive correlation with Growth and Survival. These results could be a consequence of sponsors making better project selections for funding. The change in rules would suggest that the program contributes more to the Growth and Survival of new firms than to their Start, which would take place anyway. The data available for this study did not make it possible to fully control for potential selection biases, and thus the results may overestimate the impact of the program. This calls to suggest to improve data collection standards to help identify the true effect of this type of program.","[Navarro, Lucas] ILADES Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Navarro, L (通讯作者)，ILADES Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile.",lunavarr@uahurtado.cl,,,Inter-American Development Bank,Inter-American Development Bank,"This research received financial support from the Inter-American Development Bank.

Then, we suggest a class of flexible parametric densities which satisfy certain economic constraints and stylized facts of personal income data such as the weak Pareto law and a decline of the income-share elasticities. Our empirical results using the U.S. family income data show that the ME principle provides economically meaningful and a very parsimonious and, at the same time, flexible specification of the income density function.","[Park, Sung Y.] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heuksok Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Bera, Anil K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 1407 W Gregory, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Chung Ang University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Bera, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 1407 W Gregory, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",sungpark@cau.ac.kr; abera@illinois.edu,,"Park, Sung Yong/0000-0001-9149-7603","Research Board, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","Research Board, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","We are grateful to three anonymous referees, and especially the editor for many pertinent comments and helpful suggestions.

Public authorities do not have any explicit commitment to intervene; they may even honestly state that they not want to do so ex ante, but may feel compelled to do so ex post. A declared policy aim is to limit the value of implicit guarantees by making banks stronger, more easily resolvable in case of distress, as well as by imposing extra charges that rise as banks become more systemically important. As part of the latter approach, globally systemically important banks are identified and subjected to more costly and intrusive regulation. There is little evidence that specific approach has been successful so far. There is some evidence that the introduction of new resolution frameworks has been helpful, while the use of newly available resolution tools and the involvement of bank creditors in the burden sharing associated with bank failure resolution has significantly reduced the value of implicit bank debt guarantees, where it occurred. In that sense, actions speak louder than words.","[Schich, Sebastian] OECD, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Schich, S (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",sebastian.schich@oecd.org,,,,,,,100,5,6,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The model incorporates three essential characteristics of knowledge that have not been covered entirely by previous diffusion models: the network character of knowledge, compatibility of new knowledge with already existing knowledge, and the fact that transmission of knowledge requires some form of attention. We employ a network-of- networks approach, where agents are located within an innovation network and each agent itself contains another network composed of knowledge units (KUs). Since social learning is a path-dependent process, in our model, KUs are exchanged among agents and integrated into their respective knowledge networks depending on the received KUs' compatibility with the currently focused ones. Thereby, we are also able to endogenize attributes such as absorptive capacity that have been treated as an exogenous parameter in some of the previous diffusion models. We use our model to simulate and analyze various scenarios, including cases for different degrees of knowledge diversity and cognitive distance among agents as well as knowledge exploitation vs. exploration strategies. Here, the model is able to distinguish between two levels of knowledge diversity: heterogeneity within and between agents. Additionally, our simulation results give fresh impetus to debates about the interplay of innovation network structure and knowledge diffusion. In summary, our article proposes a novel way of modeling knowledge diffusion, thereby contributing to an advancement of the economics of innovation and knowledge.","[Schlaile, Michael P.; Mueller, Matthias] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ 520i, Wollgrasweg 23, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Schlaile, Michael P.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ & Business Educ 560 D, Wollgrasweg 23, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Zeman, Johannes] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Computat Phys, Allmandring 3, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim; University Hohenheim; University of Stuttgart,"Schlaile, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ 520i, Wollgrasweg 23, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.;Schlaile, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ & Business Educ 560 D, Wollgrasweg 23, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",schlaile@uni-hohenheim.de,"Schlaile, Michael P./Q-8095-2019; Müller, Matthias/AAE-6806-2022","Schlaile, Michael P./0000-0002-9269-0306; Müller, Matthias/0000-0001-8213-0447; Zeman, Johannes/0000-0001-7735-5086",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the cluster of excellence Simulation Technology [EXC 310 SimTech]; Dieter Schwarz Stiftung,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the cluster of excellence Simulation Technology(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Dieter Schwarz Stiftung,"We thank Raul J.

However, a sparse but growing strand of the literature now looks at the reverse because there is reason to believe that higher income inequality may influence corruption levels. Furthermore, the empirical literature is inconclusive on the exact relationship between income inequality and corruption across different regions and income categories. We contribute to this literature by providing empirical evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa using an unbalanced panel data for 48 countries from 1996 to 2016. Contrary to prior results from developed countries, our results show that higher levels of income inequality are rather associated with lower corruption levels and suggestive of a changing relationship between income inequality and corruption among countries on different income trajectories. We also find a reverse causality between income inequality and corruption and that corruption Granger-causes income inequality. Finally, results from OLS, random effects and fixed effects models reveal a U-shaped relationship between income inequality and corruption for low-income and lower-middle-income African countries with turning point income inequality levels ranging from 22 to 52.

We hypothesize that an alternative approach such as non-parametric artificial neural networks can be used for latent variable estimation through an undirected graphical models. In this study, we explore the use of generative non-parametric modelling methods to estimate latent variables from prior choice distribution without the conventional use of measurement indicators. A restricted Boltzmann machine is used to represent latent behaviour factors by analyzing the relationship information between the observed choices and explanatory variables. The algorithm is adapted for latent behaviour analysis in discrete choice scenario and we use a graphical approach to evaluate and understand the semantic meaning from estimated parameter vector values. We illustrate our methodology on a financial instrument choice dataset and perform statistical analysis on parameter sensitivity and stability. Our findings show that through non-parametric statistical tests, we can extract useful latent information on the behaviour of latent constructs through machine learning methods and present strong and significant influence on the choice process.

The estimates show that the heterogeneous treatment effects are negatively associated with the propensity to use childcare, which implies that mothers who increase their labor supply the least when subjected to the treatment are those mothers with the highest underlying tendency to use childcare. Because the childcare rationing rule tends to allocate childcare slots to mothers who work full-time before they apply, the slots tend to go to mothers who have the strongest labor force attachment, who are also the mothers who tend to have the strongest propensity to use childcare.","[Yamaguchi, Shintaro] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo, Japan; [Asai, Yukiko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo, Japan; [Kambayashi, Ryo] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Naka 2-1, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; Hitotsubashi University,"Yamaguchi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo, Japan.",syamaguchi@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp; y_asai@iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp; kambayas@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,"Yamaguchi, Shintaro/0000-0001-7951-9670","Murata Science Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [15K17071, 16H02020, 16K21743]; Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K21743, 15K17071, 16H02020] Funding Source: KAKEN","Murata Science Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank seminar participants at the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia for their helpful comments.

We notice that in the frequency domain, the two variables have a relationship in higher spectrums (short-term). The results also show that co-movements exist during structural reforms and financial crises, which in turn supports the expenditure-switching model. The C.P.I. and P.P.I. are sensitive to variations in exchange rates, which pass through prices at the domestic level. Exchange rate shocks lead to inflationary pressure; therefore, long-term oriented intervention policies of the central banks will be more efficient.

We propose an empirical structural methodology, which can deal with settings involving all types of owners and ownership rights, to quantify the coordinated effects of partial horizontal acquisitions on differentiated products industries, by evaluating the impact of such acquisitions on the minimum discount factors for which coordination can be sustained. We also provide an empirical application of the methodology to several acquisitions in the wet shaving industry that give rise to cross- and common -ownership structures. The results are as follows (i) the incentives to coordinate of the firms that the acquiring party is - pre-acquisition - able to influence are non-decreasing with any acquisition; (ii) the incentives to coordinate of the acquired firm are non-decreasing with acquisitions involving full or partial both financial and corporate control rights, but non-increasing with acquisitions involving full or partial solely financial rights; and (iii) the incentives to coordinate of the remaining firms in the industry are non-increasing with any acquisition. This implies that the coordinated effects of partial horizontal acquisitions are, in general, ambiguous, which illustrates the importance of an empirical structural methodology.

While symmetric players are equally productive, mutually dependent players are only jointly (hence, equally) productive. In particular, we provide a characterization of the whole class of positively weighted Shapley values that uses two standard properties, efficiency and the null player out property, and a new property called superweak differential marginality. Superweak differential marginality is a relaxation of weak differential marginality (Casajus and Yokote, 2017). It requires two players' payoff for two games to change in the same direction whenever only their joint productivity changes, i.e., their individual productivities stay the same. In contrast, weak differential marginality already requires this when their individual productivities change by the same amount. The Shapley value is the unique positively weighted Shapley value that satisfies weak differential marginality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper introduces an econometric strategy for estimating individual or household-level development resilience from panel data. Estimation of multiple conditional moments of a welfare function-itself specified to permit potentially nonlinear path dynamics-enables the computation and forecasting of individual-specific conditional probabilities of satisfying a normative minimum standard of living. We then develop a decomposable resilience measure that enables aggregation of the individual-specific estimates to targetable subpopulation- and population-level measures. We illustrate the method empirically using household panel data from pastoralist communities in northern Kenya. The results demonstrate the method and its potential for targeting resilience-building interventions.","[Cisse, Jennifer Denno] US Agcy Int Dev, Washington, DC 20523 USA; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Cornell University,"Cissé, JD (通讯作者)，US Agcy Int Dev, Washington, DC 20523 USA.",jcisse@usaid.gov,"Cisse, Jennifer/ABH-3265-2020","Cisse, Jennifer/0000-0001-5637-1941","UK Department for International Development through FSD Trust [SVVD/Weather/43/2009]; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [EDH-A-00-06-0003-00]; World Banks Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development; USAID BASIS Research Program at the University of California, Davis; CGIAR project; African Development Bank; USAID; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1522054] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","UK Department for International Development through FSD Trust; United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIAR); World Banks Trust Fund for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development; USAID BASIS Research Program at the University of California, Davis(CGIAR); CGIAR project(CGIAR); African Development Bank(CGIAR); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))","We thank Mark Constas, Nathan Jensen, Shanjun Li, Graham Rowlands, Joanna Upton, an anonymous reviewer, Editor -in -Chief Andrew Foster and participants in presentations at Cornell, the 2015 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association annual meetings, the 2015 Midwest International Economic Development Conference, and the Centre for the Study of African Economies Conference 2016 for helpful comments on previous drafts.

If the firm conceals information, it might be detected and fined. We show that optimal monitoring is determined by a trade-off. Overall, stricter enforcement reduces the incentives for selective reporting but crowds out information search. Our model implies that there are situations in which the relationship between the two monitoring instruments might be complementary. We also show that the welfare effects of mandatory disclosure depend on how it is enforced and that imperfect enforcement (in which some information remains concealed) might be optimal. In particular, the optimal fine might be smaller than the largest possible fine, even though the latter requires lower resource costs for inspections. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we use the arrival of a new communication technology, ADSL broadband, to study the effects of heterogeneous types of ICT on firm performance. To do so free from endogeneity bias, we construct instruments using postcode-level geographic variation in the infrastructure underlying broadband internet - the pre-existing telephone network.

We employ various decision models to aggregate counterfactual national interest rates based on Taylor rule estimates and test which of the resulting interest paths fits best to the actual monetary policy in the euro area. As a novel feature, we introduce decision models where countries that fare economically worse than the euro area average obtain a higher weight in the decision process. Our results suggest that these models explain actual ECB policy better than GDP-based bargaining models that have been highlighted in the previous literature. Thus, the ECB seems to have emphasized the needs of countries that face an economic crisis disproportionately highly even before the advent of the financial crisis.","[Drometer, Marcus] Ifo Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut,"Drometer, M (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",drometer@ifo.de,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2018,71.0,4,,,,,537,556,,10.1111/kykl.12185,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW5QR,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000446991700002,0

However, health investment may be subject to borrowing constraints. In this study, we incorporate endogenous health investment in a scale-invariant Schumpeterian growth model. We find the following. When the cash-in-advance (CIA) constraint does not apply to medical expenditures, long-run growth does not depend on the nominal interest rate. In contrast, when the CIA constraint does apply to medical expenditures, an increase in the nominal interest rate leads to a decrease in both R&D and health investment, which in turn reduce the long-run growth rates of technology and output. Nevertheless, welfare is always a decreasing function of the nominal interest rate, and the welfare loss is greater under the CIA constraint on medical expenditures. As an empirical test, we build panel data for 61 countries during the years 1995-2014. We find a significant, negative effect of inflation on out-of-pocket health expenditure (% of total expenditure on health) of the World Development Indicators of the World Bank, which provides support for our theory. The policy implication is that government financing of health care for the poor can offset this effect.","[He, Qichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"He, QC (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",qichunhe@gmail.com,,", Qichun/0000-0001-7643-3150",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"I am grateful to the Editor Sushanta Mallick, one associate editor, two anonymous referees, and Angus Chu for comments that substantially improved this paper.

The study aims at addressing this key question: Do Islamic banks (IBs) have higher credit risk than conventional banks (CBs) in Malaysia? Accordingly, some papers tried to answer this question but they were performed using cross-country data. The cross-country data should have been treated more cautiously since every country has its own developmental backgrounds and regional resulting in different characteristics of banking industry. Moreover, different financial systems that give support or limit the operation of Islamic banks will also make more difficult to compare the data of each country. For that reason, it is suggested to take suitable control for heterogeneity across countries to obtain consistently good conclusions about the credit risk. Different from the cross-country works, this study will focus on the country-level data of Malaysia. A panel data model was applied and it was used the generalized least squares (GLS) model and a yearly bank level data to evaluate the credit risk of 22 conventional banks and 17 Islamic banks in Malaysia. In addition, the study period, which lasted from 2005 to 2015, seems to be representative since it encompasses the period of the sub-prime crisis. This project is an extension of the study begun by Cihak and Hesse (2008) that used cross-country bank data such Malaysia. The results are particularly interesting and do not confirm the results generated by these researchers. The main contribution that this work will hopefully make is to show the reasons which account for the Islamic banks' higher degree of credit risk, and particularly to provide additional insights and complement the existing cross-country studies on Islamic bank stability.

The unique feature of the Western Australian setting is that the same carbon tax was introduced and later repealed, but the market structure differed at each event. At the repeal event, the dominant firm had less incentive to exercise unilateral market power. Then, the opposite result is observed - emissions were lower with the tax.

The changing economic conditions, including increases in the returns to schooling and employment opportunities for women, and increases in one-child families, have likely changed the incentives for parental investments in the education of children, and potentially differentially so for sons and daughters, and for families in rural and urban areas. In this paper, we use data spanning three generations of Chinese families to examine the evolution of educational attainment for boys and girls and the relative levels of schooling by gender. We also examine differences in trends across rural and urban areas. We find a substantial narrowing of the gender gap in schooling, so much so that girls now have more education on average than boys. In addition, policy initiatives had a larger effect in rural than urban areas.","[McGarry, Kathleen; Sun, Xiaoting] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [McGarry, Kathleen] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"McGarry, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.;McGarry, K (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mcgarry@ucla.edu,,,,,,,17,3,6,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Industrial development is defined as a shift from an imitation-based, low-skill economy to an innovation-based, high-skill economy, where ideas are produced domestically. Imitation generates knowledge spillovers, which enhance productivity in innovation. Changes in industrial structure are measured by the ratio of the variety of imitation- to innovation-based intermediate goods. The model also distinguishes between basic infrastructure, which helps to promote learning by doing and productivity in imitation activities, and advanced infrastructure, which promotes knowledge networks and innovation. Numerical experiments, based on a parameterized version for a stylized low-income country, show that changes in the level and composition of public investment in infrastructure may have significant effects on the structure of the labour force and the process of industrial development.","[Agenor, Pierre-Richard] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Alpaslan, Baris] Univ Ankara, Social Sci, Ankara, Turkey",University of Manchester; Ankara University,"Agénor, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",Pierre-Richard.Agenor@manchester.ac.uk,"Alpaslan, Baris/A-3541-2017","Alpaslan, Baris/0000-0002-7908-1557; Agenor, Pierre-Richard/0000-0001-5720-3544",,,,,33,7,7,4,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

This study uses U.S. micro-data from 2000 to 2012 (thus including effects of the Great Recession) to examine how displacement (i.e., exogenous job loss) affects the probability of divorce. The author finds displacement significantly increases the probability of divorce but only if the husband is the spouse that is displaced, and his earnings represented approximately half or less of the household's earnings prior to displacement. Similarly, results show that the probability of divorce increases if the wife is employed and as her earnings increase. While the mechanism behind these asymmetric results remains unclear, these results are consistent with recent research that finds a destabilizing effect on marriages when a wife earns more than her husband.","[Banzhaf, Melissa Ruby] US Bur Census, Atlanta Fed Stat Res Data Ctr, 1000 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA",,"Banzhaf, MR (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Atlanta Fed Stat Res Data Ctr, 1000 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",Melissa.r.banzhaf@census.gov,,,,,,,32,4,4,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

In our framework, we allow contestants to have more general preferences than have been used in the literature. Previous approaches have the unfortunate characteristic that contestants' marginal rates of substitution between the rent share allocated by the contest and their effort is constant regardless of the size of the rent share. This results in a conventional wisdom: larger rents command more effort. By providing a more general framework, we show the reverse may also be true and we derive the conditions under which this is the case. Our approach then allows us to rationalize, within a standard contest framework, observations that rents might be more hotly contested when they become scarcer, as has evidently been the case with the recent global contraction of public funds available for public policy.

Lower credit constraints allow less productive firms to enter with the following consequences. On the one hand, more competition tends to reduce average prices, but on the other hand, less productive firms charge above-average prices. The overall effect is thus ambiguous. We therefore formulate and structurally estimate a quantitative multi-country version of the model to gauge the direction and magnitude of the effects of credit constraints in a model with variable firm-specific markups over marginal costs. In a sample of 11 European countries' manufacturing sectors between 2000 and 2005, we find that an abolishment of credit constraints reduces markups by about 6.1% on average, while average prices are predicted to increase by 1.6%. The latter indicates that the effect of credit constraints on productivity dominates the one on competition.","[Egger, Peter] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CEPR, Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter; Seidel, Tobias] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Kunert, Sebastian; Seidel, Tobias] Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Ifo Institut; University of Duisburg Essen,"Egger, P (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CEPR, Zurich, Switzerland.;Egger, P (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",German Research Foundation (DFG) [SE1893/2-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This paper has benefited much from the comments of two anonymous referees.

This approach allows measuring the dynamics of return and volatility connectedness over time and across frequencies simultaneously. The empirical results show that most of return and volatility connectedness is generated in the very short-term, i.e. movements up to five days, while the long-term plays a minor role. Our analysis further reveals a greater degree of interconnectedness across crude oil and financial markets since the onset of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis in summer of 2007, consistent with the view of a global re-pricing of risk triggered by the recent worldwide financial crisis. Crude oil prices do not appear as a key driver of the stock market performance of renewable energy companies in the short-term or the long-term, which suggests a decoupling of the alternative energy industry from the traditional energy market. Moreover, crude oil prices are a net receiver of financial shocks, supporting the financialization of the commodity markets since the early 2000s. In addition, a significant pairwise connectedness is found, mainly in the short-term, between clean energy and technology stock prices, indicating that these two types of stocks are perceived by investors as similar assets. These results can have important practical implications for investors and policy makers with different time horizons. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Immediately following university completion, male and female full-timers work a very similar number of hours per week, but men earn more than women across the pay distribution, with an unadjusted gender gap in full-time monthly earnings of about 20 log points on average.

This is a unique case, where $3 trillion current day dollars was spent. We find robust evidence consistent with the hypothesis that economic factors dominated the allocation of supply contracts, and that political factors-or at least winning the 1944 presidential election-were at best of secondary importance. General industrial capacity in 1939, as well as specialized industrial capacity for aircraft production, are strong predictors of contract spending across states. Electoral college pivot probabilities are weak predictors of contract (and new facilities) spending, and under the most plausible assumptions they are essentially unrelated to spending. This is true over the entire period 1940-1944, and also for shorter periods leading up to the election in November 1944. That is, we find no evidence of an electoral cycle in the distribution of funds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The current paper attempts to uncover the issue of allocating credits to bad borrowers. In this respect, consumer credit scoring is a measure taken to overcome challenges encountered by Tunisian banks in the process of granting credits. These challenges stand as initiatives to enable banks to predict the future performance of borrowers, to determine the optimal credit limit with regard to the applicants' repayment behavior, and to ensure their efficiency through automating the credit-granting decision process. To reach this end, we use the logistic regression as well as the discriminant analysis in order to develop predictive models that distinguish between good and bad borrowers. The data have been collected from a commercial Tunisian bank over a 3-year period, from 2010 to 2012. These data consist of four selected and ordered variables. By comparing the respective performances of the logistic regression (LR) and the discriminant analysis (DA), we notice that the LR model yields a 99 % good classification rate in predicting customer types, and then, a significantly low error rate (1 %), as compared with the DA approach (where the good classification rate is only equal to 68.49 %, leading to a significantly high error rate, i.e., 31.51 %).

The need for non-linear and non-anonymous prices - a complication that is often difficult to implement in practice - arises from limiting attention to elicitation processes based on demand queries (i.e., asking bidders to report their demands at posted prices). In this paper, we relax this restriction and allow the auctioneer to supplement demand queries with marginal value queries (i.e., requests to report value differences between pairs of commodity bundles) as needed. This added flexibility enables an iterative ascending auction design that achieves efficiency despite using linear and anonymous prices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

There is a growing concern that public finances may be negatively affected when spending and taxing powers are delegated to subnational tiers of government, especially under adverse financial conditions. Our work proves that these concerns are unfounded. The empirical investigation on 19 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries over the period 1980-2010 shows that the budget balances of central and local governments do not get worse with fiscal decentralization. Moreover, during banking crises expenditure decentralization seems to be beneficial, as the central government can easily shift resources from intergovernmental grants to financing public policies necessary to tackle the crisis. In turn, more subnational tax autonomy would improve the budget of all tiers of government, suggesting that more 'effective' tax decentralization increases fiscal discipline also in times of financial distress.","[Bartolini, David] OECD, Dept Econ, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Bartolini, David; Santolini, Raffaella] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Ple Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Sacchi, Agnese] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Sacchi, Agnese] Univ Vigo, Governance & Econ Res Network GEN, Vigo, Spain; [Salotti, Simone] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC Seville, Seville, Spain",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Marche Polytechnic University; Sapienza University Rome; Universidade de Vigo,"Sacchi, A (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.;Sacchi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Governance & Econ Res Network GEN, Vigo, Spain.",dbartomail@gmail.com; agnese.sacchi@uniroma1.it; simone.salotti@ec.europa.eu; r.santolini@univpm.it,"Salotti, Simone/N-7916-2019; Santolini, Raffaella/AFV-2513-2022","Salotti, Simone/0000-0003-1898-6683; SANTOLINI, Raffaella/0000-0001-5307-5653",,,,,89,14,14,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

Effects of heterogeneity in innovations,STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,C02; L0; O31,PRODUCT; LIFE; GROWTH,"This paper studies the question how changes in intellectual property rights (IPR) regime affect relative innovation intensity for multinational large enterprises (MNEs) and local firms. The R&D process is doubly-differentiated, allowing both for variety-expanding and productivity-improving innovations. The IPR regime is abstracted as an effective duration of patent protection. From one side stronger IPR foster R&D activities of the MNE, which is in agreement with other findings. From the other side the local innovative activity is threatened by stronger protection. Depending on technical characteristics of the underlying R&D processes, the strengthening of the uniform one-size-fits-all IPR creates productivity bias or variety bias. Moreover, if technologies are heterogeneous, this bias varies over time implying the necessity of technology-specific heterogeneous IPR protection regimes to foster structural change and avoid technology lock-ins.

I use an instrumental variables (IV) approach that assigns immigrants to counties by interacting two sources of variation: the availability of land for settlement and the arrival of Europeans over time. Counties with historically higher shares of European population in 1914 have higher per capita GDP 80years later. I show that this long run effect is linked to the higher level of human capital that immigrants brought to Argentina. I show that Europeans raised literacy rates in the receiving counties, and that high-skilled Europeans played an important role in the onset of industrialisation, owned most of the industrial establishments, and provided the majority of the industrial labour force.","[Droller, Federico] Univ Santiago Chile, FAE, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Droller, F (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Chile, FAE, Dept Econ, Av Lib B OHiggins 3363, Santiago 9170022, Chile.",federi.codroller@usach.cl,"Droller, Federico/S-7630-2019",,Universidad de Santiago DICYT [031462D],Universidad de Santiago DICYT,"I am grateful to the Editor, Hans-Joachim Voth, and three anonymous referees for helpful observations.

We are interested in the role that historical precedents may play for equilibrium selection between these two repeated games. We find that a precedent for efficient play in the repeated Stag Hunt game does not carry over to the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game despite the possibility that efficient play can be sustained as an equilibrium of the indefinitely repeated game. Similarly, a precedent for inefficient play in the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game does not extend to the repeated Stag Hunt game. We conclude that equilibrium selection between similar repeated games may have less to do with historical precedents and might instead depend more on strategic considerations associated with the different payoffs of these similar repeated games.","[Duffy, John] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Fehr, Dietmar] WZB, Berlin, Germany",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Duffy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",duffy@uci.edu; dietmar.fehr@wzb.eu,"Duffy, John/F-6968-2015","Duffy, John/0000-0002-7660-2281",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [CRC 1029],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),For helpful comments and suggestions we thank an anonymous referee and participants at the Workshop in Memory of John Van Huyck held at SMU in October 2015.

Empirical evidence indicating negative investment effects of the regulation played a key role in this reversal, though the quantification of these investment effects were a matter of substantial controversy. This article surveys the studies cited in the recent decision and the Commission's scrutiny of them. In all, the Commission considered eight primary works but relied on only two of them, a culling process that relied on four principles: (1) simply comparing outcomes before-and-after an event is not a valid impact analysis; (2) before-and-after comparisons are more probative if regression analysis is used to condition the outcomes by accounting for potentially relevant factors like economic growth, sales, and so forth; (3) the causal effects of a regulation are best determined with reference to a counterfactual; and (4) the application of proper methods does not excuse the use of bad data. These principles are mostly uncontroversial and are consistent with the modern practice of impact analysis.","[Ford, George S.] Phoenix Ctr Adv Legal & Econ, 5335 Wisconsin Ave NW,Ste 440, Washington, DC 20015 USA",,"Ford, GS (通讯作者)，Phoenix Ctr Adv Legal & Econ, 5335 Wisconsin Ave NW,Ste 440, Washington, DC 20015 USA.",ford@phoenix-center.org,,,,,,,31,3,4,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

We start with an overview of the measurement of offshoring, organizing our discussion around the three key elements of offshoring: that it involves intermediate inputs for production (versus final goods for consumption); that it involves imported inputs (versus domestically produced ones); and that the inputs involved could have been produced internally within the same firm. We then briefly discuss the theories of offshoring and survey the literature that examines the wage effects of offshoring: the wave of studies using industry-level data; the wave using firm-level data; the wave using worker-level data; and the wave using matched worker-firm data. For each wave, we highlight the identification strategies used, critically assess its strengths and weaknesses, discuss its connections with theory, and draw out potential policy implications of its findings. Finally, we survey the literature that examines how offshoring affects employment and displacement. We highlight the recent development of a novel cohort-based approach that is specifically designed to address selection with displacement, and capable of identifying the overall effects of offshoring, including wage, displacement, and all other types of transitions.","[Hummels, David; Xiang, Chong] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hummels, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Munch, Jakob R.] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Munch, Jakob R.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Copenhagen; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Hummels, D (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Hummels, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Munch, Jakob Roland/0000-0002-4387-1039",,,,,129,62,70,5,51,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Theoretically, we exploit a structural gravity model to derive a closed-form solution for a widely-used measure of market potential. We are thus able to express market potential as a function of directly observable and easily estimated variables. Empirically, we collect a large dataset on aggregate and bilateral trade flows as well as output for 51 countries. We find that market potential exhibits an upward trend across all regions of the world from the early 1930s and that this trend significantly deviates from the evolution of world GDP.

We use a regression method with time-varying coefficients to trace changes in coefficients over time. The empirical results show that the RMB's effects on East Asian currencies were near zero before 2008, but since then have significantly increased and taken over the role of the U.S. dollar in some countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines). In Singapore and Thailand, the RMB is still a non-factor. South Korea shows an interesting pattern, in that the role of the RMB swings over time, with an increase in the past couple of years. We conjecture that the trade share with China has a positive influence on the role of the RMB. In conclusion, given the small absolute value of the regression coefficient on RMB, although the RMB has attained a more significant status in the currency market, it is too early to talk about the creation of an RMB bloc in East Asia.","[Kim, Chang Sik; Kim, Sunghyun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sunkyunkwan Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Wang, Yunjong] Catholic Univ Korea, Sch Int Studies, 43 Jibong Ro, Bucheon Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Wang, Yunjong] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Sejong Natl Res Complex,370 Sicheongdaerom, Sejong Si, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Catholic University of Korea; Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP),"Kim, CS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sunkyunkwan Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",skimcs@skku.edu; shenrykim@skku.edu,,"Kim, Sunghyun/0000-0002-9326-1028",,,,,21,6,7,2,25,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

In this paper, we derive the density of CSM returns in analytic form, along with moments of all orders, under the assumption that underlying asset returns are multivariate normal. The resulting expressions are highly non-trivial in general and involve truncated normal distributions. The distribution of CSM returns can be formally described as a mixture of the unified skew-normal family of distributions. However, if the asset returns are independent, then the density of the CSM returns is shown to be a mixture of univariate normals. In order to shed light on the general case, we present a detailed analysis of the case of two underlying assets, which is shown to explain many of the key features of CSM returns reported in the empirical literature.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the current position of the literature on skills mismatch and highlight areas which are relatively underdeveloped and may warrant further research. Using data from the European Skills and Jobs Survey, we assess the incidence of various combinations of skills mismatch across the EU. Finally, we review the European Commission's country-specific recommendations and find that skills mismatch, when referring to underutilized human capital in the form of overeducation and skills underutilization, receives little policy attention. In cases where skills mismatch forms part of policy recommendations, the policy advice is either vague or addresses the areas of mismatch for which there is the least available evidence.","[McGuinness, Seamus] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Econ & Social Res Inst Dublin, IZA, Dublin, Ireland; [Pouliakas, Konstantinos] Univ Aberdeen, European Ctr Dev Vocat Educ, CEDEFOP, IZA, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Redmond, Paul] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Econ & Social Res Inst Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; University of Aberdeen; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"McGuinness, S (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Econ & Social Res Inst Dublin, IZA, Dublin, Ireland.",seamus.mcguinness@esri.ie,,"mcguinness, seamus/0000-0003-1729-3017; Redmond, Paul/0000-0001-8272-8596",,,,,122,80,94,18,90,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In Europe, digital sellers based in a given EU country are not always able to distribute across borders. In January 2016, US-based Netflix announced an expansion to 243 countries, accomplishing cross-border distribution through business strategy. Changes in law or technology that facilitate cross-national cultural trade have traditionally drawn the concern of observers worried about the cultural heritage-and products-of small markets. The expansion raises questions about what Netflix is doing. Is it a cultural hegemon, distributing US fare into 243 countries? Or it is a facilitator of free trade, making the products of even small countries more available outside their home markets (relative to traditional distribution)? And how does the curated model-which limits the number of movies the platform wants to distribute-affect Netflix's function? To shed light on these questions, we develop a new measure of the global availability of a repertoire, the value-weighted geographic reach. Using this measure we find, first, that Netflix makes many of the works from a wide variety of countries available in many other countries. Second, we find that theatrical distribution strongly advantages US-origin fare. Third, the pattern of origin repertoire available through Netflix also favors the USA, although less overwhelmingly. Moreover, many countries are relatively advantaged by their Netflix availability patterns. Finally, we discuss some issues related to the Netflix platform, including horizontal competition with other platforms, vertical struggles with content providers (and its backward integration into production), and we speculate on possible challenges for regulators.","[Aguiar, Luis] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Digital Econ Unit, Seville, Spain; [Waldfogel, Joel] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Waldfogel, Joel] NBER, Minneapolis, MN 02138 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Waldfogel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Waldfogel, J (通讯作者)，NBER, Minneapolis, MN 02138 USA.",luis.aguiar@ec.europa.eu; jwaldfog@umn.edu,"Aguiar, Luis/JDV-5650-2023; Waldfogel, Joel/A-4916-2015","Aguiar, Luis/0000-0001-6176-7393; Waldfogel, Joel/0000-0002-8040-7227",,,,,10,37,47,8,138,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

With internationally mobile capital, strategic policies generate two cross-border externalities that voters in each country fail to internalize: (1) an increase in public spending that bolsters capital accumulation but also (2) a race to the top in public debt which crowds out capital. The relative size of these two externalities varies with the number of financially integrated countries and interacts with the domestic political conflict between young and old voters. Despite residence based taxation, capital tax rates are lower under strategic policies than under coordination. Furthermore, they may decline with financial integration. Strategic policies lead to lower long run output and welfare relative to coordination but are preferred by subsequent generations of voters if the number of financially integrated countries is low or the political weight of the young is high.

We find unexpected monetary policy moves to exert a substantially milder impact in presence of high uncertainty. We then exploit the set of impulse responses coming from the nonlinear VAR framework to estimate a medium-scale new-Keynesian DSGE model with a minimum distance approach. The DSGE model is shown to be able to replicate the VAR evidence in both regimes thanks to different estimates of some crucial structural parameters. In particular, we identify a steeper new-Keynesian Phillips curve as the key factor behind the DSGE model's ability to replicate the milder macroeconomic responses to a monetary policy shock estimated with our VAR in presence of high uncertainty. A version of the model featuring firm-specific capital is shown to be associated to estimates of the price frequency which are in line with some recent evidence based on micro data.

Our analysis focuses on Italian graduates and refers to the cohort that graduated in 2007 using data from the AlmaLaurea survey on graduates entering the labour market. A new measure of overeducation is introduced and jointly examined along with an alternative measure based on workers' self-assessment. After having run estimates of the impact of overeducation on earnings and analyzed possible determinants of educational mismatch, we conclude that the two definitions of overeducation measure quite different things and in particular that traditional measures based on workers' self-assessment are affected by individuals' characteristics and by workers' expectations and perceptions concerning the job post. However, effects on wages are very similar no matter what definition is adopted.","[Cattani, Luca; Guidetti, Giovanni] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy; [Pedrini, Giulio] Univ Milano Bicocca, Interuniv Res Ctr Publ Serv CRISP, Milan, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Pedrini, G (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Interuniv Res Ctr Publ Serv CRISP, Milan, Italy.",Giulio.pedrini3@unibo.it,"Cattani, Luca/AAB-2594-2022; Pedrini, Giulio/AAW-6152-2021","Cattani, Luca/0000-0001-9171-6394; pedrini, giulio/0000-0002-4972-171X",,,,,58,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Using data both at sectoral and country level, we develop two counterfactual exercises to provide evidence on the effects of R&D tax relief on MNEs' inward R&D business investments (Inward BERD): a matching and a continuous-treatment econometric model. In this counterfactual perspective, we compare Countries with a tax incentive scheme for R&D and countries that do not have this kind of policy in action during the period 2000-2013. Results show that the effect of the R&D tax incentives on Inward BERD is positive, with an initial flat region and a steeper one starting at a dose around 40%, which corresponds to a tax incentive ratio on Total BERD of 6.8% (tax rate relief). The positive and statistically significant pattern starts however from a dose around 65% onwards, which corresponds to an 11.1% of tax relief. This result shows a relatively low sensitivity of Inward BERD to the R&D fiscal regime, except for the case of a high and thus costly incentive intensity.","[Cerulli, Giovanni; Poti, Bianca] CNR IRCrES, Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Res Sustainable Econ Growth, Via Taurini 19, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Spallone, Raffaele] CNR ISSiRFA, Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Study Regionalism Federalism & Self Govt, Via Taurini 19, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulla Crescita Economica Sostenibile (IRCRES-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Studi sui Sistemi Regionali Federali e sulle Autonomie Massimo Severo Giannini (ISSIRFA-CNR),"Cerulli, G (通讯作者)，CNR IRCrES, Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Res Sustainable Econ Growth, Via Taurini 19, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",giovanni.cerulli@ircres.cnr.it; bianca.poti@ircres.cnr.it; raffaele.spallone@gmail.com,,"CERULLI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-5892-3372",,,,,37,2,3,2,16,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We contribute to this agenda developing the first general equilibrium model designed to study how the geographic distribution of police protection affects the decision to pursue illegal activities, the intensity and location of crime, residential choices, housing prices, and the welfare of different socioeconomic groups. The target is to explore the positive and normative long-run effects of different ways of spatially allocating police forces in an urban area. We find that, when the police protect some neighborhoods (concentrated protection), the city becomes segregated, while when the police are evenly deployed across the city (dispersed protection), an integrated city emerges. Unequal societies face a difficult dilemma in that concentrated protection maximizes aggregate welfare but exacerbates social disparities. Taxes and subsidies can be employed to offset the disadvantages of police concentration. Private security makes an integrated city less likely to occur in equilibrium. Even under dispersed public protection, rich agents may use private security to endogenously isolate themselves in closed neighborhoods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In each period, the population of agents is randomly matched in groups of n members (each group faces a particular environment), with the top performing agents from each group being the winners of the prizes. Hence, the ratio determines the proportion of winning agents in each group. This ratio also describes the strength of competition in the group: the lower is, the higher the level of competition is. Our results show that type A eventually dominates the entire population with moderate competition, but type B survives in the long run for high levels of competition. Hence, we obtain that no matter how low the expected success rate of a type is, if the strength of competition is high enough those agents with the lowest expected success rate survive in the long run.","[Garcia-Martinez, Jose A.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Estudios Econ & Financieros, Alicante, Spain",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche,"García-Martínez, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Estudios Econ & Financieros, Alicante, Spain.",Jose.Garciam@umh.es,,"GARCIA-MARTINEZ, JOSE A./0000-0002-6195-0275",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [MTM2014-54199-P]; Junta de Andalucia [SEJ2011-8065],Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"I wish to express my gratitude to Fernando Vega-Redondo, Ascension Andina-Diaz, Carlos Alos-Ferrer, Ana Ania, Pablo Beker, Joseph Harrington, Francisco Marhuenda, Dilip Mookherjee, Frederic Palomino, and Giovanni Ponti for their helpful comments and suggestions.

This paper remedies that omission for the most recent fiscal consolidation attempt in the U.S.: the 2011-mandated budget sequestration spending cuts in discretionary spending slated to begin in 2013. The credibility of those cuts is assessed with a novel methodology that draws on the event study and Business Cycle Accounting traditions. The paper finds that the fiscal austerity program had little, if any, credibility around the time it was scheduled to become effective and that studies that don't take this lack of credibility into account might overestimate the quantitative impact of the budget sequestration on key macroeconomic variables by a factor of three or more. These findings expose the dangers of extrapolating policy lessons extracted from the budget sequestration experience to other fiscal stabilization programs, without gauging first their credibility. Properly adapted and extended, the methodology the paper developed with that purpose could prove useful for the systematic assessment of the credibility of other fiscal stabilization programs, of the impact of their credibility on aggregate outcomes and, ultimately, of the chances of those programs to successfully eliminate structural fiscal imbalances.

It is shown that the MCF equals one at the optimal tax system, for both lump-sum and distortionary taxes, for linear and nonlinear taxes, and for both income and consumption taxes. By allowing for redistributional concerns, the marginal excess burden of distortionary taxes is shown to be equal to the marginal distributional gain at the optimal tax system. Consequently, the modified Samuelson rule should not be corrected for the marginal cost of public funds. Outside the optimum, the marginal cost of public funds for distortionary taxes can be either smaller or larger than one.

However, little has been done using micro-level data to investigate whether information provision may trigger peer influence among firms that affects their compliance behavior. Using station-level inspection verification data from the Mexican gasoline market, this paper examines whether gas stations react to peers' performance to adjust their own compliance decisions. The information disclosure policy assigned each inspected gas station with green, yellow, or red colors to indicate the status of compliance, minor violation, and severe violation, respectively. We find strong evidence of peer influence triggered by information spillover. The probability of being in compliance increases as the number of green peers increases. We use both municipalities and postal codes as geographic boundaries to define potential peers, and find similar results. Our findings also suggest that the magnitude of peer effects varies across municipalities: the effects appear to be greater in wealthier, more educated communities.","[Liu, Xian] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Kirwan, Barrett] Univ Illinois, 1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Martens, Andrea] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Tianjin University of Finance & Economics; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; KU Leuven,"Liu, X (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",xliu@tjufe.edu.cn,"Liu, Xian/AAL-5186-2021; Liu, Xian/HTR-3574-2023","Kirwan, Barrett/0000-0003-1994-2789",,,,,54,6,6,5,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We use a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to capture the dependence structure between the considered market returns under different Bitcoin market conditions, while considering nuances of oil price movements, compared to gold. Our findings show that both Bitcoin and gold would serve the roles of a hedge, a safe haven and a diversifier for oil price movements. However, this property seems to be sensitive to the Bitcoin's and gold's different (bear, normal or bull) market conditions and to whether the oil price is in a downside, normal or upside regime. By controlling for new and relevant U.S. and global uncertainty indicators, we confirm that both Bitcoin and gold, but not oil, are assets where investors may park their cash during times of political and economic turmoil. The conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) approach to risk management is then conducted, providing robust evidence of the usefulness of each of the Bitcoin and gold in expanded oil portfolios, in terms of diversification opportunities and downside risk reductions.

According to ethnomusicological and civilization classifications, we classify countries into several groups and make novel variables that properly represent the cultural differences. We use the gravity model of trade proposed in Helpman et al. (The Quarterly Journal of Economics 123(2):441-487, 2008), which is utilized to avoid selection and endogeneity biases of estimation. In addition, we exploit an identifying assumption on the types of consumers, so that one of the cultural variables can satisfy the exclusion restriction in our two-stage estimation procedure. Our empirical hypothesis is that the trade volume of music is larger between two countries with greater cultural familiarity. The empirical results show that cultural differences have significant influences on the trading decision and volume of music traded in addition to the traditional determinants of trade. This finding supports our hypothesis that cultural familiarity promotes the cultural goods trade.","[Takara, Yuki] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Kita Ku, Kita9 Nishi7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan",Hokkaido University,"Takara, Y (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Kita Ku, Kita9 Nishi7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan.",yuki_takara@eis.hokudai.ac.jp,,"Takara, Yuki/0000-0001-7801-7177",,,,,28,10,10,7,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

To account for the endogeneity of unionization, we adopt an IV 2SLS model, a differences-in-differences technique, and Heckman's (1979) two-stage procedure. We also explore an exogenous proxy for employees' collective bargaining power. Using two samples, we find that after controlling for endogeneity, both industry- and firm-level unionization rates are significantly and negatively related to measures of information asymmetry among investors. The findings are consistent with the notion that labor unions or more broadly, employees with bargaining power, help reduce information asymmetry in capital markets.

I build a political agency model in which a vote-maximizing politician is subject to the oversight of distinct constituencies. The voters' demand for targeted spending in these constituencies is driven down by the competition among them. In order to make their constituency an attractive choice for discretionary spending, the voters adopt reelection standards below what they receive in equilibrium. They therefore tend to be satisfied with the distributive politics of the incumbent politician. The incumbent is then quite likely to win more than half of the votes.","[Zudenkova, Galina] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Zudenkova, G (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",galina.zudenkova@gmail.com,,"Zudenkova, Galina/0000-0002-0008-2427",German Science Foundation [SFB 884-C1]; Karin-Islinger-Stiftung foundation [0563.01],German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Karin-Islinger-Stiftung foundation,"I am indebted to four anonymous referees for their detailed and valuable comments and suggestions.

However, agents might be probabilistically prioritized ex-ante, for instance, through a non-uniform tie-breaking rule. This paper generalizes the deterministic setting by allowing priorities to be random. In this probabilistic environment, we first introduce a fairness notion called claimwise stability in the spirit of the usual stability of Gale and Shapley (1962). We show that the natural generalization of the deferred acceptance mechanism (Gale and Shapley, 1962), so called probabilistic deferred acceptance mechanism, is claimwise stable, but with the downside that it is stochastically dominated by another claimwise stable rule. We then introduce a new mechanism called the constrained probabilistic serial, which is built on the probabilistic serial mechanism of Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). It is both claimwise stable and constrained sd-efficient. The paper then systematically compares the probabilistic deferred acceptance and constrained probabilistic serial mechanisms in terms of their strategic and fairness properties.

A potential cause of this gender pay gap is discrimination, but, in this paper, we show there are other channels that contribute to such gap. Methodology: We implement a laboratory experiment with 404 individuals in which they play the ultimatum game and a wage bargaining game. The experiment contains three stages: an anonymous stage, a stage where we reveal the opponent's photograph, and a final face-to-face phase. We estimate gender differences in bargaining preferences. Results: First, we find no gender differences in the amount proposers send to respondents in both types of games. Second, gender matters in the bargaining process. When participants know their opponent's gender, women show solidarity to other women in terms of higher wage proposals. Third, women reject less offers than men, especially in the ultimatum game. Lastly, in the wage bargaining game, women counteroffer less than men, and men are more aggressive in terms of counteroffers against firms headed by women. Conclusions: Gender stereotyping can explain our results. Such stereotypes may define how each gender should behave in different social situations, or, for instance, how we perceive women in positions of power. Hence, results are relevant for public policies that enhance social norms related to gender equity.","[Arceo Gomez, Eva O.] Ctr Invest & Docencia Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Campos Vazquez, Raymundo M.; Medina Cortina, Eduardo M.] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Velez Grajales, Roberto] Ctr Estudios Espinosa Yglesias, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

The results cover (a) simultaneous price-change of multiple alternatives, (b) introduction/elimination of an option, (c) changes in choice-characteristics, and (d) choice among nonexclusive alternatives. In these cases, Marshallian consumer surplus becomes path-dependent, but Hicksian welfare remains well-defined. We demonstrate that under completely unrestricted preference-heterogeneity and income-effects, the distributions of Hicksian welfare are point-identified from structural choice-probabilities in scenarios (a), (b), and only set-identified in (c), (d). In program-evaluation contexts, our results enable the calculation of compensated-effects, that is, the program's cash-equivalent and resulting deadweight-loss. They also facilitate a theoretically justified cost-benefit comparison of interventions targeting different outcomes, for example, a tuition-subsidy and a health-product subsidy.

We develop a general equilibrium framework to understand better the dynamic absorption of remittances in a two-sector small open economy, by incorporating many of the stylized features of the informal sector. Calibrating the model to yield a long-run equilibrium consistent with sample averages for 56 developing countries for the period 1990-2014, we show that the effect of remittances depends critically on how they impinge on the recipient economy, i.e., whether these inflows are (i) permanent or temporary, (ii) associated with a collateral effect to securitize borrowing, and (iii) exogenous or countercyclical. We also identify the conditions under which remittances are associated with an expansion of the informal sector, as well as the Dutch Disease effect.","[Chatterjee, Santanu] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Turnovsky, Stephen J.] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Turnovsky, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",schatt@uga.edu; sturn@u.washington.edu,,,Van Voorhis endowment at the University of Washington; Terry-Sanford Research Award at the University of Georgia,Van Voorhis endowment at the University of Washington; Terry-Sanford Research Award at the University of Georgia,"We would like to thank Shatakshee Dhongde, Julio Garin, Thomas Lebesmuelbacher, Federico Mandelman, Felix Rioja, two anonymous referees, and the Editors, Doug Gollin and David Lagakos, for constructive comments that have improved the paper substantially.

Closely resembling actual US credit card law, we assume that card issuers can always deny their cardholders access to new debt, but that they cannot demand immediate repayment of the outstanding balance. Hereby, current debt can potentially soften a household's borrowing constraint in future periods, and thus provides extra liquidity. We show that for some intermediate values of liquid net worth it is indeed optimal for households to simultaneously hold positive gross debt and positive gross assets even though the interest rate on the debt is much higher than the return rate on the assets. Including a risk of being excluded from new borrowing which is positively correlated with unemployment, we are able to simultaneously explain a substantial share of the observed borrower-saver group and match a broad range of percentiles from the empirical distributions of credit card debt and liquid assets.","[Druedahl, Jeppe] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jorgensen, Casper Nordal] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jorgensen, Casper Nordal] Danmarks Nationalbank, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Druedahl, J (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",jeppe.druedahl@econ.ku.dk; casper.n.jorgensen@gmail.com,,"Druedahl, Jeppe/0000-0002-0462-8394",,,,,40,12,14,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The system, characterized by large pro-cyclical capital flows and chronic imbalances, is inherently unstable, and has contributed to repeated crises, recessions and geopolitical tensions. One potentially least-difficult line of reform would be to allow the evolution of a multi-currency system, underpinned by an expanded role for Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Attempts to promote wider use of the SDR have foundered on the liquidity premium. However, for Chinese corporations and institutions, at present restricted in their capital account activities, the SDR liquidity premium would appear less daunting. The Chinese authorities could provide policy encouragement for the use of SDRs by their institutions. This initiative, supported by China's Special Administrative Region Hong Kong, would kick-start an international SDR ecosystem, and encourage even broader use of SDRs, to the benefit of international monetary stability.","[Harrison, Matthew] Hong Kong Inst Int Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Geng] Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Xiao, G (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China.",matt-harrison@netvigator.com; xiaogeng@phbs.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,5,5,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2018,26.0,4,,,,,41,61,,10.1111/cwe.12248,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN3GV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000438893100003,0

We find that the Medicaid expansions significantly reduced the number of unpaid bills and the amount of debt sent to third-party collection agencies among those residing in zip codes with the highest share of low-income, uninsured individuals. Our estimates imply a reduction in collection balances of approximately $1140 among those who gain Medicaid coverage due to the ACA.

We show that the agent's optimal portfolio exhibits a trend chasing behavior and the portfolio share of the risky asset fluctuates between 0 and the value of an unconstrained individual; the fluctuations do not attenuate as time gets near the end of the planning horizon. We also explore implications of the model for asset pricing and show that the model has a potential to match better the recent US data than traditional habit models.

The results are evidence that manufacturers can encourage retail relationship-specific investments by providing downstream market power.

This lack of evidence mainly comes from the results of firm-level panel data analysis. This is important since this approach seems to be the most appropriate for estimating FDI spillovers. The paper takes a look at recent substantive and methodological developments in FDI spillover analysis, which have brought some more optimistic results with regard to FDI spillovers, and can help in further development in this field. The main substantive development relates to the introduction of a broad variety of sources of firm heterogeneity (foreign affiliates as well as local firms) in the analysis. Others include differentiation between vertical (inter-industry) and horizontal (intra-industry) spillovers, and host country absorptive capacity for knowledge spillovers. Methodological developments relate to distinguishing between technological/knowledge and productivity spillovers, improvement of modelling and estimation methods, and an increased amount and quality of data.","[Rojec, Matija] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Knell, Mark] NIFU Nord Inst Studies Innovat Res & Educ, Oslo, Norway",University of Ljubljana,"Rojec, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",matija.rojec@gov.si,"Knell, Mark/JXX-7956-2024",,,,,,181,54,54,5,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We follow Bec, Salem, and Collard's approach in order to specify an asymmetric reaction function suggesting that central banker interventions are influenced by business cycles. Our results reveal that the C.B.R.T. has asymmetric preferences. We find that the C.B.R.T. targets inflation stabilisation, both in recession and expansion periods. Moreover, the C.B.R.T. reacts more aggressively to any inflation gap during recessions than it does during expansions. On the other hand, the C.B.R.T. tries to smooth fluctuations in output, both during recessions and expansions.

The research was carried out on a sample of ten countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia), over the period 2004-2016. These countries were grouped by their stage of economic development, respectively: efficiency driven economies, in transition between efficiency and innovation and innovation driven economies. An econometric analysis on panel data was used, considering as a dependent variable the competitiveness of a country, quantified by the Global Competitiveness Index. As independent variables, we took into account a set of seven macroeconomic and business environment indicators which could have an impact on a country's competitiveness. The results obtained show important differences between countries, but also some resemblance. Although all the considered countries are emerging ones, the factors that have a significant influence on the competitiveness differ significantly. Thereby, if for efficiency-driven countries, G.D.P., inflation rate, trade, labour productivity and costs are important determinants of competitiveness, for innovation-driven countries the determinants of competitiveness are: G.D.P., inflation rate, tax rate, F.D.I., trade and costs. As regards the C.E.E. countries in transition only G.D.P., inflation rate and labour productivity are determinants of competitiveness.","[Rusu, Valentina Diana] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Interdisciplinary Res Social Sci & Humanitie, Iasi, Romania; [Roman, Angela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Finance Money & Publ Adm, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Rusu, VD (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Interdisciplinary Res Social Sci & Humanitie, Iasi, Romania.",valentinadiana.ig@gmail.com,"ROMAN, Angela/G-9223-2018; Rusu, Valentina/T-2252-2018","ROMAN, Angela/0000-0003-0402-7641;","'Alexandru Ioan Cuza' University of Iasi, within the Research Grants program, Grant UAIC [GI-UAIC-2017-02]","'Alexandru Ioan Cuza' University of Iasi, within the Research Grants program, Grant UAIC","This work was supported by a grant of the 'Alexandru Ioan Cuza' University of Iasi, within the Research Grants program, Grant UAIC, code GI-UAIC-2017-02 [grant number GI-UAIC-2017-02].",,36,43,45,7,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

So, besides the boundary equilibria where all players make the same choice, there are two further steady states where agents playing different strategies coexist and get identical payoffs. Such binary game can be interpreted as a club good game, in which players have to choose either joining or not the club in the presence of cost sharing, so that they can enjoy a good or a service provided that a participation threshold is reached. At the same time congestion occurs beyond a second higher threshold. These binary choice models, can be used (and indeed have been used in the literature) to represent several social and economic decisions, such as technology adoption, joining a commercial club, R&D investments, production delocalization, programs for environmental protection. Existence and stability of equilibrium points are studied, as well as the creation of more complex attractors (periodic or chaotic) related with overshooting effects. The study of some local and global dynamic properties of the evolutionary model proposed reveals that the presence of the participation threshold causes the creation of complex topological structures of the basins of coexisting attracting sets, so that a strong path dependence is observed. The dynamic effects of memory, both in the form of convex combination of a finite number of previous observation (moving average) and in the form of memory with increasing length and exponentially fading weights are investigated as well.

If it is rejected, both gain nothing. Common sense, business experience and theory suggest that the proposer would partition the sum so that the other party receives a minimal amount. However, experiments have shown that the offer is more equitable, and behavioralists explain this as altruism. In this paper, we reconcile these two conflicting conclusions by introducing multiple proposers and an important element that is present in most business situations: competition for gains among those proposing. We find that this element of competition restores the theoretical expectation of a purely monetary self-interest decision, and reduces the role for altruism. Our results suggest that while behavioral altruism/fairness considerations are dominant in isolated experiments, the competitiveness of business situations tends to marginalize these factors, and renders business decisions closer to the pure self-interest model.","[Caginalp, Gunduz] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Math, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Ho, Shirley J.] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; National Chengchi University,"Caginalp, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Math, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",caginalp@pitt.edu; sjho@nccu.edu.tw,,,Fullbright Foundation,Fullbright Foundation,"We would like to thank the anonymous referees and Editor, Prof. Sushanta Mallick for comments and suggestions on our paper.

This paper focuses on the effects of technology and market assumptions with projections out to 2050. A total of 15 models contributed projections based on a set of standardized scenarios. The scenarios include a range of assumptions about the price of natural gas, costs of end-use energy efficiency, retirements of nuclear power, the cost of renewable electricity, and overall electricity demand. The range of models and scenarios represent similarities and differences across a broad spectrum of analytical methods. One similarity across almost all results from all models and scenarios is that the share of electricity generation and capacity fueled by coal shrinks over time, although the rate at which coal capacity is retired depends on the price of natural gas and the amount of electricity that is demanded. Another similarity is that the models project average increases in natural gas power generating capacity in every scenario over the 2020-2050 period, but at lower average annual rates than those that prevailed during the 2000-2015 period. The projections also include higher gas capacity utilization rates in the 2035-2050 period compared to the 2020-2050 period in every scenario, except the high gas price sensitivity. Renewables capacity is also projected to increase in every scenario, although the annual new capacity varies from modest rates below the observed 2000-2015 wind and solar average to rates more than 3 times that high. Model estimates of CO2 emissions largely follow from the trends in generation. Low renewables cost and low gas prices both result in lower overall CO2 emission rates relative to the 2020-2035 and 2035-2050 reference. Both limited nudear lifetimes and higher demand result in increased CO2 emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The lecturer moves first, choosing the student's level of access to online class materials, from zero to 100%. The student observes the lecturer's choice, and then chooses whether to attend or skip class. The student has a valuable outside option during class time, but she also values learning. Out-of-class learning cannot perfectly substitute in-class learning. The student's decision depends on her outside option and the level of access to online materials chosen by the lecturer. For extreme parameter values, the student's optimal action does not depend on the lecturer's choice; in these cases there is full access to online materials, as the lecturer anticipates the student's choice. If parameters lie in a range where the lecturer's action may influence the student, then the lecturer provides the maximum level of access to online materials that still incentivizes the student to attend class.

One explanation identified in the literature is fiscal decentralization and resulting competition for mobile capital among localities. We elaborate on this explanation for the Chinese context by developing a model of local public infrastructure investment with land financing. We show that public infrastructure investment increases when local governments are able to capture returns from investment in land improvement. We further find that the polarization effect associated with fiscal decentralization by Cai and Treisman (2005) can be exacerbated when local governments are able to capture the returns from land improvement. Finally, we note that while land financing can provide a stimulus for local development, this may come at the expense of a diminished share of spending on social welfare programs and other public consumption goods.

At the theoretical level it has been argued that FDI is growth enhancing. However, existing empirical studies have left researchers and policy makers perplexed as these studies do not appear to find a strong relationship between the two variables. This paper departs from the existing literature by exploring the transmission channels from FDI to growth. The results, based on a sample of developed and developing countries over the period 1970-2007, conclusively reveal that FDI affects growth via inputs accumulation but not the total factor productivity growth channel. In other words, our results suggest that factors other than FDI may have contributed to the increase in productivity witnessed in developing countries in recent decades.","[Makiela, Kamil] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland; [Ouattara, Bazoumana] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, 1st Floor Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Cracow University of Economics; University of Manchester,"Ouattara, B (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, 1st Floor Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",osman.ouattara-2@manchester.ac.uk,"Makieła, Kamil/T-5786-2018","Makieła, Kamil/0000-0003-1236-2423",,,,,57,57,60,0,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

For the integrated European procurement of balancing reserves, the European Commission proposes a multi-attributive auction mechanism which is very similar to the current German auction. The key difference, however, is a switch from pay-as-bid to uniform pricing. We develop a game-theoretical model of the current German and the future European balancing market design. Both market designs have desirable economic properties in their one-shot version, i.e., an efficient auction outcome and competitive prices. We show that a switch to uniform pricing does not induce bidders to report their true costs in their bids, but leads to underbidding. We contrast the equilibrium outcomes with German market data and find a substantial discrepancy, i.e., non-competitive prices. We provide a game-theoretical grounded explanation that is based on the regular repetition of the auction combined with the invariant supplier side. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Extreme increases in pollution, in particular, may have lethal implications for human beings, and, indeed, all living organisms. This paper thus devises a new model of economic growth that takes into account these lethal effects of accumulated pollution via a pollution threshold to show two key results. First, if an abatement technology is relatively inefficient, there exists a stationary steady state in which consumption and pollution stop growing. Second, if the abatement technology is sufficiently efficient, there exists a path along which pollution decreases at an accelerating rate until it finally reaches zero.

The model generates endogenous booms and busts along credit cycles. As feed back loops on aggregate demand affect the goods and the labor markets, the real and the financial sides of the economy are closely interconnected. The baseline scenario is able to qualitatively reproduce a wide range of stylized facts. We show that a monetary policy rule that targets the movements in the net worth of firms significantly dampens the credit cycles and reduces the employment costs of financial crises, because this indicator incorporates early signals of financial imbalances. Performances of this three-mandate Taylor rule are also more robust to the specific parameter values and regulatory framework than the standard dual-mandate Taylor rules. Nonetheless, none of the policy rules under study completely eliminates the high employment costs of financial crises. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Eight of the models in the study reported outputs sufficient to estimate damage from CO2, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and methane, and three of those eight reported outputs sufficient to calculate consumer surplus, supplier profit, government revenue, and therefore total social surplus. Over approximately thirty years, the four CO2 tax policies reduce emissions enough to reduce estimated CO2 damage by $1 to $1.5 trillion, SO2 damage by $1 to $1.3 trillion, and NOx and methane damage by smaller amounts, based on averaging the results from the relevant models. The estimated non-environmental social surplus cost of each of these policies is between 23% and 29% of its environmental benefit. The CO2 cap-and-trade scenario, modeled after the Clean Power Plan, reduces estimated CO2 damage and other emission damage each by $0.4 trillion, at a non environmental social surplus cost estimated to be 17% of the environmental benefit. Changing the natural gas price changes SO2 damage more than twice as much as it changes CO2 damage. Estimated methane emissions move in the same direction as CO2 emissions in every scenario other than the low natural gas price scenario, in which the methane increase counteracts an estimated 27% of the benefit from the CO2 reduction but only 5% of the total net benefit. In addition, the paper explains the set of assumptions and methods used to estimate environmental damage, and briefly explains how the non-environmental parts of total social surplus can sometimes be computed from more common results if necessary.

Furthermore, we also nowcast the unemployment rate by using dynamic factor models (DFMs). Our results indicate that most of the sophisticated forecast combination methods have better predictive accuracy than the simple forecast combinations, especially in higher forecast horizons, which constitutes a case for the nowcast combination puzzle. Furthermore, most of bridge equations with the advanced forecast combination schemes usually outperform DFMs which are assumed to be superior to the bridge equations. This latter result indicates that bridge equations augmented by advanced forecast combination schemes may be a viable alternative to the DFM. Finally, we show that real and labor variables play the most important role for nowcasting the Turkish unemployment rate, whereas financial variables and surveys do not seem to be beneficial. Overall, our results indicate that advanced combination schemes can increase the performance of nowcasting models.","[Soybilgen, Baris; Yazgan, Ege] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Bilgi University,"Yazgan, E (通讯作者)，Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",baris.soybilgen@bilgi.edu.tr; ege.yazgan@bilgi.edu.tr,"Yazgan, Ege/GPG-1135-2022",,,,,,51,3,4,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Furthermore, we use the industry-specific real effective exchange rate data developed by to allow for different movements of real effective exchange rates across industries. It is found that financial constraints have a significant influence on Japanese exports in response to exchange rate shocks. Japanese exporters with either lower internal financial constraints or external financial constraints are less affected by the yen's appreciation. In addition, if firms face high external financial constraints, only reducing the internal financial constraints cannot help them mitigate the impact of the yen's appreciation on their exports. Thus, an accommodative financial environment also plays an important role in alleviating the impact that the yen's appreciation has on Japanese exports.","[Zhang, Shajuan] Toyo Univ, Fac Business Adm, Bunkyo Ku, 5-28-20 Hakusan, Tokyo 1128606, Japan",Toyo University,"Zhang, SJ (通讯作者)，Toyo Univ, Fac Business Adm, Bunkyo Ku, 5-28-20 Hakusan, Tokyo 1128606, Japan.",zhang085@toyo.jp,,,JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) [24330101]; Yokohama National University,"JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Yokohama National University","The author is grateful for helpful comments and suggestions by Kiyotaka Sato, Eiji Ogawa, Junko Shimizu, Kentaro Kawasaki, Taiyo Yoshimi, Willem Thorbecke, Qiyuan Xu, Jianwei Xu, Xiaoqin Li, and conference and workshop participants.

There are two major methodological paradigms in this literature: stated effort and real effort. In the stated-effort paradigm the researcher uses an effort function that maps choices to outcomes. In the real-effort paradigm, participants work on a task, and outcomes depend on their performance. The advantage of the stated-effort design is the control the researcher has over the cost of effort, which is particularly useful when testing theory. The advantage of the real-effort design is that it may be a better match to the field environment, particularly with respect to psychological aspects that affect behavior. An open question in the literature is the degree to which the results obtained by the two paradigms differ, and if they do, why. We present a review of methods used and discuss the results obtained from using these different approaches, and issues to consider when choosing and implementing a task. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Agents are organized in a social network and repeatedly update their beliefs based on coarse messages about their neighbors' beliefs. We show that agents do not reach a consensus; instead, their beliefs keep fluctuating forever if different languages are present in their neighborhoods. In particular, we recover the classical result that under persuasion bias agents typically reach a consensus if there is a unique language in society, while small perturbations lead to fluctuations. Our approach provides and formalizes a possible mechanism to account for theories according to which storytelling may generate excessive confidence swings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

By applying the structural vector auto regression (SVAR) methodology to the data of 301 logistics service providers (LSPs) from 2004 to 2014, based on annual and half-yearly report data (in total 6020 firm-years), it is shown that oil price changes are absorbed in a variety of ways by different types of companies. Fluctuations in oil prices negatively affect the transportation industry - with minor restrictions in asset-light clusters and companies which consume little to no oil. Our analysis also shows that oil price shocks result in effects of different magnitude and length with respect to the type of LSP. Thus, some LSP clusters adapt quicker to oil price changes titan others and are better able to absorb price shocks.

An endogenous mass of landlords and tenants is active in the search market. While the mass of entering tenants is exogenous, the mass of entering landlords is endogenously determined by the rate at which apartments become vacant. Brokerage fees paid by tenants are used as a device to screen short term and long term tenants. We analyze a policy that requires fees to be paid by landlords. Such a policy decreases efficiency by preventing efficient screening, but also increases turnover and hence efficiency in the search market.

The effects of technology shocks are transmitted internationally through the dynamics of the interest rate. Specifically, the borrowing mechanism brings about a wedge between the real interest rate and the expected marginal product of capital, such that interest rates fall following positive technology shocks. A lower interest rate induces more investment by Foreign firms, which in turn contribute to greater synchronization of economic activities across countries.

Our analysis is conducted through the news mechanism that is unrelated to fundamentals. This research contributes to the literature on the effect of oil prices on news-based uncertainty by studying the dynamics, in both the time and frequency domains, using the wavelet coherence analysis. Our results illustrate that oil prices exhibit a statistically and economically significant leading role on NVIX, especially in the long run. Further, we distinguish the different impacts of oil shocks and find that the oil supply and aggregate demand shocks usually play a leading role on relatively long-term NVIX while the oil specific demand shocks are sensitive to the fluctuations of NVIX. We also find that the rules of comovement between oil prices (oil shocks) and news-based uncertainty change at different frequencies and times. They usually move together in opposite directions with the exception of the oil supply shocks and NVIX. These findings apply to both oil spot and futures markets. Our results present new and interesting implications for investors and policy makers by supporting the news reallocation channel as an important transmission mechanism from oil markets.

The idea relies on an assumption that linearization offers a good approximation: we share this assumption with existing linearization methods. However, unlike those methods, the approach here does not rely on direct derivation of first-order Taylor terms. It also does not use recursive methods, whereby aggregates and prices would be expressed as linear functions of the state, usually a very high-dimensional object (such as the wealth distribution). Rather, we rely merely on solving nonlinearly for a deterministic transition path: we study the equilibrium response to a single, small MIT shock carefully. We then regard this impulse response path as a numerical derivative in sequence space and hence provide our linearized solution directly using this path. The method can easily be extended to the case of many shocks and computation time rises linearly in the number of shocks. We also propose a set of checks on whether linearization is a good approximation. We assert that our method is the simplest and most transparent linearization technique among currently known methods. The key numerical tool required to implement it is value-function iteration, using a very limited set of state variables.

The model generates nonlinearities and multiple growth trajectories, determined by countries' structural characteristics and policy parameters. Developing economies that are able to activate and support synergies among their main growth engines can achieve a faster catch up process and more sustained income per capita level in the long-run than countries characterized by weak co-evolutionary dynamics.","[Castellacci, Fulvio] Univ Oslo, TIK Ctr, Postboks 1108, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Castellacci, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, TIK Ctr, Postboks 1108, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",fulvio.castellacci@tik.uio.no,,,,,,,42,25,27,5,46,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We use a novel approach based on a model of occupational choice that delivers a gravity equation linking worker flows to occupation characteristics and transition costs. Using data from the Current Population Survey and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles we find that task-specific costs account for no more than 15% of the total transition cost across most occupation pairs. Transition costs vary widely across occupations and, while increasing with the dissimilarity in the mix of tasks performed, are mostly accounted for by task-independent occupation-specific factors. The fraction of transition costs that can be attributed to task-related variables appears fairly stable over the 1994-2013 period.","[Cortes, Guido Matias] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Gallipoli, Giovanni] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Manchester; University of British Columbia,"Cortes, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",matias.cortes@manchester.ac.uk; gallipol@mail.ubc.ca,,"Gallipoli, Giovanni/0000-0002-4441-4964",Canadian Labour Market and Skills Researcher Network (CLSRN); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC),Canadian Labour Market and Skills Researcher Network (CLSRN); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Financial support from the Canadian Labour Market and Skills Researcher Network (CLSRN) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) is gratefully acknowledged.

Keynes began to trade in the US stock market on a regular basis in late 1931, when it was still very hard to tell when full recovery could be expected. In 1930, he had publicly rebutted the view of his business partner Oswald Falk, whose advice to investors was to abandon British manufacture and buy American shares. Until 1933, Keynes's outlook on the USA remained negative. Only in February 1934 did Keynes become optimistic about the USA on account of his growing confidence in the New Deal, which however was short-lived. In 1937 he was shaken by the US recession and disillusioned by Roosevelt's fiscal policies and reforms. In this paper we first trace the evolution of Keynes's opinions on the US economy and his view on the US stock market. There are direct references to Wall Street and specific examples relating to its working that are contained, in particular, in Chapter 12 of the General Theory. We then go on to follow the timeline of his investments by sectors, focusing on the companies that Keynes held onto for a longer period, looking for a pattern in his investment behaviour in the US market between 1931 and 1939, before the War changed the personal and institutional circumstances of his investment activity. We offer also a comparison of Keynes's own portfolio with his investments on behalf of King's (as reconstructed by Chambers and Kabiri, Bus Hist Rev 90(Summer):301-328, 2016) and conclude with an assessment of the influence of his theoretical approach on his investment activity.","[Cristiano, Carlo] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Giurisprudenza, Via Coll Ricci 10, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Stat, Viale Regina Elena 295, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Sanfilippo, Eleonora] Univ Cassino & Lazio Merid, Dipartmento Econ & Giurisprudenza, Via S Angelo, I-03043 Cassino, Italy",University of Pisa; Sapienza University Rome; University of Cassino,"Marcuzzo, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Stat, Viale Regina Elena 295, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",carlo.cristiano@unipi.it; cristina.marcuzzo@uniroma1.it; e.sanfilippo@unicas.it,"Cristiano, Carlo/JDM-4376-2023; Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina/AAK-8514-2020","Cristiano, Carlo/0000-0002-8657-6187; Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-4768-8872",,,,,34,7,7,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

In this paper we argue that a functional perspective on financial intermediation can be usefully employed to investigate the functioning of financial networks. We do this in two steps. First, we use previously unreleased data to show that focusing on the economic functions performed over time by the different institutions exchanging funds in an interbank market can be informative, even if the underlying topological structure of their relations remains constant. Second, a set of alternative artificial histories are generated and stress-tested by using real data as a calibration base, with the aim of performing counterfactual welfare comparisons among different topological structures.","[Gaffeo, Edoardo] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38100 Trento, Italy; [Molinari, Massimo] Bank Italy, Market Operat Directorate, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy",University of Trento; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Molinari, M (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Market Operat Directorate, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",edoardo.gaffeo@unitn.it; massimo.molinari@bancaditalia.it,,"MOLINARI, MASSIMO/0000-0001-8635-5053",Fondazione Caritro; Sapienza University of Rome [278/2016],Fondazione Caritro(Fondazione Caritro); Sapienza University of Rome,"This version of the paper has greatly benefited from the very constructive comments of two anonymous referees.

We find that imposing a pollution tax causes substantial reductions in employment in the regulated (polluting) industry, but this is offset by increased employment in the unregulated (nonpolluting) sector. As a result, while the policy causes a substantial shift in employment between industries, the net effect on overall employment (and unemployment) is small, even in the short run. An environmental performance standard causes a substantially smaller sectoral shift in employment than the emissions tax, with roughly similar net effects. Thus, policymakers who want to minimize sectoral shifts in employment might prefer performance standards over environmental taxes. The effects on the unregulated industry suggest that empirical studies of environmental regulation that focus only on regulated firms can be misleading, significantly overstating the net employment effects (and those that use nonregulated firms as controls for regulated firms will be even more misleading, overstating both the net effects and effects on the regulated industry). This implies that overall effects on employment are less of an issue for environmental policy than the empirical literature might suggest.","[Hafstead, Marc A.

However, the empirical assessment of their relative relevance seems still insufficient. Therefore we investigate the determinants of lending rates using bank-level panel data by including all the above factors in empirical analysis of the interest rate pass-through. In particular, to better capture a relative increase in banks' funding costs we calculate a weighted average cost of liabilities and use it instead of a money market interest rate in testing how banks set lending rates. In contrast to the money market rate - usually employed in interest rate transmission analyses - the weighted average cost of liabilities comprises interest rates on many sources of banks' funding and is sensitive to changes in structure of banks' liabilities. Our findings imply that money market interest rates may not be a sufficiently good proxy for banks' funding costs, especially in the periods of increased financial stress and for analyses of the transmission of negative interest rates. In this way the paper offers a new analytical perspective on analyzing monetary transmission mechanism in the banking sector.","[Kapuscinski, Mariusz; Stanislawska, Ewa] Narodowy Bank Polski, Ul Swietokrzyska 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland; [Kapuscinski, Mariusz] Warsaw Sch Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; Warsaw School of Economics,"Stanislawska, E (通讯作者)，Narodowy Bank Polski, Ul Swietokrzyska 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland.",Mariusz.Kapuscinski@nbp.pl; Ewa.Stanislawska@nbp.pl,,"Stanislawska, Ewa/0000-0003-1587-2963; Kapuscinski, Mariusz/0009-0008-7245-8463",,,,,40,6,6,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Financial depth is defined within the model as the ease with which investors can issue equity in the market on new units of capital. I assume that agents differ in the cost of undertaking investment projects and that there is a fixed distribution of such costs across the population. I theoretically identify channels through which financial depth influences growth, both positively and negatively. When considering a specific distribution of costs, I show that the net effect of financial depth on growth is non-monotonic. It depends on the shape of the distribution, as well as the level or stage of financial depth. The results of this paper help to rationalize some findings in the recent empirical literature on the non-monotonic effect of financial depth on long-run growth. The model is even capable of obtaining a negative effect of excessive financial depth on growth, a result that is also found in the empirical literature.","[Salas, Sergio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Negocios & Econ, Ave Brasil 2830,Piso 9, Valparaiso, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso,"Salas, S (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Negocios & Econ, Ave Brasil 2830,Piso 9, Valparaiso, Chile.",sergiosalaslan@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,9,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Households choose where to live and how much to invest in their child's human capital. The return on parents' investment is determined in part by their child's ability and in part by a neighborhood externality. We calibrate the model using data from Chicago in 1960, assuming that in previous decades households were randomly allocated to, and then could not move from, neighborhoods with different total factor productivity (TFP). This restriction on neighborhood choice allows us to overcome the fundamental problem of endogenous neighborhood selection. We use the calibrated model to study Wilson's (1987) hypothesis that racial equality under the law need not ensure equality of opportunity due to neighborhood dynamics.

These effects offset so that there is no gender gap in the probability of graduating in one's initial major choice.

While some cross-country studies exist, there is lack of country specific studies that take into account the different characteristics of low-income economies. This paper contributes to the growing literature by considering the case of Malawi and the macroeconomic impact of price shocks in its major export crop of tobacco. Using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) approach on quarterly Malawian data from 1980:1 to 2012:4, the paper establishes that a positive tobacco price shock has a significant positive impact on the country's gross domestic product, decreasing consumer prices and inducing real exchange rate appreciation. The results are robust to alternative specifications of a SVAR on difference stationary data and cointegrating VAR. The cointegrating VAR confirms the existence of a long run-relationship among the variables and causality that runs from tobacco prices.","[Bangara, Bertha Chipo; Dunne, John Paul] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Bangara, BC (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",berthabangara@gmail.com,"Dunne, John Paul/K-9455-2019","Dunne, John Paul/0000-0001-6150-7663",Carnegie Corporation; African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),Carnegie Corporation; African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"I would like to acknowledged Carnegie Corporation which sponsored the last part of my PhD and are sponsoring my Postdoctorate Research Fellowship, the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) which offered me a PhD scholarship and Dr. Amos C.

We find that the possibility of gains for the second mover (generosity) and the risk of losses for the first mover (vulnerability) are important drivers for second mover behavior. On the other hand, efficiency concerns and an aversion against violating trust seem to be far less important motivations. We also find that second movers compare the actual choice of the first mover and the alternative choices that would have been available to him to allocations that involve equal material payoffs.","[Engler, Yola; Page, Lionel] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kerschbamer, Rudolf] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, Innsbruck, Austria",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Innsbruck,"Page, L (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",yolaengler@gmail.com; rudolf.kerschbamer@uibk.ac.at; lionel.page@qut.edu.au,,"Page, Lionel/0000-0002-6020-9733; Kerschbamer, Rudolf/0000-0002-7666-7157",,,,,31,2,2,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

We show that, with current labor market characteristics, the target set by governments seems compatible with the social surplus maximization objective for some countries, while being too high for other countries. For all countries, maximizing employment would imply higher educational spending than that required for the social surplus to reach its maximum.","[Lebon, Isabelle] Univ Caen Normandie, CREM, CNRS, Dept Econ, F-14000 Caen, France; [Rebiere, Therese] CNAM, LIRSA, 40 Rue Jeuneurs,Case EPN09J, F-75002 Paris, France; [Rebiere, Therese] IZA, Dept Econ, 40 Rue Jeuneurs,Case EPN09J, F-75002 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Caen Normandie; heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM),"Rebière, T (通讯作者)，CNAM, LIRSA, 40 Rue Jeuneurs,Case EPN09J, F-75002 Paris, France.;Rebière, T (通讯作者)，IZA, Dept Econ, 40 Rue Jeuneurs,Case EPN09J, F-75002 Paris, France.",isabelle.lebon@unicaen.fr; therese.rebiere@lecnam.net,,"lebon, isabelle/0000-0003-4516-6736",,,,,18,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

Regardless of how backward it might have seemed, this region of the continent gradually found its voice owing to the process of translation/naturalization that, by making what came from the outside appear to be a native product, made these exemplary accomplishments exportable, all the way to China.

These claims are examined by estimating a reduced form price model to assess the impact that major retailer market concentration, station density, brand effects and other variables may have on prices. Employing data from the New South Wales government's mandatory FuelCheck reporting system, higher degrees of market concentration and lower station density in regional centres are found to impact prices positively. These findings are robust across data types including: individual station level retail prices, regional averages, retailer margins and alternative Australian Competition and Consumer Commission data. The negative price impacts of introducing an additional non-major retailer are estimated for individual regional centres and on average range from one half to one and half cents per litre depending on fuel type. These estimates appear to be small which, in part, may be the consequence of the sample focus on regional centres only and the introduction of FuelCheck and its objective to improve price transparency in the market.

Accounting for intermediates: Production sharing and trade in value added. Journal of International Economics, 86(2), 224-236), and some studies report that 20-25% of CO2 emissions can be attributed to international trade [Peters, G, J Minx, C Weber and O Edenhofer (2011).

China's interregional spillover of carbon emissions and domestic supply chains. Energy Policy, 61, 1305-1321.], adopts the perspective of demand spillovers to provide new insights regarding the position of Chinese domestic-regions' production in Global Value Chains (GVCs) and their associated CO2 emissions. To this end, we employed a new type of World Input-Output Database (WIOD) in which China's domestic interregional input-output table for 2007 is endogenously embedded. The pattern of China's regional demand spillovers across both domestic regions and countries is revealed by employing this new database. These results were then connected to endowments theory, which helps to make sense of the empirical results. It is found that China's regions are located relatively upstream in GVCs, and had CO2 emissions in net exports, which were entirely predicted by the environmental extended Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) model. Our study points to micro policy instruments to combat climate change: for example, tax reform for energy inputs that helps to change the production pattern, which then has an impact on trade patterns and so forth.","[Pei, Jiansuo; Wang, Fei; Zhao, Zhongxiu] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Meng, Bo] IDE JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Xue, Jinjun] Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",University of International Business & Economics; Nagoya University,"Meng, B (通讯作者)，IDE JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",jspei@amss.ac.cn; bo_meng@ide.go.jp; wangfei64@hotmail.com; setsu@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp; zhxzha@uibe.edu.cn,"Meng, Bo/AAP-5042-2020","Meng, Bo/0000-0003-1179-5390; Pei, Jiansuo/0000-0003-4360-8705","CIDEG/Tsinghua Univ.-IDE/JETRO-USITC-IGLCE/Nagoya Univ. joint research project: Tracing China's CO2 emissions in Global Value Chains; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41205105]; Program for Young Excellent Talents, UIBE [2013YQ01]; 2015 Visiting Scholarship Program of Economic Research Center of Nagoya University","CIDEG/Tsinghua Univ.-IDE/JETRO-USITC-IGLCE/Nagoya Univ. joint research project: Tracing China's CO2 emissions in Global Value Chains; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Young Excellent Talents, UIBE; 2015 Visiting Scholarship Program of Economic Research Center of Nagoya University","We would like to thank the two Referees for their valuable comments on the content of our manuscript and their suggestions for improving the document.

Despite the fact that labour market instruments dedicated to young people represent a wide range of possibilities for supporting them in combating professional and educational inactivity, the background of their problems requires new actions that should be undertaken by labour market institutions and their partners. Purpose of the article: Taking the above into consideration, the aim of this study is to identify the challenges faced by the public employment services and other labour market institutions in the area of activating youth experiencing the most difficult situation in the labour market. Methods: The article is based partly on the results of quantitative and qualitative research, conducted in the framework of the project implemented by the Provincial Labour Office in Bialystok Podlasie open to young people, financed by Operational Programme Knowledge Education Development (PO WER). Findings & Value added: The results of the study have led to the identification of necessary actions which should be undertaken by labour market institutions to support young people representing the NEET generation. These actions can be classified into different categories. They include preventing inclusion into the NEET group, developing the most effective solutions in the area of getting in touch with this group of young people and supporting them as well as creating a culture of cooperation for their benefit. The study has also revealed the need to carry out in-depth research of the NEET population.","[Saczynska-Sokol, Sylwia] Bialystok Tech Univ, Ul Wiejska 45a, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Saczynska-Sokól, S (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Ul Wiejska 45a, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",s.saczynska@pb.edu.pl,,,MNiSW funds for science; [S/WZ/3/2015],MNiSW funds for science;,"The research conducted within the work No S/WZ/3/2015 and financed by the MNiSW funds for science.

The estimation results show that: (i) spatial spillover effects play a role in provincial carbon emissions in China; and (ii) the sum of technical effect and structure effect of financial development surpass its' sum of direct effect and wealth effect in China, which suggests that financial development reduces carbon emissions per capita.

I leverage a policy change affecting the location and timing of charter entry to account for endogenous charter competition. TPSDs respond to competition by allocating resources away from instructional and other expenditures toward new capital construction. Using teacher contracts, I show that collectively bargained salaries are largely unresponsive to competition and that declines in instructional spending are primarily due to decreases in the number of employed teachers. Competition depresses appraised housing valuations, in turn causing TPSDs to lose property tax revenues resulting in a decline in overall spending.","[Cook, Jason B.] Univ Pittsburgh, 4932 Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Cook, Jason B.] Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Herluf Trolles Gade 11, DK-1052 Copenhagen, Denmark",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Cook, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, 4932 Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",jbc50@pitt.edu,,,National Academy of Education/Spencer Dissertation Fellowship Program,National Academy of Education/Spencer Dissertation Fellowship Program,"I am grateful to Francine Blau, Michael Lovenheim, and Jordan Matsudaira for careful advising.

A prosumer has a grid-connected decentralized production unit and makes two types of exchanges with the grid: energy imports when the local production is insufficient to match the local consumption and energy exports when local production exceeds it. There exists two systems to measure the exchanges: a net metering system that uses a single meter to measure the balance between exports and imports and a net purchasing system that uses two meters to measure separately power exports and imports. Both systems are currently used for residential consumption. We build a model to compare the two metering systems. Under net metering, the price of exports paid to prosumers is implicitly set at the price of the electricity that they import. We show that net metering leads to (1) too many prosumers, (2) a decrease in the bills of prosumers, compensated via a higher bill for traditional consumers, and (3) a lack of incentives to synchronize local production and consumption.","[Gautier, Axel; Jacqmin, Julien] Univ Liege, LCII, HEC Liege, Liege, Belgium; [Gautier, Axel] UCL, CORE, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Gautier, Axel] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Poudou, Jean-Christophe] Univ Montpellier, MUSE, MRE, Montpellier, France; [Poudou, Jean-Christophe] Univ Montpellier, LabEx Entreprendre, Montpellier, France",University of Liege; Universite Catholique Louvain; Ifo Institut; Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier,"Gautier, A (通讯作者)，Univ Liege, LCII, HEC Liege, Liege, Belgium.;Gautier, A (通讯作者)，UCL, CORE, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Gautier, A (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",agautier@uliege.be; julien.jacqmin@uliege.be; jean-christophe.poudou@umontpellier.fr,"Gautier, Axel/AAM-4182-2020","Gautier, Axel/0000-0001-7700-3814; Jean-Christophe, Poudou/0000-0001-9182-1979",FNRS; Walloon Region (Grant TECR),FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Walloon Region (Grant TECR),"The authors thank the FNRS and the Walloon Region (Grant TECR) for its financial support.

Finally, the paper examines how to interpret the legality of central bank mandates, and whether or not central banks have exceeded their powers.

Actively developing new energy has become a fundamental means to solve the dilemma between environmental pollution and energy consumption growth. Thus, more scholars have conducted a wide range of studies on the new energy industry. However, most of the existing studies use traditional linear models to investigate the relationships between new energy industry and its driving forces, ignoring the objective reality that there are many nonlinear relationships in economic variables. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing research, this paper uses a data-driven nonparametric additive regression model to study the new energy industry. The results show that the nonlinear effect of agricultural development shows an inverted U-shaped pattern due to the changes in crop acreage at different stages of development. The nonlinear impact of foreign energy dependence also indicates an inverted U-shaped pattern. However, technological progress produces a positive U-shaped nonlinear impact on the new energy industry because of the difference in R&D funding and R&D personnel investments. Similarly, the impact of energy consumption structure also shows a positive U-shaped pattern, owing to the gradual decline in coal consumption. Therefore, the government should develop differentiated policies at different stages, in order to effectively promote the development of new energy industries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A relationship between exchange rate regimes and economic growth has been identified through statistical approaches. The results indicated that as compared to flexible exchange regime, growth rate was higher by 1.2% when fixed exchange regime was adopted; and a growth rate of 0.64% was achieved under the intermediate regime when compared with the flexible regime. A positive impact has been identified in exchange rate regimes upon economic growth of the developing countries.

In this paper, we provide a brief survey of the relationship between international trade and finance, a field that only recently has been the subject of systematic analysis in the economic literature, from both a theoretical and empirical point of view. In general, barriers to external financing play a significant role as an obstacle to the exporting activity of firms, especially for younger and smaller firms; and these results would have been reinforced by the global financial crisis.","[Bajo-Rubio, Oscar] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Berke, Burcu] Nigde Omer Halisdemir Univ, Nigde, Turkey",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Nigde Omer Halisdemir University,"Bajo-Rubio, O (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain.",oscar.bajo@uclm.es; burcuberke@ohu.edu.tr,"Berke, Burcu/A-4308-2016",,"Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [ECO2016-78422-R]","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","This paper has benefited from the comments of three anonymous referees.

Production volumes are substantial, they are traded at high frequency and the quality of the product is relatively homogeneous. Unlike other commodities and the top-end wines (which represent only 3% of the traded volume), there is no futures market for generic Bordeaux wine. Reliable forecasts of prices can to large extent replace this information deficiency and improve the functioning of the market. We use state-space methods with monthly data to obtain a univariate forecasting model for the average price. The estimates highlight the stochastic trend and the seasonality present in the evolution of the price over the period 1999 to 2016. The model predicts the path of wine prices out of sample reasonably well, suggesting that this approach is useful for making reasonably accurate forecasts of future price movements.","[Bazen, Stephen] Aix Marseille Univ AMSE, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Bazen, Stephen] Aix Marseille Univ AMSE, EHESS, Marseille, France; [Cardebat, Jean-Marie] Univ Bordeaux, LAREFI, Bordeaux, France; [Cardebat, Jean-Marie] INSEEC, Bordeaux, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite de Bordeaux; Groupe Inseec,"Cardebat, JM (通讯作者)，Ave Leon Duguit, F-33600 Pessac, France.",jean-marie.cardebat@u-bordeaux.fr,"Cardebat, Jean-Marie/JED-5290-2023",,,,,,30,10,10,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show that, in such an environment, the decentralisation of policy responsibilities for the regulation of banks can achieve the first-best allocation and ensure financial stability. While national governments design banking regulations, the federal policy maker authorises inter-regional income redistribution payments throughout the federation.

The obtained results allow us to identify countries with similar financial situations for elderly households in 2007, 2010 and 2013, and changes in clusters and ranking over the analysed period.

Household-level data are used to derive a measure of expected and unexpected changes in house prices; these are then incorporated into a recursive bivariate probit model of the decision to withdraw housing equity and save. The results suggest that households respond to changes in their housing wealth primarily by increasing their mortgage borrowing, rather than by decreasing their savings, although this is mainly for younger households. However, while changes in housing wealth do not have a direct impact on household saving, they do have an important indirect impact, since they increase the likelihood that the household will withdraw equity, which in turn has a negative impact on household saving.","[Burrows, Vivien] Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Burrows, V (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England.",,,"Burrows, Vivien/0000-0003-1361-5568",Economic and Social Research Council,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The data used in this publication were made available through the ESRC Data Archive.

In recent years, it is also receiving attention among historians of science. History of economics is no exception in that researchers have begun to use network analysis to study a variety of topics, including collaborations and interactions in scientific communities, the spread of economic theories within and across fields, or the formation of new specialties in the discipline of economics. Against this backdrop, a debate is emerging about how network analysis can help address questions that are pertinent to the history of economics. With this paper, we want to push this debate one step forward by offering and discussing five reasons why network analysis should have a future in the history of economics.","[Catherine, Herfeld] Univ Zurich, Inst Philosophy, Zurich, Switzerland; [Catherine, Herfeld; Doehne, Malte] Univ Zurich, Inst Sociol, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Zurich,"Catherine, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Philosophy, Zurich, Switzerland.;Catherine, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Sociol, Zurich, Switzerland.",c.s.herfeld@gmail.com,,"Doehne, Malte/0000-0002-2579-8421",,,,,97,12,12,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

The first model was designed to judge whether a building needs to be retrofitted; and the second, to estimate the cost of retrofitting buildings to specific levels. The study proposes a life-cycle seismic risk framework that takes into account projections of the seismic risk a given building will confront over the course of its entire existence, and thus helps determine the economically optimal level of retrofitting. The results of a case study indicate that the higher upfront cost of retrofitting that is required to reach higher seismic performance levels could, depending on the level of predicted seismic risk, be offset by lower repair costs in the long run. It is hoped that this research will serve as a basis for further studies of the assessment of the life-cycle seismic risk of school buildings, with the wider aim of arriving at an economically optimal building-retrofit policy.","[Cheng, Min-Yuan; Wu, Yu-Wei; Chen, Hung-Ming; Wu, Cai-Wei] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Ringgold Stand Inst, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Wei, Hsi-Hsien] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Wei, HH (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate Kowloon, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hhwei@polyu.edu.hk,"Wei, Hsi Hsein/AAR-4108-2020; Cheng, Min-Yuan/G-3510-2013","Wei, Hsi-Hsien/0000-0002-7024-0726",,,,,27,3,3,1,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This mutifacetedness creates a lack of communication between critics of economics (which includes a large proportion of philosophers and professors with a religious bent) and defenders of what, for lack of a better term, I will call mainstream economics. The problem is that when critics attack economics, their attack generally focuses on the one-dimensional vision of the social relationship of individuals that is conveyed by the principal texts rather than on a much more sophisticated vision of humans and of social relationships held by good economists. The author fully agrees that morals and science are intertwined in a Putnam sense-the questions one asks and the framework one chooses reflects moral choices.

Because the SRTC is effective after an incubation period, we make a distinction between short and long-term causality, following the methodology proposed by Dufour and Taamouti (2010). We find that causality from monetary policy to systemic risk, while not significant in the very short term, robustly represents 75 to 100% of the total dependence between the two variables in the long run. Reverse causality is rejected: systemic risk did not influence the policy of the European Central Bank before the global financial crisis. However, central banks must be aware that a too loose monetary policy stance may be conducive to a build-up of systemic risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We employ an endogenous-switching technique to explore micro-economic survey-based data from both innovating and noninnovating firms. The model allows us to construct counterfactual scenarios which overcome problems of self-selection in the data. Some of the findings provide support for the traditional patterns previously found in the innovation literature, in which innovation efforts and investments in physical and human capital are found to be important for product and process innovations in manufacturing and service firms and across economy types. Our counterfactual analysis also allows us to outline a rationale for policy intervention towards noninnovating firms as well as innovating firms depending on where the transitional heterogeneity effects are greatest.","[Crowley, Frank] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Econ, Coll Rd, Cork, Ireland; [McCann, Philip] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University College Cork; University of Sheffield,"Crowley, F (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Cork, Sch Econ, Coll Rd, Cork, Ireland.",Frank.crowley@ucc.ie,"Crowley, frank/ABC-3203-2021; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","Crowley, frank/0000-0003-3626-203X;",,,,,81,41,45,3,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Decision makers strongly favor own group candidates when deciding with someone from their own group, but not when deciding with someone from the other group.

Longitudinal Evidence for Uruguay,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,school attendance; non-cognitive abilities; panel data; nutrition; repetition; teenagers; SDQ; Uruguay,ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; ACHIEVEMENT; IDENTIFICATION; PARENTS,"Background: This study assesses the determinants of grade repetition and middle school drop-out in Uruguay, focusing on the role of past nutritional trajectory and non-cognitive abilities. A bulk of research attests the relevance of early childhood development and interventions in early stages on a wide set of outcomes across the whole life cycle (Behrman et al., 2009; Conti and Heckman, 2012; Daelmans et al., 2016). In the developing world, many studies highlight the strong association among nutrition and other childhood outcomes, and specifically schooling (Behrman and Wolfe, 1987). However, the role of non cognitive abilities on educational outcomes has been studied to a lesser extent. Methods: We use a two waves panel survey that follows-up a cohort of children since 2004, when they were first graders at public primary schools. The cohort considered in this study was exposed to a severe economic crisis in the first 3-4 years of life (1999-2003). In order to isolate the determinants of the probability of repetition we use a fixed effects estimator, exploiting the longitudinal nature of the data-set. To overcome the potential endogeneity problems arising from including previous repetition events as a determinant in the case of the school drop-outs equations, we base our analysis on MCO and MC2E estimators. Results: Our main results show that lagged household income and height for age strongly predict grade repetition. At the same time, a low SDQ score in the pro-social, emotional symptoms, hyperactivity and behavioral problems sub scales is highly associated with repetition. Meanwhile, repetition strongly predicts school drop-out. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the previous literature that points out that early child development strongly conditions outcomes in later life. Specifically, we identify a strong effect of departing conditions on teen-age educational outcomes. The latter uggest the relevance of designing early interventions that provide support to households since early stages in the life cycle. Identifying the initial conditions that deprivations that determine educational outcomes is a very relevant input for short-run and long-run antipoverty policy design. Our findings also point out that the links among grade repetition and school drop-out need to be further studied in order to expand educational achievements in Uruguay.","[Failache, Elisa; Salas, Gonzalo; Vigorito, Andrea] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Inst Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Failache, E (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Inst Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay.",efailache@iecon.ccee.edu.uy; gsalas@iecon.ccee.edu.uy; andrea@iecon.ccee.edu.uy,,,,,,,51,2,2,2,7,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We model the decision to migrate as akin to owning a financial option in which the exercise price is the fixed cost of moving. We show that a higher fixed cost associated with moving and a higher standard deviation of the quality of the labor market reduce the incentive to migrate. We then empirically examine whether the standard deviation of indicators of labor market quality reduce the likelihood of migration. Our findings strongly support this hypothesis, and imply that for the relatively mobile population of high-skilled workers the counterfactual outmigration rates that would obtain if future labor-market quality were known with certainty are more than twice observed rates.","[Gardner, John] Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, 366 Holman Hall, University, MS 38677 USA; [Hendrickson, Joshua R.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, 229 North Hall, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi,"Hendrickson, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, 229 North Hall, University, MS 38677 USA.",jrgardne@olemiss.edu; jrhendr1@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,35,6,7,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Results indicated that the main drivers of financial supply to NMS are externally determined, with economic sentiment and business climate in the Eurozone carrying the highest weight. FSI proved to have a good predictive power for debt inflow dynamics. In addition, we create a new indicator - the Refinancing Risk Ratio, which relates the supply and demand for foreign capital - to quantify the external refinancing conditions and risk faced by the government.

In this study, we use high total skewness and high maximum daily return (MAX) to measure lottery-type stocks and examine whether investors do exhibit distinct herding pattern in these stock types. Empirical results show that investors display stronger herding among lottery-type stocks, thereby indicating that such stocks induce correlated behaviour with the investors. In addition, we find that stocks with the highest skewness exhibit stronger herding under upmarkets, whereas stocks with the lowest skewness display stronger herding under downmarkets. Regarding the highest MAX portfolio, no significant herding asymmetry is seen between upmarket and downmarket. The results reported in this article demonstrate that comovement in stock returns may be partly attributed to the nonstandard preferences of investors in the stock market.","[Gong, Pu; Dai, Jun] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Gong, P (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",gongpu@hust.edu.cn,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

As the model has a deterministic backbone and a full-employment equilibrium, it can be directly compared to Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. We study the effects of negative productivity shocks by way of impulse-response functions (IRF). Simulation results show that when search and matching are centralized, the economy is always able to return to the full-employment equilibrium and IRFs are similar to those generated by DSGE models. However, when search and matching are local, coordination failures emerge and the economy persistently deviates from full-employment. Moreover, agents display persistent heterogeneity. Our results suggest that macroeconomic models should explicitly account for agents' heterogeneity and direct interactions. Moreover, our results point to the role of quantity adjustments in determining the ability of the economy to return or not to full-employment.","[Guerini, Mattia; Napoletano, Mauro; Roventini, Andrea] OFCE, Sci Po 60,Rue Dostoievski, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Napoletano, Mauro] Univ Cote Azur, SKEMA, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France; [Guerini, Mattia; Napoletano, Mauro; Roventini, Andrea] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy",SKEMA Business School; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Guerini, M (通讯作者)，OFCE, Sci Po 60,Rue Dostoievski, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France.",mattia.guerini@sciencespo.fr,"Roventini, Andrea/K-3314-2017; ROVENTINI, Andrea/N-4699-2019","Roventini, Andrea/0000-0001-5518-3084; ROVENTINI, Andrea/0000-0001-5518-3084; Napoletano, Mauro/0000-0002-8128-6674; GUERINI, Mattia/0000-0003-2071-6615",European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation [649186 - ISIGrowth],European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation,"We are grateful for helpful comments and discussions to Herbert Dawid, Giovanni Dosi, Jean-Luc Gaffard, Nobuyuki Hanaki, Kevin D.

Changes in the stock of reserves play no role in the macroeconomy including in business cycle volatility, trade dynamics or exchange rate volatility. We consider richer supply dynamics and model exploration and depletion. We show that an endogenous supply of reserves is important for capturing the stylised facts associated with commodity price shocks including a commodity currency, the crowding-out of non-commodity activity (Dutch-Disease) and a volatile business cycle. We also consider how exploration and depletion affect the ranking of optimal monetary and taxation policies. When natural resource reserves are held fixed, monetary policy is an efficient tool for stabilising the effects of commodity price shocks. However, when exploration and depletion are accounted for, using interest rates to stabilise the effects of commodity price changes becomes inefficient. Using taxes on the resource sector, specifically an ad valorem royalty, remains efficient. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It says (roughly) that X causes Y if and only if there is a possible intervention on X that changes Y, where X and Y stand for macroeconomic aggregates, where an intervention is understood as a manipulation of an intervention variable / that satisfies conditions requiring that I be a cause of X, and that there be no confounders of X and Y, and where an intervention variable is either a variable or a parameter.","[Henschen, Tobias] Univ Konstanz, Dept Philosophy, Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Henschen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Philosophy, Constance, Germany.",tobias.henschen@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,22,7,7,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

This paper adopts a new hybrid MADM model combined with the DEMATEL technique to construct an influential network relationship map (INRM) and determined the influential weights of DANP. Then, a modified VIKOR method using influential weights is applied to measure and integrate the performance gaps from each criterion into dimensions, as well as the overall criterion for evaluating and improving the modernization development of the regional financial center, as based on INRM. Finally an empirical case study using data from the Guangzhou regional financial center is carried out as an example to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed hybrid MADM model for solving real-world problems. The results show the priorities for improvement, as based on the degree of the effect and impact of the dimensions, as follows: first is making government policy, second is enforcing financial infrastructure and safety, next is formulating financial institutions and human resources, and finally financial service.","[Hu, Kuang-Hua] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, 21 Chisha Rd, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wei Jianguo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wei Jianguo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Accounting Sch, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung] Natl Taipei Univ, Coll Publ Affairs, Grad Inst Urban Planning, New Taipei, Taiwan","Guangdong University of Finance & Economics; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Nanfang College, Guangzhou; National Taipei University","Hu, KH (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, 21 Chisha Rd, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",18320709916@163.com,,,,,,,90,17,17,0,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Our liquidity premium measure is intuitive because it assesses the extent to which the value of the asset should be increased from the current market price if investors were allowed to retain the asset until they achieve an investment goal. This measure is readily available for assessing an asset's liquidity because it does not require information on the asset's transactional characteristics.

Utilizing daily data spanning the period 1 September 2005, to 31 December 2015, we estimate a foreign exchange intervention model within a GARCH theoretic framework. Empirical results indicate that foreign exchange interventions have had mixed impact on the volatility of the exchange rate. We find that inflation targeting is capable of curbing temporary exchange rate shocks. Empirical results indicate that while order flow is capable of reducing exchange rate volatility, an increase in the operating target rate, the 7-day interbank rate tends to exacerbate exchange rate volatility. Our empirical results are robust to alternative model specifications.

We postulate that overconfidence (regardless of its manifestation: calibration, better than average, and illusion of control) reinforces technical analysis usage. This hypothesis is tested in the present study conducted with professionals (traders in a proprietary trading company) and novices (finance students).

The goal of the present paper is to recall how the end of the Great Moderation has been interpreted by the advocates of mainstream economics, and how they have questioned their own macroeconomic theories as a consequence of what happened during and after the financial crisis. There is thus a need to reconsider most aspects of mainstream theory. In particular, the crisis has once more demonstrated that potential output is influenced by aggregate demand - a phenomenon associated with hysteresis, which also questions concepts such as the natural rate of interest and crowding-out effects.","[Lavoie, Marc] Univ Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris 13, Ctr Econ Paris Nord, Paris, France; [Lavoie, Marc] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Universite Paris 13; University of Ottawa,"Lavoie, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris 13, Ctr Econ Paris Nord, Paris, France.;Lavoie, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),The idea of this paper arose from a presentation that I was asked to make at the Jornadas Monetarias y Bancarias organized by the Banco Central de la Republica Argentina (BCRA) in Buenos Aires in November 2013.

We show that the demand ad valorem subsidy is the least efficient policy, regardless of whether it is measured in regard to the industrial or export subsidy policies. The superiority related to the specific and cost ad valorem subsidies hinges upon the production technology.

We find robust evidence that bank concentration reduces firms' debt maturity. As regards the role of firm size and firm ownership variables, the results show that the negative effect of bank concentration on firms' debt maturity weakens with firm size and firm government ownership. The negative influence of bank concentration strengthens for SMEs and non-SOEs than large-sized firms and SOEs, respectively. The debt maturity of SOEs decreased less than the debt maturity of non-SOEs in regions where bank concentration is higher. These findings are robust to several checks, including using alternative variables and alternative regression frameworks. These results reveal that privatizing state-owned banks and SOEs and reducing governments' interventions would be effective ways to reduce debt risks and credit discrimination.

This article aims to contribute to current thinking about the interaction between the diversity of capitalism and sustainable development, based on the concepts of institutional complementarity and hierarchy, and to question the dynamics of various forms of capitalism in this perspective. The example of economic policies aimed at tackling global warming shows how each form of capitalism adopts measures that are compatible with its own unique configuration of complementary institutions, helping to make it greener. However, this trend fits into a dynamic of limited sustainability that does not challenge the finance-dominated institutional hierarchy or the current growth regime.

There is a connection between efficient auctions and duality theory. The primal-dual algorithm can be taken as a decentralized and dynamic method of determine the pricing equilibrium. A primal-dual algorithm usually maintains a feasible dual solution and tries to compute a primal solution that is both feasible and satisfies the complementary slackness conditions. If such a solution is found, the algorithm terminates. Otherwise the dual solution is updated towards optimality and the algorithm continues with the next iteration.

With a particular focus on ageing shocks, we describe an increase in the share of elderly in regional population due to exogenous changes in the institutional context, such as pension reforms. The regional labour market implications of an ageing shock are then tested with regard to the effects on employment growth, unemployment and labour participation rate. Our results based on a sample of 71 Scandinavian regions point to negative regional labour market effects of an ageing shock implying a reduction in employment growth and a temporarily declining labour participation rate, while the unemployment rate increases. Importantly, spatial spillovers amplify these negative impacts through a marginalization of macro-regional labour markets. As a robustness check, we reverse the causal ordering and analyze the responses to a positive macroeconomic shock which initially increases employment growth. We find direct and spatially indirect adjustment patterns characterized by a reduction of the unemployment rate, an increase in the labour participation rate and a decrease in the share of elderly in the population.","[Mitze, Timo; Schmidt, Torben Dall] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark; [Rauhut, Daniel] Univ Eastern Finland, Karelian Inst, Joensuu, Finland; [Kangasharju, Aki] Nordea Bank, Helsinki, Finland",University of Southern Denmark; University of Eastern Finland,"Mitze, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",tmitze@sam.sdu.dk,"Rauhut, Daniel/AAD-8575-2019","Rauhut, Daniel/0000-0002-9146-9984; Schmidt, Torben Dall/0000-0002-7662-1669; Mitze, Timo/0000-0003-3799-5200",,,,,66,8,8,5,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Higher economic globalization emphasizes market-based policies, makes government more transparent and accountable and creates better adherence to global standards of governance. At the same time, higher social globalization that comes with the greater exchange of ideas and information as well as cultural integration, can make the populace more aware of international norms, can enhance freedom of expression via network building and exchange of ideas and can make the populace adhere better to rules in the society. Based on a sample of 142 countries over 1996 to 2013, the papers find that for economic globalization to have a beneficial impact on governance indicators, countries should have more than median levels of social globalization. Countries with low levels of social globalization fail to benefit from economic globalization. Thus, a better level of global governance is hidden in the right mix of cultural fusion along with higher labor and capital flows.","[Dutta, Nabamita] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Mukherjee, Deepraj] Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Mukherjee, D (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",dmukherj@kent.edu; ndutta@uwlax.edu,"MUKHERJEE, DEEPRAJ/ABI-7532-2020; Dutta, Nabamita/K-3728-2019","MUKHERJEE, DEEPRAJ/0000-0002-2032-477X; Dutta, Nabamita/0000-0002-0943-5217",,,,,55,11,11,1,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Three main points are noted. First, the two measures yield qualitatively similar scenarios, and both indicate sigma-divergence in income over the period. Second, however, they do show large differences in the rate of change in income inequality, and SDLOG indicates divergence at a much higher rate than CV. It seems likely that SDLOG would indicate greater divergence, or weaker convergence, than CV in many cases. Third, therefore, researchers are urged not to rely too heavily on one or the other measure for an inference on sigma-convergence, and it seems appropriate to consider both for drawing reasonable conclusions on convergence in income and many other variables studied by scholars.","[Ram, Rati] Illinois State Univ, Econ Dept, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Illinois State University,"Ram, R (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Econ Dept, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",rram@ilstu.edu,,,,,,,14,9,9,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The results indicate that the uncertainty measure is weak at forecasting the skilled labour but significantly carries forecasting information on the unskilled labour. The forecasting information increases if the sample is restricted to construction and manufacturing industries. Using rolling regressions to conduct a simulated out-of-sample forecasting exercise, we find that the uncertainty measure contains forecasting information for the unskilled labour in those industries for two quarters ahead. By providing detailed information about the forecasting power of uncertainty by skill and industry, this study will be helpful in designing more efficient labour market policies.","[Sakutukwa, Tutsirai] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Yang, Hee-Seung] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, 263 Namsejongro, Sejong 30149, South Korea",Monash University; KDI School of Public Policy & Management,"Yang, HS (通讯作者)，KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, 263 Namsejongro, Sejong 30149, South Korea.",heeseung.yang@kdischool.ac.kr,,"Sakutukwa, Tutsirai/0000-0003-2967-9363",,,,,11,2,3,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A broad-based theoretical debate on the decline of the dollar and its consequences has begun. There is a large body of studies that sees the origin of an international money as a market-led process. In this view, because the United States will very soon lose its economic pre-eminence the US dollar will consequently share its international role with other currencies or even be replaced by the renminbi. In this paper we contest this argument, focusing on the conditions that make a fiat money acceptable in international transactions. Trust in a type of money like this needs an institutional framework that guarantees the property rights of currency holders. This framework implies a high level of rule of law domestically and a high level of state capability in the international balance of power. Since at present no other currency fulfils these two requirements at the same time, the dominance of the US dollar as an international money is going to last.

Starting with the production of low-value, labour-intensive goods, Chinese companies have gradually progressed up the value-added ladder. China has successfully utilized foreign technologies and becomes a strong competitor to many industries in developed countries. China has the opportunity to be a global leader in a number of important areas that will be cornerstones of global growth in the next decades and this is also challenge as well as threat for its biggest competitors.

Applicability and efficacy of the suggested approach are illustrated by a real data set involving the factors of competitiveness based on Global Competitiveness Index in reference period of the 10th anniversary of the global financial crisis.","[Stanickova, Michaela] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Stanícková, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.",michaela.stanickova@vsb.cz,"Stanickova, Michaela/ABE-6334-2020","Stanickova, Michaela/0000-0001-6210-2377",Czech Scientific Foundation [17-22426S]; project Law Aspects of China's Incorporation into the Global Trade System,Czech Scientific Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); project Law Aspects of China's Incorporation into the Global Trade System,"This research was financially supported by the Czech Scientific Foundation (Grant NO. 17-22426S), project Law Aspects of China's Incorporation into the Global Trade System.",,18,0,0,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,349,358,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000485363200038,0

Current studies analysing the competitive effect primarily focus on the examination of public works contracts, or on examining the competitive effect of public procurement as a heterogeneous whole. The subject of this examination is a separate analysis of public service contracts. Below and above-threshold public service contracts awarded in the Czech Republic in 2014 were examined. The results of the examination of its own sample of 790 public contracts in open procedure show that, with each additional tenderer, the average price drops by 3.04%. This finding is in line with the studies that have dealt with the examination of the competitive effect in public procurement for public works contracts. The analysis also indicates a stronger existence of a competitive effect in open procedure types compared to other procedure types. The report also highlights some of the phenomena that may affect the resulting public contract price, where the higher final price does not necessarily mean inefficiency nor overpricing of the public contract (such as the difficulties with the anticipated price for IT service contracts).","[Stehlik, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Dept Publ & Social Policy, U Krize 8, Prague 15800, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Stehlík, P (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Dept Publ & Social Policy, U Krize 8, Prague 15800, Czech Republic.",petrus.stehlik@gmail.com,"Stehlik, Petr/U-7987-2018",,,,,,33,2,3,0,9,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The model's predictions are confronted with data on more than 150,000 speeding tickets from the Autobahn and 290,000 speed measures from a traffic monitoring system. The data provide evidence on modest levels of bunching, despite several frictions working against it.

This article looks at some of the factors that have impacted the industry since 1968 and led to its demise, including a high value of the Australian dollar in recent years, strategic decisions on the part of parent companies and reductions in governmental support and tariff protection. We estimate a cost function for the industry with inputs of domestic capital and labour and insourced intermediate goods as well as imported intermediate goods. The findings include that the remaining firms are operating in an output range of strongly statistically significant economies of scale, and that all of the input pairs are substitutes except for statistically significant complementary relationships between capital and domestic intermediate goods and labour and foreign intermediate goods. Unexpected results are that an increase in output per assembly plant appears to have a positive effect on total cost, while an increase in the effective tariff and an increase in the number of models appears to have a negative effect. One explanation for these robust but unexpected findings may be that total profit contribution is a part of total cost, and, therefore, factors that increase total profit contribution will also increase total cost.","[Truett, Lila J.; Truett, Dale B.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Truett, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",lila.truett@utsa.edu,,"Truett, Lila/0000-0002-6976-2324",,,,,75,2,4,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

(Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper 2000; Econometrica 2005). In such an economy, there is no rational explanation for producers' delivery upper bounds while the endowments naturally limit consumers' deliveries. However, we show that the typical equilibrium allocation of the asymmetric information economy necessarily and substantially depends on such exogenous upper bounds (Example 1 and Theorem 1). In other words, an equilibrium existence theorem without such upper bounds, even if such exists, will typically fail to treat the asymmetric information problem, e.g., the adverse selection problem. Hence, to treat the equilibrium existence problem under the informational asymmetry appropriately, we have to extend the standard model so that the delivery upper bounds need not to be specified explicitly. For this purpose, we propose a quite natural and realistic assumption with respect to the technological condition related to the market delivery, i.e., the existence of some small standardization, commoditization, and/or transaction costs of market deliveries is shown to be sufficient (Theorem 3).","[Urai, Ken] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Yoshimachi, Akihiko] Doshisha Univ, Dept Commerce, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028580, Japan; [Shiozawa, Kohei] Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Osaka University; Doshisha University; Kobe University,"Shiozawa, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",urai@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp; shiozawa@rieb.kobe-u.ac.jp,,,[JP15J04941],,This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Research Fellow Grant Number JP15J04941.,,14,1,1,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Chinese firm-level data have been used to examine whether the cultural distance between domestic and host countries is a bane or a boon to innovation when firms engage in OFDI for technology acquisition. Generally, businesses with similar cultural backgrounds have an easier time-making technological progress. However, this research revealed a deeper level of reverse technological spillover among firms that invest in Europe and the USA, which are considered to quite culturally distant from China. Reverse technological spillover through OFDI is positively affected by individualism and uncertainty avoidance, which are the two dimensions of cultural distance.","[Ye Jiao; Zhao Yunpeng; Cui Chuanjiang; Zhao Lu] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,"Ye, J (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian, Peoples R China.",yejiao@dlut.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,7,7,5,75,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In contrast to the (partial equilibrium) results of the small open economy (SOE) model, I show that in general equilibrium, strong wealth effects on labor supply in emerging economies are necessary to rationalize the evidence.

This article adopts the dynamic panel quantile regression to investigate the impact of income, economic openness and interest rates on housing prices in China, based on the panel data of 35 major cities from 2002 to 2012. Compared with previous studies, we can more precisely and reasonably discuss the impact of these variables on different levels of housing prices. The empirical results indicate that the impact of independent variables on housing prices is heterogeneous across quantiles. Specifically, the impact of income is positive and significant across quantiles, and the impact becomes greater at the 90th and 95th quantiles. Economic openness has a positive and significant effect at the 5th-80th quantiles, which support the Balassa-Samuelson effect, but it is insignificant at the 90th and 95th quantiles. The impact of interest rates is positive and significant at low quantiles, but the impact is negative and insignificant at high quantiles. Furthermore, we also find that the coefficients of interest rates at various quantiles are smaller. In addition, the population has a significant positive effect across quantiles.

However, in the consumer survey data analyzed, respondents take the survey twice with a six-month gap, and responses are reported to the nearest integer. Both the low frequency and the rounding result in overestimation of information stickiness. Higher-frequency unrounded data reveals that consumers revise their inflation expectations far more frequently-about five times in an eight month period. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The methodology proposes a link between the old series of vacancies from the former INEM (National Employment Institute) and the new series from Eurostat. To that end, we use the information from the Short-Term Labour Survey. An analysis of this new homogeneous series shows that the Beveridge curve shifted between 2008 and 2009 due to the worse efficiency of the process of matching vacancies and unemployed workers. A simulation of the macroeconomic effects of this fall in efficiency in a general equilibrium model for Spain generates movements in GDP and employment in the same direction as those actually observed in the crisis, albeit of lesser magnitude. The evidence offered shows that since 2014, the Beveridge curve has gradually been recovering its pre-crisis position, with a consequent decline in the unemployment rate.","[Bosca, Jose E.; Ferri, Javier] Univ Valencia, FEDEA, Valencia, Spain; [Domenech, Rafael] Univ Valencia, BBVA Res, Valencia, Spain; [Garcia, Jose R.] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Boscá, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, FEDEA, Valencia, Spain.",,"Domenech, Rafael/L-8616-2014; Garcia, Jose Ramón/L-5755-2014; Ferri, Javier/L-2024-2014; Bosca, Jose E./K-8142-2014","Domenech, Rafael/0000-0001-9902-1060; Ferri, Javier/0000-0001-7722-9186; Bosca, Jose E./0000-0001-5238-1237",Rafael del Pino Foundation; BBVA Research; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-53150-R]; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEO2016-097],Rafael del Pino Foundation; BBVA Research(BBVA Foundation); Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),"The authors are grateful for the valuable comments and suggestions by the editor, two anonymous referees, Antonio Diaz and Juan R.

The notion of polarization is concerned with the disappearance or non-consolidation of the middle class, which occurs when there is a tendency to concentrate in the tails, rather than the middle, of the income/consumption distribution. This paper uses newly available data and the relative distribution methodology (Handcock and Morris, 1998, 1999) to present new results on polarization. The findings confirm the sharp increase of polarization. Compared to 2003, the distribution of consumption has become more concentrated in upper and lower deciles in 2013, while the middle deciles have thinned. A between-group analysis shows the emergence of a macro-regional gap: while the South-South and South-West regions contribute mainly to polarization in the upper tail, households in the North East and North West zonesthe conflict-stricken areasare more likely to fall in the lower national deciles.","[Clementi, F.] Univ Macerata, Macerata, Italy; [Dabalen, A.

First, a general framework for examining growth and distribution is discussed, in terms of which classical-Marxian and post-Keynesian-Kaleckian and other theories are presented. Since this framework examines how variables are determined in equilibrium, second, dynamics behind equilibria are examined, focusing on goods market and labor market changes. Third, the framework is extended in a variety of ways to examine additional models addressing productivity growth and technical change, money and inflation, finance and debt, additional distributional considerations, multisector issues, open economy questions, and the environment. It is concluded that the literature on heterodox theories of growth and distribution is vibrant, large, and growing, and addresses many issues that are ignored or neglected in orthodox theories, including power, unemployment, and aggregate demand.","[Dutt, Amitava Krishna] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Dutt, Amitava Krishna] FLACSO Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador",University of Notre Dame,"Dutt, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;Dutt, AK (通讯作者)，FLACSO Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador.",adutt@nd.edu,,,,,,,139,16,17,4,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

While there have been many studies on developed countries, empirical evidence for developing countries is somehow limited. In the last few years, mobile cellular subscriptions achieved a tremendous growth across theMENA region making it the second fastest growing region in the world in terms of mobile subscriptions in 2012, and the fastest growing region in terms of mobile traffic in 2014. Fixed subscriptions have also grown but at a slower rate than mobile subscriptions. Using unbalanced data on 17 MENA countries over the period 1990-2009, we explore the relationship between fixed and mobile telephone services by using dynamic panel data models. We find empirical evidence for asymmetric one-way substitution between fixed-lines and mobile phones and we estimate own-and cross-price elasticities for fixed and mobile telephone services in MENA region. The results are then used to derive policy implications in terms of market redefinition, taxation policies, extension of universal services and broadband markets.","[Ezzat, Riham Ahmed] Cairo Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Giza, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Ezzat, RA (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Giza, Egypt.",riham.ahmedezzat@feps.edu.eg,,"EZZAT, Riham A./0000-0003-4985-9468",,,,,47,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

Each such newspaper publisher, in setting the subscription prices and numbers of pages of content in its morning edition and evening edition, must take into account self-selection of demanders as to type of subscription. The subscription offerings thus amount to second-degree price discrimination, which is the main reason why it might be profitable to even publish an evening edition along with the morning one. Estimates here show that the Japanese newspaper publishers that do offer optional evening editions enlarge their profits by around eight percent of their morning-edition subscription revenue. Furthermore, these newspaper publishers increase consumer surplus by an amount equal to half what they add their own profit. The second-degree price discrimination increases social welfare.

Previous studies find that when income is earned through work there is less support for redistribution than when income is determined by luck. Using a lab experiment, we vary both the income-generating process (luck vs. performance) and the level of inequality (low vs. high). We find that an increase in inequality has less impact on redistribution choices when income is earned through performance than when income results from luck. This result is likely explained by individuals using income differences as a heuristic to infer relative deservingness. If people believe income inequality increases as a result of performance rather than luck, then they are likely to believe the poor deserve to stay poor and the rich deserve to stay rich.","[Gee, Laura K.; Parsa, Sahar] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Migueis, Marco] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Tufts University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Migueis, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",mmigueis@gmail.com,"Gee, Laura/S-6537-2019; Migueis, Marco/D-8275-2017","Gee, Laura/0000-0002-3715-7445; Migueis, Marco/0000-0002-9855-7944",Tufts University Faculty Research Awards Committee,Tufts University Faculty Research Awards Committee,"The opinions expressed in this manuscript belong to the authors and do not represent official positions of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System.

Not only may individuals alter labor supply by working more or less in response to changes in tax policy, they may also alter reported earnings or shift income between taxable and tax-deferred compensation. As a result, in addition to estimating the standard extensive and intensive labor supply elasticities, we also examine elasticities by type of income (wage earnings vs. self-employment earnings) and compensation (taxable vs. tax-deferred). We find that wives have more elastic work participation and earnings than husbands. Furthermore, self-employment income is more responsive to net-of-tax price changes than wage earnings for both husbands and wives, suggesting that it is easier for the self-employed to alter their work hours, work intensity, and/or reported income than wage earners. Finally, we find that wives respond to changes in the net-of-tax price of earnings by altering the amount of earnings subject to current-year taxes through adjustments of tax-deferred contributions to employer-provided retirement accounts.","[Lin, Emily Y.; Tong, Patricia K.] US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC 20226 USA",United States Department of the Treasury,"Lin, EY (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC 20226 USA.",Emily.Lin@treasury.gov,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

I suggest that economists should also consider intellectual debates that are initiated by economic actors. I set out to understand the role of intellectual debate in the economy and, drawing on Polanyi's concept of intellectual order', the institutions that emerge endogenously to support it. Professional communities and public intellectual spheres are shown as the most important examples. Three historical cases are given as illustrations.

The goal of this study is to estimate the direct and indirect (via the spouse) effects of a pioneer French pension reform on both spouses' retirement decision. The extent of the reform varies by birth year, which enables us to identify its retirement effects on both spouses, since the husband is, on average, 2 years older than the wife. We use labor-force survey data to implement a sharp regression-discontinuity framework, in which the running variable is the distance of the individual birth month to a certain reference month, as well as an incremental differences-in-differences approach. We find a significant drop in each spouse's probability of retirement. The husband's retirement probability also drops immediately by 1 percentage point if the wife is affected by the reform, while her retirement probability does not respond immediately if he is affected.

The producers are exposed to stochastically fluctuating costs and interact through aggregate supply. Capacity expansion is irreversible and modeled in terms of timing strategies characterized through threshold rules. Because the impact of changing costs on the producers is asymmetric, we are led to a nonzero-sum timing game describing the transitions among the discrete investment stages. Working in a continuous-time diffusion framework, we characterize and analyze the resulting Nash equilibrium and game values. Our analysis quantifies the dynamic competition effects and yields insight into dynamic preemption and over-investment in a general asymmetric setting.

Two types of flexibility emerge: contingent protection, which requires governments to verify the state of the world, and discretionary protection, which allows governments to set tariffs unilaterally. The structure of the GATT/WTO agreement provides these two types of flexibility through a mechanism that we call Cap and Escape. Governments may choose tariffs unilaterally below the negotiated cap, but escaping from the cap requires state verification. We show that this framework explains key features of the GATT/WTO agreements, including the substantial variation across sectors and countries in the level of negotiated tariffs, and the rate at which different flexibility measures are used.","[Beshkar, Mostafa] Indiana Univ, Econ, 100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Bond, Eric W.] Vanderbilt Univ, Econ, 2301 Vanderbilt Pl, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Vanderbilt University,"Beshkar, M (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Econ, 100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",mbeshkar@indiana.edu; eric.bond@vanderbilt.edu,,,Faculty Research Support Program at Indiana University; Leitner Center at Yale University,Faculty Research Support Program at Indiana University; Leitner Center at Yale University,"We thank participants in seminars at the Dartmouth/SNU conference on International Trade Policy and Institutions, the Midwest International Economics Meetings, DISSETL Workshop at ECARES, InsTED Workshop at University of Exeter, University of Nottingham, Kobe University, and Yale University.

The new database is used to test the strategic partisan transfers hypothesis, which states that mayors from the same party as the president receive higher federal transfers than those from different parties, if the corresponding municipality is situated in a state where the governor is not aligned with the president. In general, the econometric analysis strongly supports the strategic partisan transfers hypothesis. Furthermore, it supports the hypothesis that there is a biannual political transfers cycle in Brazil due to the country's staggered electoral system with elections every other year.","[Bugarin, Mauricio; Marciniuk, Fernanda] Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, Campus Darcy Ribeiro, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Bugarin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, Campus Darcy Ribeiro, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",bugarin.mauricio@gmail.com; flmarciniuk@gmail.com,"Bugarin, Mauricio/ABI-5462-2020","Bugarin, Mauricio/0000-0003-1177-7344",CNPq,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Department of Economics, University of Brasilia, Campus Darcy Ribeiro, Asa Norte, CEP 70910-900, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.

Allowing voters to spend freely a fixed budget of votes over multiple issues restores some minority power. However, it also creates a complex strategic scenario: a hide-and-seek game between majority and minority voters that corresponds to a decentralized version of the Colonel Blotto game. We offer theoretical results and bring the game to the laboratory. The minority wins as frequently as theory predicts, despite subjects deviating from equilibrium strategies. Because subjects understand the logic of the game - minority voters must concentrate votes unpredictably - the exact choices are of secondary importance, a result that vouches for the robustness of the voting rule to strategic mistakes.

We estimate markups at the market-product-plant level using detailed panel production and cost data from Mexican manufacturing between 1994 and 2007. Exploiting variation in the real exchange rate in the aftermath of the peso crisis in December 1994, we provide robust empirical evidence that plants increase their markups and producer prices in response to a real depreciation and that this increase is greater for products with higher productivity. Thus, we provide direct evidence for the theoretical mechanism of variable markup response behind incomplete and heterogeneous exchange rate pass-through on producer prices. Our empirical methodology allows us to decompose the producer price response to exchange rate shocks into a markup and a marginal cost component using our markup estimates. Using these estimates, we establish that marginal cost at the product-plant level increases more in response to real exchange rate depreciation if the plant has higher share of imported inputs.","[Caselli, Mauro] Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Trento, Italy; [Chatterjee, Arpita; Woodland, Alan] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Trento; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Chatterjee, A (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",arpita.chatterjee@unsw.edu.au,"Woodland, Alan/AAG-6239-2020; Chatterjee, Arpita/GPS-9141-2022; Woodland, Alan/J-9157-2012","Woodland, Alan/0000-0003-0523-6517; Woodland, Alan/0000-0003-0523-6517; Caselli, Mauro/0000-0002-1132-1665",Australian Research Council [DP140101187],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Alan Woodland gratefully acknowledges the financial support provided by the Australian Research Council through its Discovery Grants program for this research (grant DP140101187).

This paper proposes a novel mechanism to explain policy diversity between similar countries from an open economy perspective. I study optimal policies in a two country model where policies affect the determinants of trade patterns. Symmetric countries choose asymmetric policies in equilibrium if aggregate income is sufficiently convex in own policy. Such high social increasing return to policy, despite constant returns to scale in production, generate enough gains from trade to sustain policy diversity in equilibrium. Any asymmetric equilibrium is welfare-improving compared to the common autarky optimum. Similarly, a more asymmetric Nash equilibrium Pareto dominates a less asymmetric one. As an application, I consider a model in which the government's choice of education policy affects skill distribution and comparative advantage. In this application, the existence of an asymmetric Nash equilibrium in education policy requires that the elasticity of the education cost of agents with respect to skill is relatively low.

In a controlled laboratory experiment we show that exogenous variation of second-order expectations (promisors' expectations about promisees' expectations) leads to a significant change in promisor behavior. We provide evidence that a promisor's aversion to disappointing a promisee's expectation leads her to behave more generously.

The environment features transferable utility and symmetric information. A key novelty with respect to existing work is that we allow for multidimensional heterogeneity on both sides of the market. The probabilities of finding and filling different jobs and the corresponding wages are determined endogenously in equilibrium. We show that constrained efficient allocations can be determined as optimal solutions to a linear programming problem, whereas the prices supporting these allocations and the associated expected payoffs for workers and firms correspond to the solutions of the 'dual' of that linear program. We use this characterization to show that an equilibrium exists and is constrained efficient under very general conditions. The fact that linear programming techniques are used for the structural estimation of frictionless matching models suggests that our framework is potentially useful for empirical studies of labor markets and other markets where search frictions are prevalent.

In our economic experiment, having voice, i.e., the opportunity to state one's opinion prior to a decision, significantly increases subordinates' subsequent kindness towards the authority. These positive effects occur irrespectively of the decisions' content. The experimental findings stress the positive effects of voice when subordinates and authorities interact. Our results suggest that in organizations, but also in the legal and political arena, participative decision-making can be used to guide people's actions after decisions have been made.

Unfortunately, the approaches currently used for modeling heteroskedasticity all have drawbacks. For instance, assuming known dates for variance changes is often unrealistic while more flexible models based on GARCH or Markov switching residuals are difficult to handle from a statistical and computational point of view. Therefore we propose a model based on a smooth change in variance that is flexible as well as relatively easy to estimate and illustrate its use by analysis of the interaction between monetary policy and the stock market based on a five-dimensional system of U.S. variables. For the benchmark setup it is found that previously used conventional identification schemes in this context are rejected by the data if heteroskedasticity is allowed for. We also illustrate the implications of using different transition variables and varying the sample period. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the model, bank lending is distorted by debt overhang, banks hold sovereign debt, and the government taxes output and guarantees banks' liabilities. At the height of a crisis, there is uncertainty about whether the crisis is driven by self-fulfilling expectations (SFEs) or by weak economic fundamentals. A potentially unlimited program eliminates an SFEs-driven crisis, but can generate financial losses and moral-hazard distortions-adding conditionality avoids these losses and distortions.

When appealing is costly, students (or parents) may not find it worth appealing, even if their priorities are violated in their preferred schools. In order to incorporate this into the school-choice setting, we consider the vector of parameters, namely the profile of students' stickiness degrees resulting from students' cost-benefit analyses and consisting of each student's least rank difference associated with appeals he/she finds beneficial. Then, sticky-stability rules out only appeal-causing priority violations. Consequently, we introduce the following two mechanisms, both of which elicit these parameters from students: efficiency-improving deferred-acceptance mechanism (EIDA) and efficiency-corrected deferred-acceptance mechanism (ECDA). We show that both are sticky-stable and dominate stable matchings in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, the latter is efficient within the class of sticky-stable mechanisms. In a complete information setting, both are manipulable while the EIDA is immune to manipulations via stickiness degree misreporting. However, if students have limited information, then the EIDA becomes robust to manipulations, whereas the ECDA continues to be vulnerable, but with a diminished scope.","[Afacan, Mustafa Oguz; Aliogullari, Zeynel Harun; Barlo, Mehmet] Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey; [Aliogullari, Zeynel Harun] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Sabanci University; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Afacan, MO (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",mafacan@sabanciuniv.edu; zeynelharun@sabanciuniv.edu; barlo@sabanciuniv.edu,"AFACAN, MUSTAFA/AAA-7252-2020; Barlo, Mehmet/HOC-5849-2023","AFACAN, MUSTAFA/0000-0001-7359-9569; Barlo, Mehmet/0000-0001-6871-5078",,,,,28,8,10,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

For estimating the potential impact of the prices increase in the consumption we develop scenarios on elasticity and tax rate. We use public information from INEGI for both analysis. Results: From the price analysis, results indicate that the industry transferred the tax to prices of snacks completely. Likewise results show that the tax enforced from 2014 to 2016 generated a moderate reduction in consumption. Estimates of the potential impact in the consumption indicate that a higher tax rate would generate bigger decreases in consumption and that the tax would be more effective if the demand of the snacks is elastic. Conclusions: Results provide information to reconsider the tax rate and alert about the need to evaluate the strategy as a whole.","[Aguilera Aburto, Nelly] CIDE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rodriguez Aguilar, Roman] Univ Anahuac, Fac Ingn, Huixquilucan, Mexico; [Nicte-Ha Sansores Martinez, Diana; Gutierrez Delgad, Cristina] Secretaria Salud Mexico, Unidad Anal Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

Indeed, the Laffer curve exists under a weak compensation effect, while the green paradox requires a strong effect.

Using oil volatility risk premium (oil VRP) as the predictor, we find that oil VRP does exhibit statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power for G7 countries, even controlling for some popular macroeconomic variables. These findings are robust when using alternative proxies for volatilities of stock and oil. Furthermore, the strength of the predictive evidence is substantial during relatively high and low level of stock market, while is substantially higher for recessions vis-a-vis expansions. Oil VRP can also contains additional information for predicting a series of macroeconomic variables, which serves as an available explanation for its forecasting ability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

If players are sufficiently similar, distributional preferences create multiple equilibria. For the case of only mildly heterogeneous players, equilibrium effort can be lower as well as higher than effort exerted by players with selfish preferences. These findings can explain the following three anomalies observed in empirical tests of probabilistic and share contests: the large variance of effort levels (overspreading), individual spending that exceeds the Nash-equilibrium prediction (overspending), and aggregate spending that exceeds the value of the prize (overdissipation). If players are sufficiently heterogeneous, the game has a unique equilibrium that is more egalitarian than the selfish Nash equilibrium. It turns out that the less talented competitor may win the larger share of the prize if his inequality aversion is sufficiently strong. We analyze how the equilibria evolve if the number of players becomes larger and how sequential moves influence behavior. Two new insights follow from the analysis of the sequential-move game. First, sequential moves act as a coordination device in case of multiple simultaneous equilibria, and second, inequality aversion of the more egalitarian player can be used as a commitment device for low effort. This effect can reverse the conventional wisdom that the underdog should lead. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate this issue by using daily data on 12 Islamic banks in four regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States) from July 2007 to April 2016. We apply different methodological approaches (principal component analysis, panel data tests, and quantile regression). First, the principal component analysis shows that the performance of Islamic banks varies among regions. Second, the linear panel regression highlights that the geographical environment positively and significantly affects Islamic banking, suggesting the importance of externality effects. Finally, the environmental effect seems to vary with quantiles (positive effect for the lowest quantile versus negative effect for the highest quantile). This quantile specification points to nonlinearity in the environment Islamic bank performance relationship, reflecting a time-varying discipline imposed by the Sharia board (Islamic Law). This finding helps better explain the main difference between Islamic banks in the East (Africa and Asia) and those in the West (Europe and the United States) and also enables investors to adjust their portfolio choices when considering the products of Islamic banks according to regional specificities.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91025 Evry, France; [Jawadi, Nabila] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG LAB, Paris, France; [Cheffou, Abdoulkarim Idi] EDC Paris Business Sch, Courbevoie, France; [Ben Arneur, Hachmi] INSEEC Business Sch, Paris, France; [Louhichi, Wael] ESSCA Sch Management, Angers, France",Universite Paris Saclay; IPAG Business School; Groupe Inseec; ESSCA School of Management,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91025 Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,,"JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,20,9,9,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Overall, the distribution of earnings is only mildly skewed towards the principal.

Using these techniques, we construct MST and PMFG networks of the US stock market at different time scales. The key empirical results show that (1) the topological structures and properties of networks vary across time horizons, (2) there is a sectoral clustering effect in the networks at small time scales, and (3) only a part of connections in the networks survives from one time scale to the next.

Based on monthly data from 1995:1 to 2016:3, we address this issue by employing the quantile regression technique. ThiS approach enables a more detailed investigation in different market circumstances, namely, bearish, normal and bullish markets. Empirical results indicate that the effects of oil price shocks and economic policy uncertainty are asymmetric and highly related to stock market conditions. Moreover, both the nexus of oil- and economic policy uncertainty-stock are changed at the onset of a crisis. Specially, rising oil prices have greater negative effects on stock returns when stock markets are bullish (extreme higher quantiles) before a crisis, whereas the effects are significantly positive under different market conditions after the onset of the crisis. Falling oil prices lower stock returns when stock markets are bullish and normal before the crisis, whereas lower stock returns under different market conditions except extreme bullish after the onset of the crisis. These findings might be related to the optimistic or pessimistic investor sentiments and investors might become more frightened after the crisis.

The results identify mitigating factors in MENA's finance-growth relationships. Moreover, they show that the impact of finance on growth was positive pre-Arab Spring, but lost some of its significance post the Arab Spring, as some macroeconomic indicators improved, while others worsened. However, governance variables show significant improvement post-Arab Spring. These findings suggest that the financial development-growth nexus is contingent on socio-political reforms that shift the paradigm of institutional quality. Finally, this paper also discusses certain policies that may improve the efficiency of financial institutions and the government in generating inclusive economic growth.

Our results also indicate a negative relationship between the level of public debt and deficits over the entire period and the pre-crisis period, suggesting that rising public debt represented a brake on future deficits. We also find that election cycles affect the fiscal deficit, but only during the pre-crisis period, while no evidence of a relationship between fiscal policy and government fragmentation was captured. We find some evidence that in the pre-crisis period the CEE countries with a fixed exchange rate regime ran lower deficits than those with a floating regime, whereas during the crisis no impact of the exchange rate regime on the fiscal deficit was found. There is also some evidence that an, arrangement with the IMF was associated with lower deficits for the entire sample period.

In some locations, the rise in the labor force due to this inflow of repatriates was 5-10%. The strong involvement of the Turkish state in the settlement of earlier waves of repatriates provides us a strong source of exogenous variation in the 1989 immigrant shock across locations and brings our study closer to an ideal natural experiment. We find that a 1% increase in the labor force due to repatriates increases the unemployment rate of native men by about 0.3 percentage points 14 months after the end of the repatriate flow. When the analysis is done according to skill groups, the impact on non-repatriates is the strongest among the young and those with similar educational attainment to repatriates. Using a reservoir of 342 cities and towns with variable treatment intensity, we also construct a matched sample that is well balanced in terms of covariate distributions of the treatment and comparison groups using propensity score matching. Using this methodology, we demonstrate the importance of constructing well-matched samples prior to IV estimation which leads to impact estimates that are more than 50% higher than those with the baseline sample.

We develop a model in which criminals choose both links and actions. We show that the degree of cascade of detection plays an important role in shaping equilibrium criminal networks. Surprisingly, greater cascade of detection could reduce ex ante social welfare. In particular, we prove that full cascade of detection yields a weakly denser criminal network than that under partial cascade of detection. We further characterize the optimal allocation of the detection resource and demonstrate that it should be highly asymmetric among ex ante identical agents. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this paper is to develop a modular approach to the design of double auctions, by relating it to the exhaustively-studied problem of designing one-sided mechanisms with a single seller (or, alternatively, a single buyer). We consider several desirable properties of a double auction: feasibility, dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, the still stronger incentive constraints offered by a deferred-acceptance implementation, exact and approximate welfare maximization, and budget balance. For each of these properties, we identify sufficient conditions on two one-sided algorithms-one for ranking the buyers, one for ranking the sellers-and on a method for their composition into trading pairs, which guarantee the desired property of the double auction. Our framework also offers new insights into classic double auction designs, such as the VCG and McAfee auctions with unit-demand buyers and unit-supply sellers.

However, though farmers selling to private mills make no difference with respect to the background of partners, farmers selling to cooperatives significantly decrease contributions when paired with non-cooperative members. Finally, we study how self-selection into a mechanism that punishes the lowest contributors effects contributions both inside the group and with partners of the opposite background, and we show that it increases contributions by cooperative farmers interacting with non-cooperative farmers by more than 100%.","[Hopfensitz, Astrid; Miquel-Florensa, Josepa] Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Hopfensitz, A (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse, France.",astrid.hopfensitz@tse-fr.eu; pepita.miquel@tse-fr.eu,"Hopfensitz, Astrid/C-1236-2014","Hopfensitz, Astrid/0000-0002-6503-6114",ANR-Labex IAST; ANR research grant [2010 JCJC 1803 01],ANR-Labex IAST(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ANR research grant(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We would like to thank CATIE (Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza) for their hospitality while the experiments were performed.

Peer networks are key in determining the smoking behaviour of youths, but the magnitude of the effects is still debated, questioned and inconclusive. I used a control function approach, a two-stage least square and the fixed effect method to address the potential endogeneity of peer network. The results suggest positive and significant peer effects on smoking participation and smoking intensity. While the network effects are consistently positive and significant, the magnitude of the estimates varies across methodological approaches with the instrument variable estimates generally lower. Including older adults in the peer reference group increases the peer effect estimates. Finally, using clusters as an alternative measure of network size in wave one, I show that peer effects are independent on network size but rather on network quality. Relative to the results of this paper, previous literature has documented larger peer effects on the decision to smoke. The findings suggest that policies (excise tax) that directly affect the decision to smoke and the smoking intensity of the peer reference group are likely to affect own smoking behaviour.","[Mukong, Alfred Kechia] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, SAL DRU, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Mukong, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, SAL DRU, Cape Town, South Africa.",alfred.mukong@uct.ac.za,,,Economics of Tobacco Control Project,Economics of Tobacco Control Project,"I appreciate funding of the research by the Economics of Tobacco Control Project hosted by the South African Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU) at the School of Economics, University of Cape Town.

The economics behind it implies that greater efficiency can be achieved if besides goods and services, the factors of production (i.e. capital and labour) can also move freely across a common market. Nevertheless, this setup was originally designed for an economic area where internal imbalances were modest. In fact, these freedoms have serious, originally unintended consequences in the 21st-century European Union (EU) where the original condition, even if implicit at that time, no longer applies. Nicholas Kaldor had actually warned about these threats many decades ago, saying that with the development of trade, initial differences among trading regions would grow in the absence of adequate compensating policies. Most lately, two large-scale events have accelerated intra-EU divergence and, consequently, migration: the Eastern enlargements and the recent financial and economic crisis.

In this setting there are two merger effects: the standard upward pricing pressure due to firms internalizing the substitution between the stand-alone products, and an additional effect where the firms internalize the impact of selling complements and reduce the price of the cocktail product.

In ancient times, the area of contemporary Germany was divided into a Roman and a non-Roman part. The study uses this division to test whether the formerly Roman part of Germany are more developed than the non-Roman part. This is done using the Limes Germanicus wall as geographical discontinuity in a regression discontinuity design framework. The results indicate that economic development-as measured by luminosity-is indeed significantly and robustly larger in the formerly Roman part of Germany. The study identifies the persistence of the Roman road network until the present as an important factor causing this developmental advantage of the formerly Roman part of Germany both by fostering city growth and by allowing for a denser road network.","[Wahl, Fabian] Univ Hohenheim, Wollgrasweg 49, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Wahl, F (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Wollgrasweg 49, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",fabian.wahl@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Wahl, Fabian/0000-0002-3479-7762",,,,,78,31,34,2,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

In each stage, besides the private signal, each player also observes actions taken by the winners of all previous stages as public signals. A unique equilibrium of the game is found and characterized. I then define the variances of three forms of gap: the gap between the average play and the underlying fundamental value, the gap between a generic player's action and the average play, and the gap between a generic player's action and the winner's play. By checking their dynamics in the equilibrium, it is shown that the accumulation of private signals always reduces the first variance and the accumulation of the public signals always reduces the second variance. However, the effects of accumulated public (private) signals on the first (second) variance are rather ambiguous. Based on a theoretical finding that expresses the third variance as a weighted sum of the other two, I conduct an empirical study on the Miss Korea pageant during 1994-2013. I find a descending trend in the variance of the gap between the average face and the underlying true beauty face over these years. Moreover, this process is accompanied by ascending trends in the other two variances, indicating that contestants' faces have been converging to the true beauty overall but diverging from each other over the two decades, which is consistent with our theoretical results.","[Yi, Ming] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Yi, M (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",yiming@hust.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HUST: 2016AB007],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The author would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments that greatly contributed to improving this paper.

We show that this local fertility norm has positive and significant effects on the fertility behavior, including the number of births; sex selection biased towards boys; and the education, employment status, and income of women. We also show that the gender gaps in education, labor supply, and income are significantly larger in regions where the belief of continuing the family line is stronger.

We focus on a large market of investment products targeted exclusively at households: retail structured products. These products typically offer a high return under their best-case scenario-the headline rate-that is nested in a complex payoff formula. Using a text analysis of the payoff formulas of the 55,000 products issued in Europe from 2002 to 2010, we measure product headline rates, complexity, and risk. Over this period, product headline rates depart from the prevailing interest rates as the latter decrease, complexity increases, and risky products become more common. In the cross section, the headline rate of a product is positively correlated with its level of complexity and risk. Higher headline rate, more complex, and riskier products appear more profitable to the banks distributing them. Our results suggest that financial complexity is a by-product of banks catering to yield-seeking investors.","[Celerier, Claire] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA USA",University of Toronto; Harvard University,"Célérier, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,Europlace; University of Zurich through its University Research Priority Program Financial Market Regulation,Europlace; University of Zurich through its University Research Priority Program Financial Market Regulation,"This study is based on Claire Celerier's dissertation submitted to the Toulouse School of Economics and on Boris Vallee's dissertation submitted to HEC Paris.

After reading a hypothetical scenario involving a debtor and a lender, survey respondents rate the degree of fairness that they attach to a third party's decision to allow debt relief. The experimental design varies (1) the responsibility of lenders and debtors in terms of whether their situations stem from bad luck or poor choices, (2) the salience of a lender's profit motive and (3) whether the debtor and the lender are individuals or corporations. The results show that debt relief is more likely to be found fair in a corporate context compared to a personalized context and that the factors that drive the perceived fairness of debt relief differ across corporate and personalized contexts. With corporate debt, debtor and lender responsibility are strongly, and consistently, linked to the perceived fairness of debt relief. With personalized debt, lender responsibility is never a significant driver of the perceived fairness of debt relief, and debtor responsibility only matters if the lender's profit motive is made salient.","[Chavanne, David] Connecticut Coll, Dept Econ, 270 Mohegan Av, New London, CT 06320 USA",Connecticut College,"Chavanne, D (通讯作者)，Connecticut Coll, Dept Econ, 270 Mohegan Av, New London, CT 06320 USA.",dchavann@conncoll.edu,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2017,70.0,3,,,,,381,401,,10.1111/kykl.12142,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ8QN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404992000002,0

Often the ideas adopted include present or inattention bias, both potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes. But these models also point to opportunities for effective, low-cost government policies that can have meaningful positive effects on people's long-term well-being. The last decade has been marked by a growing interest from governments the world over in using behavioural economics to inform policy decisions. This is true of Canada as well. In this paper we discuss the increasingly important role behavioural economics plays in Canadian public policy. We first contextualize government policies that have incorporated insights from behavioural economics by outlining a collection of models of intertemporal choice. We then present examples of public policy initiatives that are based upon findings in the field, placing particular emphasis on Canadian initiatives. We also document future opportunities, challenges and limitations.","[French, Robert] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada",Harvard University; University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada.",philip.oreopoulos@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,74,12,12,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Primary data were collected from a sample of 359 residents in two important Greek ports: Thessaloniki and Volos. Respondents' environmental attitude was measured with the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale. Economic values were derived from contingent valuation survey. Use of appropriate methods revealed three factors of environmental attitudes: man dominate to nature, anti-anthropocentrism and limits to growth. Significant relationships are found between NEP scale factors, socio-economic characteristics and individuals' opinions about biodiversity utility. Pro-environmental behavior is associated with higher NEP scores. A logistic regression setup the relation between people's willingness to pay (WTP) for marine biodiversity protection with their socio-economic characteristics and PCA results.

The literature suggests that any counterinsurgency strategy can have three effects: deterrence, incapacitation, and vengeance. Violence will increase if the vengeance effect outweighs the deterrence and incapacitation effects; if the deterrence and incapacitation effects are dominant, the reverse is true. Pakistan has used three types of counterinsurgency measures to curb violence: peace accords, military operations, and a combination of military assaults (operation Zarb-e-Azb) and the National Action Plan (NAP). Using data for the period 1974m1-2015m12, the results from Negative Binomial Regression models suggest that peace accords have no significant effect on violence, whereas military operations increase violence, suggesting the dominance of the vengeance effect. On the other hand, operation Zarb-e-Azb, complemented by the National Action Plan, generated a strong incapacitation effect, leading to a significant reduction in violence. The results are robust, and even stronger, for a subsample of the post-9/11 period. These findings support the notion that an effective counterterrorism strategy requires a well-executed military operation backed by strong political support.","[Rehman, Faiz Ur] Quaid I Azam Univ, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Nasir, Muhammad] Pakistan Inst Dev Econ, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France",Quaid I Azam University; Pakistan Institute of Development Economics; Montpellier Business School,"Nasir, M (通讯作者)，Pakistan Inst Dev Econ, Islamabad, Pakistan.",faiz@qau.edu.pk; nasir84@pide.org.pk; shahbazmohd@live.com,"Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019","Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997;",,,,,35,7,7,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The INDCs vary across nations, since national circumstances differ, including national incomes and damages. The INDCs follow a bottom-up approach, whereby nations submit their plans of actions in a Nash-like form (i.e., taking the other nations' plans as given). We build a model with normal goods and an unequal world income distribution to consider the endogenous formation and stability of an international environmental agreement (IEA) under the bottom-up approach. Nations provide carbon abatement and produce R&D efforts that promote improvements in environmental efficiency of their outputs. Nations share R&D efforts and enjoy R&D spillovers if they join an IEA. Non-members do not enjoy R&D spillovers. Global carbon abatement rises as the IEA expands in size due to the R&D spillovers. We show that the Grand Coalition is stable under a nearly perfectly equitable income distribution, where all nations make positive carbon abatement and R&D contributions. We also consider a more realistic world income distribution, in which some nations lack sufficient income to provide carbon abatement and R&D. In this case, the stable coalition contains all (wealthier) nations that make positive abatement and R&D contributions. For a very unequal world income distribution, not even a bilateral IEA, with the two richest nations in the world, is stable. The stable IEAs provide too little carbon abatement relative to the first best.","[Silva, Emilson C.

In a sample of 79 small-scale horticultural fishing communities in the Solomon Islands, and in samples of 186 to 1,265 societies across the world, we find that coral reef density systematically predicts the prevalence of matrilineal inheritance. Moreover, this result likely reflects adaptation of institutions to ecological conditions, as it holds within ethno-linguistic groups. Reef density explains as much as 10% of the variation in inheritance rules across villages in the Solomon Islands. Explanations based on the sexual division of labor and on inclusive fitness arguments support our results. We also document some of the demographic consequences of matrilineal inheritance, including smaller household and village population size, but find at best weak evidence that matrilineal inheritance translates into higher female economic or political agency.","[BenYishay, Ariel] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Grosjean, Pauline] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Vecci, Joe] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",William & Mary; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Gothenburg,"Grosjean, P (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",abenyishay@wm.edu; P.grosjean@unsw.edu.au; joseph.vecci@gu.se,,"Vecci, Joseph/0000-0002-2532-6897; grosjean, pauline/0000-0002-3623-8083",Australian Research Council [DP160100459]; University of New South Wales; Swedish Research Council [348-2014-4030]; UNSW,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); University of New South Wales; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); UNSW,"This work benefited from the collaboration of the Solomon Islands Ministry of Development, Planning and Aid Coordination (SIMDPAC) and the World Bank.

Treatments are time pressure within the task and distractions through a second task (a Stroop-task) that has to be performed as well and influences payment. We additionally measure stress levels through salivary cortisol and heart rate.

Specifically, using an international panel from 26 countries over the period 1990 to 2004, we find evidence that the general positive relation between capital gains taxes and expected returns becomes weaker or even reverses when (i) a firm's systematic risk is high, (ii) the market risk premium is high, or (iii) the risk-free rate is low. The results are particularly pronounced in countries with substantive changes in tax rates, more trust in government institutions, less integrated and less liquid capital markets, and lower foreign institutional ownership as well as around substantive increases and decreases in the risk parameters. We corroborate our findings in a single country setting, using the 1978,1997, and 2003 capital gains tax rate changes in the United States as events. Our results underscore the importance of macroeconomic and firm-specific factors in determining the effect of tax capitalization, and suggest that tax rate changes can sometimes have opposite valuation implications than what policymakers have in mind.

Conducting propensity score matching (PSM) techniques and differences-in-differences (DID) analysis, we find strong and robust evidence that the first OFDI promotes parent firm's productivity and this effect varies substantially with the firms' characteristics. In particular, firm's absorptive capacity is essential for the own-firm effect, and the absorptive capacity related with the product innovation is more important than that of the process innovation for the own firm effect.

Then, we figured out the changing trend and the causes of immigrant poverty under the perspective of multidimensional poverty. Based on the dual cutoff method and regression analysis, the study results show that the discrepancy of poverty before and after immigration is significant, but the poverty problem of immigrants in the TGRR is still serious. The current multi-poverty incidence of immigrants is 30.15%, which means that there are still 2.3097 million people under poverty. The major causes of poverty in this region are poverty in assets, poverty in education and poverty in health. The poverty contribution rate of land scarcity has increased from 12.16% to 29.52% with the deterioration of land loss, which has a negative effect on immigrants' livelihood. The results reveal several outstanding poverty problems in this region: the coverage of social security of immigrants is far from ideal; There are still 12.75% of the impoverished immigrants without medical insurance and 11.36% without pension insurance; the percentage of female laborers, the education level of laborers, the percentage of agricultural expenditure and the percentage of medical expenditure have significant correlations with immigrants' poverty in this region. The paper argues that the precise identification and targeting of poverty reduction in China should be undertaken from a multidimensional perspective.","[Liu, Yue; Shuai, Chuanmin] China Univ Geosci, Lumo Rd 388, Wuhan, Hubei Province, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Huimin] Hubei Prov Commun Investment Grp, Luoyu Rd 1077, Wuhan, Hubei Province, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Wuhan,"Shuai, CM (通讯作者)，China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, 388 Lumo Rd, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",450054682@qq.com; shuaicm@cug.edu.cn; zhoubin5377@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71473231],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 71473231).,,38,7,9,0,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Estimates of structural demand and supply reveal that the merger enhanced production efficiency of the merged party by 3.8%. Simulations, based on these estimates, indicate that while the merger increased domestic prices, the export volume of the merged party was more than doubled. Moreover, the effects of the merger are found to differ by auto model according to the model's pre-merger export status. It is shown that efficiency gains from the merger are likely to increase export volumes for models that were already exported prior to the merger, and to offset domestic market power for those that were not exported even after the merger. Finally, the paper compares the actual merger's effects to those of alternative counterfactual mergers, finding that the actual merger brought greater benefits to producers and fewer to domestic consumers.

This paper shows that this is possible if two conditions are met. First, people learn about the distribution of wage offers from the experience of their peers, and second, people believe that wage offers are stationary even though offers that arrive later tend to have higher wages than offers that arrive earlier. Peer groups can then end up with different stable beliefs that lead to intergroup wage differences. The non-stationarity of offers is rationalized in a model where firms can either advertise their job openings or not, and where advertised ones have more influence on more inexperienced job searchers. A statistic is proposed whose application to existing studies suggests that the non-stationarity considered here is present in data.","[Rotemberg, Julio J.] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University,"Rotemberg, JJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",,,,Harvard Business School Division of Research,Harvard Business School Division of Research,"I wish to thank Francis Kramarz, Pawel Krolikowski, Benjamin Schoefer, two anonymous referees and audiences at Ca' Foscari University, the Banque de France, the University of Michigan, and the NBER Summer Institute for comments.

Do reallocations with more flows tend to produce higher productivity growth? Does such a link appear at the expense of higher income inequality? We explore the rich evidence from earlier studies on worker flows in the period of massive and rapid labor reallocation, that is, the economic transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy in CEE. We have collected over 450 estimates of job flows from the literature and used these inputs to estimate the short-run and long-run relationship between labor market flows, labor productivity, and income inequality. We apply the tools typical for a meta-analysis to verify the empirical regularities between labor flows and productivity growth as well as income inequality. Our findings suggest only weak and short-term links with productivity, driven predominantly by business cycles. However, data reveal a strong pattern for income inequality in the short runmore churning during reallocation is associated with a level effect toward increased Gini indices.","[Tyrowicz, Joanna; van der Velde, Lucas] GRAPE, Warsaw, Poland; [Tyrowicz, Joanna; van der Velde, Lucas] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland; [Tyrowicz, Joanna] Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland; [Svejnar, Jan] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Svejnar, Jan] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Svejnar, Jan] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Svejnar, Jan] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England",University of Warsaw; Narodowy Bank Polski; Columbia University; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Tyrowicz, J (通讯作者)，GRAPE, Warsaw, Poland.;Tyrowicz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.;Tyrowicz, J (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland.",j.tyrowicz@uw.edu.pl,"Tyrowicz, Joanna/I-3270-2019; van der Velde, Lucas Augusto/ABC-5117-2021; Svejnar, Jan/H-2924-2014","Tyrowicz, Joanna/0000-0002-5928-332X; van der Velde, Lucas Augusto/0000-0002-3798-9305;",National Center for Science [UMO-2012/05/E/HS4/01506],"National Center for Science(National Science Centre, Poland)","Authors would like to thank the associate editor Hristos Doucouliagos as well as an anonymous referee for extremely valuable suggestions.

The results show that patterns of clustering or inhibition may be observed not as genuine phenomena but only as the effect of data imperfections.","[Arbia, Giuseppe] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Stat Sci, Rome, Italy; [Espa, Giuseppe; Giuliani, Diego; Dickson, Maria Michela] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; University of Trento,"Arbia, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Stat Sci, Rome, Italy.",giuseppe.arbia@unicatt.it,"arbia, giuseppe/AAD-1772-2022; Dickson, Maria Michela/AFR-3025-2022",,,,,,37,9,9,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

The novelty of the model lies in the endogenous production of energy with convex costs, explicit modeling of goods with different degrees of energy-dependency and sectoral price rigidities. Our analyses prescribe the desirable monetary responses to four types of energy price shocks, highlighting the distinct characteristics of each shock and affirming the need for diverse policy considerations. We also found several points of divergence in relation to previous studies on addressing energy supply shocks. In addition, we shed light on the role of sectoral price rigidities in the shocks' propagation.","[Bao Tan Huynh] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Huynh, BT (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",bthuynh.2010@phdecons.smu.edu.sg,,,,,,,24,2,2,2,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

In this paper, we focus on how the rise of institutional investors over the past several decades has transformed the corporate landscape and, in turn, the governance problems of the modern corporation. The rise of institutional investors has led to increased concentration of equity ownership, with most public corporations now having a substantial proportion of their shares held by a small number of institutional investors. At the same time, these institutions are controlled by investment managers, which have their own agency problems vis-a-vis their own beneficial investors. We develop an analytical framework for understanding the agency problems of institutional investors, and apply it to examine the agency problems and behavior of several key types of investment managers, including those that manage mutual funds-both index funds and actively managed funds-and activist hedge funds. We show that index funds have especially poor incentives to engage in stewardship activities that could improve governance and increase value. Activist hedge funds have substantially better incentives than managers of index funds or active mutual funds. While their activities may partially compensate, we show that they do not provide a complete solution for the agency problems of other institutional investors.","[Bebchuk, Lucian A.] Harvard Law Sch, Law Econ & Finance, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bebchuk, Lucian A.] Harvard Law Sch, Program Corp Governance, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cohen, Alma] Harvard Law Sch, Empir Practice, Cambridge, MA USA; [Cohen, Alma] Tel Aviv Univ, Eitan Berglas Sch Econ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hirst, Scott] Harvard Law Sch, Program Inst Investors, Cambridge, MA USA; [Hirst, Scott] Harvard Law Sch, Law, Cambridge, MA USA; [Bebchuk, Lucian A.; Cohen, Alma] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; Tel Aviv University; Harvard University; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bebchuk, LA (通讯作者)，Harvard Law Sch, Law Econ & Finance, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Bebchuk, LA (通讯作者)，Harvard Law Sch, Program Corp Governance, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Bebchuk, LA (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bebchuk@law.harvard.edu; alcohen@law.harvard.edu; shirst@law.harvard.edu,"Cohen, Alma/R-9690-2019; Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019; Hirst, Scott/GXH-6629-2022; Bebchuk, Lucian A./H-2735-2014","Hirst, Scott/0000-0003-0437-9196;",Harvard Law School,Harvard Law School,"The authors are grateful to Matthew Bodie, Robert Clark, John Coates, Stephen Davis, Einer Elhauge, Jesse Fried, Mark Gertler, Gordon Hanson, Kobi Kastiel, Reinier Kraakman, Enrico Moretti, Mark Roe, Robert Sitkoff, Holger Spamann, Timothy Taylor, and participants in three Harvard seminars and the American Law and Economics Association Annual Meeting for valuable suggestions; to David Mao and Gregory Shill for excellent research assistance; and to Harvard Law School for financial support.",,54,143,150,7,75,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In addition, high levels of ethnic fractionalization at a country level are generally associated with regional concentration of minorities, and as a result, many regions may have a very different ethnic composition from the national average, and in particular, they may have much higher levels of ethnic polarization than the national level. Because of the very different ethnic composition of different regions in this situation, conflict is more likely to be confined to a limited geographical area.","[Bleaney, Michael] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Dimico, Arcangelo] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",University of Nottingham; Queens University Belfast,"Bleaney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England.",michael.bleaney@nottingham.ac.uk; a.dimico@qub.ac.uk,"Dimico, Arcangelo/AAI-1536-2020",,,,,,42,11,13,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This strategy infers the incidence of SSCSs from the discontinuities in earnings distributions created by kink points in the SSC schedule. Using administrative data on earnings for the period 1976-2010, we study approximately 200 such kink points and do not find that they systematically induce a discontinuity in the distribution of gross earnings. This allows us to reject the hypothesis that SSCs are incident on workers, at least locally around kinks. Additionally, we exploit the large variations in SSC rates across kinks and years to estimate the local incidence of both employer and employee SSCs around these thresholds. We find that employer SSCs are shifted to employers while employee SSCs are shifted to employees. These findings are consistent with the economic incidence of SSCs being aligned with their statutory incidence, locally around kink points.","[Bozio, Antoine; Breda, Thomas; Grenet, Julien] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Bozio, Antoine] EHESS, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Breda, Thomas; Grenet, Julien] CNRS, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bozio, A (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.;Bozio, A (通讯作者)，EHESS, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",antoine.bozio@ipp.eu; thomas.breda@ens.fr; julien.grenet@psemail.eu,,"Bozio, Antoine/0000-0003-0201-6148",Agence nationale de la recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-ORAR-0004]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-ORAR-0004] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Agence nationale de la recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank participants of the Open research area (ORA) consortium from CPB, DIW, IFS and PSE.

Partnering with a charity that provides public goods locally, we conducted a field experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to one of four raffle treatments to examine the effectiveness of alternative incentive schemes designed to encourage either participation or volume. Contrary to theory which anticipates that gains can be made mostly on volume, our results indicate that significant revenue gains are available on both margins. Indeed, the large opportunity cost of using the standard linear raffle (in which the price per chance to win is fixed) that we find suggests the importance of mechanism design when considering the voluntary provision of public goods.

On the one hand, an increase in human capital directly affects economic growth by enhancing labor productivity in production. On the other hand, human capital is an important input into R&D and therefore increases labor productivity indirectly by accelerating technological change. In addition, different types of human capital such as basic and higher education or training-on-the-job might play different roles in both production and innovation activities. We merge individual data on valuable patents granted in Prussia in the late nineteenth-century with county-level data on literacy, craftsmanship, secondary schooling, and income tax revenues to explore the complex relationship between various types of human capital, innovation, and income. We find that the Second Industrial Revolution can be seen as a transition period when it comes to the role of human capital. As in the preceding First Industrial Revolution, useful knowledge embodied in master craftsmen was related to innovation, especially of independent inventors. As in the subsequent twentieth century, the quality of basic education was associated with both workers' productivity and firms' R&D processes. In a final step, we show that literacy had also a negative effect on fertility which increased with innovation. In general, our findings support the notion that the accumulation of basic human capital was crucial for the transition to modern economic growth.","[Cinnirella, Francesco] CEPR, CESifo, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Cinnirella, Francesco] Ifo Inst, CAGE, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Streb, Jochen] Univ Mannheim, L 7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",Ifo Institut; Ifo Institut; University of Mannheim,"Cinnirella, F (通讯作者)，CEPR, CESifo, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.;Cinnirella, F (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, CAGE, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",cinnirella@ifo.de; streb@uni-mannheim.de,"Cinnirella, Francesco/AAD-7443-2021","Streb, Jochen/0000-0001-7812-7923; Cinnirella, Francesco/0000-0001-8037-9230",,,,,90,73,78,9,82,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

We show that rank-dependent indicators of inequality can be highly sensitive to small changes in the socioeconomic variable when estimating inequality in samples consisting of countries with large differences in population weights. Since larger countries count more than smaller countries, changes in the former tend to have bigger effects than changes in the latter. When using rank-dependent indicators, however, the sensitivity to small changes in the variable which is used for ranking can be so extreme, that the indicator may suggest trend reversals in inequality which do not really exist. An empirical study shows that this is not a freak case. The use of rank-dependent indicators may therefore produce misleading results when it comes to the measurement of population-weighted between-country inequality. We propose a simple diagnostic test to check how sensitive rank-dependent indices are to small changes in the variable used for ranking.","[Erreygers, Guido] Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Antwerp, Belgium; [Erreygers, Guido; Clarke, Philip; Zheng, Qiong] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Hlth Policy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Antwerp; University of Melbourne,"Erreygers, G (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Antwerp, Belgium.;Erreygers, G (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Ctr Hlth Policy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",guido.erreygers@uantwerpen.be; philip.clarke@unimelb.edu.au; qiong.zheng@unimelb.edu.au,"Erreygers, Guido/L-7875-2016","Erreygers, Guido/0000-0002-4512-9567",,,,,23,4,4,1,9,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

This paper investigates, on the basis of a theoretical spatial model, the determinants of macroeconomic volatility of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in a panel of 257 NUTS-2 European regions in 1992-2008, considering positive and negative fluctuations separately. Evidence is found of strong positive spatial dependence, and of considerable asymmetric effects on macroeconomic volatility of sectoral output (its composition and concentration), of composition of aggregate demand, and of other regional/country characteristics. In particular, while public expenditure exerts a stabilizing effect on both types of fluctuations, financial depth amplifies negative fluctuations. Finally, inflation fluctuations and participation in European Monetary Union (EMU) appear to have no effect on macroeconomic volatility.","[Fiaschi, Davide] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy; [Gianmoena, Lisa] Marche Polytech Univ, Dept Management, Ancona, Italy; [Parenti, Angela] ICES, IMT Sch Adv Studies Lucca, Lucca, Italy",University of Pisa; Marche Polytechnic University; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,"Fiaschi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy.",davide.fiaschi@unipi.it; l.gianmoena@staff.univpm.it; angela.parenti@ec.unipi.it,"Gianmoena, Lisa/ABF-1176-2020","FIASCHI, DAVIDE/0000-0002-1992-7071",MIUR funding through the PRIN [2009H8WPX5],"MIUR funding through the PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))",This work was supported by MIUR funding through the PRIN [2009H8WPX5].,,87,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

Our reduced-form analysis suggests that the sign of the relation between real oil returns and real stock returns has changed over time, and that in the recent period this relation has turned positive since early 2007 (but started increasing since 2005). Based on our structural analysis, we find that oil-specific demand shocks have had positive effects on the US stock market since 2009 as opposed to oil supply shocks, which have no large effects on stock returns. We also show that the time variation in the parameters of the structural VAR is very well explained by the level of the US short-term interest rate and shifts in consumer confidence.

Sustainable consumption encourages to make rational choices and take responsibility for one's choices. Consumers take a number of decisions every day that affect not only them, but also cause externalities. There are many studies that indicate that consumers when buying goods and services are driven by environmental and ethical considerations. Purpose of the article: Changes occurring in the environment affect consumer behavior, leading to multiplicity of attitudes and changes in consumption trends. The article has shown consumer behavior in line with the concept of sustainable development against the background of trends in consumption in Poland. Methods: The basis for the discussion in the article will be: literature studies, available empirical studies, and our own results of the survey among respondents in Lubuskie voivodeship. Surveys using questionnaires were directed at 541 respondents. The number of correctly completed questionnaires was 500, and the figures contained in them were subjected to further analysis. Findings & Value added: Respondents in their purchasing choices are not guided by the influence of the consumption on the natural environment. However, in their behaviors we can notice some environmental measures, which stem from different reasons, depending on the socio-economic conditions.","[Kulyk, Piotr; Michalowska, Mariola; Patelska, Monika] Univ Zielona Gora, Zielona Gora, Poland",University of Zielona Gora,"Kulyk, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ Managemant, Ul Podgorna 50, PL-65246 Zielona Gora, Poland.",p.kulyk@wez.uz.zgora.pl,"Kułyk, Piotr/E-1583-2019; Michałowska, Mariola/ABB-7307-2021","Kułyk, Piotr/0000-0003-2786-4020; Michałowska, Mariola/0000-0002-6281-5446",,,,,14,5,5,1,7,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

The ' insertion ' practices of work integration social enterprises (WISEs) can be considered examples of such innovation efforts. The underlying rationales and institutional frameworks have been elaborated extensively in social economy scholarship. However, as WISEs are frequently reported to fall victim to pressures towards isomorphism or capture' by incumbent institutional structures, transitions theory seems worthwhile to invoke in order to develop a dynamic understanding of these processes. As illustrated through case study data on the Flemish social economy, it is highlighted how ' insertion ' displays longitudinal dynamics of institutional capture that are similar to those observed in sustainability transitions more generally.

The cluster analysis for the years 2002, 2007, and 2012 grouped the countries according to the range of economic development indicators showing within-EU cohesion before the EU enlargement, after the enlargement wave, and after the crisis. The findings show that a decrease in the development differences after the enlargement was replaced with an increase in these differences after the crisis, thus contributing to the existing debate about the success of cohesion and future of European integration. These results are somewhat worrying for the new member states of the EU as well as for EU membership candidates and their prospective development within the integration.","[Recher, Vedran] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Kurnoga, Natasa] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Recher, V (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.",vrecher@eizg.hr; nkurnoga@eizg.hr,"Recher, Vedran/ABA-8713-2021; Kurnoga, Natasa/I-2568-2018","Kurnoga, Natasa/0000-0002-0055-7752",,,,,50,8,8,1,18,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

This paper analyzes the relationship between energy (or emissions) and value added (or GDP) from a different viewpoint, namely from the demand rather than the production perspective, using the input-output (I-O) framework. The aggregate embodied intensity (AEI), defined as the ratio of embodied energy (or emissions) to embodied value added, can be defined at the aggregate, final demand category and sectoral levels. The total aggregate intensity can be presented as a weighted sum of the AEIs at the final demand category or sectoral level. Changes of the AEI at different levels can be decomposed to identify the driving forces using multiplicative SDA. A study using the latest 2007 and 2012 datasets of China indicates that (a) its aggregate intensity of CO2 emissions was mainly determined by the AEI in investment and (b) the emission intensity effect generally contributed the most to the AEI ratio changes at different levels. The proposed framework can be applied to other aggregate intensity indicators and extended to multi-country/region analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This present paper adopts the viewpoint that not only the size and composition of carbon footprints are relevant but also the border-crossing frequency associated with these carbon footprints, which is defined as the number of borders a product crosses in a supply chain; this process will affect the spatial accounting of the carbon emissions produced to support the economic activity. The calculation of border-crossing frequencies of carbon footprint is accomplished by decomposing the Leontief inverse matrix derived from the world input-output database. We find that the aggregated average border crossing frequencies of carbon footprints show an increasing tendency, which is influenced by the economic crisis obviously. The policy application focuses on the United States, which we assume to levy carbon tariffs on foreign emissions embodied in imports. We find that the indirect carbon tariff on emissions embodied in international trade take a significant share. The border carbon adjustments are mainly targeted at emissions generated in China, which also pays the greatest share of the tariff burden. The implication of carbon tariffs faces the problem of multiple taxation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

First, we ask whether the online distribution channel has increased total sales, or only diverted sales from traditional channels. We find that there is a market expansion effect but also a considerable sales diversion. Second, we ask to which extent consumers and firms benefited from the introduction of the online sales channel. We find that consumers benefited proportionately more, and this is entirely due to the appearance of an additional distribution channel and not due to increased competition. Third, we ask how the online channel has affected European market integration. We find that price differences between the EU countries for identical products are large both in the traditional channel and online. Therefore, the introduction of e-commerce did not influence price levels and international price dispersion in the traditional channel. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Using a novel instrumental-variable approach that exploits an exogenous shock to the US Catholic school system, we show that the positive correlation between Catholic school attendance and student outcomes is explained by selection bias. Spearheaded by the universal call to holiness, the reforms that occurred at the Second Vatican Council produced a dramatic exogenous change in the cost/benefit ratio of religious life in the Catholic Church. Using the abrupt decline in the number of Catholic sisters as an instrument for Catholic school attendance, we find no evidence of positive effects on student outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Unusual in such cases, the editors are the major protagonists in the debate. In the symposium Ng maintains that second-best theory appears to preclude giving theory-based policy advice because full second-best optima can never be determined in practical cases. While agreeing about second-best optima, Lipsey disagrees with Ng's conclusion regarding policy and discusses the development of context-specific policies not based on the theory of optimal resource allocation. To allow for theory-based policy, Ng offers his theory of third best. The major disagreement over this theory concerns its proposition: first-best rules for third-best worlds under Informational Poverty (not enough is known to determine the desirable direction of change of some the policy variable from the first-best value). Lipsey argues that, if correct, this rule would upset the main result of second-best theory that the sign of the change in the objective function may be either positive or negative when first-best rules are fulfilled piecemeal in second-best worlds. Woo supports Ng's third-best theory and derives additional rules, while Boadway surveys the application of second-best theory in several cases from the literature of public economics.","[Lipsey, Richard G.] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Ng, Yew-Kwang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore",Simon Fraser University; Nanyang Technological University,"Ng, YK (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore, Singapore.",ykng@ntu.edu.sg,"Ng, Yew-Kwang/AAM-1664-2021","Ng, Yew-Kwang/0000-0001-5669-9883",,,,,9,0,0,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

I document that expected returns, or risk premia, increase substantially in financial crises, but not in the other episodes. Asset prices decline in all episodes, but the decline in financial crises is substantially larger than the decline in fundamentals so that expected returns going forward are large. However, drops in consumption and consumption volatility are fairly similar across financial crises and recessions and are largest during wars, so asset pricing models based on aggregate consumption have trouble matching these facts. Comparing crises to deep recessions strengthens these findings further. By disentangling financial crises from other bad macroeconomic times, the results suggest that financial crises are particularly important to understanding why risk premia vary. I discuss implications for theory more broadly and discuss both rational and behavioral models that are consistent with the facts. Theories where asset prices are related to the health of the financial sector appear particularly promising.","[Muir, Tyler] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Muir, Tyler] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Muir, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.;Muir, T (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,71,56,67,2,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Manipulation is revealed through bunching of procurements just below the thresholds in construction works and services, and to a lesser degree, in goods.

This conjecture is formalized and tested in a noisy trust game where I vary the extentto which trust can be credibly signaled. I find that the introduction of noise threatens the onset of trust relations and induces players to form more pessimistic beliefs. Therefore policies that increase transparency of the decision-making environment may foster prosociality.

Specifically, we demonstrate that the rate refund policy causes pipelines effectively to extort ratepayers through the addition of economically inefficient capital investment, akin to gold-plating investments. We estimate the potential magnitude of this arbitrage impact on ratepayers to be between $400 and $700 million annually. Counterintuitively, however, we demonstrate that the presence of this arbitrage opportunity leads to underinvestment in pipeline capacity, thus negating one of the principal purposes of rate regulation. We further demonstrate that FERC could easily eliminate this regulatory arbitrage by setting the refund interest rate to the pipeline's as-filed weighted average cost of capital.","[Briden, George] Snake Hill Energy Resources Inc, North Scituate, RI USA; [Lesser, Jonathan] Continental Econ Inc, Sandia Pk, NM 87047 USA",,"Lesser, J (通讯作者)，Continental Econ Inc, Sandia Pk, NM 87047 USA.",jlesser@continentalecon.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In this paper, we measure the inequality of the distribution of equivalent incomes, which is a preference-sensitive multidimensional wellbeing measure. To quantify the contribution of preference heterogeneity to wellbeing inequality, we use a decomposition method that calculates wellbeing inequality in different counterfactual distributions. We focus on four sources of wellbeing inequality: the correlation between outcomes and preferences, the preference heterogeneity, the correlation between the outcome dimensions, and the inequality within each of the outcome dimensions. We find that preference heterogeneity accounts for a considerable part of overall wellbeing inequality in Russia for the period 1995-2005.","[Decancq, Koen] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Decancq, Koen] LSE, London, England; [Decancq, Koen; Schokkaert, Erik] KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of Antwerp; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; KU Leuven; Princeton University,"Decancq, K (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.;Decancq, K (通讯作者)，LSE, London, England.;Decancq, K (通讯作者)，KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium.",,"Fleurbaey, Marc/HHS-9231-2022; Decancq, Koen/AAD-4756-2022","Schokkaert, Erik/0000-0003-0981-3449; Decancq, Koen/0000-0002-5822-845X",,,,,38,13,14,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2017,84.0,334,,,SI,,210,238,,10.1111/ecca.12231,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ER1VL,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398583000004,0

We examine the impact of salt iodization on cognitive outcomes in the United States by taking advantage of this natural geographic variation. Salt was iodized over a short period of time beginning in 1924. We use military data collected during World War I and World War II to compare outcomes of cohorts born before and after iodization in localities that were naturally poor and rich in iodine. We find that for the one-quarter of the population most deficient in iodine this intervention raised intelligence quotient (IQ) by approximately one standard deviation. Our results can explain roughly one decade's worth of the upward trend in IQ in the United States (the Flynn effect).

Keynes was right (so far) about output per capita, but wrong about the workweek. The key reason is that he failed to allow for changing distribution. With widening inequality, median income (and therefore the income of most families) has risen, and is now rising, much more slowly than he anticipated. The failure of the workweek to shrink as he predicted follows. Other factors, including habit formation, socially induced consumption preferences, and network effects are part of the story too.

The main assumption about individuals' preferences over stable currencies underlines the whole paper with emphasis on the mathematical model. The outcome of the model reveals lower inflation rate in scenario with competition among currencies in comparison to the present scenario. This result by itself seems to favour the idea of an exclusion of legal tender clause and allowance of free currency competition.

This analysis applies to the aggregate economy as well as to nine economic sectors. Methods: A new database, LA-KLEMS, is used that will serve as a fundamental tool for empirical and theoretical research in the area of economic growth and productivity for Latin America. The variables are organized around the growth accounting methodology, which provides a clear conceptual framework for consistent analysis of interaction between the variables. The LA-KLEMS figures highlight discrepancies between countries and give a new perspective to understand how the series evolve over time. Results: Results show that the sluggish economic growth is basically driven by the negative contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) in all countries and in almost all sectors, despite the investment efforts made in the last 20 years. Latin American countries face a genuine problem of productivity, as the shift-share analysis shows. Conclusions: The problems of TFP are common to all industries and do not seem to be driven by structural change, that is the reallocation of resources from low to high productive industries.","[Hofman, Andre; Aravena, Claudio] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Santiago, Chile; [Mas, Matilde; Fernandez de Guevara, Juan] Univ Valencia, IVIE, Valencia, Spain; [Aravena, Claudio] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Santiago de Chile; University of Valencia,"Hofman, A (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Santiago, Chile.",andre.hofman53@gmail.com; matilde.mas@ivie.es; claudio.aravena@cepal.org; juan.fernandez@ivie.es,"Fernández de Guevara-Radoselovics, Juan Francisco/I-1996-2012; Mas, Matilde/I-2337-2012","Fernández de Guevara-Radoselovics, Juan Francisco/0000-0003-0590-612X; Mas, Matilde/0000-0003-1151-099X",,,,,42,7,7,0,33,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

In a model with spatial energy intensity differences and nontradables, labor demand shifts, while explaining the response of average wages to oil supply shocks, have counterfactual implications for the response of wage dispersion.

We provide additional empirical evidence of regionally directed worker reallocation and housing prices consistent with our spatial model.

The present paper makes a pioneering attempt to estimate the macro impact of microfinance in Bangladesh. The expansion of microfinance constitutes an important dimension of financial development, which can affect the real economy through multiple channels. The present paper examines how microfinance has affected the gross domestic product (GDP) of Bangladesh by operating through a number of such channels viz., capital accumulation, productivity improvement, and reallocation of capital and labor among different sectors. A static Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model has been used in order to capture these transmission mechanisms. The study estimates that microfinance has added somewhere between 8.9% and 11.9% to the GDP of the country depending on the assumptions made about the working of the labour market. The contribution to rural GDP is even higher - between 12.6% and 16.6%. There is scope to refine these estimates further in future research by including additional transmission mechanisms and employing a dynamic version of the CGE model.","[Raihan, Selim; Khalily, M. A.

A two-stepped approach is adopted: first a battery of forecasting errors (MAE, RMSE, MASE) is calculated, complementary to evaluation papers already available. Then statistical analysis is carried out by comparing both MF and CNB forecasts with OECD, European Commission and consensus benchmarks (Kruskal-Wallis test), assessing the presence of systemic bias (Wilcoxon test) and determining their incremental improvement (Page trend test). The results show that although some error patterns might suggest performance deficiencies (i.e. during the recession periods), the accuracy of forecasts prepared by both the MF and CNB does not differ significantly from the benchmark forecasts; MF and CNB predictions do not contain systemic bias and their accuracy improves as the horizon shortens. The paper also highlights several methodological shortcomings in the internal evaluations conducted by both institutions, indicating a potential for further improvement.","[Sindelar, Jiri] Univ Finance & Adm, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Sindelár, J (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Prague, Czech Republic.",jiri.sindelar@vsfs.cz,,"Sindelar, Jiri/0000-0002-1476-8235",,,,,29,1,1,0,6,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The analysis finds that firms' decision-malting on engagement in corruption can be affected vertically by their own past experience of bribing bureaucrats and horizontally by the contagion effects of neighbors' observed malfeasance, while there is substantial regional heterogeneity. Moreover, these horizontal contagion effects are nonlinear depending on the distance between neighbors. We also identify three channels underlying osmosis of corruption: firms' geographic networks, information exposure, and local marketization. The strongest contagion effect appears in the eastern region, indicating that petty firm corruption can develop into a systematic phenomenon. More practical anti-corruption policies call for cooperation in design and implementation across administrative areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We document the sources that contributed to the rise in long-term unemployment and analyze its persistence using state-of-the-art duration models. We find pervasive evidence of negative duration dependence, while personal characteristics such as mature age, lack of experience, and entitlement to unemployment benefits are key to understand the cross-sectional differences in the incidence of long-term unemployment. The negative impact of low levels of skill and education is muted by the large share of temporary contracts, but once we restrict attention to employment spells lasting at least 1 month these factors also contribute to a higher risk of long-term unemployment. Surprisingly, workers from the construction sector do not fare worse than similar workers from other sectors. Finally, self-reported reservation wages are found to respond strongly to the cycle, but much less to individual unemployment duration. In view of these findings, we argue that active labor market policies should play a more prominent role in the fight against long-term unemployment while early activation should be used to curb inflows.","[Bentolila, Samuel] CEMFI, Casado Alisal 5, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Ignacio Garcia-Perez, J.] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Ignacio Garcia-Perez, J.] FEDEA, Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Jansen, Marcel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fedea, Ciudad Univ Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Jansen, Marcel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, IZA, Ciudad Univ Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Bentolila, S (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Casado Alisal 5, Madrid 28014, Spain.",bentolila@cemfi.es; jigarper@upo.es; marcel.jansen@uam.es,"Garcia Perez, J Ignacio/JWP-2410-2024; Garcia Perez, Jose Ignacio/D-2755-2009; Bentolila, Samuel/D-8737-2014","Garcia Perez, Jose Ignacio/0000-0002-9074-7313; Bentolila, Samuel/0000-0001-8384-1080","MINECO/FEDER [ECO2015-65408-R, ECO2015-69631-P]",MINECO/FEDER,"This is a revised version of the Presidential Address delivered by the first author at the 40th Simposio de la Asociacion Espanola de Economia in Girona.

In practice, the EU ETS is mainly a financial market used for hedging and speculation. This financial feature is regarded as a solution (hedging and liquidity) to a problem (the price risk and volatility imposed on installations) which the market has actually created itself. This paper provides an estimation of the real underpinning of the scheme, i.e. the needs of installations for allowances transfers to achieve compliance in the two first exchange periods. This estimation, which was singularly lacking in the literature, shows that compliance transactions become more and more marginal as market activity grows, and they are drowned in a whirlpool of speculation. This challenges the role of the carbon price, whether it reveals a financial and self-referential evaluation rather than the installations' marginal abatement costs, the condition of cost-effectiveness expected from carbon trading.","[Berta, Nathalie; Gautherat, Emmanuelle; Gun, Ozgur] Univ Reims, F-51100 Reims, France; [Berta, Nathalie] Univ Paris 01, CES, Paris, France; [Gautherat, Emmanuelle] Paristech, CREST, Paris, France",Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Berta, N (通讯作者)，Univ Reims, F-51100 Reims, France.;Berta, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, CES, Paris, France.",nathalie.berta@univ-reims.fr,,,,,,,54,18,18,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We offer a novel explanation of this anomaly based on real options, which is consistent with earlier findings on idiosyncratic volatility (the positive contemporaneous relation between firm-level stock returns and idiosyncratic volatility). Our approach is based on introducing stochastic idiosyncratic cash flow risk into an equity valuation model of firms with growth options. Within our model, a firm's systematic risk depends on the delta of its growth option. The growth option's delta is lower when idiosyncratic volatility rises, driving down the firm's systematic risk and hence its expected return firms with higher idiosyncratic volatility therefore have lower expected returns. Our model additionally offers the following novel empirical predictions: (i) returns correlate positively with idiosyncratic volatility during intervals between large changes in idiosyncratic volatility (the switch effect), and (ii) the anomalies and the switch effect are stronger for firms with more real options and which undergo larger changes in idiosyncratic volatility. Empirical results support the predictions of our model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It develops linked models to capture connections between resource stocks and ows and the resulting microeconomic and macroeconomic impacts. A bioeconomic model is developed that is imbedded into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Incorporating imperfect regulation, the bioeconomic model characterizes optimal policies, while the CGE model explores the economy-wide consequences of possible changes to the ecosystem. The model is parameterized and calibrated to the case of the Serengeti ecosystem which is perhaps the most intensively researched biome with a relative abundance of data. This ecosystem is also undergoing rapid change from a host of factors related to developments within and around the protected area system. The analysis identifies the contribution of the ecosystem to the economy and finds that changes in tourism and bushmeat hunting have surprisingly diffuse economy-wide impacts, that are especially large in the rural sector. To guard against overstatement, ecosystem impacts are under-stated relative to other effects. The results suggest that linkages to the natural resource sector (backward and forward multipliers) are important and neglecting these may lead to biased estimates. (C) 2017 The World Bank.

Both factors reflect powerful adverse forces that are largely unrelated to the financial crisis and recession-and that were in play before the recession.","[Fernald, John G.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Hall, Robert E.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Stock, James H.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Watson, Mark W.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; Stanford University; Harvard University; Princeton University,"Fernald, JG (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",,"Reichlin, Lucrezia/J-9024-2015",,,,,,61,52,58,0,5,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.
