This study compared methods of accounting for attribute non-attendance (ANA) in WTP for food product attributes. Both inferred and stated ANA were studied and estimates of WTP for pork chop and bacon attributes were compared. A larger number of significant differences were found between stated or inferred ANA corrected models than between corrected and uncorrected models. Significant correlations between inferred and stated ANA were not present and WTP estimates from correcting for inferred ANA (IANA) or stated ANA were statistically different from one another. Exploring WTP estimates across ANA corrected models is imperative for improving models to provide insight into consumer preferences. These insights can be used in making production decisions in order to meet consumer demands and inconsistent results can lead to conflicting business decisions.,"[Bir, Courtney; Cummins, Ann M.; Widmar, Nicole Olynk] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 West State St, Lafayette, IN 47909 USA; [Wolf, Christopher A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr,Rm 307,Justin S Morrill Hall Agr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Michigan State University,"Bir, C (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 West State St, Lafayette, IN 47909 USA.",birc@purdue.edu,"Wolf, Christopher A/G-6418-2013","Bir, Courtney/0000-0003-0862-8241",,,,,47,3,4,1,1,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

We use three measures of forest user group collective action, including membership in the Nepal Community Forestry Programme (CFP). Collective action shows large, positive, and statistically significant carbon effects vis-avis communities exhibiting no evidence of forest collective action, which do not necessarily correspond with results for other measures of forest quality. We find that depending on the collective action definition and physiographic region, forests controlled by communities exhibiting no evidence of forest collective action may have as little as 34% of the carbon of forests governed under collective action. We do not, however, find evidence that CFP forests, our narrowest measure of collective action, store more carbon than forests outside the CFP. Our results therefore suggest that it is the collective action behavior and not the official CFP label that offers the largest gains. Carbon benefits from collective action are therefore not found to be conditional on CFP participation. (C) 2017 The World Bank. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

But they are often also the precursors to deforestation and other adverse environmental impacts. This paper examines the road-induced tradeoffs between economic growth, deforestation, and biodiversity loss in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Decades of conflict have left the DRC's transport infrastructure among the sparsest and most dilapidated in the world. Most of the provincial capitals are unconnected to the capital city, and improving road connectivity could lead to a significant boost in trade and economic growth. At the same time the DRC is also home to the second largest rainforest in the world. The iconic Congo forests are a trove of ecological value-some monetizable and most that is not. So the destruction of the DRC's forests will have significant environmental ramifications. We provide empirical estimates of the economic benefits of improving market access and reducing transportation costs. We then estimate a forest destruction function to assess the impact that new or improved roads have on forest clearing. In addition, a novel biodiversity index is developed to identify forests of high biodiversity significance. Two simulations are performed to quantitatively demonstrate the impacts of road improvement projects in terms of increased GDP, forest loss, and biodiversity that are put at risk. To our knowledge, this is the first study to jointly examine the economic benefits and ecological risks to infrastructure investments. It is envisioned that the methods employed here can be used to guide future infrastructure investments toward designs which have a large economic impact while minimizing ecological risks.

In this research, we overcome this problem by analyzing an environment where the behavior of both the regulator and regulated parties are publicly available. Specifically, we utilize data from the National Hockey League (NHL) to examine the impact of general experience as a referee as well as experience refereeing a particular team on the assignation of penalties. We find that gaining general experience as a referee significantly reduces the number of penalties that a referee assigns. However, as a referee gains experience refereeing a specific team, they significantly reduce the number of penalties assessed to this team relative to teams that they have less experience refereeing, confirming that regulatory capture is observed among referees and teams in the NHL.

However, the effect of food standards-as a particular important non-tariff measure-on agricultural trade flows remains unclear. We contribute to the debate with a unique dataset that contains the number of food processing firms of 87 countries from 2008 to 2013 that are certified with the International Featured Standard (IFS). We estimate a gravity model using the one-year lag of IFS as well as IFS certification in neighboring countries as an instrument to address potential endogeneity. We find that IFS increases c. p. bilateral exports on average of seven agricultural product categories in both specifications. However, the effect remains robust only for high- and middle-income countries and disappears for low-income countries. Hence, while IFS increases exports on average, low-income countries do not benefit in terms of higher export volumes. Moreover, once we separate the dataset by sector, the trade-enhancing effect remains for bakery, dairy, and beverage sectors only. Overall, we argue that food standards are not a suitable development tool to integrate low-income countries into high-value chains per se. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors test how such a directional goal affects risk perceptions and the relation between risk perceptions and assessments of value in an investment context. Compared with investors without directional goalswho, consistent with prior behavioral research, focus on negative aspects of riskthe authors find that those with directional goals assess risk as being more symmetric (i.e., they are less focused on downside risk). However, investors with directional goals are also less likely to consider risk when assessing value. Taken together, these results suggest that a directional goal reduces one behavioral effect identified in prior literature (the tendency to focus on downside risk), but creates another behavioral effect (ignoring risk in assessing value). The authors discuss implications for standard setters and regulators seeking to communicate risk information to market participants.","[Elliot, W.

Findings of this study would assist in the formulation of an innovative investment structure based on iREIT waqf that is both practical and appealing to the widest pool of investors, and further contribute towards the development of the waqf sector.","[Embi, Nor Azizan Che; Ramlee, Roslily] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Finance, Kulliyyah Econ & Management Sci, POB 10, Kuala Lumpur 50728, Malaysia; [Kassim, Salina] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, IIUM Inst Islamic Banking & Finance, POB 10, Kuala Lumpur 50728, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia; International Islamic University Malaysia,"Embi, NAC (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Finance, Kulliyyah Econ & Management Sci, POB 10, Kuala Lumpur 50728, Malaysia.",izanebbm@iium.edu.my,,,"NAPREC grant allocation, Finance Ministry of Malaysia under 10th Malaysia Plan (2011-2015) [SP13-006-0128]","NAPREC grant allocation, Finance Ministry of Malaysia under 10th Malaysia Plan (2011-2015)","This work was supported by the NAPREC grant allocation, Finance Ministry of Malaysia (Project Id SP13-006-0128) under 10th Malaysia Plan (2011-2015).",,4,0,0,1,2,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,831,839,,10.18502/kss.v3i13.4251,0.0,,,9,Business; Economics; Religion,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Religion,BS3YS,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000716967900058,0

We show that the answer is affirmative if trade increases the variety of goods and the resource is harvested under open access. Then there is increased likelihood of collapse both as a steady-state outcome and following shocks to the stock. Two separate mechanisms underlie the results. (1) Trade gives resource harvesters access to new varieties of goods. To enable buying these goods, they exert more harvesting effort. (2) The resource constitutes a new variety for other countries, implying that the resource price increases with trade openness, especially when the stock is small, which makes the resource exclusive. Unlike in the existing literature, which predicts that trade cannot lead to collapse, each of our two mechanisms can cause collapse and they both increase the vulnerability to shocks. We present several examples of collapses that can plausibly be attributed to each of the mechanisms.","[Gars, Johan] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, POB 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Spiro, Daniel] Oslo Business Sch, POB 4 St, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Spiro, Daniel] Oslo Ctr Res Environm Friendly Energy CREE, Oslo, Norway",Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Global Economic Dynamics & Biosphere - The Erling-Persson Family Academy Program,"Gars, J (通讯作者)，Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, POB 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden.",johan.gars@kva.se; daniel.spiro.ec@gmail.com,,"Gars, Johan/0000-0002-2303-1964; Spiro, Daniel/0000-0002-6819-832X",Erling-Persson Family Foundation,Erling-Persson Family Foundation,"Johan Gars is at the Global Economic Dynamics and the Biosphere, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, PO Box 50005, 104 05 Stockholm, Sweden (johan.gars@kva.se).

We use a variety of state-level data sources, together with a general equilibrium spatial model of the United States to systematically construct a panel dataset of state-level land use restrictions between 1950 and 2014. We show that these restrictions have generally tightened over time, particularly in California and New York. We use the model to analyze how these restrictions affect economic activity and the allocation of workers and capital across states. Counterfactual experiments show that deregulating existing urban land from 2014 regulation levels back to 1980 levels would have increased US GDP and productivity roughly to their current trend levels. California, New York, and the Mid-Atlantic region expand the most in these counterfactuals, drawing population out of the South and the Rustbelt. General equilibrium effects, particularly the reallocation of capital across states, account for much of these gains. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A standard GTAP Model was aggregated by 19 sectors and 16 countries/regions. The results showed that (a) Brunei Darussalam, Thailand, and Cambodia have the highest rice NTMs based on estimation of tariff equivalent calculation and (b) imposing ASEAN rice NTM lead to negative effects on Indonesian food security.

If a predictive regression is intended as a motivational building block for theoretical modelling, and the R-square bound is violated, one should recognize that the implied returns process violate long-term mean reversion.

Using a detailed archival study of a fraud by a manufacturing firm (Kelon), we propose that an audit failure by one Big 4 firm hurts not only itself and shareholders of its clients, but also competing Big 4 firms and their clients. Unlike results in developed countries, clients of both the failing auditor (Deloitte) and other foreign (Big 4) auditors experience more negative stock market reactions than local non-Big 4 auditors' clients at the disclosure event pertaining to Kelon. Negative effects are more pronounced for companies in Kelon's industry. Shareholder losses are moderated by government ownership. Furthermore, companies are less likely to switch to other Big 4 auditors after disclosure of the fraud case. Our results are robust to additional analyses, including controls for self-selection of Big 4 auditors.","[Jamal, Karim] Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Liu, Qiliang; Luo, Le] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",University of Alberta; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Liu, QL (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",lql533@163.com,,,"University of Alberta; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); National Natural Science Foundation of China [71172206, 71328201]; Huazhong University of Science and Technology [0118300100]",University of Alberta(University of Alberta); Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"This work was supported by the University of Alberta; the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71172206], [grant number 71328201]; the Huazhong University of Science and Technology [grant number 0118300100].",,41,0,0,3,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The data used in this study were obtained from a farm-level survey of 139 small-scale raspberry farmers. A stochastic production frontier model was used to evaluate the association between TE, extension, training and farmers' decisions to sell their production directly to the agro-industry or indirectly through an informal middleman. The empirical results show that the decision to sell raspberries using informal channels is negatively associated with farm productivity and revenues. The analysis also reveals a positive relationship between TE and income among experienced and trained farmers. Implementing food quality and safety standards was also found decisive in increasing farm income.

In the present conditions local budgets find themselves in the difficult situations when the income is reduced while social expenses are constantly rising. Local budget deficit is closely connected with a prominent level of fiscal centralization in Russia. We analyze the possibility to transfer any tax income to the local level considering the requirements to the transferable taxes. The corporate property tax (CPT) remains the only tax for such a transfer at the moment. This tax income would be substantial for the local budgets, and the tax base of this tax is distributed relatively fair. The analysis shows that tax income from the CPT does not depend on the price changes of hydrocarbon raw materials and the inflation. The main disadvantage of CPT is a natural limit of possible revenue, but this limit can be overcome by basing property taxation on cadastral value. The analysis demonstrated that the country's average increase of tax base is 17. 9 %, and the region's average is 13 %. Thus, it can be supposed that the tax base of CPT will increase by not less than 13 % if the cadastral property estimation is applied. The conclusion is made that transferring up to 20% of total revenue of corporate property tax to local budgets will ensure the growth of municipal entities budget revenues and will not lead to a significant reduction in the budget revenues of the region.","[Kireenko, Anna; Khoroshavina, Ekaterina] Baikal State Univ, Dept Taxat & Customs, Lenina 11, Irkutsk, Russia; [Pinskaya, Milyausha; Donchenko, Vladislav] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Dept Tax Policy & Custom Regulat, 4th Veshnyakovsky 4, Moscow, Russia",Baikal State University; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation,"Kireenko, A (通讯作者)，Baikal State Univ, Dept Taxat & Customs, Lenina 11, Irkutsk, Russia.",sw.tpk.rt@mail.ru; MPinskaya@fa.ru; kireenko.e@list.ru; vladdonchenko@gmail.com,"Kireenko, Anna P/C-3219-2017; Pinskaya, Milyausha/AAF-9477-2020",,Russian Foundation for Basic Research [17-22-01002/17],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),The article is processed as an output of a research project Elaboration the Tax Experiments in the System of Tax Avoidance Counteraction for the Economic Security Provision in the Russian Federation and Belarus registered by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research under the registration number No17-22-01002/17.,,18,0,0,0,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2283-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,67,75,,,,,,9,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL8FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456200200009,0

The paper identifies rules and norms underpinning traditionalism. It further addresses how increased land-use efficiency can be supported while maintaining communal land ownership. Information collected from in-depth interviews was analysed based on new institutional economics (NIE) theory. I argue that the government, adat leaders, the Catholic Church, leading businesses, and internationally funded NGOs are organisations contributing to the status quo. Policy recommendations include awareness among international donors of what NGOs really do. Civil society organisations could contribute to a more efficient and democratic government and less feudalist traditional leadership. A government tax on fertile land could form the basis for a cadastre system, secure farmers' permanent land-user rights, and also enhance land productivity, without reducing the values of a rich culture based on communal land.","[Kristiansen, Stein] Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway; [Kristiansen, Stein] Gadjah Mada Univ, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",University of Agder; Gadjah Mada University,"Kristiansen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway.;Kristiansen, S (通讯作者)，Gadjah Mada Univ, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",,,,Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its embassy in Jakarta,Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its embassy in Jakarta,"I am indebted to Emilianus Yakob Sese Tolo for his efforts in travelling with me and collecting data in Flores and elsewhere in Indonesia.

At the same time, the negative effect of lawsuit is more significant than the positive effect of the executive's red-hat status.","[Li, Yongkui; Mao, Yanji; Chen, Zhiying] Southwest Univ Polit Sci & Law, Econ Sch, Chongqing 401120, Peoples R China",Southwest University of Political Science & Law - China,"Li, YK (通讯作者)，Southwest Univ Polit Sci & Law, Econ Sch, Chongqing 401120, Peoples R China.",,,,"Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund, China [17YJC790083]; Youth Foundation of Southwest University of Political Science Law [2017XZQN-15]","Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund, China; Youth Foundation of Southwest University of Political Science Law","This study was supported by Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund, China (No. 17YJC790083) and Youth Foundation of Southwest University of Political Science & Law (No. 2017XZQN-15).",,8,0,0,1,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-574-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,66.0,,,,,,522,527,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448284700082,0

We find that large, diversified publicly traded firms increase their scope during times of high external capital market frictions, such as in the recent Great Recession. Moreover, during these times firms diversify their investment needs and cash flow across industries. We also find similar phenomena outside diversified public firms. Examining the mergers and acquisitions activity of stand-alone and diversified private firms, we uncover similar patterns. In aggregate data, we find that the composition of mergers shifts from focused to diversifying and back with changes in external market conditions. Our evidence is broadly consistent with the notion that firms diversify their scope in response to tightening in external capital markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Equally important to the clearing of IAPs are the land use options post-clearing. This study was conducted on private farms at the Mokolo River catchment to determine the most viable agricultural land use option after clearing IAPs. System dynamics modelling is used as a data analysis tool. The outcomes of this study indicate that early restoration of the farm area invaded by IAPs is more beneficial than restoring when the area is heavily degraded. Some of the gains from early restoration are a minimum unit reference value (URV) of R7.05 (instead of R8.29 or R9.08) per cubic metre of water produced by clearing IAPs through a co-financing strategy by the private sector and the state. Moreover, a negative net income is generated through extensive agricultural production while positive net income is generated though intensive agricultural production from 2008-2030. Therefore, this study suggests that intensive agricultural production is economically viable and has the potential to co-finance the government's activities of clearing IAPs.","[Morokong, T.] Western Cape Dept Agr, Agr Econ Serv, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Morokong, T.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa; [Blignaut, J.

The differentiation between breeds according to their genetic growth potential was identified and used to increase feedlot profitability and sustainability. The unique growth and feed intake data of different breeds was generated through a feedlot feeding experiment. The PMFP model was developed to incorporate the variable economic value and the unique production data of each breed into a model. The PMFP model can determine alternative PMFPs for any price scenario. The results indicate that breeds can be differentiated in terms of genetic production potential. The seven breeds used in this study can be divided into three groups in terms of their estimated PMFPs for the specific scenario. The Brahman, Bonsmara, and Afrikaner can be grouped together with a PMFP of 16 weeks for the Brahman and Bonsmara, and 15 weeks for the Afrikaner. The second group included the Simbra and the Angus, which have a PMFP of 21 and 22 weeks respectively. The Simmentaler and Limousin have a PMFP of 27 and 26 weeks respectively, which groups them together in the final group. In conclusion, additional G can be generated by each breed by feeding them according to their unique PMFP.

Newly suggested proxy and dynamic panel approaches provide attractive conceptual improvements over received Within and duality models. Even so, empirical implementation of such advancements does not always live up to expectations. This is particularly true for the dynamic panel estimator, which mostly failed to identify reasonable elasticities for the (quasi) fixed factors. Less demanding proxy approaches represent an interesting alternative for agricultural applications. In our EU sample, high production elasticities for materials prevail. Hence, improving the availability of working capital is the most promising way to increase agricultural productivity.","[Petrick, Martin] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Kloss, Mathias] Univ Hosp Halle, Magdeburger Str 24, D-06112 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Kloss, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Halle, Magdeburger Str 24, D-06112 Halle, Saale, Germany.",mkloss@posteo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012; Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019; Petrick, Martin/AAI-1154-2020",,,,,,40,4,4,0,3,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Return data of a sample of 66 and 34 large-cap and small-cap ETFs, respectively, are used over the period 2012-2016 to assess whether these funds herd and whether herding is more pronounced during extreme markets, during down markets, and during days with extreme trading activity and volatility. The results show that herding is not the case for ETFs. However, some evidence is obtained on a decreasing return dispersion among ETFs on days with negative market returns. Trading activity seems not to induce herding. On the contrary, the author obtains evidence that shows that the higher the trading volumes are, the higher the return dispersion among ETFs is. When it comes to herding during highly volatile markets, the author finds that return dispersion among ETFs decreases on days with extremely high intraday volatility. However, when assessing the relationship between return dispersion and volatility without focusing on days with extremely high risk, the author obtains strong evidence of a linear relation between the 2 variables. This contradicting finding suggests that the stronger the intraday volatility in the ETF market is, the wider the dispersion in returns among ETFs is.","[Rompotis, Gerasimos G.] Univ Athens, 25 Ypsilantou Str, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Rompotis, GG (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, 25 Ypsilantou Str, Athens, Greece.",geras3238@yahoo.gr,,,,,,,19,9,9,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The first part discusses the change of the original balance of power in the EU after the exit of Britain and its possible consequences, especially the strengthening of the relative position of France, and hence the French concept of the EU integration model (deeper federalization of the nucleus and the rest) resulting in an even more explicit model of the two-speed EU. In the ideal Pareto model of the Union, paradoxically, the possibility of exit makes the Union more stable and compact. The second part of the text discusses the problem of the uncompetitiveness of Southern Europe as a specific case of Dutch Disease and four scenarios of its solution - the disinflation or deflation of the South, the inflation of the North, the exit from the common currency and finally the transfer union. The last named scenario is the least attractive of given options, but it is already in progress. The imbalances in the Target 2 payment system discussed in the article are example of this. The conclusion of the article brings ten points summarizing necessary economic and political measures for the EU at the time of power shift after the Brexit and ongoing imbalances between the North and the South in the currency union.","[Sinn, Hans-Werner] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Sinn, Hans-Werner] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Sinn, HW (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Sinn, HW (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany.",sinn@ifo.de,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,14,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

At the same time, there is no evidence of the higher concern of indirect marketing effects of reverse flows. Second, cluster analysis revealed that companies in 2017 are rather divided into two equal groups: One group put stress on the marketing aspect of reverse flows, the other on cost efficiency/legislation requirements. In this respect, The CSR remains the only problematic motive to interpret, as the cluster analysis suggests that the CRS is not seen as a part of marketing related.","[Skapa, Radoslav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Skapa, R (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",skapa@econ.muni.cz,"Škapa, Radoslav/H-4410-2013","Škapa, Radoslav/0000-0003-4361-7070","Grant Agency, Czech Republic [GA16-16-16260S]","Grant Agency, Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government)","This paper was prepared thanks to the Research Project No GA16-16-16260S,Managerial approach to reduction of reverse flows in connection to customer satisfaction and continuous improvement , funded by the Grant Agency, Czech Republic.",,10,0,0,0,0,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-9164-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,247,254,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1EW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000495441500033,0

This occurs through two sorting mechanisms. First, availability of public goods leads to higher population densities. Second, population groups sort according to their preferences for public goods. We develop a structural spatial general equilibrium model that accounts for these effects. The model is estimated using data on transport infrastructure, commuting behaviour, land use and land rents for some 3000 ZIP-codes in the Netherlands and for three levels of education. Welfare benefits of investments in public transport infrastructure are shown to differ sharply by workers' educational attainment. Welfare gains from changes in land use account for up to 30% of the total benefits of a transport investment.","[Teulings, Coen N.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Teulings, Coen N.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Teulings, Coen N.; de Groot, Henri L.

The annual OECD publication Taxing Wages ignores non-tax compulsory payment wedges, even though the OECD calculates and reports them on its website. From the widely published data in Taxing Wages, it is not possible to generate recommendations to reduce the tax burden of labour or merely the rate of employer social security contributions in Czechia. Various welfare regimes use different forms of social security funding with an automatic impact on the structure of labour costs. In Czechia, the rationalization of personal income tax and social security contributions can be relatively straightforward, resulting, in particular, in integrating the personal income tax and the employee social security contributions.

It shows that there is a significant 'U' relationship between the ownership concentration and the short-term performances, while a noticeable negative linear relationship is observed on the long-term performance. The relationship varies vastly between the absolute and the relative state-owned holding enterprises. Besides, the restriction degree of the second major shareholder is insignificant to the short-term performance of the enterprise, but its impact on the long-term performance shows negative. The equity restriction in the state-owned relative holding enterprises exerts a positive impact on the short-term performance and opposite for the long-term when considering the balance of the second to the fifth shareholders. However, it is mainly reflected negative on the long-term performance in the state-owned absolute holding enterprises. Furthermore, it is found that the results of the state-owned relative holding enterprises remain unchanged when differentiating the second to the fifth large state-owned and non-state-owned shareholders. The ownership restriction of the state-owned absolute holding enterprises is negatively correlated with the short-term performance, while non-state shareholders restrictions reveal positive.

All South-European countries that faced a debt crisis had already adopted the European single currency - Euro. Our literature review depicts contemporary research work on debt crises, their economic and social implications either generally or, more relative to our work, South-European-country specific. Our research work is based on a wide range of statistical indices, in an effort to appreciate the effectiveness of the economic adjustment programmes, holistically. The countries addressed were Greece, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus. The applied statistical indices were grouped in six pillars that are considered to be essential to social prosperity. These pillars are financial prosperity, employment, healthcare, education, governance and entrepreneurship. All data were eventually incorporated in a single index, namely 'Social Prosperity Index', in an attempt to attain a holistic view on the effectiveness of these programmes. This approach contradicts the mainstream approach of pure financially oriented assessments. Portugal scores first in this appraisal - not only fully recovering but even improving social prosperity standards for its citizens - followed closely by Spain and Cyprus. Greece recorded the worst classification, albeit the index is recovering to pro-crisis levels. Our empirical results suggest that these programmes had a significant impact on the countries that were implemented. In solely financial terms, the programmes proved to be quite effective for all countries. However, their effectiveness is rather questionable if we take into consideration all pillars of social prosperity. The most problematic pillar is employment, which challenges governments and especially their citizens. European and sovereign policies must urgently address employment problems, whereas economists are already talking about a 'lost generation'.","[Zoumpoulidis, Vasilios; Simitsis, Georgios; Bilmpili, Vithleem] TEI EMTh, Dept Accounting & Finance, Agios Loukas 65404, Kavala, Greece",,"Simitsis, G (通讯作者)，TEI EMTh, Dept Accounting & Finance, Agios Loukas 65404, Kavala, Greece.",g_simitsis@yahoo.com,"Simitsis, Georgios/KCY-2725-2024; Zoumpoulidis, Vassilios/AAO-1321-2021","Simitsis, Georgios/0000-0002-3695-3466;",,,,,18,0,0,0,5,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,33,49,,10.18502/kss.v3i10.3529,0.0,,,17,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7SJ,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455399000003,0

This study replicates that experiment in three additional Canadian provincial governments to verify whether the relationship found in the original study persists in a larger sample and in conjunction with further randomization procedures.

Efficiency of the legal system, protection of creditors' rights and bank concentration show a positive relationship with debt maturity, while the weight of banks in the economy has a negative effect on firm debt maturity. The positive influence of bank concentration on corporate debt maturity reveals that creditors are more likely to extend debt maturity when the bank credit market is concentrated. This positive effect of bank concentration is reduced in high quality institutional environments. Moreover, the effects of bank concentration and the weight of banks in the economy on corporate debt maturity are higher in smaller firms.","[Gonzalez, Victor M.] Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Avda Del Cristo S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"González, VM (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Avda Del Cristo S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain.",vmendez@uniovi.es,"González, Víctor M./A-5388-2010","González, Víctor M./0000-0003-4013-0590","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-31772, ECO2015-66184R]; University of Oviedo International Campus of Excellence",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); University of Oviedo International Campus of Excellence,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant numbers: ECO2012-31772, ECO2015-66184R; University of Oviedo International Campus of Excellence",,33,9,10,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We designed an experiment that enables identification of causal effects. Subjects carry out a sequence of real effort tasks. The income earned varies with individual differences in effort (combined with variances related to skill or luck) and with the exogenously given length of the tasks. For each task, subjects privately roll a die, whose value determines the tax rate, which is then reported by subjects. This provides subjects with an incentive to cheat. Tax morale diminishes with higher effort, which might find ethical justification, but also with longer tasks, which would not. We implement treatments that vary the range of taxation. Contrary to widespread belief, participants' tax morale is invariant to these treatments. Our findings are best explained by a psychological force that tempts rich people to cheat more. This force does not seem to be related to fairness ideals that are prominent in theories of distributional justice nor to absolute levels of taxation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

One result is that an angry voter with a strong sense of shame at the thought of voting to harm others, may still do so, even when the harm is brutal. Indeed, his willingness to vote for harming others may increase if the proposed harm becomes more severe, even though the angry voter is more decent (less willing to harm others) than most of us sometimes are. Several examples are given that are consistent with the most troubling implications of the model.

The null hypothesis of no threshold effect is rejected at the 5 per cent significance level for most cases. While we find no evidence of a threshold around 90 per cent, our findings from the post-war sample suggest that the debt threshold for economic growth may exist around a relatively small debt-to-GDP ratio of 30 per cent.

The governor of the Bank of Spain has stated recently that the current public pension system will not guarantee an adequate pension to the citizens, advising to save now for retirement. In this debate on public pensions, and the complementary role that private pensions might play in Spain, this article has shed light on the decision of Spanish households to engage in individual pension plans and it has identified which factors determine the total amount saved in such retirement plans. Using micro data from the Bank of Spain (Survey of Household Finances 2011), the analysis has revealed that the expectations of lower future income, along with preferences for the financial risk and education, exert an important influence on the likelihood of enrolling in a private pension plan. University education minimizes the myopic behavior of households in the sense of making them more forward-looking and cautious in the face of their future well-being. Additionally using Heckman's methodology to correct for the problem of selection bias, our results have revealed that liquidity constraints affect negatively the total amount of money saved for retirement.","[Moreno-Herrero, Dolores; Salas-Velasco, Manuel; Sanchez-Campillo, Jose] Univ Granada, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Moreno-Herrero, D (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",mdmoreno@ugr.es; msalas@ugr.es; jsanchez@ugr.es,"SALAS-VELASCO, MANUEL/T-2135-2019; Salas-Velasco, Manuel/AAT-9295-2020","Salas-Velasco, Manuel/0000-0003-0618-5619",,,,,80,13,13,2,34,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

While it is claimed that social and environmental benefits are associated with the implementation of BSSs, few empirical studies have investigated the actual congestion reduction effect of BSSs on cities. To fill such gap, this paper aims to examine whether the launch of BSSs can reduce citywide congestion. With a panel dataset of 96 urban areas in the US from 2005 to 2014, we employed a difference-in-differences model with two-way fixed-effects panel regression. The results suggested that the introduction of BSSs shows a significant mixed impact on congestion in general: Larger cities get better off but richer cities get worse off. Such results are consistent with both subsample regression with propensity score matching and different congestion measures. Post-hoc analysis reveals that BSSs have a significant positive effect on reducing rush-hour congestion.

At each time, the firm settles emissions taking into account the fine for non-compliance with the pollution limit, and balances current costs of investments in a capital stock which allows for future emission reductions. We derive two main results. First, we show that the optimal pollution limit decreases as the capital stock increases, while both emissions and the level of non-compliance decrease. Second, we find that offering fine discounts in exchange for firm's capital investment is socially desirable. We numerically obtain the optimal value of such discount, which crucially depends on the severity of the fine. In the limiting scenario with a very large severity of the fine, the optimal discount implies that no penalties are levied, since the firm shows adequate adaptation progress through capital investment.","[Arguedas, Carmen] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, Campus Cantoblanco S-N, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Cabo, Francisco; Martin-Herran, Guiomar] Univ Valladolid, IMUVa Dept Econ Aplicada Matemat, Valladolid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad de Valladolid,"Arguedas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, Campus Cantoblanco S-N, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",carmen.arguedas@uam.es,"Cabo, Francisco/J-9102-2014; Martin-Herran, Guiomar/J-5442-2014; Arguedas, Carmen/H-4170-2016","Cabo, Francisco/0000-0003-2958-9595; Martin-Herran, Guiomar/0000-0002-9161-2349; Arguedas, Carmen/0000-0002-2719-6918","Spanish Government [ECO2011-25349, ECO2014-52372-P, ECO2011-24352, ECO2014-52343-P]; COST Action [IS1104]",Spanish Government(Spanish Government); COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"The authors wish to thank Hassan Benchekroun, Michael Finus, Maria Jose Gutierrez, Santiago Rubio, Georges Zaccour and two anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions on earlier drafts.

This paper focuses on the connections between income inequality and the fragility of economic growth. We find that longer growth spells-periods of strong, healthy, per capita growth-are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution, even when controlling for a range of other standard determinants. A key implication is that it would be a gamble to think that distribution will take care of itself provided policy makers steadfastly pursue growth.

Levinson (Am Econ Rev 99(5):2177-2192, 2009) finds that the offshoring of polluting industries to countries with lower environmental standards played only small role in the cleanup of US manufacturing, which was largely due to improvements in production technique. But there is no evidence of whether US patterns hold in other developed economies. I provide the first analysis of the pollution intensity of EU production and imports to examine which forces drove the EU cleanup. I find that concerns about the effect of pollution offshoring were unfounded in the European Union, not because the effect was small like in the United States, but because the patterns of specialization of EU production and imports were exactly opposite to what pollution offshoring would predict. Starting in the early 2000s, EU manufacturing increasingly produced more pollution-intensive goods while imports became progressively less pollution-intensive, especially from low-income countries. There are two notable exceptions: primary aluminum and electrometallurgical products, except steel, which do provide evidence of offshoring from the EU to lower income countries. The brown specialization of EU production is difficult to explain, but about a quarter can be matched by increased demand for EU exports of polluting goods. However, similar to the US cleanup, changes in production and imports were overwhelmed by improvements in production technique, which were the main drivers of the cleanup of manufacturing.","[Brunel, Claire] Amer Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Brunel, C (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",brunel@american.edu,"Brunel, Claire/AAE-7708-2020","Brunel, Claire/0000-0002-5327-8650",,,,,37,36,36,4,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We further investigate whether a country's economic freedom affects the relationship between investor sentiments and ETF returns. We find that ETF returns are strongly determined by investor sentiments and the ETF expense ratio. The quantile regression approach reveals that high-return ETFs are positively sensitive to changes in global sentiment (measured by market turnover, VIX, U.S. federal funds rate), foreign sentiment (measured by current account balance, inflation, market turnover, public debt), U.S. sentiment, currency exchange ratio, and expense ratio, while negatively influenced by economic freedom and Asian proxy. The effects of VIX and foreign inflation are a reversal; that is, returns from lower (higher) quantiles have a negative (positive) relation with VIX and foreign inflation.

We find that trade, financial and confidence channels all play a significant role in the international transmission of US shocks. However, the results point to substantial heterogeneities of shock transmission across the individual G7 economies. In particular, we find negative transmission effects for Italy and Japan as the only two G7 countries not well integrated into global value chains. Moreover, the exchange rate responses of Germany, France and Italy turn out to be far less pronounced in comparison to the other G7 economies which we relate to their membership of the euro area and their coordinated monetary policies prior to the establishment of the euro. Whereas we document a close comovement of stock market dynamics across the G7 countries, we find credit and real estate markets to be less synchronized.

The sample consists of a panel of 297 Chinese listed small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) over the period 2009-2012. The empirical results indicate that there are threshold effects in the CEO power-debt relationship and CEO power-operating lease relationship. In particular, we find that firms tend to use more debt financing (and operating leasing) when CEO power index below a certain threshold level; beyond the threshold level, CEO tends to manipulate firm capital structure to pursue their own interests, thus using less debt financing and operating leasing. In addition, our estimation results suggest a positive relationship between debt and operating leases when CEO power is smaller than certain threshold, while it becomes negative if the power index exceeds the threshold level.

In a spatial environment, with multiple locations with independent but interconnected markets, these transitions quickly become complex and highly non-linear due to the feedback loops between the micro individual-level decisions and the meso location-wise market decisions. To capture these continuously evolving micro meso interactions, this paper presents a spatially explicit bottom-up agent-based model to analyze natural disaster-like shocks to low-income regions. The aim of the model is to temporally and spatially track how population distributions, income, and consumption levels evolve, in order to identify low-income workers that are food insecure. The model is applied to the 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan, which faced catastrophic losses and high levels of displacement in a short time span, and with market disruptions, resulted in high levels of food insecurity. The model is calibrated to pre-crisis trends, and shocked using distance-based output and labor loss functions to replicate the earthquake impact. Model results show, how various factors like existing income and saving levels, distance from the fault line, and connectivity to other locations, can give insights into the spatial and temporal emergence of vulnerabilities. The simulation framework presented here, leaps beyond existing modeling efforts, which usually deals with macro long-term loss estimates, and allows policy makers to come up with informed short-term policies in an environment where data is non-existent, policy response is time dependent, and resources are limited.

With a right love of wealth an optimum exists and implies higher long-run per-capita capital, income, and consumption relative to the standard model. This has important implications for comparative development trajectories. The optimum implies dynamic efficiency with the possibility of getting arbitrarily close to the golden rule where long-run per-capita consumption is maximal. It is shown that the optimal path attains its steady state more slowly. Thus, the beneficial effects of love of wealth materialize later than in the standard model. Furthermore, the economy can be decentralized as a competitive private ownership economy. One can then identify love of wealth with the spirit of capitalism. The paper thus implies that one needs a right level of the spirit of capitalism to realize any beneficial effects for the long run.","[Rehme, Guenther] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Rehme, G (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Econ, FB1-VWL1,Bleichstr 2, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany.",rehme@vwl.tu-darmstadt.de,,"Rehme, Guenther/0000-0002-1717-8863",,,,,24,0,0,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We evaluate the systemic importance of financial institutions based on their stock returns and use wavelet framework to analyze returns in a time-frequency domain. Empirical analysis on US banking sector data between 2004 and 2013 demonstrates that wavelet decomposition can improve the forecast power of the CoVaR measure. We use panel regression to explain systemic importance of individual banks, using their objectively measurable characteristics and conclude that size, volatility and value-at-risk are the most robust determinants of systemic risk.

In less-advanced countries, the premium rises with net FDI, scale effects, centralized wage negotiations and geographically concentrated natural resource activities (absorbing scarce skilled workers), and falls with trade, diffuse natural resource exploration (using mainly unskilled workers) and high-technology exports, as emerging national low-end technology industrial exporters may lower skill pay compared with foreign industrial exporters.

The empirical analysis highlighted that the interest rate and housing price are positively correlated during July 2004 to November 2016 because of the monetary policy over this period. Subsequently, in the risk-neutral pricing framework, mortgage insurance of the fixed-rate mortgage is priced using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The sensitivity analysis indicated that interest rate, housing price, and default rate are important factors for mortgage insurance. Moreover, because our model can measure the risks of the interest rate and hazard rate, insurance companies can use this model to price mortgage insurance to avoid a condition in which the insurance company does not have sufficient reserves to support compensation.

Results provide evidence that both policies are important predictors of renewable energy market growth. The dependent variable is operationalized first as the percentage of total electricity from renewable energy and second as the annual increase in total renewable energy generation in a country. Results are robust to several alternative model specifications including those that exclude hydroelectric generation in the construct of renewable energy. The degree to which feed-in tariffs are endogenous, however, is not conclusive. Besides the prominent role of these policies, results reveal that factors related to annual increases in renewable energy differ from those related to an overall transition toward greater reliance on renewable energy. This suggests that simply increasing renewable generation does not necessarily decrease reliance on fossil fuels or help countries make the shift to a clean energy economy.","[Carley, Sanya; Brass, Jennifer N.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St,Room 535, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA; [Baldwin, Elizabeth] Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ USA; [MacLean, Lauren M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Arizona; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Carley, S (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St,Room 535, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA.",scarley@indiana.edu,,,,,,,65,87,91,4,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Some Evidence from School Segregation and the Huge Racial Gap in the Largest Brazilian City,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,racial discrimination; spatial segregation; school segregation; Brazil; education and inequality; urban labor markets,SPATIAL SEGREGATION; URBAN SEGREGATION; SAMPLE SELECTION; US,"Brazil has always been considered to be a land free of racial and ethnic tensions. However, despite Brazil being famous for miscegenation, racial discrimination in Brazil has been documented in the literature, especially in light of the huge disparity between Brazil's racial groups with respect to economic outcomes and education levels. The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the economics of racial discrimination in Brazil. To this end, the effect of segregation on the income of workers is estimated using data from elementary schools in sao Paulo, the largest city in the country. Measures of segregation in the educational system are evaluated using economic data obtained from the 2010 census. It is shown that segregation plays a fundamental role on the wage gap among racial groups. This effect may be attributed to the virtual absence of pretos and pardos in private schools. In public education, however, there is little separation along racial lines, which suggests that lack of access to social networks and to higher quality public schools may be the most important element in explaining wage differences. In Brazil, racial discrimination seems to work indirectly through socio-economic factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One strategy is Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs), which provide cash payments to poor households in exchange for compliance with health-related conditionalities including child vaccination. Using a randomized trial, we provide new evidence on the impact of large-scale CCTs on child vaccination rates in Indonesia by investigating the Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) with a sample of over four thousand children under two years old. After two years of implementation from 2007 to 2009, difference-in-differences (DID) estimates show that PKH significantly increases child vaccination rates for all basic vaccine types by up to 30% compared to the control group means among children aged less than 12 months old but PKH shows modest effects among children aged 12-23 months old. There is also evidence that PKH is equity enhancing by increasing child vaccination rates for most vaccine types by up to 52% among children aged less than 12 months old living with less educated mothers (below six years). All this underscores the ability of cash transfers to reach poor children for whom health systems supply-side-oriented strategies have been less successful. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data for the Czech Republic and five euro area countries we show that monetary tightening has a negative impact on the credit-to-GDP ratio and the non-risk-weighted bank capital ratio (i.e. a positive impact on bank leverage), while these effects have strengthened considerably since mid-2011. This supports the view that accommodative monetary policy contributes to a build-up of financial vulnerabilities, i.e. it boosts the credit cycle. On the other hand, the effect of the higher bank capital ratio is associated with some degree of uncertainty. For these and other reasons, coordination of the two policies is necessary to avoid an undesirable policy mix preventing effective achievement of the main objectives in the two policy areas.

High risk aversion is a well-known trigger of poverty traps for farm households in developing countries. This paper analyzes the effect of market experience on risk aversion for a relatively large sample of landed farm households characterized by historically low mobility in Ethiopia. We measure risk aversion using lab-in-field experimental data, and relate it to actual market experience of household heads. We use an instrumental variable approach to address the issue of endogeneity due to possible self-selection into trade. We find that market experience attenuates risk aversion farm households with greater market experience are more risk tolerant. Results are robust to using several alternative specifications, controlling for internal mobility, out-migration and other potential unobservables, and for violations to rational choice. Overall, this study provides strong empirical evidence that risk preferences endogenously change as a result of market experience, and can help design policies aiming to increase the productivity and efficiency of farm households.

Consistent with this prediction, I find that following periods of industry distress, establishments located near CEOs' childhood homes experience fewer employment and pay reductions and are less likely to be divested relative to other firm establishments. While it is not possible to directly test whether this employment bias destroys firm value, managers only implement these policies when governance is weak, suggesting that this favoritism is suboptimal. Together, these results provide direct evidence of employee favoritism and show that idiosyncratic manager styles impact corporate employment decisions.","[Yonker, Scott E.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA",Cornell University,"Yonker, SE (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Finance, 201J Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",syonker@cornell.edu,"Yonker, Scott/AAD-3593-2020; Yonker, Scott E/ABE-5429-2021",,Ann Arbor RDC from the National Science Foundation [ITR-0427889],Ann Arbor RDC from the National Science Foundation,"Any opinions and conclusions expressed herein are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Census Bureau.

We also investigate the relation between individual characteristics of companies and the degree of heavy-tailedness and asymmetry of returns. According to our estimates, the degree of heavy-tailedness is strongly related to the liquidity of stocks and the company size. At the same time, no significant effects on estimates of the tail indices of sectoral affiliation, cross-listing, adding into quotation lists, state ownership are revealed. As for the influence of the above-mentioned factors on the asymmetry of returns, the statistical reliability of relevant models is rather low. However, certain indicators of the asymmetry are observed for medium-sized regional companies, the majority showing a heavier right tail compared to the left tail. We also discuss the implications of our findings for managerial decisions and economic modeling. Our results may be useful for risk-managers, financial regulators, investors and policy-makers.

An increase in the price difference between the VIX and VIX futures, commonly referred to as the futures basis, causes a corresponding increase in the contribution to price discovery made by VIX futures. Our empirical results also show that news announcements on macro-economic issues in the United States increase the dominant role of VIX futures in the overall process of price discovery.

We focus on probability reduction (self-protection) so that correlation becomes endogenous. If prevention concerns only one risk, introducing a second exogenous risk increases the level of prevention expenditures, even if correlation is negative. If prevention expenditures may be invested for both risks, a substitution effect arises. Under nonincreasing returns on self-protection, we find that increased dependence increases aggregate prevention expenditures, but not necessarily prevention expenditures for each risk due to differences in prevention efficiency. Similar results are found when considering changes in the severity of losses. Consequently, the comparative statics emphasize global effects versus allocation effects. Our results have strong policy implications, considering the numerous mandatory safety measures introduced by governments over the past years.","[Courbage, Christophe] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland HES SO, Geneva Assoc, Geneva, Switzerland; [Courbage, Christophe] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland HES SO, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland; [Louberge, Henri] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Louberge, Henri] Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Peter, Richard] Univ Iowa, Dept Finance, Henry B Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; University of Geneva; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); University of Iowa,"Peter, R (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Finance, Henry B Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",richard-peter@uiowa.edu,,"Courbage, Christophe/0000-0002-2554-0228",,,,,29,15,15,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We estimate the impact of these groups on industrial compliance with the Clean Water Act, as well as their effect on government monitoring and enforcement. We geographically link annual panel data on facility inspection rates, pollution violations, and enforcement actions with information about nearby nonprofit watershed groups. In addition to two-stage least squares estimation for endogenous efforts of nonprofits, governments, and firms, we implement a recent advance in nonlinear methods with improved fit for our fractional dependent variables. As the number of nonprofit groups increase, government decreases inspections and firms have fewer severe effluent violations. The nonprofits' oversight substitutes for government efforts by interacting directly with facilities rather than putting pressure on regulatory mechanisms. The interventions by these environmeVntal groups encourage compliance and, based on theory, improve efficiency.","[Grant, Laura E.] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Grooms, Katherine K.] Southwestern Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Georgetown, TX USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College,"Grant, LE (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",lgrant@cmc.edu; groomsk@southwestern.edu,,,,,,,28,19,20,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

We also consider all possible 2036 different combinations of two or more of these countries. In the two-country case, we make comparisons with cross-correlations, either rolling-window or based on the multi-period returns. We find that in the bivariate set-up with the USA, the BRIC countries, except for Brazil (especially over small time scales), offer diversification benefits, while in the multivariate one, clustering with respect to America or Europe (but not Asia) leads to homogeneous groups. Hence development and region cannot always be considered as ultimate clustering factors. Leave-one-out cross-validation shows a nuanced interplay of time scales, development and region as grouping factors for Brazil, Japan, Hong Kong and Russia.

The finding revealed that trade openness as a measure of competitiveness and FDI has no significant effect on SMEs growth in Nigeria. It was also revealed that the exchange rate has a significant effect on SMEs growth in Nigeria, and the level at which exchange rate affects SMEs growth is relatively high. It was further showed that the exchange rate has a negative coefficient indicating that, as the exchange rate reduces SMEs growth increases. It is concluded that trade competitiveness had no significant effect on SMEs growth in Nigeria. It is therefore recommended that government should formulate policies, which will encourage the reduction of exchange rate in the country in order to enhance competition and improve business activities across the country, and improve the growth of SMEs across the country, as well as encouraging entrepreneurship spirit in the country.","[Oladimeji, Moruff Sanjo] Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Fac Social & Management Sci, Dept Business Adm, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Muhammed, Olaniyi Ibrahim] Moshood Abiola Polytech, Dept Mkt, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria",,"Oladimeji, MS (通讯作者)，Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Fac Social & Management Sci, Dept Business Adm, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria.",sanjolanre4life@yahoo.com,,,,,,,38,3,5,1,12,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

While the background risk is neither hedgeable nor insurable, the firm has access to fairly priced futures and option contracts to hedge against the price risk. We show that the separation theorem holds in that the firm's optimal output level depends neither on the risk attitude of the firm nor on the incident to the underlying uncertainty. However, hedging does not always enhance production. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which the full-hedging theorem holds and thus options are not used. When these conditions are violated, we show that the firm optimally uses options to better cope with the complicated state-dependence structure between risk and preferences, thereby rendering options a hedging role over and above that of futures.","[Wong, Kit Pong] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Wong, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kpwong@econ.hku.hk,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

In an advance refunding, municipalities retire callable bonds early and refund them with bonds with lower coupon rates. We find that 85% of all advance refundings occur at a net present value loss, and that the aggregate losses over the past 20 years exceed $15 billion. We explore why municipalities advance refund their debt at loss. Financially constrained municipalities may face pressure to advance refund since it allows them to reduce short-term cash outflows.

However, the extent to which luxury-related extrinsic cues determine consumer preferences and whether the relative weighting of extrinsic vs. intrinsic cues depends on consumers' values is still unclear. We investigated how luxury vs. non-luxury brands affect consumer preferences, and how this impact is moderated by consumers' materialistic values. Results from Experiment 1 showed that materialistic and non-materialistic participants similarly appreciated products with luxurious brands. However, compared with non-materialistic participants, materialistic participants devaluated products that were tagged as non-luxurious brands. In Experiment 2, we investigated how product quality interacts with brands and whether materialistic values moderated this interaction. Materialistic participants paid more attention to brand-related cues than to quality related cues, whereas non-materialistic participants considered these cues similarly. Taken together, the results of these two studies suggest that materialism influences the way extrinsic (i.e., brand) and intrinsic (i.e., quality) information is combined during product evaluation. These results highlight the importance of materialism in consumer decision-making, especially in the context of luxury consumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It finds that the disincentive effect of the capital transfer on the capital investment by the recipient is larger than the budgetary transfers. It makes financial savings more attractive relative to the capital investment for the recipient. In the absence of capital transfer, the multi-period budgetary transfers not only lead to the efficient level of capital investment by the recipient, but also achieve the same allocation as under commitment.

Increased inequality can trigger feelings of empathy and compassion, thereby increasing altruism, and it can enhance the worm-glow feeling associated with giving. However inequality can also increase social distance and, therefore, social segregation, decreasing the participation to charities because of a weaker identification with the needy. Our empirical analysis features individual data on charity participation from the World Values Survey,merged with country-level information on inequality from the World Bank Development Indicators. We find that income inequality is positively associated with the probability to actively participate in charitable organizations, even after controlling for economic, sociological, demographics, cultural, and religious factors. We also find that women, religious people, and more educated individuals have a higher probability to actively participate in charities. Since charitable organizations mostly perform redistributive tasks, we also checked whether the generosity of the welfare state crowds out the participation in them, but we found no evidence of this relationship.

Does the development discourse learn from history, including its own? Set in the contexts of aging development institutions and a changing geopolitical climate, this paper provides one account through a historiographical survey of 136 journal articles across 10 leading development journals. It uncovers a substantial body of works, which offer descriptive histories, derivative lessons, and historiographical critiques. Altogether, they evidence two modes in which the development discourse attempts to learn from history. The first lies in the proactive use of external histories as empirical evidence for a variety of development issues. This is the predominant mode exhibited in the survey. A second mode lies in the use of internal histories of the development discourse, itself. Here, the survey finds a number of noteworthy but largely disparate efforts. This suggests a relative dearth in historiographical self-consciousness for a narrow but influential segment of the development discourse. A number of consequences are considered, ultimately responding to the legitimacy, efficacy, and sustainability of development action. In sum, our survey finds that the mainstream development journal discourse is adept at learning from external histories, but not necessarily from its own. Evidence, however, suggests that it can. A case is made for why it must. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis is based on a novel model of investment value, cash flows, and fee dynamics of private equity funds. Given the embedded option-like fee components, our results demonstrate that fund managers indeed have an incentive for excessive risk-taking when only fee income from the current fund is considered. However, when managers also consider potential compensation from follow-on funds, their risk-taking incentives depend on their individual skill levels, and skilled managers will have an incentive to reduce fund risk. We also show that managers must generate substantial abnormal returns in order to compensate investors for the given fee components. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, two regulatory measures have been put forward: order-to-trade ratios and transaction taxes. This paper aims to quantify the impact of such initiatives. To do so, I consider market liquidity and volatility in the Italian Stock Exchange (Borsa Italiana) over the 2011-2013 period, which provides a unique opportunity for empirical assessment: first, a penalty for high order-to-trade ratios (OTR) was implemented in April 2012; second, a transaction tax on securities (SIT) was introduced in March 2013 on Italian large and mid-caps; third, this tax was extended to derivatives in September 2013 (FIT). I identify causality via a difference-in-difference approach (with German firms and Italian small caps, when appropriate, as control groups) and a regression discontinuity design. I find that neither the OTR nor the STITIT had a meaningful impact on market liquidity or volatility. There was however a substantial drop in OTC trading. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We explore whether lockup type influences such returns and growth opportunities. Specifically, we investigate long run returns and growth opportunities of mandatory and non-mandatory lockup firms. We find that long run returns (growth opportunities) for mandatory lockup firms are significantly lower (higher) than for non-mandatory lockup firms. Examining the influence of corporate governance on these associations, we find that good corporate governance is positively associated with long run returns for both lockup type firms, with the differential effect insignificant. We also find that the listing survival rate of mandatory lockup firms is higher than for non-mandatory lockup firms. Further analysis reveals that the incremental effect of smaller firm size on higher growth opportunities is stronger for mandatory lockup firms relative to non-mandatory lockup firms.

To improve feeding practices in Ethiopia, a strong focus in nutrition programing has been placed on improving the nutrition knowledge of caregivers. In this paper, we study the impact of caregivers' nutrition knowledge and its complementarity with market access. To test whether the effect of nutrition knowledge on children's dietary diversity depends on market access, we use survey data from an area with a large variation in transportation costs over a relatively short distance. This allows us to carefully assess the impact of nutrition knowledge with varying access to markets, but still within similar agro-climatic conditions. Using an Instrumental Variable approach, we find that better nutrition knowledge leads to considerable improvements in children's dietary diversity, but only in areas with relatively good market access. Our findings suggest that policymakers and program implementers need to ensure that efforts to improve nutrition knowledge are complemented by efforts to improve access to food.

The impact of equity returns of crisis countries on other equity markets is large and positive during normal times and less positive during the crisis, suggesting evidence of negative contagion and decoupling of stock markets during the crisis.

We deal with complementarity between productive entrepreneurship and harmful rent-seeking activities leading to potentially multiple equilibra in the economy. The degree of rent-seeking is endogenous in our model and is influenced by the economy's legal and institutional framework as well as capital market imperfections. Policy which establishes the legal environment and financial institutions dealing with capital market imperfections together decides which of the potentially multiple equilibria is chosen by the economy. This institutional choice implies the solution to a trade-off between high economic growth on the one and a high level of productivity on the other hand.,"[Antony, Juergen] Pforzheim Univ, Pforzheim Business Sch, Tiefenbronner Str 65, D-75175 Pforzheim, Germany; [Klarl, Torben] Univ Bremen, Fac Business Studies & Econ, Hsch Ring 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Lehmann, Erik E.] Univ Augsburg, Fac Business & Econ, Univ Str 16, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Bremen; University of Augsburg,"Antony, J (通讯作者)，Pforzheim Univ, Pforzheim Business Sch, Tiefenbronner Str 65, D-75175 Pforzheim, Germany.",juergen.antony@hs-pforzheim.de; tklarl@uni-bremen.de; erik.lehmann@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,"Lehmann, Erik E./AAB-4787-2022","Lehmann, Erik E./0000-0002-4108-7523",,,,,56,16,17,3,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

To overcome a systematic bias against the life-cycle hypothesis of survey data, the paper estimates how the age profile of saving changes when the micro data are corrected to account for the contribution to pensions (as additional saving) and receipt of benefits from pensions (as dissaving). With these corrections, the Russian data support the life-cycle hypothesis. A small decline in the aggregate saving rate, because of aging, can thus be expected. However, since aggregate saving rates result from a combination of age and cohort effects, this decline may not be significant. When extrapolating the rising trends of the cohort effect, the fact that younger generations are earning and saving more than older generations at the same age, the projection shows a growing aggregate saving rate. Changes in saving of future cohorts, for example because of changes in the growth rate of the economy or because of reforms in pension systems and entitlements, can affect the aggregate saving rate even more than aging.

They began pumping money in Portugal, by borrowing intensively in Euros abroad at low interest rates. The ensuing liquidity generated a capital-flow bonanza boom that culminated in a bust phase.

A limitation of this literature is its reliance on self-reported measures of weight and height, which may contain substantial error that can lead to bias in estimates of obesity prevalence and coefficients in healthcare utilization regressions. This paper estimates the extent of reporting error in weight and height among older adults, and examines its implications for estimating healthcare costs within this population. Moreover, this paper is the first to apply methods to correct for reporting error in weight and height to an older adult sample, and examine the extent to which these methods reduce bias from reporting error. Previous research on reporting error in weight has focused on working-age adults, but older adults are likely to have different patterns of misreporting due to declines in cognition, changes in body composition, and other age-related factors. We find substantial error in older adults' reports of weight and height, and this error is neither classical nor independent of common regressors in econometric models. Use of self-reports leads to bias in estimates of mean BMI, obesity prevalence, coefficients in healthcare utilization regressions, and obesity-attributable healthcare costs. Correction algorithms can reduce but not eliminate bias, and in certain cases they can actually worsen bias. These findings have implications for accurate estimates of the impact of obesity on healthcare utilization and costs among older adults. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate a discrete time hazard model to test whether diabetes affects the hazard of leaving employment among individuals who were working for pay at the age of 55-56. Using a probit model, we also estimate the effect of having undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes on the probability of labor market exit two years later. Our results indicate that diabetes is associated with an increased hazard of exiting the labor market for males, but not for females. This effect for males persists when we include controls for onset of other health conditions, two of which are documented complications of diabetes (stroke and heart conditions). We also find that diagnosed diabetes with medication use, regardless of whether or not it is under control, is associated with large negative effects on the likelihood of employment two years later.

Given this, we develop a wavelet-based framework that examines the cross-sectional pricing implications of isolating these timescale betas. An empirical application to the Fama-French model reveals that the model's well-known empirical success is largely due to the beta components associated with a timescale just short of a business cycle (i.e., wavelet scale 3). This implies that any viable explanation for the success of the Fama-French model that has been applied to the Fama-French factors should apply particularly to the scale 3 components of the factors.

We, therefore, theorize about a unique paradox for entrepreneurs trying to establish legitimacy for their new ventures within and beyond an entrepreneurial ecosystem; that is, when pursuing opportunities with high levels of technological or market newness, entrepreneurs confront a significant challenge in legitimizing their venture within an entrepreneurial ecosystem, while those entrepreneurs pursuing ventures using existing technologies or pursuing existing markets have a much easier path to garnering legitimacy within that ecosystem. However, the diffusion of that legitimacy beyond the ecosystem will be wider and more far-reaching for those pursuing the newer elements compared to those using existing technologies or pursuing existing markets, thus, creating a paradox of venture legitimation. Prior research outlines approaches for new venture legitimacy but it is unclear when these approaches should be applied within and beyond an entrepreneurial ecosystem. To address this paradox, we integrate ideas from the entrepreneurship and innovation literature with insights from the legitimacy literature to describe how different types of venture newness employ different legitimation strategies which results in different levels of legitimacy diffusion beyond an ecosystem. We conclude with a discussion of our concepts and offer suggestions for future research efforts.","[Kuratko, Donald F.; Fisher, Greg] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Bloodgood, James M.] Kansas State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Hornsby, Jeffrey S.] Univ Missouri, Bloch Sch Management, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business; Kansas State University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Kuratko, DF (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",dkuratko@indiana.edu; fisherg@indiana.edu; jblood@ksu.edu; jhornsby@ksu.edu,"Fisher, Greg/A-7027-2013",,,,,,93,76,85,14,144,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

There have been very few genuine attempts to document and interpret the meaning of the leave' vote among underprivileged voters who seemed to have voted for an outcome that harms their own interests. This article explores accounts and narratives from working class leave' voters through an ethnographic study of the political and social viewpoints of working class communities of East London and of ex-mining towns of Nottinghamshire. The article puts into fuller context the anger and apathy of being left out', arguing that being left out' has been part of working class political narratives for over 30 years. Going beyond frustration and apathy, a significant part of the narrative of working people was of not existing', suggesting certain important linkages with ongoing debates about new ways of conceptualizing class differences and class structures. The article shows how macro-stage political events such as a referendum about Europe can often be usefully illuminated by taking seriously the micro experiences on the ground.","[Mckenzie, Lisa] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Mckenzie, L (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",l.l.mckenzie@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,50,52,0,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

I show this result using a costly enforcement model in which lenders need ex post incentives to enforce payments from defaulted loans and borrowers' payoffs are correlated. When projects have correlated outcomes, learning the state of one project (via enforcement) provides information about the states of other projects. A large correlated portfolio provides ex post incentives for enforcement. Thus, intermediation dominates direct lending, and intermediaries are financed with risk-free deposits, earn positive profits, and hold systemic default risk.","[Phelan, Gregory] Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Phelan, G (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",,,,,,,,57,7,10,6,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Following Eggertsson et al. (2014), the simulations focus on reforms with deflationary impact, namely reforms that increase competition and reduce mark-ups and labour costs in the economy. The results suggest that the short-term output response to reforms is less positive at the zero bound compared to 'normal times' and can indeed be negative. Negative net effects are small and rather short-lived, however. Simulations that compare current and pre-announced future reforms question the idea that commitment to future reforms would improve economic conditions compared to reform implementation at the zero bound. According to political economy models, the zero bound may reduce reform intensity by increasing the short-term cost of implementation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This hypothesis is based on the argument that, the local volunteer enumerators of citizen-led surveys are likely to be more sensitive to the specificities of local population distribution and (recent) changes than those centrally trained; and may be more effective at reaching hard-to reach groups such as those nomadic groups and those in urban slums. To test the hypothesis, the results of UWEZO (meaning capability) surveys have been compared at a regional level with those of contemporaneous DHS surveys in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda for estimates of access to water and electricity. Overall, at national level, we find that UWEZO estimates for access to clean water were lower at a statistically significant level than those of DHS and these differences were statistically significant at the 0.01% level; in particular, the DHS values were much higher in regions where there are high concentrations of nomads and of urban slums, implying that the UWEZO surveys catch more poverty. The suggestion therefore is that citizen surveys such as UWEZO provide better, and more accurate, coverage of the poorest of the poor. Using the lowest estimate of the percentage missing in urban slums and extrapolating to all developing countries, there are an estimated 369 million missing from the sampling frames of standardized household surveys worldwide. This has important implications for the Leave no one behind appeal of the UN Secretary General and for the UN's Data Revolution. Some suggestions are made about how to progress improved population estimates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study verifies that an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) trajectory exists for per capita emissions in the European Union, that emission intensity growth is decreasing over time, and that the decreasing intensity growth reflects variations of the dependent variable in the specifications of the Green Solow model. The critique by Stefanski (On the mechanics of the Green Solow model. OxCarre Research Paper 47, OxCarre & Laval University, Oxford, 2013) of the Green Solow model assumption of exogenous and constant intensity growth is validated. The EKC is defined as the emissions plotted against income and emission intensity is defined as the ratio of emissions to income. The EKC and emission intensity share identical definitions and similar transition trajectories over time. The transition of the EKC trajectory and decline in emission intensity growth began before worldwide attention was focused on global warming.","[Chen, Wan-Jiun] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, 55 Hwa Kang Rd, Taipei 11114, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University,"Chen, WJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, 55 Hwa Kang Rd, Taipei 11114, Taiwan.",chenwanjiun@yahoo.com.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [102-2410-H-034-035],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology under grant no. 102-2410-H-034-035.

The role of industry specialization in foreign acquisitions is more prevalent when contracting inefficiencies and exporting costs limit arm's-length relationships. The economic gains in cross-border deals are larger when specialized acquirers purchase assets in less specialized industries.

In literature, consumer protection is not explicitly considered and analyzed in the area of destination competitiveness by researchers. This research article investigates the impact of consumer protection on destination competitiveness in the European Union. Research results have pointed out that consumer protection represents a factor of destination competition because illicit commercial practices and consumer trust consumers as consumer indicators affect the value of the Enabling Environment subindex, while illicit commercial practices affect the value of Infrastructure subindex, and the consumer indicators mentioned in this way affect the destination competitiveness. At the same time, the results of the analysis indicate that the European Union member states that record the highest consumer confidence and the lowest level of illicit commercial practices also record the highest competitiveness as a tourism destination.","[Petrovic, Jelena] Univ Nis, Fac Sci & Math, Dept Geog Nis, Nish, Serbia; [Milicevic, Snezana] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Hotel Management & Tourism Vrnjacka Banja, Kragujevac, Serbia",University of Nis; University of Kragujevac,"Petrovic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Fac Sci & Math, Dept Geog Nis, Nish, Serbia.",jelena25@pmf.ni.ac.rs,"Milićević, Snežana/J-6395-2018","Milićević, Snežana/0000-0002-1972-9585",,,,,27,4,4,0,5,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2017,19.0,45,,,,,432,446,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404523800008,0

Using a life-cycle framework incorporating wealth levels, bequest motives, and consumption floors created by government subsidies, we examine how increased longevity in conjunction with an individual's health state transition process impacts annuity purchase decisions. Health state transition matrices are estimated from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) data. The effects of increased longevity on annuitization decisions are considered when longevity is both accompanied by increased time spent in healthier states (morbidity compression) or experienced by more time in unhealthy states (morbidity expansion). We find that retirees' annuity demand is affected by wealth, initial health status, and expansion or compression of morbidity. Wealthier retirees have higher annuity demand when health shocks are considered, and increased longevity increases demand even more when retirees expect an expansion or slight morbidity compression. With health shocks and expectations of severe morbidity compression considered, the opposite effect might occur. Thus, an annuity can help retirees hedge health shock costs when slight compression or expansion of morbidity occurs. For retirees with lower wealth, the consumption floor provided by governmental subsidies will create a decreased propensity to annuitize.","[Ai, Jing] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, 2404 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Brockett, Patrick L.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Informat Risk & Operat Management, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Golden, Linda L.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Mkt, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Zhu, Wei] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Insurance & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of International Business & Economics,"Ai, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, 2404 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jing.ai@hawaii.edu; brockett@utexas.edu; utlindagolden@gmail.com; zhuwei@uibe.edu.cn,"Golden, Linda L/A-1451-2009",,"National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71201029, 71373044]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [CXTD5-04]",National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE,"Jing Ai is at the Shidler College of Business, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, 2404 Maile Way Honolulu, HI 96822.

These Integrated Conservation and Development Projects primarily promote the intensification of natural resource production. Currently, a research program on the pathways and politics through which international organizations influence related domestic policy and cause changes is being developed. The aim of this study is to analyze the influence the World Bank had on environmental and natural resources policies aiming at poverty alleviation in Armenia. We use Armenia for analyzing how this neoliberal approach of the World Bank echoes in a post-Soviet system. Empirically, we use a qualitative case-study design building on content analysis of key policy documents from World Bank interventions and subsequent domestic policy changes. Our results show that the World Bank interventions in Armenia, formally aiming to reduce rural poverty by means of improving natural resources management, de facto promoted policy and administrative changes. These changes, however, largely benefit transnational private companies, while at the same time restricting the access of poor local users to natural resources. By employing a discourse of illegal logging and by framing local actors as the main drivers of deforestation, the World Bank achieved considerable deregulation of the forest sector. This in turn promoted privatization of the forestland as well as a reform of the state forest administration. We conclude that interventions by international organizations, such as the World Bank, may formally claim to enhance the common good e.g. through strengthening ecological goals in natural resources management. Informally, however, quite the opposite might happen: Neoliberal privatization and deregulation will further weaken state actors and their capacities, while at the same time strongly and quickly incentivizing the increase in extractive natural resource production, as observed with increased timber harvests and exports.

Previous theories have reached ambiguous conclusions as to whether countries with more debtor-friendly bankruptcy laws (i.e. laws that are more forgiving towards debtors in bankruptcy proceedings) are likely to have more entrepreneurs, or whether, creditor-friendly regimes have positive effects on new ventures via enhanced incentives for the supply of credit to entrepreneurs. Responding to this ambiguity, we apply prospect theory to propose that entrepreneurs do not attach the same significance to different elements of bankruptcy codes-and to explain which aspects of debtor-friendly bankruptcy laws matter more to entrepreneurs. Based on this, we derive and confirm hypotheses about the impact of aspects of bankruptcy codes on entrepreneurial activity using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor combined with data on both personal and corporate bankruptcy regulations for 15 developed OECD countries. We use multilevel random coefficient logistic regressions to take account of the hierarchical nature of the data (country and individual levels). Because entrepreneurs and creditors are sensitive to different elements of the codes, there is scope for optimisation of the legal design of bankruptcy law to achieve both an adequate supply of credit and to encourage high-ambition entrepreneurship.","[Estrin, Saul] London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Mickiewicz, Tomasz; Rebmann, Anna] Aston Univ, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Aston University,"Rebmann, A (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",s.estrin@lse.ac.uk; t.mickiewicz@aston.ac.uk; a.rebmann@aston.ac.uk,"estrin, saul/AAC-7000-2020; Mickiewicz, Tomasz/AAC-8016-2019","estrin, saul/0000-0002-3447-8593; Mickiewicz, Tomasz/0000-0001-5261-5662; Rebmann, Anna/0000-0002-7766-1101",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,85,34,35,4,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Changes in connectivity largely affect the external relations among cities, thus influencing the structure of the city network. This paper examines the impacts of China's HSR network on the overall connectivity and nodal centrality of the city network, as evaluated by passenger trains from 2003 to 2014. This paper employs the graph index, average path length, clustering coefficient and three indicators of centrality, namely weighted degree centrality (WDC), weighted closeness centrality (WCC) and weighted betweenness centrality (WBC). The results show that the HSR network largely increased overall connectivity according to the increasing Beta index and clustering coefficient, and decreasing average path length. The HSR lines also increased the average centrality of the city network and the inequality of nodal centrality according to the WCC indicator, but they decreased the inequality of nodal centrality with regard to the WDC and WBC indicators.

We propose that individual members in entrepreneurial teams may differ in their dispositions to act in entrepreneurial ways, that is, in their individual entrepreneurial orientation (iEO) and that these differences have meaningful implications for team performance. Drawing upon research in team diversity and entrepreneurial orientation, we argue that the three iEO diversity dimensions-proactiveness, risk taking, and innovativeness diversity-affect team outcomes in different ways, although they belong to the same diversity type and even belong to a common superordinate construct. Empirical data gathered in 104 dyadic entrepreneurial teams supports our theory: Diversity in proactiveness within a team impairs team performance. Risk-taking diversity also harms team performance by heightening relationship conflict. However, innovativeness diversity facilitates team performance. The present study contributes to two streams of research, namely, entrepreneurial team research and research on entrepreneurial orientation and is of practical significance to entrepreneurial team formation and performance.","[Kollmann, Tobias; Stoeckmann, Christoph; Meves, Yvonne; Kensbock, Julia M.] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Univ Str 9, D-45141 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Kensbock, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Univ Str 9, D-45141 Essen, Germany.",julia.kensbock@icb.uni-due.de,"Stöckmann, Christoph/HNI-2181-2023","Stöckmann, Christoph/0000-0003-3054-4765; Kensbock, Julia M./0000-0001-8642-1938",,,,,106,64,74,19,142,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The VSL estimates in U.S. studies consequently may have established a reference point for the estimates that researchers analyzing data from other countries are willing to report and that journals are willing to publish. This article presents the first comparison of the publication selection biases in U.S. and international estimates using a sample of 68 VSL studies with over 1000 VSL estimates throughout the world. Publication selection biases vary across the VSL distribution and are greater for the larger VSL estimates. The estimates of publication selection biases distinguish between U.S. and international studies as well as between government and non-government data sources. Empirical estimates that correct for the impact of these biases reduce the VSL estimates, particularly for studies based on international data. This pattern of publication bias effects is consistent with international studies relying on U.S. estimates as an anchor for the levels of reasonable estimates. U.S. estimates based on the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries constitute the only major set of VSL studies for which there is no evidence of statistically significant publication selection effects. Adjusting a baseline bias-adjusted U.S. VSL estimate of $9.6 million using estimates of the income elasticity of the VSL may be a sounder approach for generating international estimates of the VSL than relying on direct estimates from international studies.","[Viscusi, W.

This article examines the effects of export-driven factors on China's OFDI through export-supporting and export platform. On the basis of 2003-2010 panel data from 144 countries and regions, including Canada, we find a strong effect of rising exports on China's OFDI. In addition, the export platform is an important part of China's OFDI, and this trend has strengthened in recent years. Moreover, markets of neighbouring host countries do not have a significant effect on the OFDI. China's OFDI has an obvious agglomeration effect in the host countries, particularly in high-income countries. The empirical results suggest that China should pay attention to the dual effects of its export-supporting and export platform on OFDI. The government should guide enterprises to implement a mixed international trade and investment strategy and build a platform of networking investment to protect firms' overseas investments.","[Wang, Fangfang; Liu, Juan] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Natl Econ Res Ctr, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Su, Cong] Uppsala Univ, Dept Business Studies, Uppsala, Sweden",Guangdong University of Finance & Economics; Uppsala University,"Wang, F (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Natl Econ Res Ctr, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wff@gdufe.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [13CJL034],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 13CJL034).,,48,9,9,9,87,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The paper also investigates whether hedging potential of gold remains equally strong in several bearish and bullish Conditions of gold market using a quantile regression approach. It was found that there is a fairly robust evidence of gold acting as a safe haven against exchange rate risk in Pakistan and India. However, the evidence of gold hedging stock market risk is not uniformly strong in varying gold market conditions in the three cduntries. Also the evidence that gold hedges inflation risk in the US is realized only during the average and bearish conditions of gold market but not during bullish trends. The paper found robust evidence of gold acting as a safe haven against deteriorating local currency in Pakistan using daily data. The hedging and safe have benefit of gold against currency risk is also fairly strong in India as evidenced in the daily data. Thus, the empirical findings of gold acting as either a hedge or a safe haven against the risks in other asset markets need some qualification pertaining to the gold market condition itself.","[Iqbal, Javed] Inst Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan","Institute of Business Administration, Karachi","Iqbal, J (通讯作者)，Inst Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan.",jiqbal@iba.edu.pk,,,,,,,19,81,86,1,31,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Given that standard hours become discontinuous at certain establishment sizes, we employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impacts of the policy change. The theory predicts that policy change should unambiguously reduce hours worked in establishments with an initial workweek longer than the new standard hours but shorter than the old standard hours. The policy impact is expected to be zero for establishments with short hours, while it is ambiguous for establishments with very long hours. Indeed, the empirical analysis indicates that the reduction of standard hours significantly decreased hours worked in establishments whose hours are predicted to be between the old and new standard hours. Even in establishments with reduced working hours, monthly wages and annual bonuses did not decrease, leading to the increase in labor costs per hour. As a result, the policy change did not contribute to job creation. This paper demonstrates the importance of considering heterogeneous treatment effects, rather than the average treatment effects. When the policy impacts totally differ among groups, as in our case, estimating only the average treatment effect could mask the real impact. In addition, some groups actually affected by the policy may not be the ones targeted by the policy makers; in such cases, if there are heterogeneous treatment effects, unexpected outcomes can occur.

The standard VAR approach of Campbell (1991) and Voulteenaho (2002) is compared to two alternatives that use analysts' forecasts as proxies for market expectations: the ICC method of Chen et al. (2013) and the Revisions in Analysts' Forecasts (RAF) method. Methods are evaluated based on (i) the forecast accuracy of cash flow expectations, (ii) association with the other proxies of CF news, and (iii) Monte-Carlo simulations. The results suggest that analysts' forecasts behave as more accurate proxies of market expectations than the VAR system predictions. The ICC method is sensitive to the cash flow forecast errors because it amplifies forecast errors during implied cost of capital estimation. Overall, the RAF method appears to have a greater construct validity than the VAR and ICC methods as it incorporates forward looking information of direct cash flow forecasts and avoids amplification of forecast errors.","[Khimich, Natalya] Drexel Univ, 3220 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Khimich, N (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, 3220 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",natalya.v.khimich@drexel.edu,,,,,,,61,4,4,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

Taking advantage of the OECD bilateral IMS database, we analyze the short-run determinants of out-migration using a panel of Schengen countries between 1995 and 2011. We find that out-migration is counter-cyclical: foreign nationals tend to leave host countries with high unemployment, while they are likelier to stay in good times (i.e. low unemployment). Typically, a 10 % increase in the unemployment rate leads to a 5 % increase in out-migration. Thus, short-term economic fluctuations have the same qualitative effect as restrictive migration policies in economic downturns. However, we find mixed evidence for the role of economic cycles in the potential destination countries of those flows. Movers appear to be sensitive to unemployment changes in their country of origin, but they do not seem to be sensitive to business cycles in potential destinations.","[Bazillier, Remi] Univ Paris 01, F-45067 Orleans, France; [Bazillier, Remi] Univ Orleans, LEO, CNRS, UMR 7322, F-45067 Orleans, France; [Magris, Francesco; Mirza, Daniel] Univ Francois Rabelais Tours, LEO, CNRS, UMR 7322, Orleans, France; [Mirza, Daniel] CEPII, Paris, France",Universite de Orleans; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Mirza, D (通讯作者)，Univ Francois Rabelais Tours, LEO, CNRS, UMR 7322, Orleans, France.;Mirza, D (通讯作者)，CEPII, Paris, France.",remi.bazillier@univ-orleans.fr; francesco.magris@univ-tours.fr; daniel.mirza@univ-tours.fr,"Mirza, Daniel/Q-1795-2018","Mirza, Daniel/0000-0002-0685-2939; Bazillier, Remi/0000-0001-6106-3484",,,,,36,3,4,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

As a result of this, vital transport networks are becoming increasingly exposed to disruption or disablement due to weather related incidents. In order to adapt to these changing conditions it is important to gain an understanding of how weather currently impacts transport systems. This paper presents the results of a statistical analysis of the impact of weather conditions on the performance of metropolitan commuter rail based upon observations made on the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) rail system. Utilising a dataset comprising daily performance observations for 30 train services operating across the DART network, this research applies a number of multiple regression models to gain an understanding of the role of weather, temporal effects, and resulting interactions, on delays experienced by the network. While research in this area has traditional focused on the impact of single events, this study presents an examination of the role of multiple factors and their interactions. With regard to temporal effects, the largest delays are observed in the last third of the year, with peak delays occurring in November. Delays due to adverse weather conditions are observed, with rain being the primary factor related to poor performance. Interactions between different weather conditions, particularly wind and rain, as well as between weather conditions and the month in which a journey took place were also observed to be significant and resulting in delays to services.

By developing an interbank market with heterogeneous financial institutions granting loans on different network structures, we investigate which market architecture is more resilient to liquidity shocks and how the risk spreads over the modeled system. In our model, credit linkages evolve endogenously via a fitness measure based on different banks' strategies. Each financial institution, in fact, applies a strategy based on a low interest rate, a high supply of liquidity or a combination of them. Interestingly, the choice of the strategy influences both the banks' performance and the network topology. In this way, we are able to identify the most effective tactics adapt to contain contagion and the corresponding network topology. Our analysis shows that, when financial institutions combine the two strategies, the interbank network does not condense and this generates the most efficient scenario in case of shocks.","[Berardi, Simone; Tedeschi, Gabriele] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [Tedeschi, Gabriele] Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy",Universitat Jaume I; Marche Polytechnic University,"Tedeschi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy.",berardi.simone@gmail.com; gabriele.tedeschi@gmail.com,"Tedeschi, Gabriele/JNE-2457-2023","Tedeschi, Gabriele/0000-0003-2638-7373","European Union [318723, 612955]; Universitat Jaume I [P11B2012 - 27]",European Union(European Union (EU)); Universitat Jaume I,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union, Seventh Framework Programme FP7, under grant agreement MATHEMACS, no: 318723 and FinMaP no: 612955.

Knowledge strategy is a semantic construct that reflects the interface between strategic thinking and knowledge management. It is essential in designing the future of the university and in creating a sustainable intellectual capital. The exploration is based on the three stages of intellectual capital research, on the theory of multifield organizational knowledge dynamics, and the theory of nonlinear integrators. The multifield theory considers three main knowledge fields: rational, emotional, and spiritual. These fields impact on the structure of intellectual capital suggesting new building blocks: rational intellectual capital, emotional intellectual capital, and spiritual intellectual capital. Also, the paper develops a new model of organizational intellectual capital based on entropic transformation of the potential intellectual capital into an operational intellectual capital, as a result of organizational integrators' work. The research shows that efforts should be made not only in increasing the potential level of the intellectual capital but also in making the entropic transformation more efficient to increase the operational level of the intellectual capital of the university.","[Bratianu, Constantin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Bratianu, Constantin] Acad Romanian Scientists, Bucharest, Romania; [Bejinaru, Ruxandra] Univ Stefan Cel Mare Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Academy of Romanian Scientists (AOSR); Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Bratianu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.;Bratianu, C (通讯作者)，Acad Romanian Scientists, Bucharest, Romania.",constantin.bratianu@gmail.com; ruxandrabejinaru@yahoo.com,"Bejinaru, Ruxandra/Y-4648-2019; Bejinaru, Ruxandra/AAW-4372-2021; BEJINARU, RUXANDRA/CAF-3746-2022; CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/L-3402-2018","Bejinaru, Ruxandra/0000-0003-2331-155X; BEJINARU, RUXANDRA/0000-0003-2331-155X; CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/0000-0002-1029-7384",,,,,52,29,29,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,34,41,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000005,0

Remote work as one of the forms of flexible work is a modern way to adjust to ever changing needs of both employees and organizations, yet the impact of remote work intensity on work-related outcomes has not been sufficiently studied. Based on the analysis of scientific research literature, statistical data and the data collected from Latvian ICT sector employee online survey, the aim of the paper was to study the impact of remote work intensity on employee perceived productivity, job satisfaction and organizational commitment to suggest best practices for adapting and adjusting remote work policies. Employees working regularly remotely at least once a week from 48 Latvian ICT sector organizations participated in the survey. Data was analyzed using linear and hierarchical regressions and the results of the survey revealed that remote work intensity is positively related to the productivity of individual workers. However, no significant relationship was found between remote work intensity and either job satisfaction or organizational commitment as well as autonomy, employee-manager and employee-co-worker relationship quality. Negative association was found between remote work intensity and work-life balance, while lower work-life balance was found to negatively affect job satisfaction and organizational commitment. In addition, significant positive relationships were found to exist between autonomy and quality of the employee-co-worker relationship predicting productivity, job satisfaction and organizational commitment, as well as employee-manager relationship quality was found to be associated with higher levels of organizational commitment and job satisfaction. The findings will contribute to the remote work literature and help to implement and manage remote work practices.","[Cekuls, Andrejs; Malmane, Evita; Bluzmanis, Juris] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Cekuls, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Гуткина, Полина/AAW-4146-2021; Cekuls, Andrejs/V-2423-2018","Cekuls, Andrejs/0000-0003-3696-818X",,,,,16,1,1,4,30,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,96,107,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400010,0

Due to the subsidiary mandate in the host country being categorized as exploitation-orientation or exploration-orientation, we further examine whether there is a different moderating effect for different types of a subsidiary mandate. This analysis takes advantage of the data-set on Taiwan-based subsidiaries and the IPR indices by the World Economic Forum over the 2006-2009 period. The empirical results show that a stronger degree of IPR protection is, on average, found to play a significant moderating role in the influence of R&D outsourcing strategy based on local collaboration relationships.

The 1960s, 1970s and even 1980s was characterized by major economic changes. It was the period Schumpeter called as a period of creative destruction in which the new technologies have gained ground, replacing industrial bases. This scientific approach is complementary to other work in the economic field and aims at a multidisciplinary approach in order to travel the trajectory of society, but especially of the economy, of the business environment and of the company with all its specific sub-assemblies, in the context of change and conversion from the informational specific to the one based on knowledge, dominated by the new technologies and innovations, in particular pursuing the industrial revolution trajectory from Industry 1.0 to Industry 4.0. The present paper aims to make a temporal incursion and a dynamic analysis of the stages that have been made in the last years in the literature regarding the subject proposed for research. In this context, the temporal incursions of the business environment in the global context are presented, from the First Industrial Revolution to the present, when we are faced with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, along with the changes brought by these transformations in the form of entrepreneurship, organization, and resources, as well as the changes that the local and the global administrative bodies should adopt in order to keep up with societal changes.","[Ciobanu, Oana-Georgiana; Neamtu, Daniela] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, 13 Univ St, Suceava 720229, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Ciobanu, OG (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, 13 Univ St, Suceava 720229, Romania.",oana.ciobanu91@yahoo.com; dananeamtu999@gmail.com,"Neamtu, Daniela Mihaela/IAQ-7440-2023","Neamtu, Daniela Mihaela/0000-0002-8488-0900",,,,,33,0,0,0,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,397,410,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800031,0

For example, relative to the years before the act, the number of structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges was nearly unchanged, the number of workers on highway and bridge construction did not significantly increase, and the annual value of construction put in place for public highways barely budged. The author shows that as states spent Recovery Act highway grants, many simultaneously slashed their own contributions to highway infrastructure, freeing up state dollars for other uses. Next, using a cross-sectional analysis of state highway spending, the author shows that a state's receipt of Recovery Act highway dollars had no statistically significant causal impact on that state's total highway spending. Thus, the amount of actual highway infrastructure investment following the act's passage was likely very similar to that under a no-stimulus counterfactual.","[Dupor, Bill] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Div, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Dupor, B (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Div, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Dupor, William/I-5742-2016","Dupor, William/0000-0002-2407-2792",,,,,17,4,6,0,4,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

The main problem of using this approach presents the cross-sectional dependency of macroeconomics data, whose estimation may be biased and potentially inconsistent. The estimation of cross-sectional dependency using robust methods is inappropriate as well, because tax revenue is function of many variables, hence we lose too many degrees of freedom. We propose alternative approach with complex dependent variable, which measures not only tax to GDP ratio, but also effectiveness of corporate tax collection. The complex variable is constructed via DEA method and proposed approach is applied on panel containing observations of 20 EU members in period from 2000 to 2013. We conclude, that while the Laffer hypothesis is not empirically supported the tax rate is statistically significant factor in tax collection efficiency.","[Fryd, Lukas] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Stat & Informat, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Fryd, L (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Stat & Informat, Prague, Czech Republic.",xfryl@vse.cz,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,4,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

To reconstruct the paradigm of mother tongue education in institutions of higher learning by using ecological theory and promote harmonious and sustainable development of mother tongue education by virtue of comprehensiveness, association and balance is an innovative road that is attemptable. In the irreversible globalized wave, various countries treat domestic mother tongue education in institutions of higher learning as an increasingly important public basic course. No matter in the USA, Hong Kong or Taiwan, mother tongue education occupies an important position in college education and it is brought into the required course system to safeguard it in the system. In China, mother tongue education in institutions of higher learning is undertaken by College Chinese, especially for students who major in science, industry, agriculture and medicine. College Chinese is one of uncommon the school-required courses with the direct purpose of mother tongue education. According to the investigation on students' mother tongue level in College Chinese in recent years, it can be observed that from theoretical study to classroom practice and from internal support to external environment, College Chinese actually is kept in the awkward situation. The mother tongue education effects are also anxious. By reviewing the history of mother tongue education, since the Revolution of 1911, Freshman Chinese course was established under the advocate of Cai Yuanpei. This was the Chinese language course that makes the current College Chinese educators and scholars admire its brilliance and sigh with its fade. Freshman Chinese established by Tsinghua University was commonly completed by multiple teachers, including Zhu Zhiqing, Wen Yiduo, Shen Congwen, Yu Pingbo, Yang Shuda, Yu Guanying, Wang Yao and Wu Zuxiang, who taught the most brilliant parts in their classroom. Students also could gain knowledge, enjoyment and scholarship approach in the classroom. On the other hand, the setting of freshman Chinese aimed to compensate for vernacular Chinese, pointing to fill a vacancy in scholarship enlightenment and reading. After that, College Chinese has been paused for a long time until Mr. Kuang Yaming and Mr. Su Buqing advocated the reestablishment of College Chinese-the course is specific to students in non-Chinese major. The original intention of establishing such a course was to make up a missed lesson. At that time, most of students who were admitted to the college had the weak Chinese foundation. The direct purpose of establish such a course was to make up a basic course of Chinese. Guided by such an educational idea, it is enough that new teachers or young teachers make up Chinese knowledge and there is no need for famous professors giving a lesson in person. The reopening of College Chinese has already had 40 years. More and more colleges have joined, so that it is present in flourishing. However, College Chinese has been kept in the awkward situation for a long time, so that paradigm of mother tongue education falls into disorder. First of all, in terms of one dimension, lagging theoretical study and confusion of College Course can't provide the powerful intelligent support for educational practice. There are 1745 papers with the title of 'College Chinese' including 720 papers with the theme of humanity... There is the major deviation in the research direction of papers.([1]) Nearly half of College Chinese studies focus on the humanism of the course, but there is no consistent opinion. The confusion of theoretical studies is related to the priori one dimension preset of theoretical study in College Chinese. Secondly, in terms of utilitarian, College Chinese is considered as a dispensable course that is established for purposefulness and is stopped for uselessness. College Chinese is treated as a directly effective tool to make up a missed lesson for literature class, literacy class, writing class, common sense in literature and history, basic linguistics, outline of sinology and ancient Chinese. College Chinese just compensates for knowledge shortage of students. What's more, it may be changed for influences of sociocultural trends and public opinions. As a matter of fact, as the important channel of mother tongue education, College Chinese isn't as equal as College English, which is also a public basic course. The establishment is often measured by the utilitarian scale. Under the guide of utility, it is difficult for College Chinese to attract more excellent teachers and scholars indulging themselves in study. At last, in terms of closeness, as an important channel of mother tongue education, College Chinese is relatively closed. First of all, College Chinese is disconnected with Chinese education in junior and senior high schools. College Chinese is indifferent to changes of high school Chinese textbooks and college entrance examination contents, but it fails to integrate with the existing Chinese education of students. In contents chosen by College Chinese, they may be repeated with high school Chinese. On the one hand, the explanation mode in the College Chinese classroom is highly identical with high school Chinese. Characters, words, structure and induction which are called as high-four Chinese are focused. On the other hand, it emphasizes the obvious distinction between College Chinese and high school Chinese, thus students may get caught in the separation between the manner and content, so as to not know what to do. Furthermore, it is hard for College Chinese to advance with times. In self-closeness, it ignores the dramatic changes in the outside world. In recent years, the network greatly changes the lifestyle and thinking mode of students. Therefore, if College Chinese still sticks to convention and constantly repeat itself, it just makes students reject it for tiredness. Besides, the teaching practice of College Chinese is often based on self-comprehension of teachers. Part-time teachers often exceed full-time teachers, while teaching contents often focus on research contents of full-time teachers.","[Guo, Qian] Northwest Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an,"Guo, Q (通讯作者)，Northwest Univ, Fac Liberal Arts, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-463-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,53.0,,,,,,742,745,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL5MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452213200150,0

Recent studies, however, find that there is a counterbalancing trend: farmers are leaving the organic sector and reverting to conventional methods. We contribute to this new branch of literature by performing event history analysis in order to examine reversion patterns in Germany for the first time. Moreover, we present new evidence for a comparable cohort of farms on which organic production was started in the same time period between 1999 and 2003. Our results show that 30% of these newly converted farms were reverted to conventional agriculture by 2010. Most of the reversions took place between 2003 to 2005. Thus, we can conclude that these farms were reverted within six years after they had become organic. Furthermore, we find that part-time farms and farms with fattened pigs or poultry face a higher probability of reverting, while farms with a higher income potential per labor unit, a higher degree of conversion, a higher share of vegetables, and a higher number of dairy or suckler cows are less likely to revert to conventional methods. Information on reversion behavior is needed when policy aims at reaching a higher share of organic area in a country. In order to prevent organic farmers from leaving the organic sector, we recommend offering an extended advisory service both before and during conversion as well as continuous support after conversion. Particular support for part-time farms or farms with pigs and poultry may contribute to the growth of the organic sector.","[Heinze, Sanna] Thunen Inst Farm Econ, Braunschweig, Germany; [Vogel, Alexander] Stat Off Hamburg & Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Vogel, A (通讯作者)，Stat Off Hamburg & Schleswig Holstein, Res Data Ctr, Frobelstr 15-17, D-24113 Kiel, Germany.",alexander.vogel@statistik-nord.de,"Vogel, Alexander/B-2286-2012",,,,,,24,3,3,1,24,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

A new concept of management has been formulated which reconciles the controversial requirements of cost efficiency and reliability. The peculiar feature of the proposed concept is that, firstly, the condition of company's electrical engineering and infrastructural facilities is monitored; secondly, and the equipment performance analysis is carried out taking into account probable breakdowns; thirdly, economic losses from equipment failures are evaluated; fourthly, power consumers become categorized; fifthly, repair works become rated by their urgency. The proposed concept has the integrating idea of shaping a balance of production features, risks and maintenance and repair costs. Due to introduction of the maintenance and repair management based on the newly formulated concept, the repair schedules become optimized in terms of cutting down the likeliness of failures and retaining the company's economic efficiency. Some ingenious tools are offered for implementing the organizational management technology: a graphical chart of multi-dimensional positioning of facilities in the customer categorization - facility technical condition coordinates; a method of calculating the economic losses; a consumer category matrix; a summary table of repair urgency rating. The herein proposed matching concept of organizational management is noted for adaptability and multi-aspect analysis of the factors reflecting the interests of grid companies and power consumers. The expediency and practicality of the proposed organizational management technology are confirmed with calculations of an optimal maintenance and repair scheme as exemplified on a regional power grid company.","[Ismagilova, Larisa; Sitnikova, Larisa] Ufa State Aviat Tech Univ, USATU, Ufa, Russia",Ufa University of Science & Technology,"Ismagilova, L (通讯作者)，Ufa State Aviat Tech Univ, USATU, Ufa, Russia.",ismagilova_ugatu@mail.ru; s_larissa@yandex.ru,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,252,257,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600043,0

One of the problems that the researchers of the Russian Arctic face is the limited availability of the publicly accessible statistical data. Official statistics often cannot catch up with fast speed changes in the Arctic communities. While several case studies have been conducted with the use of qualitative methods for the analysis of tourism development, the knowledge gap exists in quantitative estimations of the phenomenon. Meanwhile, occupation of the one-third of the Arctic territory, concentration of endemic wildlife species, preserved unique Arctic cultures, and improvements in transportation accessibility, make the area highly attractive for tourists. In order to receive more adjusted information on the development of tourist infrastructure, the authors combined analysis of secondary data taken from the previous studies and Russian Committee of Statistics with the Internet tourist resources available in Russian (tourist sites). Based on analysis of available information, the authors distinguished three zones differing in the prospects and scale of the development of tourism infrastructure: European, Siberian, and Far Eastern. While the Russian Arctic has a lot of specific advantages and disadvantages for the tourism development in comparison with other Arctic countries, the interregional contrasts in economies, natural conditions and transportation access are also highly important for understanding different trajectories of tourism development.","[Kuklina, Vera] George Washington Univ, Lab Georesources & Polit Geog, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Kuklina, Maria; Rogov, Viktor] Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Dept Management Ind Enterprises, Irkutsk, Russia; [Ruposov, Vitaly; Bayaskalanova, Tuyana] Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Irkutsk, Russia",George Washington University; Irkutsk National Research Technical University (INRTU); Irkutsk National Research Technical University (INRTU),"Kuklina, V (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Lab Georesources & Polit Geog, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",vvkuklina@gmail.com; kuklina-kmv@yandex.ru; vitality@mail.ru; rogovvu@mail.ru; dama83@mail.ru,"Kuklina, Vera/I-4715-2016; Ruposov, Vitaliy/B-5051-2019; Kuklina, Maria/AAV-8890-2021; Bayaskalanova, Tuyana/B-6433-2019","Kuklina, Vera/0000-0001-8618-8507; Bayaskalanova, Tuyana/0000-0003-2347-3137; Kuklina, Maria/0000-0002-9571-2144",RFBR [16-33-01189(a2)],RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),The reported study was funded by RFBR according to the research project No 16-33-01189(a2).,,22,5,6,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,379,385,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600063,0

This analysis is applied to MoS routes connecting the Italian mainland with Sicily. The study involves: a detailed intermodal network model which compares monetary costs and travel times from all relevant origins in the mainland to all relevant destinations in Sicily; and a survey carried out at some representative trucking firms operating to/from Sicily. The aim of the interviews has been: on one side to make a comparison between the theoretical and actual mode of transport and routes taken, and in case they are different, to understand the reasons of the discrepancy; on the other side to determine what are the main aspects taken into account by trucking companies in their modal choice, in order to understand how the cordpetiveness of MoS against road transport can be improved. The results of the analysis Show that the modal choice is affected by several elements: monetary costs and travel times; reliability of MoS routes; availability of MoS routes; MoS routes frequencies; but it resulted from the interviews that monetary costs and travel times are the most important factors considered by trucking companies in the modal and route choice. This study has also shown that an improvement of MoS routes on the Italian Adriatic side is necessary: actually, a strong reason for which in Italy MoS traffic is still a small percentage of road traffic is the low number of MoS routes currently in operation and their low frequency. This analysis could help decision makers, and maritime operators, to efficiently invest in the improvement of MoS routes. Moreover, this analysis, developed for an Italian case study, can be applied to other European and Mediterranean scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the article is to find statistically significant differences in financing policy between family owned companies and others. As many as 4,539 listed companies in selected Central and Eastern European countries were analyzed in period of 2007-2016, including more than 603 family ones. The analysis was focused on capital structure, profitability and liquidity. Besides descriptive statistics the significance difference test were used. The research was conducted in a general, sectoral and national context. Results show that family businesses compared to other companies apply conservative financing policies. They are less indebted and generally achieve higher profitability. It must be stressed, however, that results obtained are not entirely clear. This may be caused both by the sectoral conditions of financing strategy and the differences in the family business development stage in particular country. Our findings do not allow concluding about the role of liquidity in the financial policy at the general level, but only at national one. The obtained results contribute to the research on the capital structure determinants and provide new insights about the family businesses behaviour. Some information about the role of centralized ownership in business management was provided as well. The results are mostly consistent with previous achievements, but they point some significant differences in the level of borrowing ability or financial liquidity in each country.","[Marszalek, Jakub] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Marszalek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland.",,,"Marszalek, Jakub/0000-0002-7665-1497",,,,,24,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,366,376,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400037,0

For this purpose, a Just-Pope production function indicates production inputs' influence on output risk, and a Holt-Laury lottery is used to measure farmers' risk attitudes. We then test whether more risk averse farmers use more risk-reducing and less risk-increasing production inputs. To do so, a unique data set which includes 185 small-scale rubber farmers on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, is used. The Just-Pope production function suggests that higher fertiliser usage has a risk-reducing effect, whereas higher herbicide usage has a risk-increasing effect. Comparing this with the outcome of a Holt-Laury lottery, we found that more risk averse farmers use more fertiliser (risk-reducing) and less herbicides (risk-increasing). The consistency of these results can be interpreted as reinforcing the external validity of measuring risk attitude with a Holt-Laury lottery.","[Moser, Stefan; Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Moser, S (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Farm Management Grp, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",smoser@gwdg.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees and Martin Banse for helpful comments and suggestions.

The accent is also on the gender-based differences in consumer gender and in their decision-making styles. By analysing current market trends and patterns of the consumer behaviour, the goal is to determine whether and how these trends affect changes in the patterns of modern consumer behaviour. The survey was conducted by using a questionnaire. The structured questionnaire was used on a random sample of consumers. Consumer decision styles determine the way of consumer decision in purchasing and they are relatively stable. However, under the influence of market changes and contemporary trends, they are also changeable. Demographic changes, as well as a consumer lifestyle changes, affect changes in consumer decision-making styles and shopping habits. The research results indicate significant differences in consumer purchase decision-making between different genders. The research shows that significant differences exist between women's shopping behaviour and men's shopping behaviour through several dimensions of decision-making styles: brand preference, price sensitivity, shopping preference for fun and relaxation, tendency to fashion trends, tendency to modern shopping. The research results can help businesses to understand consumer behaviour and to predict consumer needs, as well as their purchasing habits. In that way they can adapt their offer, sales and promotions to the targeted consumer segment and, therefore, face the market challenges easier.","[Nanic, Arnela] Univ Bihac, Fac Econ, Bihac, Bosnia & Herceg",,"Nanic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bihac, Fac Econ, Bihac, Bosnia & Herceg.",arnela.nanic@unbi.ba; dijana.tevsic@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,2,15,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,299,313,,,,,,15,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900018,0

As a result separate panel regression models were determined for each industry sectors and EU Member States based on the variables, such as operating revenues, payroll, added value and tangible fixed assets. Those regression factors are able to statistically significantly explain the variability in the generation of EBIT margin in case of SME in EU 28, which is often used for transfer pricing purposes.

This paper argues for a class-relational approach to NREGS and, by extension, to social policy more generally. By locating NREGS in a broader context of antagonistic class relations, it becomes clearer why, where, when and how it either contributes to pro-labouring-class change or to reproducing the position of the dominant class. This is particularly important in the South Indian state of Karnataka, where (i) national sample survey data indicates that NREGS has performed relatively badly and (ii) the recent rate of decline of poverty has been amongst the slowest in the country. Based on longitudinal fieldwork in villages in two North Karnataka districts, this paper's class-relational approach explains significant differences in NREGS outcomes across time and place - primarily with regard to intra- and inter-class relations, which are interlinked with caste and gender relations. In one fieldwork district, high levels of implementation have declined due to increased (but uneven) dominant class control over the scheme. In the other, initial subversion of the scheme has been partially challenged by collective labouring-class action.","[Pattenden, Jonathan] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Pattenden, J (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",j.pattenden@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,83,10,12,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The family farms, with their 97 percent share, represent the most common type of farms, including large and small farms, full-time as well as the part-time ones. In 2013, the average acreage of agricultural holding in the EU-28 was 16.1 hectares, while in Slovakia it was 80.7 hectares of agricultural land per holding. The aim of submitted paper is to determine the minimum size of agricultural land of a small family farm focused on crop production at various cost variants of farms. The partial aim of the paper is primarily to find dependence between expenditure (costs) and the acreage of agricultural land. Another aim is to determine the minimum acreage in hectares needed to support one average Slovak family with 4 members (2 adults and 2 children). In the paper was analyzed dependence of expenditures (costs) of farmers on the acreage of agricultural land. Based on the correlation results, the total expenditures of physical entities associated with land management are not clearly dependent on the acreage of the farm. Subsequently, we have provided 3 variants of economic-mathematical models for determining the minimum acreage of agricultural land for sustaining one average farm family. The results of the submitted paper proved, that the more agricultural activities are realized by the farm family itself, the smaller acreage of agricultural land is needed to cover the household expenditures. The results of the paper proved that, according to the model of an average farm focused on crop production, the acreage of 41.35 ha of agricultural land is needed for one family. This option assumes that the family farm will not hire another employee and will not bear production and administrative costs.","[Rovny, Patrik; Dobak, Dusan; Kadekova, Zdenka; Kubicova, L'ubica] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Nitra, Slovakia; [Smutka, Lubos] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Rovny, P (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Nitra, Slovakia.",patrik.rovny@gmail.com; dusan.doba@uniag.sk; zdenka.kadekova@uniag.sk; lubica.kubicova@uniag.sk; smutka@pef.czu.cz,"Kádeková, Zdenka/AAH-6817-2021; Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015","Kádeková, Zdenka/0000-0003-2814-5239; Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333",,,,,10,1,1,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,327,334,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400044,0

The current approach is based on the European values and universal rights, focusing on the Europe 2020 agenda and its inherent implications. The conducted analysis reveals the intensity of social changes and their impact in financial terms, developing different theoretical patterns that should apply to the identified welfare state typology, in order to classify the models. The methodological approach insists on the coherence between economic, social and environmental progress through relevant case studies and variable analysis, providing the necessary tools to compose an ideal social economic model in the examined area.","[Schipor, Constantin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Doctoral Sch Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Schipor, C (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Doctoral Sch Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania.",constantin.schipor@ymail.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,FILODIRITTO PUBLISHER,BOLOGNA,"INFOROMATICA SRL, VIA CASTIGLIONE, 81, BOLOGNA, 40124, ITALY",,,978-88-95922-97-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,119,126,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6KN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426793600016,0

And because land is being constantly lost, not only due to urbanisation processes, food availability and food security becomes a policy agenda. Main aim of this contribution is to determine development of the index of food security in Visegrad countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) between 2004 and 2015. Partial aims are comparison of the resulting index among countries and identify the main variables in the reporting period affecting the overall result. The Index of Food Security (IFS) is evaluated using base index, where year 2004 was selected as base due to the EU accession. Based on reached results it can be concluded, that in the Czech Republic food security fluctuated significantly over the examined period, but in long-term perspective it does not change a lot. The IFS is rather stable in Hungary, the only exception was in 2007 and 2011. In Poland, Index of Food Security is rather constant with the exception of 2006 and 2014.

Besides online survey, we have directing collect the data from students at Ton Duc Thang university in Ho Chi Minh city. The statistical analysis method conducted in this paper is Factor analysis using SPSS 20.0 version software. Findings - Result indicate that attitude, control on available, subjective norm and green trust played important role influencing young consumer's purchase intention of organic cosmetic. Research Limitations - the sample was limited in Vietnam and sample size may not represent the population of organic cosmetic consumers. Implications - Vietnamese become more and more concerned about environment, especially young Vietnamese, so that the green consumption will continue to grow.

In this paper, the author analyzes the current situation and existing problems of College English teaching combined with some problems encountered in practice teaching and related information, and puts forward measures to improve English teaching efficiency from multiple perspectives. With the deepening of the process of economic globalization, English plays a more important role in people's life. Especially for college students, in addition to professional knowledge, English ability is also indispensable. From the perspective of practical English teaching, our college students' English level has not yet achieved the expected goal, because the efficiency of College English classroom teaching is not high.

The research methodology combined qualitative and quantitative research. Four focus groups were conducted in the first qualitative research, followed by a selection made by the specialists. This research is original as there is no research to investigate the construct of city brand personality of a Romanian city, particularly of the city of Iasi. The article delivers scales to measure the dimensions of city brand personality for the city of Iasi: Peacefulness/Sincerity, Malignancy, and Competence. The results of this research are useful for travel agencies, in order to promote the city of Iasi for offers such as city breaks, according to how it is already perceived. Also, these results are useful for the local administration managers. The research provides a clear image of the personality of this city. Local administration managers may decide either to keep the image or promote it as it is or to define a strategy to modify aspects of the perceived personality of the city. One important limitation is that the research investigated only students, as both tourist and partly inhabitants. We considered they are more familiar with the investigated city and their opinion is more reliable. Yet, this research would probably bring slightly different results if only tourists' perceptions would be investigated.","[Tugulea, Oana; Stoian (Bobalca), Claudia] Alexandru loan Cuza Univ, 22 Carol 1 St, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Tugulea, O (通讯作者)，Alexandru loan Cuza Univ, 22 Carol 1 St, Iasi 700505, Romania.",ciobanu.oana@uaic.ro; iuliana.bobalca@uaic.ro,"Stoian, Claudia/R-1828-2016",,,,,,44,0,0,0,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,341,350,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800026,0

The contribution analyses application of different concepts of old-age pensions under the different times and conditions. The methodology concentrates on the comparative analysis of the retirement systems in this direction, in particular on the role of the statutory retirement ages. We find that the current Czech public old-age pensions are extremely inconsistent with any standard retirement system and/or welfare regime.

A socioeconomic food security index and qualitative data are used to assess the dairy's supply chain's contribution to strengthen smallholder households' livelihoods. Data for this research were obtained through individual surveys, focus groups and in- depth interviews of LDB managers and milk suppliers. Results show that milk income contributes significantly to household food security. Suppliers who stabilize their dairy income between rainy and dry seasons, diversify income sources and have larger herds are more likely to remain food secure. The LDB innovations contribute by helping herders access biophysical and economic resources, leading to better livestock feed and household food security.","[Wane, Abdrahmane] Int Livestock Res Inst, CIRAD PPZS, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Wane, Abdrahmane] Int Livestock Res Inst, ILRI PIL, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Cadilhon, Jean-Joseph] Int Livestock Res Inst, Policy Inst & Livelihoods Program, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Yauck, Mamadou] CIRAD Delegat Reg, Pole Pastoralism & Drylands PPZS, 37 Ave Jean 13,BP 6189, Dakar, Senegal; [Yauck, Mamadou] Laval Univ, 2185 Ave, Chapdelaine, PQ G1V 1M9, Canada",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CIRAD; Laval University,"Wane, A (通讯作者)，Int Livestock Res Inst, CIRAD PPZS, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.;Wane, A (通讯作者)，Int Livestock Res Inst, ILRI PIL, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",awane@cirad.fr,,"Yauck, Mamadou/0000-0003-3841-8990; Wane, Abdrahmane/0000-0001-5081-3788","CIRAD; Small Grants Program of the CGIAR Standing Panel on Impact Assessment; CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","CIRAD; Small Grants Program of the CGIAR Standing Panel on Impact Assessment(CGIAR); CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets(CGIAR)","We would like to express our special gratitude and thanks to the Consortium of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), The French Centre for Agricultural Research and International Cooperation (CIRAD) and GRET, an international development NGO governed by French law, for allowing us to use their databases from the study area.

Our analysis is carried out on a sample of 925 Tunisian traders over the period 2009-2014 to find out how gender, age, investor characteristics, portfolio management types, bull or bear market conditions, and external factors are related to the intensity of the disposition effect by separately tracking their trading transaction histories. The findings show mainly robust evidence of disposition bias across different groups of investors. In particular, the study reveals that male and younger Tunisian investors suffer from a strong disposition bias compared with their counterparts, female and mature investors. Furthermore, our results show that other behavioral biases, including market trading volume, the value of a share traded, trading frequency, trading in round numbers, and the investor's overall level of portfolio diversification depend on the disposition effect. Concerning the bull and bear market issue, we divided our data period into bull and bear markets to observe the effect of disposition bias every month of the year, and we found that this effect is even more pronounced in bull markets.

Published research on NGOs has paralleled this growth, yet there exists scant synthesis of the literature. This article presents a synthesis, while also introducing a collaborative research platform, the NGO Knowledge Collective. We ask four questions: first, who studies NGOs, and how do they study them? Second, what issues, sectors and places are studied when NGOs are the focus? Third, what effect do NGO activities have on specific development outcomes? And fourth, what path should the NGO research agenda take? To answer these questions, we conduct a mixed-method systematic review of social science publications on NGOs, which includes computer-assisted content analysis of 3336 English-language journal articles (1980-2014), alongside a close, qualitative analysis of 300 randomly selected articles. We find, first, that interdisciplinary journals dominate NGO publishing, that research on NGOs is more qualitative than quantitative, and that practitioners publish, but Northern academics create most published knowledge. Second, we find the literature is framed around six overarching questions regarding: the nature of NGOs; their emergence and development; how they conduct their work; their impacts; how they relate to other actors; and how they contribute to the (re)production of cultural dynamics. Articles also focus disproportionately on the most populated and/or politically salient countries, and on the governance and health sectors. Third, we find that scholars generally report favorable effects of NGOs on health and governance outcomes. Fourth, we propose a research agenda calling for scholars to: address neglected sectors, geographies, and contextual conditions; increase author representativeness; improve research designs to include counterfactuals or comparison groups; and better share data and findings, including results from additional, focused NGO-related systematic reviews. Implementing this agenda will help reduce bias in decisions by donors, governments, and other development actors, which should improve development outcomes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Firms face a trade-off between investment scale and the cost of capital measured by the credit spread. Small-scale investment is safe, fully collateralized, but earns modest profits in all states. Large-scale investment is risky, requires a positive credit spread, but yields high profits only in good states and default in bad states. CDS only affect risky credit spreads, which in turn affects the opportunity cost of issuing collateralized, safe debt. Covered (Naked) CDS lower (raise) credit spreads and raise (lower) the likelihood of issuing risky debt.

We reproduce this correlation for 177 countries from 1998 to 2014. However, once taking account of country-specific heterogeneity via fixed effects, these negative associations disappear, both in terms of statistical significance and magnitude. This suggests that female participation rates in politics and the labor market are not directly linked to lower corruption. Exploiting country-specific dimensions of culture, we then present evidence from pooled estimations suggesting that power distance and masculinity are systematically associated with both corruption and female participation rates. In fact, these two cultural characteristics are sufficient to fully explain the link between gender and corruption. Therefore, culture is an important dimension to consider when analyzing the relationship between female participation in society and corruption since the omission of cultural characteristics can produce a spurious correlation between increased female participation rates alone and reduced corruption levels.","[Debski, Julia; Moesle, Saskia; Stadelmann, David] Univ Bayreuth, Univ Str 30, Bayreuth, Germany; [Jetter, Michael] Univ Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Jetter, Michael] Inst Study Labor, Bonn, Germany; [Jetter, Michael] CESifo Res Affiliate Ctr Econ Studies, Munich, Germany; [Stadelmann, David] CREMA, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Bayreuth; University of Western Australia; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Jetter, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",mjetter7@gmail.com,"Stadelmann, David/I-1116-2019","Stadelmann, David/0000-0002-1211-9936; Jetter, Michael/0000-0001-7967-5200; Meuchelbock, Saskia/0000-0002-8970-3735",,,,,72,33,35,2,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

However, despite the common assumption used in the empirical literature of homogenous impact across banks, the strength of this relationship is often bank-specific, and imposing homogeneity may lead to over- or underestimating the resilience of the financial system to macroeconomic woes. We introduce a three-stage approach to generate forecasts of macro-financial variables and project non-performing loans (NPLs) in a way that accounts for banks' heterogeneous reactions to macro-financial shocks in a dynamic context and for potential cross-sectional dependence across banks caused by common shocks. An application to Ecuador suggests that both substantial heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence are present and that should be taken into account when trying to anticipate inflections in the quality of the portfolio.

We also utilize the econometric methods of Greenaway-McGrevy and Phillips (2016) to explore the possibility of contagion between these two markets. The paper offers significant econometric-based evidence of bubbles in both markets during this period in Japan and more importantly, for the first time in the literature, formal tests of bubble contagion from Japan's stock market to its real estate market. Our findings may help to understand why Japan's real estate bubble collapsed after the stock price bubble, as the bubble-like behaviour from the stock market migrates to the real estate market.","[Hu, Yang; Oxley, Les] Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Waikato, New Zealand",University of Waikato,"Oxley, L (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Waikato, New Zealand.",les.oxley@waikato.ac.nz,"Oxley, Les T/A-6075-2008; Oxley, Les/JDW-1971-2023","Oxley, Les/0000-0003-3621-2323; Hu, Yang/0000-0001-9277-8992",,,,,44,16,18,4,37,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0889-1583,1095-8681,,J JPN INT ECON,J.

This inequality-reducing effect is highly likely to operate from better education attainments and improved health status due to oil booms.","[Kim, Dong-Hyeon] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Lin, Shu-Chin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 SungKyunKwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Korea University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Lin, SC (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 SungKyunKwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",dhk1015@korea.ac.kr; sclin@skku.eduw,"Lin, Shu-Chin/AAG-3608-2019",,,,,,58,25,26,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Consequently, many governments, donors and non-governmental organizations have encouraged on-farm fuelwood production and agroforestry practices. Whether, however, fuelwood from different sources can be easily substituted is an important empirical question as the degree of substitutability can depend on local markets and households' resource endowments and incomes. In this paper, we examine the substitution between three fuelwood sources among rural households in western Kenya: fuelwood collected off-farm, fuelwood produced on-farm, and that which is purchased. Using household-specific shadow prices for fuelwood and male and female wages, we find that strict gender divisions in household labor result in limited substitution between fuelwood sources. Among the implications are that programs and policies promoting agroforestry will have limited success without first addressing the structural differences in labor markets.","[Murphy, David M.

We demonstrate that when banks are inefficient with high loan monitoring costs, regulatory effort is a strategic substitute so that each country's regulator tends to exert lower effort free-riding that of the other countries' regulator. On the other hand, when banks are efficient with lower monitoring costs, regulatory effort is a strategic complement and regulators have lower incentives to free-ride. However, regulators face multiple equilibria and thus financial instability if each of them responds in an overly sensitive manner to another's strategy. In this case, introducing informational barriers can refine multiple equilibria into a unique equilibrium. The results suggest that cooperative financial policy coordination mechanism is more likely to be sustained among countries whose banking sectors' political influence on regulators is smaller and more homogeneous.

Defining a management plan is, however, a complex task that entails multidisciplinary work. In fact, while it requires solid scientific knowledge of fish stocks, the inclusion of economic and social objectives is crucial to a successful management implementation. In this paper we develop an age-structured bioeconomic model where the objective function is modified to accommodate preferences from different stakeholders. In particular, we consider important characteristics that a management plan should take into account: profit maximization, fishermen's preference for reducing landings' fluctuations and risk of fishery collapse. Modeling preferences for reducing landings' fluctuations is accomplished by defining a utility function with aversion to intertemporal income fluctuations. Building upon biology literature, we model precautionary concerns by incorporating a probability of collapse that depends on current spawning biomass. We illustrate how this framework is able to assist in the analysis and design of harvest control rules applying it to the Ibero-Atlantic sardine stock.","[Rosa, Renato] Univ Nova Lisboa, CENSE Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Rosa, Renato; Vaz, Joao; Mota, Rui] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vaz, Joao] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Silva, Alexandra] IPMA, Ave Dr Alfredo Magalhaes Ramalho 6, P-1449006 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Wyoming; Instituto Portugues do Mar e da Atmosfera,"Rosa, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, CENSE Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal.;Rosa, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal.",renato.rosa@novasbe.pt,"SILVA, MARIA ALEXANDRA/I-4326-2017; Vaz, João/AAZ-2607-2021","SILVA, MARIA ALEXANDRA/0000-0002-2950-1429; Rosa, Renato/0000-0002-1155-9681; Mota, Rui Pedro/0000-0003-3650-4924; Lameiras Vaz, Joao Manuel/0000-0003-3211-9287","Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, I.P., Portugal [Pest-OE/AMB/UI4085/2013]; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [UID/ECO/00124/2013]; POR Lisboa [LISBOA-01-0145-FEDER-007722]; FCT [SFRH/BPD/81880/2011]; EU/DGMARE Fisheries Data Collection Framework (DCF); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/81880/2011, PEst-OE/AMB/UI4085/2013] Funding Source: FCT","Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, I.P., Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); POR Lisboa; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); EU/DGMARE Fisheries Data Collection Framework (DCF); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian.

Specifically, a cross-sectional regression of the power law coefficients obtained from stock returns on the coefficients implied by the nonparametric volatility model yields a slope close to one.

Using property rights theory, the purpose of this paper is to hypothesize the contingent effect that these property rights changes have on the investment of individual human and financial capital toward entrepreneurship. In addition, this study also explores whether property rights changes have a differential effect on the two forms of entrepreneurship, namely, opportunity and necessity entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach This research uses logit regression analysis on a two-period model using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) database to test these effects. Findings Contrary to existing evidence from western contexts, this study finds that property rights changes have a significant influence on the investment of both forms of capital toward necessity entrepreneurship in China. Research limitations/implications The use of a secondary database like GEM has certain limitations, such as the non-availability of data on a longitudinal basis, and the need to operationalize certain constructs like social and financial capital as non-continuous variables. Originality/value There has been limited research on the phenomena of necessity entrepreneurship in economies such as that of China. The findings of this study highlight that property rights protection is equally important for necessity entrepreneurship in institutional contexts like China.","[Sahasranamam, Sreevas] Strathclyde Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Raman, G.

Design/methodology/approach A total sample of 4,249 firm-year observations from 13 different industries spanning a total of eight years (from 2005 to 2012) is used for this purpose. The ordinary least squares regression technique is used to test the influence of various industry variables on earnings management activity. Findings The findings indicate the presence of earnings management practices in Malaysian industries. Among industry-level variables, capital intensity, volatility and profitability are found to influence aggregate earnings management. Further analysis shows that volatility only influences the smoothing measure while profitability influences the discretionary measure. Interestingly, industry competitiveness and leverage are not able to explain the variations in earnings management across industries. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study which documents the role of various industry characteristics in influencing earnings management activity. It highlights the importance of considering industry-level variables in a study on earnings management and, hence, adds to the growing literature on earnings management.","[Wasiuzzaman, Shaista] Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Cyberjaya Campus, Cyberjaya, Malaysia",Multimedia University,"Wasiuzzaman, S (通讯作者)，Multimedia Univ, Fac Management, Cyberjaya Campus, Cyberjaya, Malaysia.",shaistaw76@gmail.com,"Wasiuzzaman, Shaista/H-8403-2019","Wasiuzzaman, Shaista/0000-0002-0244-2174",,,,,71,4,5,1,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

In the computation of total economic capital, a financial institution faces a considerable amount of model uncertainty related to the estimation of the interdependence amongst the marginal risks. In this paper, we propose to apply a clustering procedure in order to partition a risk portfolio into independent subgroups of positively dependent risks. Based on available data, the portfolio partition so obtained can be statistically validated and allows for a reduction of capital and the corresponding model uncertainty. We illustrate the proposed methodology in a simulation study and two case studies considering an Operational and a Market Risk portfolio. A rule of thumb stems from the various examples proposed: in a mathematical model where the risk portfolio is split into independent subsets with comonotonic dependence within, the smallest VaR-based capital estimate (at the high regulatory probability levels typically used) is produced by assuming that the infinite-mean risks are comonotonic and the finite-mean risks are independent. The largest VaR estimate is instead generated by obtaining the maximum number of independent infinite-mean sums. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Di Lascio, F.

This paper contributes to this literature by examining the relationship at the sub-national level. We also add value to the existing literature in that we employ data capturing the extent to which the shadow economy and corruption are viewed as problems by firms as opposed to the standard measures of corruption and the size of the shadow economy. Using World Bank Enterprise Survey data, we find that sub-national units in which more firms report that corruption is an obstacle to their operations also tend to have more firms that report that the practices of informal competitors are an obstacle and vice versa. Sub-Saharan Africa is different in that neither of these findings is evident in that sub-sample.","[Gillanders, Robert] Dublin City Univ, Dublin, Ireland; [Gillanders, Robert] Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki, Finland; [Parviainen, Sinikka] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Espoo, Finland",Dublin City University; Hanken School of Economics; Aalto University,"Gillanders, R (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Business Sch, Room Q251, Dublin 9, Ireland.",rgillanders@gmail.com,"Gillanders, Robert/I-5105-2019","Gillanders, Robert/0000-0001-9462-0005",Foundation for Economic Education (Liikesivistysrahasto),Foundation for Economic Education (Liikesivistysrahasto),Foundation for Economic Education (Liikesivistysrahasto),,44,14,14,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We find that a directorship on another board is more likely to be undisclosed when the other firm experienced an adverse event-such as an accounting restatement, securities litigation, or bankruptcy-during the director's tenure. Withholding such information is associated with a more favorable stock price reaction to the director's appointment and the loss of fewer subsequent directorships.

People react more strongly and persistently to the move-in of the offender in places wherein indicators of social connectedness are stronger, such as places with relatively low population density. We also find that, unlike housing prices, rents do not change in response to the move-in of a sex offender. These heterogeneous housing market responses may be attributed to better acquisition of and higher sensitivity to information on local (dis)amenities among (potential) members in highly connected communities, particularly among homeowners.

A usual requirement is that REITs can only disseminate information relating to their property valuations once per year; therefore, this leads to the lagging effect. Within the context of exchange options (i.e. mergers), it seems that no study has researched on this theme. This article uses the Black & Scholes model to calculate implied volatilities and their corresponding implied options to illustrate arbitrage opportunities when exchange options emerge. The results illustrate that implied volatilities are different from non-implied volatilities. Further, arbitrage is still higher among REITs as opposed to other capital market instruments.

In this paper, a pair-wise comparison between the conventional risk premium and the accrued risk premium in rolled-over positions on the front contract is carried out for UK natural gas futures. Several novel results are obtained. Firstly, and most importantly, the accrued risk premium in rollover strategies is significatively larger than conventional risk premiums and increases with the time to delivery. Specifically, for strategy horizons between three and six months, this difference increases from 1% to 10% (or from 4% to 20% in annualized returns). Secondly, it is the first time that risk premium in day-ahead forwards has been measured in this market. The average value of the day-ahead risk premium is 0.5% per day and it is statistically significant. Thirdly, all risk premiums are significantly larger and more volatile in winter. Finally, risk premium time-variation is analysed using a regression model. It is shown that reservoir shocks, demand shocks and spot price volatility are significant explicative variables and its sign reflects equilibrium models implications for storable commodities.","[Martinez, Beatriz] Univ Valencia, Dept Business Finance, Valencia, Spain; [Torro, Hipolit] Univ Valencia, Dept Financial & Actuarial Econ, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Torró, H (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Avda Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",hipolit.torro@uv.es,"Martinez, Beatriz/K-4830-2017; TORRO, HIPOLIT/K-3420-2017","Martinez, Beatriz/0000-0002-9950-8116; TORRO, HIPOLIT/0000-0002-2963-9276",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-40816-P],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"Financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Project ECO2013-40816-P) is gratefully acknowledged.

Being one of the most dynamics industries, tourism proves to be strongly resilient, with a high level of involvement and multiplication for receiver economies. The multiplication potential is, however, dependent upon a series of factors (endogenous and exogenous), insufficiently analysed in the literature, and the impact on growth and convergence is controversial. This paper aims to bring additional insights from this perspective, the main purpose of the research being to identify the macroeconomic determinants responsible for the higher values of the tourism multiplier effect and to highlight the potential of this industry to reduce the disparities between the economies of the European Union EU. Using the Stepwise regression and a series of indicators that associate the economic, social and spatial dimensions of European tourism, the main determinants of multiplier effects (on GDP and job creation) are identified and, then, the processes of multiplication from the perspective of centre-periphery dynamics are analysed. The research results indicated that tourism development in the Union reflects a centre-periphery model and has a high potential for contributing to reducing infra-EU disparities.","[Pascariu, Gabriela Carmen; Ibanescu, Bogdan-Constantin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Pascariu, GC (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",gcpas@uaic.ro,"Pascariu, Gabriela Carmen/O-4976-2015; Ibanescu, Bogdan/AAT-2248-2020","Pascariu, Gabriela Carmen/0000-0002-8169-0124; IBANESCU, Bogdan-Constantin/0000-0002-3861-2251",,,,,50,18,19,3,32,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,982,997,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/982,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700011,0

We concentrated on the international transmission of credit risk through the internal capital market of multinational banks. Our theoretical assumptions follow studies that document how the parent bank condition and home country macroeconomic environment affect lending in subsidiaries in CEE countries. However, our results go one step further. We provide evidence that these relationships are reflected in subsidiaries' credit risk in CEE countries. Our results suggest that the size and profitability of the parent bank have negative influences, while the liquidity and credit risk of the parent bank have positive influences on the subsidiaries' credit risk. Moreover, the GDP growth in the parent bank's country has a negative effect on the credit risk of the subsidiary, while the lending rate and liquidity in the parent bank country cause growth in the credit risk.

Impulse responses for total, youth, and long-term unemployment are estimated using local projections for a panel of 20 OECD countries over the period 1980-2013. The empirical findings suggest that a decline in private credit can generate sizable and statistically significant increases in all three unemployment measures. On average, credit contractions in the sample increase total unemployment rates by nearly 1 percentage point at the peak. This effect is even stronger for youth unemployment. The persistent impact on long-term unemployment emphasizes the sluggish recovery of labor markets following a credit downturn. The results also reveal that increases in joblessness depend heavily on the scale of the build-up in financial leverage prior to the onset of a contraction. Specifically, excessive credit booms tend to be followed by a significantly larger rise in unemployment in the subsequent bust phase. Moreover, credit contractions associated with rigid labor market institutions lead to disproportionately greater increases in unemployment. These findings underline the important relationship between disruptions in the credit market and unemployment fluctuations.","[Tamas Borsi, Mihaly] Univ Ramon Llull, IQS Sch Management, Via Augusta 390, Barcelona 08017, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull; Institut Quimic de Sarria,"Borsi, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Ramon Llull, IQS Sch Management, Via Augusta 390, Barcelona 08017, Spain.",mihaly.borsi@iqs.edu,"Borsi, Mihaly/J-2050-2019","Borsi, Mihaly/0000-0001-7569-6207",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-36719]; Summer Visiting Researcher Program of the Central Bank of Hungary (2014); Research project in economics at the Bank of Spain (2015-2016),Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Summer Visiting Researcher Program of the Central Bank of Hungary (2014); Research project in economics at the Bank of Spain (2015-2016),"I would like to thank Maximo Camacho, Matteo Ciccarelli, Maria Dolores Guillo, Jean Imbs, Norbert Metiu, Fidel Perez Sebastian, Vincenzo Quadrini, Francesco Turino, seminar participants at the Bank of Spain, the Central Bank of Hungary, Paris School of Economics, Universidad de Alicante, AEA 2015, RES 2015, SAEe 2016, WFBS 2017, and an anonymous referee for helpful discussion and comments.

Drawing on specific examples of programs designed for skills development at the post-secondary level, this article explores practical ways to cultivate a broad skill set by immersing post-secondary education students into the workplace and by engaging them in private-sector research environments.","[Walker, Valerie] Business Higher Educ Roundtable, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Bowkett, Gail] Mitacs, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Duchaine, Isabelle] Business Higher Educ Roundtable, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Walker, V (通讯作者)，Business Higher Educ Roundtable, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,17,3,6,0,17,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The integration of developing economies into global capitalism and the continued advance of structural transformation would seem to indicate that there is no longer a classic agrarian question in the developing world. In other words, agriculture is no longer a major barrier to capitalist development in these countries. However, there is reason to doubt this growing consensus. This article argues for a rethinking of the agrarian question in the Global South and presents evidence that capitalist property relations have not penetrated agriculture throughout much of the developing world. Contrary to recent trends in the literature, I argue that not only is there still an agrarian question in the Global South but also that it remains central to explaining lower levels of industrialization in these countries and, thereby, their relative underdevelopment.","[Carlson, Chris] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Sociol Dept, 365 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Carlson, C (通讯作者)，CUNY, Grad Ctr, Sociol Dept, 365 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",ccarlson@gradcenter.cuny.edu,,,,,,,63,18,20,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Yet, our understanding of urbanization as a driver of changes in food consumption remains limited. Data from the Tanzania National Panel Survey, which tracked out-migrating respondents, allow us to compare individuals' dietary patterns before and after they relocated from rural to urban areas and assess whether those changes differ from household members who stayed behind or moved to a different rural area. Our study shows that moving to an urban area does not have any significant effect on the intake of fats, animal-source foods, and dietary diversity. However, individuals who moved to urban areas do experience a more pronounced shift away from the consumption of traditional staples, and towards high-sugar, more conveniently consumed and prepared foods. These effects occur across the whole spectrum of urban locations, ranging from smaller secondary towns to large cities. Further exploring the factors underlying these changes in dietary patterns upon moving, we demonstrate that - depending on the food category considered - a substantial part of the impact of relocating to an urban area is related to the transition out of farming, differences in food prices, and especially income changes. The latter appears to explain the more pronounced growth of unhealthy food consumption after rural-urban migration. As such, health concerns over diets can be expected to spread to less urbanized areas as soon as income growth takes off there. Our findings call for more in-depth research on the extent and consequences of changes in diets related to living in more urbanized areas that may contribute to improved projections on food demand and help to improve health and food and nutrition security policies as well as agricultural and trade strategies.

We show that at the national level, Burkina Faso has succeeded in increasing its output of cotton lint. At the local level, we see a differentiated outcome where the liberalization-initiated system of shared liability has improved overall cotton cooperative management but this has come at a significant cost: the exit of poorer farmers from the cotton sector and an increasing debt burden on those individual farmers who remain. The novelty of this article is that it considers producers' institutions as a key level of analysis linking macro-scale policy decisions to micro-scale village and farm outcomes. The resulting analysis allows us to focus on the politics of scale, particularly the power relations of different actors and the ability to capture resources at different levels, as well as the role of multilevel institutions in producing differentiated outcomes.","[Gray, Leslie C.] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Environm Studies & Sci, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Dowd-Uribe, Brian] Univ San Francisco, Int Studies Dept, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA",Santa Clara University; University of San Francisco,"Gray, LC (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Dept Environm Studies & Sci, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",lcgray@scu.edu,,,,,,,52,15,17,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Markets provide a suboptimal amount of investment in sectors characterized by learning spillovers. We show that a stable and competitive RER policy may correct for this externality and other related market failures. The resulting development of these sectors leads to overall faster economic growth. A system of effectively multiple exchange rates is required when spillovers across different tradable sectors differ. The impact of RER policies is increased when they are complemented by traditional industrial policies that increase the elasticity of the aggregate supply to the RER Among the instruments required to implement a stable and competitive RER are interventions in the foreign exchange market and regulation of capital flows. We also discuss the trade-offs associated with alternative stable and competitive RER policies and the relationship between the use of exchange rate policies for macro-stability and for development.

Relative to their business cycle counterparts, we show that financial cycles have a higher amplitude, a longer duration and exhibit far greater symmetry. Mostly owing to this difference in symmetry, we find that financial and business cycles synchronise on average only two-thirds of the time, exhibiting weaker concordance in countries having experienced very persistent financial downturns. We then relate our empirical results to the literature by reviewing five model mechanisms that could potentially underlie these facts. Overall, our results suggest that macroeconomic stabilization and financial stability objectives can, at times, be in conflict. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One of the striking features of the agricultural transition in Central Asia (and Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS] in general) is the dramatic shift, since 1992, from the predominance of large corporate farms to individual or family agriculture based on a spectrum of small farms. Evidence shows that individualization of agriculture is associated with the observed posttransition recovery in Central Asia (and in CIS in general) and that small family farms outperform the large enterprises. This clashes with the traditional philosophy of economies of scale and with the inherited view of small family farms as an undesirable aberration.

Directly after Election Day, we asked Canadians for which party they voted, and whether they regret their choice. We find that 39% of them are not perfectly happy with their decision, and 4% even say that they made a bad decision. We show that the propensity to regret can be explained by a mixed-utility theory, whereby voters attempt to maximize a mixture of instrumental and expressive utilities. Our study contributes to the literatures on voting behaviour and political economy, which usually considers that voters are either instrumental or expressive, but not both at the same time.","[Bol, Damien] KCL, Dept Polit Econ, 30 Aldwych Bush House, London WC2B 4BG, England; [Blais, Andre] Univ Montreal UdeM, Dept Sci Polit, CP 6128,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Laslier, Jean-Francois] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France",University of London; King's College London; Universite de Montreal; Paris School of Economics,"Bol, D (通讯作者)，KCL, Dept Polit Econ, 30 Aldwych Bush House, London WC2B 4BG, England.",damien.bol@kcl.ac.uk; andre.blais@umontreal.ca; jean-francois.laslier@ens.fr,"Laslier, Jean-Francois/K-1539-2019; Bol, Damien/I-3051-2016; Laslier, Jean-Francois/GSJ-2634-2022","Bol, Damien/0000-0002-1896-1294; Laslier, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-8334-1350",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The funding was provided by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Grant No. Making Electoral Democracy Work Project).

First, it seeks to establish a consistent theoretical framework for the relationship between Islamic finance and economic growth. Second, it attempts to assess empirically the effect that Islamic banking loans had on the economic growth of 13 countries in the MENA region during the 2000-2014 period. We found strong evidence to suggest that financial system development stimulated economic growth in the selected MENA countries over the studied period. Furthermore, we found that while Islamic financial development can boost economic growth, this positive effect is hindered by underdeveloped institutional frameworks. In addition, net-oil-exporting MENA countries do not appear to benefit from large oil-fueled deposits that are likely to increase the scale of loans. The findings suggest that governments should consider implementing proactive and favorable economic and institutional policies that are geared toward Islamic finance.

In this article, we measure cross-sector volatility spillovers, casting light on their intensity in the US-denominated investment grade bond universe. We find that volatility spillovers are high in the US credit market and that the insurance, goods and energy sectors have been net contributors to these shocks over the 1996-2017 period. A structural analysis of the spillover history based on a three-regime multivariate VAR Markov Switching model is then proposed. It highlights that with different volatility regimes come different volatility spillover structures: the insurance and goods sectors are volatility spillover sources during crisis periods. However, according to our estimates a large portion of spillovers are non-recurring and therefore difficult to anticipate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

I show that when a capital market is incomplete - in the sense that the rates of return from risky investments are idiosyncratic and there is no insurance for such idiosyncratic risk - the introduction of a consumption tax in the presence of a wage tax improves welfare. This holds true even in the presence of optimal or nonoptimal capital income taxes. In the general-equilibrium model, the optimal level of the consumption tax is determined to balance the benefits of the risk-sharing effect and the asset accumulation effect against the costs of postponing government revenue to later periods.","[Naito, Hisahiro] Univ Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan",University of Tsukuba,"Naito, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",naito@dpipe.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI Grant) [15K03501]; University of Tsukuba; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03501] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI Grant)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); University of Tsukuba; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author appreciates the comments of Professor Toshihiro Ihori of the University of Tokyo, Professor Daiji Kawaguchi of Hitotsubashi University, the seminar participants of the Canadian Public Economics meeting, the International Institute of Public Finance, and an anonymous referee.

It was established with an aspiration to focus more on applied and policy relevant research compared to other established journals, and to establish better channels of communication and collaboration between researchers from Europe and other parts of the world. We present a text based exploratory analysis of 1630 articles published in the Journal from 1991 to 2015 that suggests the Journal has been somewhat successful in meeting both these aims. Perhaps more importantly, it shows the Journal continues to progress toward these goals. The European authors are the largest contributors to the Journal, which is in contrast to other prominent journals (such as Journal of Environmental Economics and Management and Ecological Economics). And while most of the collaboration has occurred within this geographic region (e.g., European authors collaborated with other European authors more frequently), this trend appears to be changing as the proportion of articles written by international collaborators is gradually increasing. Topic analysis reveals that almost all of the articles could be grouped under applied and/or policy relevant topics, and almost two-thirds of the articles are empirical in nature, which suggest that the journal has been able to fulfil both of its commitments. We also investigate trends in research foci over the last 25 years and what kind of research gaps can be discerned.","[Polyakov, Maksym; Chalak, Morteza; Iftekhar, Md.

We examine the extent to which the asymmetric information and agency costs theories explain dividend smoothing and whether their proxies' impact varies given the firm's reputation as a high- or low-smoothing firm. Our quantile regression results confirm that the determinants vary significantly across smoothing quantiles. In the low-smoothing quantiles, capturing firms with a lower tendency towards smoothing and hence facing lesser or no reputational concerns, the degree of dividend smoothing increases significantly with size, age, and tangibility, whereas it declines with ownership concentration and risk. Interestingly, most of these factors turn insignificant for firms in the high-smoothing quantiles, facing higher reputational stakes. Emphasizing the predominance of reputational effects on the determination of dividend smoothing, these findings help explain the dividend smoothing puzzle: why firms with lesser or no need for dividend smoothing still smooth high.

This finding is robust to whether the expectations series used relates to individual consumers or professional forecasters.

Furthermore, bonds sponsored by more experienced PE groups (PEGs) underperform bonds associated with less experienced PE groups, while bonds backed by investment bank-affiliated PEGs underperform bonds sponsored by other PEGs. These findings highlight the risk and return relationship in the high-yield bond market related to leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and PEGs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We show that, even when bid costs approach zero, bidding occurs in repeated jumps, consistent with certain types of natural auctions such as takeover contests. In contrast with most past models of bids as valuation signals, every bidder has the opportunity to signal and increase the bid by a jump. Jumps communicate bidders' information rapidly, leading to contests that are completed in a few bids. The model additionally predicts; informative delays in the start of bidding; that the probability of a second bid decreases in, and the jump increases in, the first bid; that objects are sold to the highest valuation bidder; and that revenue and efficiency relationships between different auctions hold asymptotically.","[Daniel, Kent D.] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Daniel, Kent D.; Hirshleifer, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hirshleifer, David] UC Irvine, Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Daniel, KD (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Daniel, KD (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Hirshleifer, David/E-4342-2012","Hirshleifer, David/0000-0003-0280-8882",,,,,39,13,13,2,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

New Zealand (NZ) committed to reduce emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The purpose of this paper is to assess the range of economic costs for NZ derived from the commitment under the PA, conditional to the mitigation potential of forestry carbon sequestration (FCS), pricing agricultural emissions, and linking the NZ emissions tradable scheme (NZ ETS) to the European Union ETS (EU ETS). We use a general equilibrium model and soft-link it with the global timber model. We found that NZ can meet the PA terms; however, important GDP decreases may arise due to limited domestic mitigation potential from the energy and transport sectors. FCS plays a significant role in mitigating the negative impacts, where the benefits of FCS outweigh those of pricing agricultural emission and linking the NZ ETS.","[Fernandez, Mario A.] Auckland Council, Res & Monitoring Unit, Auckland 1050, New Zealand; [Daigneault, Adam J.] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Fernandez, MA (通讯作者)，Auckland Council, Res & Monitoring Unit, Auckland 1050, New Zealand.",mario.fernandez@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz; adam.daigneault@maine.edu,"Daigneault, Adam/GYU-9342-2022","Daigneault, Adam/0000-0002-8287-8727; Fernandez, Mario/0000-0002-1390-2375",Landcare Research New Zealand,Landcare Research New Zealand,Research funded by Landcare Research New Zealand.

Other than the hedge fund return (Y) we introduce an explanatory variable: a market portfolio of hedge fund returns (X). By connecting X and Y, some critical parameters are found to be effectively related to testing the two types of return smoothing. Using those parameters, we develop distinct desmoothing algorithms against intentional and inadvertent smoothing. Our empirical results show that although intentional smoothing is partly responsible for hedge fund smoothing and is done more consistently than inadvertent smoothing, return smoothing is mainly caused by the nature of underlying assets.

This article reports tests of reflection over money and health outcomes defined by life years gained from treatment. With open valuation exercises, the results suggest qualified support for the reflection effect over money outcomes and strong support over health outcomes.

Populist politicians provide voters with a utility boom followed by a subsequent bust. Non-populists provide a constant level of utility. Once elected, however, politicians of both types are able to seize control of institutions to ensure their re-election. We show that in equilibrium, populist politicians may capture institutions to avoid being voted out of power during the bust: non-populists do not. Voters rationally elect a populist if voters discount the future sufficiently or if it is too costly for the populist to seize control of institutions. Unfortunately, both types of politician may prefer not to strengthen institutions, either to allow their capture or to discourage the election of the populist.","[Chesterley, Nicholas] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Apartment 2,290 Gloucester St, Ottawa, ON K1R 5E4, Canada; [Roberti, Paolo] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Roberti, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",paolo.roberti3@unibo.it,,"Roberti, Paolo/0000-0002-2577-0154",,,,,43,20,22,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Bicycling to school is a way to increase physical activity and reduce the prevalence of these conditions. In locations such as Christchurch, New Zealand, where adolescent girls cycle to school far less than boys, there is potential for a lack of gender equity in health. Focus groups were held with adolescent girls at three Christchurch high schools in 2012 and 2013. Separate focus groups were held for year 9/10 (13-14 years-old) and year 13 (16-17 years-old) girls. Girls' decisions to cycle to school were found to be affected by injunctive and descriptive cycling norms in relation to both friends and parents, in addition to concerns about image, being social, being feminine and shunning physical activity, gender attribution, cycling confidence and personal security concerns. To achieve gender equity in health and improve the health and the opportunities available to girls to independently engage in social, educational, vocational and sporting activities, it is necessary to take into account the intrapersonal factors that affect girls' decisions to cycle to school.","[Frater, Jillian; Kingham, Simon] Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Frater, J (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",jillian.frater@lincoln.ac.nz,,"Kingham, Simon/0000-0002-2869-3756",,,,,99,20,22,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We also derive the asymptotic distribution for EPM and for the difference of two EPMs when the samples are independent. We conduct simulations to show the proposed theory performs well for one and two independent samples. The simulations show that the proposed approach is robust in the dependent case.

Using and combining different transport modes flexibly on a single trip is discussed as being crucial to a more efficient and sustainable urban transport system. However, research on intermodality has mainly addressed long-distance traffic or specific combinations. This study analyzes how intermodality is practiced in everyday mobility by looking at relevant mode combinations, trip purposes, spatial differentiation and the requirements of intermodal users. The article presents results on intermodal travel behavior from a survey conducted in different neighborhoods in Berlin in 2016 (n = 1098). The results show that many people use intermodal combinations in their everyday mobility. Intermodal travel behavior is significantly characterized by public transport modes and trips to work. Spatial differences in intermodal use become obvious with combinations of bike and public transport being strong in urban neighborhoods, car and public transport in decentralized neighborhoods and combinations of different means of public transport in well-connected neighborhoods. In addition, the study emphasizes that time efficiency is an important aspect for intermodal users, becoming apparent in the reasons they state for performing intermodal trips and their evaluation of interchanges. Intermodal travel behavior and users' needs must therefore be taken into account in urban planning if the aim is to make the most of intermodal combinations for an effective urban transport system.","[Oostendorp, Rebekka; Gebhardt, Laura] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Transport Res, Rutherfordstr 2, D-12489 Berlin, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Oostendorp, R (通讯作者)，German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Transport Res, Rutherfordstr 2, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",Rebekka.Oostendorp@dlr.de; Laura.Gebhardt@dlr.de,,"Oostendorp, Rebekka/0000-0002-3675-3931",German Aerospace Center (DLR),German Aerospace Center (DLR)(Helmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR)),"We would like to express our thanks to three anonymous reviewers as well as to our colleagues Julia Jarass and Daniel Krajzewicz for valuable comments on the manuscript.

Our main finding is that a media effect mainly manifests itself after the mid-1840s and that the introduction of arm's-length ownership along with markedly increased market participation was the main reason for the emergence of this media effect.","[Turner, John D.; Walker, Clive B.] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Ye, Qing] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Queens University Belfast; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Turner, JD (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",,,,ESRC [RES-000-22-1391]; ESRC [RES-000-22-1391] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Thanks to the ESRC (RES-000-22-1391) for financial support.

The research is conducted by combining a quantile regression approach with a wavelet decomposition analysis. Although we find little or insignificant dependence under short investment horizons, we detect the strong asymmetric dependence of oil prices and the US dollar index on the six Chinese stock markets in the medium and long terms. Moreover, not only is crude oil not a safe haven, it may damage Chinese stock markets as it increases over the long term, even in bull markets. Meanwhile, appreciation of the US dollar (depreciation of RMB) damages (boosts) Chinese stock markets during bull (bear) market conditions under long investment horizons. Moreover, we find that VIX (volatility index)-related derivatives may serve as good risk management tools under any market condition, while gold is a safe haven asset only during crisis periods.","[Yang, Lu] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Tian, Shuairu] Shanghai Business Sch, Res Ctr Finance, 2271 West Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200235, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wei] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, 130 Meilong Rd, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Xu, Mingli] South China Normal Univ, Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Sch Publ Adm, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hamori, Shigeyuki] Kobe Univ, Fac Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Shanghai Business School; East China University of Science & Technology; South China Normal University; Kobe University,"Hamori, S (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Fac Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",kudeyang@zuel.edu.cn; tiansr@sbs.edu.cn; yang_wei@hust.edu.cn; minglixu@m.scnu.edu.cn; hamori@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Tian, Shuairu/J-9783-2019; Hamori, Shigeyuki/J-4877-2019; Yang, Lu/AAR-3577-2020","Tian, Shuairu/0000-0001-8387-5600; Hamori, Shigeyuki/0000-0003-1498-0188; Yang, Lu/0000-0003-3112-1115; Yang, Wei/0000-0002-4827-5914; Xu, Mingli/0000-0002-5526-4324",Project of National Natural Science Funds for Young Scholars [71601185/71403294]; Ministry of Education of China in Philosophy and Social Sciences [16JZD016]; JSPS KAKENHI Grant [17H00983]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H00983] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Project of National Natural Science Funds for Young Scholars; Ministry of Education of China in Philosophy and Social Sciences; JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to an anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions.

We find that institutional ownership is positively related to managerial efficiency. Our identification relies on a discontinuity in ownership around the Russell 1000/2000 Index threshold and suggests that the positive effect of institutional ownership on managerial efficiency is causal. Furthermore, we document that monitoring by institutions helps improve managerial efficiency, and that an exogenous increase in institutional ownership leads to higher pay-for-performance sensitivity. Finally, we find consistent results after excluding from our sample forced CEO turnovers, suggesting that institutional shareholders force incumbent managers to exert greater effort rather than influence the replacement of less efficient CEOs. Taken together, our findings highlight the important role played by institutional shareholders in getting the most out of corporate executives. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Regression analysis indicates that, all else equal, average income-tax rates tend to be overstated to a greater extent by (1) those who believe taxes on households like theirs should be lower, (2) those who get tax-preparation assistance, and (3) those who believe tax dollars are spent ineffectively.","[Ballard, Charles L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Social Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Gupta, Sanjay] Michigan State Univ, Eli Broad Coll Business, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Ballard, CL (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Social Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",ballard@msu.edu; sgupta@msu.edu,,,,,,,35,13,15,1,7,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Paradoxically, these three building blocks of a competence-legitimacy, power, and resources-both promote inertia and enable change. Inertia can be overcome when firms employ three levers of transition: organizationally separating an emerging technology to protect it, co-opting legitimacy by using the new technology to serve the incumbent technology, and diverting resources for the emerging technology's development. Over time, the emerging technology achieves enough legitimacy, power, and resources in the firm to overtake, and ultimately displace, the incumbent competence. We develop an integrative model of technology transition that contributes to literature on resources, dynamic capabilities, competence-destroying change, and ambidexterity.","[Danneels, Erwin] Univ S Florida, Muma Coll Business, 4202 East Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Verona, Gianmario] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Provera, Bernardino] Assicurazioni Gen SpA, Trieste, Friuli Venezia, Italy",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Bocconi University,"Danneels, E (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Muma Coll Business, 4202 East Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",edanneels@usf.edu; gianmario.verona@bocconi.it; bernardino.provera@gmail.com,"Verona, Gianmario/AIF-4104-2022","VERONA, GIANMARIO/0000-0002-9992-2544",,,,,94,26,28,8,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

First, we provide empirical evidence suggesting that, in the period of U.S. passive monetary policy, a positive government spending shock was followed over time by a spending cut. Second, our theoretical analysis reveals that the pegged nominal interest rate is not a sufficient condition to generate a large fiscal multiplier. An increase in government spending could increase the long-run real interest rate, if it is associated with a government spending reversal and a less responsive monetary policy. Consequently, the response of private consumption can be negative and the government spending multiplier is not necessarily greater than 1.","[Li, Rong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tian, Xiaohui] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China,"Li, R (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lirong.sf@ruc.edu.cn; tianxiaohui@ruc.edu.cn,,"Li, Rong/0000-0002-5174-2691","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503256, 71603268]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This paper is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 71503256 and 71603268.

Second, although occasionally analysts make forecasts with small errors, the decomposition of such errors provide, on average, larger (positive) accounting errors, and larger (negative) other information errors.

Unclear and conflicting tenure has been the main challenge faced by the proponents of subnational REDD+ initiatives, and accordingly, they have expended much effort to remedy the problem. This article assesses how well REDD+ has performed in laying an appropriate tenure foundation. Field research was carried out in two phases (2010-2012 and 2013-2014) in five countries (Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia) at 21 subnational initiatives, 141 villages (half targeted for REDD+ interventions), and 3,754 households. Three questions are posed: 1) What was the effect of REDD+ on perceived tenure insecurity of village residents?; 2) What are the main reasons for change in the level of tenure insecurity and security from Phase 1 to Phase 2 perceived by village residents in control and intervention villages?; and 3) How do intervention village residents evaluate the impact of tenure-related interventions on community well-being? Among the notable findings are that: 1) tenure insecurity decreases slightly across the whole sample of villages, but we only find that REDD+ significantly reduces tenure insecurity in Cameroon, while actually increasing insecurity of smallholder agricultural land tenure in Brazil at the household level; 2) among the main reported reasons for increasing tenure insecurity (where it occurs) are problems with outside companies, lack of title, and competition from neighboring villagers; and 3) views on the effect of REDD+ tenure-related interventions on community well-being lean towards the positive, including for interventions that restrain access to forest. Thus, while there is little evidence that REDD+ interventions have worsened smallholder tenure insecurity (as feared by critics), there is also little evidence that the proponents' efforts to address tenure insecurity have produced results. Work on tenure remains an urgent priority for safeguarding local livelihoods as well as for reducing deforestation. This will require increased attention to participatory engagement, improved reward systems, tenure policy reform, integration of national and local efforts, and business-as-usual interests.

One critical feature of these mechanisms is their cumulative nature: once set in motion, they feed themselves. The various costs associated with city size put a brake on such mechanisms. In many countries, the unevenness of the distribution of skilled labor across cities is both the cause and the consequence of particular agglomeration economies. Human capital is beneficial to the cities, which attract skills and talents.

A disaggregated analysis reveals that the reaction of economic growth to the occurrence of hurricanes depends strongly on the level of development of the afflicted countries with developing countries being most negatively affected. We also consider through which channels tropical storms affect long-run growth and find the investment share as well as fertility to react systematically to tropical storms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

For a developing economy with state-owned firms in the urban sector, a merger via a reduction in the number of the urban state-owned firms can reduce the cost of capital. It then lowers the skilled wage rate through the factor-substitution effect, while it raises the unskilled wage by the inflow of capital to the rural sector and hence lowers urban unemployment. In addition, the reduction in the number of the urban state-owned firms can yield a scale effect to the firms. The beneficial effects on higher urban output and less urban unemployment can improve social welfare of the developing economy.","[Chao, Chi-Chur; Ee, Mong Shan] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Wang, Leonard F.

Inadequate transport infrastructure in rural areas and large distances between areas of production and consumption mean that farmers find it costly to bring their produce to the market and this very often results in small net margins and poverty among farmers who are geographically isolated. Agriculture in developing countries is characterized by the presence of intermediaries that have a cost advantage over farmers. Because of their market power, these intermediaries are able to impose interlinked contracts and are free to choose the spatial pricing policy they use. In this paper, we develop a model of input-output interlinked contracts between an intermediary and geographically dispersed farmers. We establish when the intermediary uses either uniform or mill pricing policies, as opposed to spatial discriminatory pricing. For each pricing policy, we analyze what the welfare implications are in terms of an increase in farmers' income and a reduction in poverty in rural areas. We also establish how the choice of a spatial pricing policy impacts geographically isolated farmers and how it influences the participation by farmers.","[Lefevre, Melanie; Tharakan, Joe] Univ Liege, HEC Management Sch, Liege, Belgium; [Tharakan, Joe] Univ Leuven, CORE, Leuven, Belgium",University of Liege; KU Leuven,"Tharakan, J (通讯作者)，Pl Orateurs 3, B-4000 Liege 1, Belgium.",j.tharakan@ulg.ac.be,,"Lefevre, Melanie/0000-0002-5195-0896",,,,,37,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to determine which trajectories changed where, and to what scale of human consequence. We perform three empirical assessments: a count of countries that accelerated their rate of progress post-2000; statistical t-tests for differences in mean country rates of progress; and a determination of the incremental lives saved or improved (or not) due to accelerated progress above pre-MDG trends. We find that low-income countries and sub-Saharan African countries had positive acceleration on a majority of indicators and accounted for much of the world's post-2000 accelerations. Middle-income countries typically registered larger cumulative gains but less acceleration over the period. The greatest advances were in matters of life and death. At least 20.9 million and as many as 30.3 million additional lives were saved due to accelerated rates of progress, with sub-Saharan Africa accounting for approximately two-thirds of the total. Primary school completion also showed considerable overall acceleration, leading to at least 74 million more children having finished primary school. Other measures of basic needs-including undernourishment, access to water and access to sanitation - showed mixed patterns of acceleration. Headcount rates of extreme income poverty declined at an accelerated rate in most regions. Environmental indicators showed no systematic evidence of faster progress. (C) 2018 The Authors.

In oil palm and land grab literature, much attention is paid to potential contributions of free, prior, and informed consent procedures. However, this article demonstrates how atomizing practices obstruct such procedures. Some practices stand out: During a preparatory phase of plantation development, companies remain in the background and leave actual land acquisition to local authorities and villagers, thus obscuring their agenda for plantation development. Second, rather than negotiating land transfer in public meetings, companies use a combination of promises, bribes, and threats to gain support or to enforce acceptance. Third, companies gain support by wedging themselves into communities, exacerbating disparities within communities. Analysis of this atomized process of plantation development is crucial for a critical understanding of oil palm conflicts.","[de Vos, Rosanne; Kohne, Michiel; Roth, Dik] Wageningen Univ & Res, Sociol Dev & Change, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"de Vos, R (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, Sociol Dev & Change, Wageningen, Netherlands.",rosa.devos@wur.nl,"de Vos, Rosa/AAE-3171-2022","de Vos, Rosa/0000-0001-5691-1434; Roth, Dik/0000-0002-3703-5245",Wageningen School of Social Science (WASS),Wageningen School of Social Science (WASS),Wageningen School of Social Science (WASS),,50,13,15,3,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Stock options can induce risk-taking incentives, while CDS can be used to hedge against credit risk. Building on the existing literature on executive compensation and risk management, our study contributes novel empirical support for the role of stock options in restraining the use of CDS for hedging purposes. Based on data of CEO stock options and CDS held by 60 European banks during the period 2006-2011, we find a negative relationship between option-induced risk-taking incentives (vega) and the proportion of CDS held for hedging. However, the extent of CDS held for hedging is found to be positively related to default risk in the period leading to the financial crisis that erupted in 2007.

Specifically, on a bivariate basis, we use dependence dynamics through copulas with regime switching of Silva Filho et al. (2012) using intraday data returns to identify contagion among stock markets. The empirical results add significant evidence to the literature on the financial contagion from the Brexit to other countries for a very large sample thus far. Evidence shows that the methodology identified immediate financial contagion produced from the referendum results. However, the contagion was not sufficiently significant given the short duration. In general, results showed instant financial contagion due to the shock and increased uncertainty from the referendum results; however, the shock and uncertainty were very limited, because a few days after the polling day, most stock exchange markets had fully recovered their losses. The approach provides significant information not only to policymakers but also to investors about the stock market's reaction to the expected Brexit. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we translate the Foster-Hart measure from static and abstract gambles to dynamic and applied finance using nonparametric estimation of risk-neutral densities from S&P 500 call and put option prices covering 2003-2013. The dynamics of the resulting 'option-implied Foster-Hart bound' are assessed in light of other well-known option-implied risk measures including value at risk, expected shortfall and risk-neutral volatility, as well as high moments of the densities and several industry measures. Rigorous variable selection reveals that the new measure is a significant predictor of (large) ahead-return downturns. Furthermore, it grasps more characteristics of the risk-neutral probability distributions in terms of moments than other measures and exhibits predictive consistency. The robustness of the risk-neutral density estimation is analyzed via Monte Carlo methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Banks most affected by the policy increase loan supply and lower interest rates on new mortgage originations. These lower-interest-rate loans serve as collateral for newly issued RMBS with lower-rated tranches and subsequently experience worse repayment performance.

However, the long-term effects of openness have yet to be demonstrated, even if few researchers hypothesized that high openness could increase firms' dynamic capabilities and hence their resilience in the face of adversities, such economic downturns. Hence, this article attempts to investigate this dynamic relationship between openness and firm performance with particular considerations addressing the recent financial crisis in 2008. Based upon the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) panel data collected between 2006 and 2012, this study finds evidence that supports the positive influence of openness on long-term firm performance. The results show that (i) increasing a firm's openness is an effective way of enhancing its dynamic capability and hence its resilience, and (ii) of all the various configurations of openness, the collaboration with partners outside the firm's value chain and international partners has the highest impact on turnover recovery, as they will increase the chances of acquiring newer knowledge, which in turn will help firms to identify new opportunities to achieve sustainable growth.

The Johns Hopkins University Press for Resources for the Future, Baltimore, 1982), there is a theoretical consensus about the occurrence of limit cycles (through a Hopf bifurcation) under a positive effect of pollution on consumption demand (compensation effect) and about the impossibility under a negative effect (distaste effect). However, recent empirical evidence advocates for the relevance of distaste effects. Our paper challenges the conventional view on the theoretical ground and reconciles theory and evidence. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) (pollution first increases in the capital level then decreases) plays the main role. Indeed, the standard case A la Heal (limit cycles only under a compensation effect) only works along the upward-sloping branch of the curve while the opposite (limit cycles only under a distaste effect) holds along the downward-sloping branch. Welfare effects of taxation also change according to the slope of the EKC.","[Bosi, Stefano] Univ Evry, EPEE, Evry, France; [Desmarchelier, David] Univ Lorraine, UMR CNRS 7522, BETA, Nancy, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite de Lorraine,"Desmarchelier, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, UMR CNRS 7522, BETA, Nancy, France.",sbosi@univ-evry.fr; david.desmarchelier@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,11,11,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Furthermore, we find that media coverage on CSR engagements with local impact on companies' communities and employees, rather than those with broader social impact on the general public, is the main driver in explaining higher shareholder value and operating performance. We also implement a two-stage least-squares regression (2SLS) and propensity score matching to establish a causal link between publicized local CSR activities and shareholder value. Our evidence is consistent with the notion that shareholders put positive value on locally-oriented CSR when it is also complemented with high level of stakeholder awareness. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Male-Female Wage Gaps Among Salaried Workers in India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,gender; wage differentials; gender discrimination; India,GENDER PAY GAP; QUANTILE REGRESSION; STICKY-FLOOR; DIFFERENTIALS; CASTE; DECOMPOSITION; EDUCATION; EARNINGS,"We use nationally representative data from the Employment-Unemployment Surveys in 1999-2000 and 2009-10 to explore gender wage gaps among Regular Wage/Salaried (RWS) workers in India, both at the mean, as well as along the entire wage distribution to see what happens where. The gender log wage gap at the mean is 55% in 1999-2000 and 49% in 2009-10, but this change is not statistically significant. The Blinder-Oaxaca and the Machado-Mata-Melly decompositions indicate that, in both years, the bulk of the gender wage gap is unexplained, i.e., possibly discriminatory. They also reveal that over the decade, while the wage-earning characteristics of women improved relative to men, the discriminatory component of the gender wage gap also increased. In fact, in 2009-10, if women were paid like men, they would have earned more than men on account of their characteristics. In both years, we see the existence of the sticky floor, in that gender wage gaps are higher among low-wage earners and lower for high wage earners. Over the ten-year period, we find that the sticky floor became stickier for RWS women. Machado-Mata-Melly decompositions reveal that, in both years, women at the lower end of the wage distribution face higher discriminatory gaps compared to women at the upper end.

Our estimates imply a 100 basis-point shock to the Federal Funds rate would increase overall deposit funding costs by about $40 billion, which is roughly equal to 25% of aggregate annual net income for commercial banks and savings institutions.

Firms are more likely to refinance early when credit conditions are good to keep the effective maturity of their loans long and hedge against having to refinance in tight credit conditions. High credit quality firms are better able to hedge, making their refinancing propensity more sensitive to credit cycles than less creditworthy firms. There is a strong relationship between refinancing a loan, and subsequent growth in capital expenditure, especially when a loan is refinanced early. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

First, the theoretical background of food quality and safety, product origin, and food origin labels is discussed. The next section is devoted to the methodology of research followed by a discussion of research results. Data were collected via the online survey with 530 respondents of Generation Y. Chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to determine whether consumer attitudes differ based on their country. A statistically significant difference between the attention given to food products origin in the purchase decision and the respondents' country was confirmed, the product origin is the most important for Poles. In comparison with Czechs and Slovaks, Poles have also a stronger preference for domestic food products, believing them to be of a higher quality than the foreign ones. In each respective country, the awareness of food origin labels is low and their benefits are not sufficiently perceived. Statistically significant relations exist between the attitudes of Czechs and Poles as well as Slovaks and Poles, whereas there are no differences between the attitudes of Czechs and Slovaks.","[Velcovska, Sarka] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Velcovská, S (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",sarka.velcovska@vsb.cz,"Velčovská, Šárka/G-3734-2018","Velčovská, Šárka/0000-0002-0096-2758",European Social Fund [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296]; Intergenerational Comparison of Consumer Behaviour in the International Context [SP2016/106],European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Intergenerational Comparison of Consumer Behaviour in the International Context,"The paper is supported by the European Social Fund within the project CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296 and by the project An Intergenerational Comparison of Consumer Behaviour in the International Context, project registration number SP2016/106.",,36,9,9,1,11,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2018,20.0,47,,,,,46,61,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ8BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427829800004,0

This study uses a large and diverse data set from an investment experiment that is rich in context and captures some important features of actual financial decision making. The focus of the article is to build on the literature documenting behavioral explanations for investment choices by studying the equity allocation decision across different financial tools. The authors find evidence that risk aversion, inertia, and excessive extrapolation are associated with investment behavior even when it is clear that return rates are independent across decision-making periods. Further, subjects have an asymmetric response to positive versus negative returns. In addition to having a novel experimental design, the authors also examine behavior before and after the recent financial crisis. The authors find that the financial crisis indirectly affects the first-stage annuity take-up rate in the experiments vis-a-vis a higher average level of risk aversion after the start of the crisis.","[Anderson, Lisa R.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Freeborn, Beth A.; Hulbert, Jason P.] Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC USA",William & Mary,"Anderson, LR (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",lisa.anderson@wm.edu,,"Anderson, Lisa/0000-0002-8748-222X",,,,,29,5,5,4,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

This research employs a content analysis and scoring methodology in order to evaluate all the integrated reports available in the Integrated Reporting Examples Database for 2017. The results reveal that the companies are in different stages regarding the conformity with the IIRC requirements. Moreover, the mandatory integrated reports show better compliance with the IIRC Framework's suggestions, although the difference between the two types of integrated reports is not significant.

Subsequently, we analyse the influence of utilitarian exploiting of extremely low or even negative interest rates, supported by extreme money printing, on the operation of economic subjects, first and foremost on individual kinds of financial institutions. And subsequently, in contrast with theoretical economic principles, impacts of this monetary policy, combined with deficit fiscal policies of governments to operation of real economy are analyzed; before all with focus on the most imporiant national or multinational economic units of the world.

Evidence indicates that female land ownership promotes women's wealth and decision-making authority, which could be the pathways through which their fertility is influenced.

The data while the election was obtained from the official website of the Election Committee https://www.kpu.go.id/ and the official website of each region. This study uses binary logistic regression and uses purposive sampling. Before the regression test, it is examined by using the classical assumption tests. The results showed the contents of accounting information contained in the accountability report. The regional income and expenditure budgeting influences the electability of incumbent re-election, among others, the ratio of regional income to total income, capital expenditure ratio and poverty level positively influences the re-election of incumbents, while the tax revenue ratio the total income, the ratio of total expenditure to total income, the ratio of expenditure on goods and services to total income, and the unemployment rate does not affect the electability of re-election of incumbents. An understanding of information accounting content expressed by the local government voters can make the basis for assessing whether the incumbent regional head is worthy of the opportunity to reign or not. The results of the study provide input to the local government to determine the regulations and policies that will come regarding the accountability of financial statements so that there is no misuse of authority resulting in corruption, collusion, and nepotism.","[Darmawati; Pagalung, Gagaring; Mediaty; Damayanti, Ratna Ayu] Univ Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia",Universitas Hasanuddin,"Darmawati (通讯作者)，Univ Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia.",,"Darmawati, Darmawati/AAB-7762-2021; Damayanti, Ratna Ayu/ABA-5395-2020; Damayanti, Ratna Ayu/S-1686-2016","Darmawati, Darmawati/0000-0003-0536-3225; Damayanti, Ratna Ayu/0000-0002-2867-6315;",Ministry of Research and Technology of the Ministry of Research and Technology,Ministry of Research and Technology of the Ministry of Research and Technology(Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEK)),The author would like to thank the Ministry of Research and Technology of the Ministry of Research and Technology for providing research Dissertation grants for the Doctor and the Research and Community Service Institute (LP2M) of Hasanuddin University.,,39,0,0,2,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-786-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,92.0,,,,,,575,585,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP5ZL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000558679400060,0

Based on data for the period from 2011 to 2015, we perform an analysis in two steps. In the first step, we measure the systemic risk in Brazil based on Delta CoVaR framework. In the second step, we present empirical evidence from a panel data analysis regarding the determinants (banking and macroeconomic variables) of the systemic risk. The findings denote that the systemic risk measured using the Delta CoVaR methodology is consistent with the main events contained in the Financial Stability Reports issued by the Central Bank of Brazil. Furthermore, the empirical evidence highlights the importance of bank liquidity, profitability, leverage, and interest rate in determining systemic risk. One implication of this analysis is that prudential regulation policy must be coordinated with monetary policy in order to mitigate the systemic risk.","[de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira; da Silva, Rafael Bernardo] Fluminense Fed Univ, Dept Econ, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira] Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense,"de Mendonça, HF (通讯作者)，Rua Dr Sodre 59, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",helderfm@hotmail.com; r_afael2007@hotmail.com,"de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira/A-7415-2009","de Mendonca, Helder Ferreira/0000-0003-1465-1755",,,,,50,29,33,1,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

Of much importance is the understanding of the goals and the prospects of innovative educational processes. Our major finding is that they stem from global economy's challenges emerging in the conditions of postindustrial society both at global and local levels. Consequently, education, as a unique resource for the development of society, is a subject for transformation of its structure and content. Another important finding is the critical role of innovative education as the major shaper of the relations that will determine the future of our civilization.

We document a marginalized status of young workers aged 16-24, whose risk of job loss followed by unemployment is two to three times higher than that of prime-age workers (35-49). Further more, unemployed workers aged 50-61 face relatively the lowest probability of finding a job, at rates 30-50% lower than prime-age unemployed workers. These results are qualitatively in line with those established for the reference economy of the UK. Finally, we find that fluctuations in age-specific unemployment rates in all three countries are mainly driven by variations in outflow rates from unemployment rather than by variations in inflow rates into unemployment. In contrast, in the UK, the fluctuations in all age-specific unemployment rates, are decisively affected by variations in inflow rates into unemployment.","[Flek, Vladislav; Hala, Martin; Mysikova, Martina] SKODA AUTO Vysoka Skola, Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic",Skoda Auto,"Flek, V (通讯作者)，SKODA AUTO Vysoka Skola, Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic.",vladislay.flekl@says.cz; martin.hala@says.cz; martina.mysikova@says.cz,"Hala, Martin/E-7119-2018; Mysíková, Martina/B-9175-2014","Mysíková, Martina/0000-0002-6340-4753; Vladislav, Flek/0000-0002-3132-3983",,,,,25,7,7,1,19,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The information on the days and on the number of phone calls needed by the interviewers to conduct the mystery calls make it possible to construct new measures of bureaucratic start-up costs and study their determinants. We find that lower bureaucratic costs are mainly associated with factors related to organization features of the OSS, such as a more intensive use of ICT and expertise of the employees.

Meanwhile, on the margins, agro-ecologically oriented tours bring admiring US students, farmers and agrarian advocates. Cubans concur that the country must solve key problems in its agricultural sector to overcome the contradictions of its agri-food model, and that this entails more exchange with the US - but in what capacity and on what terms? The current crossroads begs the classic agrarian question, even as it updates it. Having experienced and survived the promises and disasters of both capitalist and communist agricultural economies, Cuban farmers expand the original peasant' protagonist. As they navigate new non-state markets and recent re-entrenchment of state control of prices, Cuban farmers and cooperatives struggle to avoid monopolizing tendencies of unfettered capitalist as well as communist agricultural economies - both of which have historically been ecologically damaging. US agribusiness courts Cuba, but not as mere unidirectional capture: Cubans are inviting and leveraging trade to end the embargo, which is increasingly being modified altogether. Key Cuban agrarian principles of resilience and cooperativismo have persisted through capitalist and communist crises: could they influence prospects for agro-industrial hegemony from the North?","[Graddy-Lovelace, Garrett] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Graddy-Lovelace, G (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",graddy@american.edu,,,,,,,118,4,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Using both unique trading constraints in the Chinese stock market and other commonly-used limits-of-arbitrage measures, we construct a comprehensive limits-of-arbitrage index. Based on this index, we find that the negative idiosyncratic volatility return premium is much stronger and more persistent in stocks with high limits of arbitrage. Furthermore, the existing explanations about the idiosyncratic volatility return premium cannot fully explain what we find about the role of limits of arbitrage in the pricing of idiosyncratic volatility in the Chinese stock market. Our study suggests that the trading constraints introduced in the name of protecting individual investors can actually hurt them, since these additional limits of arbitrage will increase the inefficiency of the security market.

Processes of class differentiation within peasant organizations in both countries have led to the interests of certain classes predominating over or at the expense of others. Despite La Via Campesina's projection of unity in diversity', incorporating sometimes conflicting class interests into the movement is particularly challenging.

The analysis is based on the data panel of 31 European countries covering the period of 1995 to 2016. Upon these data the random effects panel regression model is built and estimated. The estimated equations provide support for the hypotheses that the countries with larger land area, population size and level of economic development tend to decentralize more government expenditure, whereas the higher urbanization supports more centralization. The heterogeneity of preferences measured by ethnical, language and religion fractionalization proved to be the significant factor of expenditure decentralization. From the institutional determinants, the voice and accountability, the government efficiency and the political stability were the most significant determinants of expenditure decentralization. Finally, the federated countries and countries with socialist or German legal origin are more decentralized, while the English legal origin countries are more centralized.","[Jilek, Milan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Jílek, M (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",jilek@jcu.cz,"Jilek, Milan/M-7618-2013","Jilek, Milan/0000-0002-8422-3927",Ministry of Education of Czech Republic,"Ministry of Education of Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","The article is processed, thanks to the Ministry of Education of Czech Republic, as an output of the institutionally funded research at the University of South Bohemia, Faculty of Economics, Dept. of Accounting and Finance.",,34,3,3,0,2,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2283-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,58,66,,,,,,9,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL8FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456200200008,0

Yet the leading behavioral economists exhibit far more interest in applying those biases to market decisions than to political decision-, and see irrational decisions making as another example of market failure which justifies correction by some form of government action. We treat this as a justification for comparing the distortions of cognitive biases on market decisions with the distortions of those biases on political decisions. We also make a distinction between the rationality of individual decisions and the collective rationality of those decisions, and question Thaler's argument that people fail to learn much from the mistakes they make in markets. We conclude that behavioral economists would do more to increase economic rationality by making the case for eliminating government policies that are clearly economically irrational and destructive. Eliminating such policies would not necessarily increase the individual rationality of political or market decisions, but it would increase the collective rationality of both.","[Lee, Dwight R.] Southern Methodist Univ, Cox Sch Business, ONeil Ctr Global Markets & Freedom, 6212 Bishop Blvd, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Clark, J.

The purpose of this paper is to try to answer the question whether 'Precariat' is a social and economic problem for Russia or whether it is a new reality. Considering the stability of employment, the main sources of wages or various groups of the population and the number of these groups, the authors came to the conclusion that, in fact, the main social problem is not the 'Precariat', but the phenomenon that the authors called 'Dependiat' (derived from the word 'dependents'). The 'Dependiat' is characterized by employment of a significant group of population, whose income is permanent, stable and depends mainly on the national budget.","[Maloletko, Alexander] Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Maloletko, Natalia] Minist Interior Russia, Kikot Moscow Univ, Moscow, Russia",Russian State Social University (RSSU),"Maloletko, A (通讯作者)，Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia.",Shadow.economy@gmail.com; 1102505@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-623-5,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,56.0,,,,,,235,238,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000491539600053,0

A salient feature of this paper is the analysis of the ramifications of joint venture contract for quantity and quality, which is often deficient in most previous analyses of moral hazard. The research found that contracts that have rewards based on the quantity produced weakened the agent's incentive to make effort in ensuring quality. This finding could explain why most contracts in agriculture for products with differentiated markets rarely use retail-price conditioned contracts.","[Mkhabela, Thulasizwe] Agribusiness Dev Agcy, ZA-3202 Pietermaritzburg, Kwazulu Natal, South Africa; [Mkhabela, Thulasizwe] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Mkhabela, T (通讯作者)，Agribusiness Dev Agcy, ZA-3202 Pietermaritzburg, Kwazulu Natal, South Africa.;Mkhabela, T (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",mkhabelat@ada-kzn.co.za,,,,,,,48,5,5,0,1,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

We analyze a sample of US domestic equity mutual funds in the period 1990-2016. Before controlling for the HE, we find that mutual fund investors worsen the return that they achieve with their timing decisions by 1.80% annually. However, after controlling for the HE, the actual prejudice is 0.71% annually. We establish several additional controls obtaining these next results: (i) more sophisticated and informed investors show better timing skills; (ii) the HE is more relevant to less sophisticated investors; (iii) investors wrongly time their exposure to the stock market; and (iv) incubation bias does not significantly affect previous results.

At the same time, the country has declared in its basic law a categorical prohibition on the application of genetically modified organisms. The aim of this study is to explain the causes of this obvious contradiction. The collection of expert estimations regarding the relative positions and attitudes of different actors has been carried out in the form of face-to-face interviews with 67 stakeholders in the agri-food sector, following a strictly neutral approach, not taking into consideration whether the respondents have taken positions for or against the application of genetically modified crops. In order to define the key actors in the GM regulation debate, their mutual influences and their goals. Based on this information, a quantitative model has been developed to determine the system of interests of different actors and the coalition(s) which develop among them around different goals. The results of the analysis emphasise that a wide coalition of anti-GMO actors has formed, consisting of researchers, NGOs, GM-free certifiers, the media and the parliamentary parties. However, their interests are quite different, as is their natural reluctance to accept new, partially unknown technology. The results of our investigations support the practical applicability of strategic position analysis, supported by modern expert-opinion based quantitative methods. The application of this approach offers a favourable possibility to determine the positions of various actors. Under these conditions, there is an urgent need to change the communication strategy of pro-GMO scientists and other stakeholders and instead of taking a defensive position, pro-active communication should be adopted.","[Popp, Jozsef; Balogh, Peter] Univ Debrecen, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Sectoral Econ & Methodol, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Olah, Judit] Univ Debrecen, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Appl Informat & Logist, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Fari, Miklos] Univ Debrecen, Fac Agr & Food Sci & Environm Management, Dept Agr Bot Plant Physiol & Biotechnol, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Lakner, Zoltan] Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Food Sci, Dept Food Econ, Villanyi Str 29-43, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary",University of Debrecen; University of Debrecen; University of Debrecen; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Oláh, J (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Appl Informat & Logist, Boszormenyi Str 138, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary.",,"Popp, József/AAF-4461-2021; Popp, József/AFN-1250-2022; Oláh, Prof. Dr. Judit/U-5352-2019; Balogh, Peter/J-9183-2019","Popp, József/0000-0003-0848-4591; Oláh, Prof. Dr. Judit/0000-0003-2247-1711; Balogh, Peter/0000-0002-8611-0221; Fari, Miklos/0000-0001-6406-348X",New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities [UNKP-17-4],New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities,Supported by the UNKP-17-4 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities.,,125,7,7,0,14,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The concept of halal tourism is an actualization of the Islamic concept where halal and haram values become the main benchmark, this means that all aspects of tourism activities are inseparable from halal certification which must be a reference for every tourism actor (Chookaew et al., 2015). In tourist attractions SMEs can sell products as a distinctive Indonesian feature, but if coupled with the concept of halal tourism, the products sold by SMEs must certainly have halal certification. With the existence of halal certification, of course, it will guarantee that the products sold are suitable for foreign tourists who are very concerned about halal food or products. In addition there are also Muslim tourists from non-Muslim countries such as Singapore and France. Kemenparekraf noted that the number of Muslim tourist visits to Indonesia reached 1,270,437 people per year (Tourism, 2015). According to Perdani & Chasanah (2018), the construction of a halal guarantee system is very important because it is to safeguard products whose raw materials are not from Muslim countries. With halal certification, SME products obtain added value so that they will increase the competitiveness of Indonesian products in the international world. The purpose of this study is to find out what factors influence and which factors play the most powerful role in influencing efforts to improve the competitiveness of Small and Medium Enterprises in Eastern Indonesia. The research design used in this study is a qualitative method (by using a qualitative approach to case studies and data mining with the method of depth interview). The data used in the second (qualitative) approach is one shot, which is collected through data mining in the form of depth interviews and focus group discussions to key informants. Informants as many as 12 SMEs and the Department of Industry and Trade as well as MUI in the local area in Eastern Indonesia (Bali and Lombok). In addition to completing the depth of the discussion and allowing more in-depth findings to be produced, literature studies have also been conducted on several similar research results. The results of this study found that there are several factors influencing efforts to improve the competitiveness of Eastern Indonesia Small and Medium Enterprises namely Availability & Conditions of Business Environment, Business Capability, Business Performance, Policy and Infrastructure, Research and Technology, and External Support. The dominant factor is that policy and infrastructure want to illustrate the extent to which the implementation of policies and infrastructure in locations around MSMEs operate can support or hinder businesses to operate. In this case, there are several measurement indicators, namely the application of legal policies, the application of economic policies, the application of socio-cultural policies, and the completeness and availability of business supporting infrastructure.","[Ratnasari, Ririn Tri; Gunawan, Sri; Rusmita, Sylva Alif; Prasetyo, Ari] Univ Airlangga, Fac Econ & Business, Surabaya, Indonesia",Airlangga University,"Ratnasari, RT (通讯作者)，Univ Airlangga, Fac Econ & Business, Surabaya, Indonesia.",ririnsari@feb.unair.ac.id,"ratnasari, ririn tri/AAF-8804-2021; Gunawan, Sri/AAA-9676-2020","ratnasari, ririn tri/0000-0003-1126-4012; Gunawan, Sri/0000-0002-2687-6786; Prasetyo, Ari/0000-0003-3228-0863",,,,,20,0,0,0,0,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,1044,1056,,10.18502/kss.v3i13.4266,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics; Religion,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Religion,BS3YS,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000716967900073,0

Since then, the growth of intermediated asset management and consolidation in the asset management sector has led to more pronounced common-ownership links at the level at which corporate control is exercised. Recent empirical research has provided evidence consistent with the literature's prediction that common-ownership concentration (CoOCo) can affect product market outcomes. The resulting antitrust concerns have received worldwide attention. However, because CoOCo can change the objective function of a firm, the potential implications span all fields of economics that involve corporate conduct, including corporate governance, strategy, industrial organization, and financial economics. This article connects the papers establishing the theoretical foundations, reviews the empirical and legal literatures, and discusses challenges and opportunities for future research.","[Schmalz, Martin C.] Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Schmalz, Martin C.] Ctr Econ Policy Res CEPR, London EC1V 0DX, England; [Schmalz, Martin C.] Ifo Inst Ctr Econ Studies CESifo, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Schmalz, Martin C.] European Corp Governance Inst ECGI, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; European Corporate Governance Institute,"Schmalz, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Schmalz, MC (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res CEPR, London EC1V 0DX, England.;Schmalz, MC (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst Ctr Econ Studies CESifo, D-81679 Munich, Germany.;Schmalz, MC (通讯作者)，European Corp Governance Inst ECGI, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",schmalz@umich.edu,,,,,,,165,92,109,29,102,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Specifically, the relationship between the organizational capabilities and perceived nonfinancial performance is investigated. Firstly, the sequential combination of principal component analysis and regression analysis is deployed to the outlined case example. Secondly, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is applied to the case example. The comparison of both approaches proves SEM to be more vigilant statistical method for capturing the strength of relationship between latent constructs.","[Siska, Ladislav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 41A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Siska, L (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 41A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",ladislav.siska@econ.muni.cz,"Siska, Ladislav/R-4652-2019; Siska, Ladislav/R-4644-2019","Siska, Ladislav/0000-0003-1136-1605; Siska, Ladislav/0000-0003-1136-1605",Masaryk University; [MUNI/A/1001/2016],Masaryk University;,This paper has been prepared within the research project no.

In this article, we analyse whether this also holds for the popular variable moving average (VMA) rules of Brock et al. (1992). While previous research on this issue has strongly concentrated on US and emerging stock market indices, we fill a research gap by focussing on a wide range of developed market indices and individual stocks. Using a trend regression approach for a dataset covering 1972 to 2015, we find that most analysed trading rule specifications show negative trend coefficients. These results, robust in a variety of settings, indicate that VMA rule signals have steadily lost their ability to forecast future price movements accurately. Analysing several rationales for this outcome, we find that negative trends in the autocorrelation of stock returns are a highly promising explanation for the poorer performance of VMA rules because they are designed to capture autocorrelation.","[Strobel, Marcus; Auer, Benjamin R.] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; [Auer, Benjamin R.] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany",Leipzig University; Ifo Institut,"Auer, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.",auer@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,Wissenschaftsforderung der Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe e.V.,Wissenschaftsforderung der Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe e.V.,We thank the editor and an anonymous reviewer for valuable comments and suggestions.

A panel of 4945 firms are studied comparatively over two periods: before (2003-2007) and during (2008-2013) the global crisis. During the global crisis, micro-enterprises survive by relying mostly on internal sources of financing. External leverage is reduced, as the increased information asymmetry and default risk raise the cost of debt. When necessary, micro-enterprises sell the underused or unnecessary tangible assets, as they focus on their main competence and develop their intangible assets: human skills, advertising, networking, brand name, and awareness. In addition, we show that the pecking order is the most relevant theory for predicting the financial decisions and situation of French MEs. These results provide interesting insights into the financial strategy of French micro-enterprises, facilitating understanding and action at academic and policy levels.","[Thi Hong Van Hoang; Gurau, Calin; Lahiani, Amine] Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier, France; [Thi Hong Van Hoang; Gurau, Calin] Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier, France; [Lahiani, Amine] Univ Orleans, LEO, Orleans, France; [Seran, Thuy-Luu] Univ Montpellier, MOMA, Montpellier Res Management, Espace Richter, Rue Vendemiaire, F-34960 Montpellier, France",Montpellier Business School; Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Orleans; Universite de Montpellier,"Hoang, THV (通讯作者)，Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier, France.;Hoang, THV (通讯作者)，Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier, France.",thv.hoang@Montpellier-BS.com; c.gurau@montpellier-bs.com; amine.lahiani@univ-orleans.fr; thuy.seran@umontpellier.fr,,,,,,,89,12,16,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Estimating a differences-in-differences model and controlling for observable differences in land use, housing type distribution, tax revenues and other postal code area characteristics by means of propensity score matching, we find no significant effect of the release of emission information on the value of houses in affected postal code areas. This result survives a number of robustness checks designed to assess whether our findings are due to data aggregation issues or the actual treatment definition.

We develop a two-step regression strategy that fully exploits the available high-frequency market reaction data to identify the impact of macroeconomic releases and to quantify the effects at lower frequencies. While macroeconomic surprises explain only one tenth of the daily variation in bond yields, their explanatory power improves substantially at lower frequencies, accounting for one third of quarterly variations.

Using data for 118 banks of 30 countries over the period 2004-2011, we find that an improvement of the quality of economic and legal institutions can help in reducing banks' CDS spreads, as banks operating in countries where the regulatory quality is stronger tend to be less affected by spikes in financial stress of 2008-2009. Considering a series of indicators of the financial structure of the banking system, our results reveal that more concentration of the banking sector, a stronger presence of foreign banks, a deterioration of the banking sector health or the lack of alternative means of finance is associated with higher CDS spreads of banks. We also show that the dynamics of bank CDS spreads accrue to: (i) the quality of banks' balance sheet; (ii) (il)liquidity of banks' assets; (iii) how profitable banks' operations are; and (iv) the banks' leverage ratios. Finally, higher CDS spreads of banks tend to be associated with periods of high inflation and low GDP growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that corporate bond funds exhibit a concave flow-to-performance relationship: their outflows are sensitive to bad performance more than their inflows are sensitive to good performance. Moreover, corporate bond funds tend to have greater sensitivity of outflows to bad performance when they have more illiquid assets and when the overall market illiquidity is high. These results point to the possibility of fragility in the fast-growing corporate bond market. The illiquidity of corporate bonds may generate a first-mover advantage among investors in corporate bond funds, amplifying their response to bad performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

I develop a model in which the takeover premium and the ability of the target board to resist the takeover are endogenous. The analysis relates the influence of the board on target shareholders and the reaction of the market to its recommendations to various characteristics of the acquirer and the target. I also show that the expected target shareholder value can decrease with the expertise of the board and it is maximized when the board is biased against the takeover. Generally, uninformative and ignored recommendations are not necessarily evidence that the target board has no influence on the outcome of the takeover. Perhaps surprisingly, under the optimal board structure, target shareholders ignore the recommendations of the board, which are never informative in equilibrium. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Domestic government bonds are considered to be HQLAs. To assess the appropriateness of this rule, we investigate the liquidity of European government bonds in ordinary times and in periods of market turmoil. We find that the effect of adverse market conditions on liquidity strongly depends on individual bond's characteristics. Our evidence argues for rules on HQLAs that should constrain the eligibility of government bonds depending on their characteristics (primarily, duration and rating). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find no evidence that staggered board changes are negatively related to firm value. However, we find a positive relation for firms engaged in innovation and where stakeholder relationships matter more. This suggests that staggered boards promote value creation for some firms by committing the firm to undertaking long-term projects and bonding it to the relationship-specific investments of its stakeholders. Our results are robust to matching procedures and an exogenous change in Massachusetts corporate law that mandated staggered boards. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Cremers, K. J.

Higher investments in resource extraction make expropriation more attractive from the perspective of national governments. A low expropriation risk is in turn an important determinant of international investments and is therefore associated with high levels of resources extraction. Moreover, investments in the resource sector also raise corruption.

On average we do not find any significant effect on children's health; however, the effect varies among different groups. Children's health may improve as a result of parental migration in families with lower income in the base year and families with higher-income growth rates. Furthermore, children's health may deteriorate with maternal migration but improve with longer distance of paternal migration and longer time of paternal migration. We argue that parental migration affects children's health through complex mechanisms: income increase may have a positive impact while decreased parental care may have a negative effect. The two effects seem to offset each other in rural China.","[Sun, Wenkai; Wang, Yijie] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, 59 ZhongGuanCun Ave, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Guo, Qian] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Foreign Languages & Literatures, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Tsinghua University,"Sun, WK (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, 59 ZhongGuanCun Ave, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",sunwk_r@126.com,"Guo, Qian/HMD-5017-2023","Guo, Qian/0000-0002-7645-4186",Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [15XNQ008],Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China,This study is financially supported by the Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (Grant No. 15XNQ008).,,55,7,7,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

A part of this increase is due to an increase in value of fish landings, but accounting for that still leaves room for increases due to ITQs. Return on total capital (including quota value) has either stagnated or fallen.

Yet, the two types of programs have been examined in distinct bodies of literature without much reference to each other. By systematically reviewing peer reviewed journal articles, dissertations, and select working papers, we suggest important similarities and differences between HCD cash transfer and PES programs that have been overlooked, particularly in how direct transfers are conceptualized and operationalized and how intended and unintended program outcomes are produced. Rather than considering HCD cash transfers and PES as two distinct tools, a common framework that conceptualizes direct transfers as an umbrella mechanism to produce socially desirable outcomes can contribute to effectively engaging target populations, addressing the needs of beneficiaries in a holistic way, comprehensively evaluating program impacts, and enabling opportunities to build synergies and minimize redundancies and competition across programs. We conclude by offering five insights into future research, program development, and policy innovations. Specifically, PES programs can learn from HCD cash transfer programs to (1) incorporate considerations of economic and gender inequalities to better sustain long-term environmental outcomes; (2) enhance collaboration among PES scholars, program practitioners, and policy makers to improve PES design and implementation and minimize adverse unintended impacts; (3) use randomized control trials to measure the causal impacts of PES; and (4) reconsider the role of conditionality to promote simultaneous production of environmental, economic, and social benefits. HCD cash transfer programs can learn from PES programs to (5) explore collaborative, community-based program design and implementation to facilitate not only adoption of socially desirable behaviors but also long-term human capital gains.

Overconfidence is identified in the sample in various forms. By matching survey data with participants' transactions and portfolio holdings, we find an influence of overplacement on trading activity, of overprecision and overestimation on diversification, and of overprecision and overplacement on risk taking.

We predict that, if manufacturers form relational contracts with subcontractors, if manufacturers closely collude with each other when trading with subcontractors, if information about subcontractors' past actions is only imperfectly shared by manufacturers as hearsay, and if demand shock is considerable, then premium subcontractors suffer more from market volatility than ordinary subcontractors would and hence, it is optimal for manufacturers to shield premium subcontractors against the risk. We then study Kiryu, a kimono weaving cluster that expanded from the late nineteenth century with the development of new synthetic dyeing techniques. We show that premium subcontracting weavers were allowed long-term relational contracts and specialization, which shielded already honest weavers against market volatility and induced them to be diligent and to acquire skills.","[Nakabayashi, Masaki] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1030033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Nakabayashi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1030033, Japan.",mn@iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Nakabayashi, Masaki/AAM-4041-2020","Nakabayashi, Masaki/0000-0003-1096-1350",JSPS KAKENHI [JP22243022]; Kikawada Foundation,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Kikawada Foundation",This research has been supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP22243022 and The Kikawada Foundation.,,43,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We test whether changes in inventory alone can explain this atypically long contango. To do this, we estimate monthly VARs of the CME WTI oil futures spread and OECD and U.S. inventory in line with standard theory, and add petroleum consumption and implied volatility to the vector of endogenous variables. When we model the futures spread as one continuous series, results confirm two-way causation between inventory and the futures curve, as predicted by the theory of storage. However when we separate negative and positive futures spreads we find that: two-way causation between the futures spread and U.S. inventory breaks down; shocks to OECD petroleum consumption cause more negative spreads and shocks to U.S. consumption cause more positive spreads in addition to inventory-driven changes; and increases in volatility directly raise positive spreads. These new causal channels have become significant since 2008 and can be related to higher inventory, inelastic supply of oil and uncertainty about global economic conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The present author examines all cyclones that were generated in the North Indian Ocean, both the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, from 1990 to 2015. A negative binomial (NB) model of cyclone fatalities against cyclone intensity finds that the CSP does little in protecting people's lives against the high storm intensity. In contrast, a two-stage NB model of cyclone fatalities against the level of surges reveals that the CSP is vastly effective against storm surges. The number of fatalities is, on average, 75% smaller in the areas where the shelter program has been implemented against the areas without the program in response to the same level of storm surges. A set of Probit adoption models of adaptation options in response to cyclone surges and intensity reveals that the CSP has been directed to a low-income area with high population density, which is in contrast to the other strategies which have been increasingly adopted with higher income, e.g., cyclone trajectory projection technologies.","[Seo, S.

Specific mechanisms involved include cadastre modernization, land titling, land registration and land-consolidation schemes. Through these techniques, the state increases its control over common-public lands, reconfigures land-use and access patterns, and deepens commodification. The paper traces historical variation in land use from the national developmentalist to the neoliberal phases of capital accumulation in Turkey, with comparative, contextual examples drawn from the Ottoman Empire. It highlights the combined and socio-spatially differentiated processes of commodification across sectors that engender a multiplicity of outcomes in simultaneously framing commercialization of agriculture and housing. Contextual analysis of official documents and histories is complemented by information gathered from fieldwork and in-depth interviews in several former wheat-cultivating villages, a former gecekondu neighbourhood, and a small agricultural town in the province of Ankara.","[Atasoy, Yildiz] Simon Fraser Univ, Sociol, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Atasoy, Y (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sociol, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",yatasoy@sfu.ca,,,,,,,91,13,14,9,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

It is found that the variability between weekend and weekday pairs is much greater than between weekday-weekday pairs or weekend-weekend pairs. The variability of other household members' activity-travel patterns is found to significantly influence an individual's activity-travel patterns. The results also show that the variability in the activity-travel patterns of workers and students is greater when conducting a particular discretionary activity on weekdays. Due to performing discretionary activities more often and for longer, non-workers tend to have more predictable activity-travel patterns. Undertaking multitasking activities within different activities on weekdays significantly impacted the different degrees of variability in an individual's activity-travel patterns. Having different health and built environment characteristics also corresponds with different degrees of predictability of the activity-travel patterns, particularly in the worker/student case.","[Dharmowijoyo, Dimas B.

We build an updated panel of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I institutions and utilize within-institution variation to identify the effects of athletic success. Using a ranking of all institutions, we find that having more successful men's basketball and football teams has a significant positive effect on first-year retention rates. We also find some evidence that improved basketball rankings increase graduation rates, and that success in the NCAA tournament may have a sizable impact on retention. Although the estimated effects are generally modest in scale, we find rather limited evidence of other institutional factors affecting persistence, suggesting that athletics can be one avenue for institutions of higher education to engage and retain students.","[Hickman, Daniel C.] Univ Idaho, Dept Business, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Meyer, Andrew G.] Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; Marquette University,"Hickman, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Dept Business, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",dhickman@uidaho.edu; andrew.g.meyer@marquette.edu,,,,,,,45,4,17,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Their importance can be understood by the observation that the money at the core of these systems, central bank money, is injected into the economy on terms, not defined in a market, but by the collateral frameworks and interest rate policies of central banks. Using the collateral framework of the Eurosystem as a basis of illustration and case study, the paper brings to light the functioning, reach, and impact of collateral frameworks. A theme that emerges is that collateral frameworks may have distortive effects on financial markets and the wider economy. They can, for example, bias the private provision of real liquidity and thereby also the allocation of resources in the economy as well as contribute to financial instability. Evidence is presented that the collateral framework in the euro area promotes risky and illiquid collateral and, more generally, impairs market forces and discipline. The paper also emphasizes the important role of ratings and government guarantees in the Eurosystem's collateral framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper challenges that consensus as applied to eurozone-centred debt flows. Though bank-centred approaches are well equipped to explain a significant portion of cross-border debt dynamics through carry trades, there is little evidence this constituted the central mechanism for channelling flows. The expansion of debt flows is instead explained by depressed returns on fixed income instruments and the ensuing asset-liability mismatches which led investors to move into financial sector debt and yield-producing securitized assets. An investor-centred as opposed to a bank-centred understanding of debt flows has important financial stability and policy implications.","[Sweeney, Robert] Univ Leeds, Dept Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Sweeney, R (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, 90 Clarendon Rd, Leeds LS2 9LB, W Yorkshire, England.",bn11res@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,74,5,6,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

At the same time, fisheries management has other objectives. This study uses Swedish fisheries to analyse how the fishing sector and its climate impact are affected by regulations aiming at: (1) solving the common pool problem (2) taxing greenhouse gas emissions and (3) maintaining small-scale fisheries. The empirical approach is a linear programming model where the effects of simultaneously using multiple regulations are analyzed. Solving the common pool problem will lead to a 30 % reduction in emissions and substantially increase economic returns. Taxing greenhouse gas emissions will further reduce emissions. Policies for maintaining the small-scale fleet will increase the size of this fleet segment, but at the cost of lower economic returns. However, combining this policy with fuel taxes will reduce the size of the small-scale fleet, thus counteracting the effects of the policy. If taxation induces fuel-saving innovations, it is shown that this will affect not only emissions and fleet structure, but also quota uptake.","[Waldo, Staffan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Paulrud, Anton] Swedish Agcy Marine & Water Management, Gothenburg, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Waldo, S (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",Staffan.waldo@slu.se,"waldo, staffan/AHA-9201-2022",,Nordic Council of Ministers [(58) 2012]; Swedish Research Council Formas [229-2009-616],Nordic Council of Ministers; Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"We acknowledge funding from the Nordic Council of Ministers for the project Economic consequences of abolishing fuel subsidies for fishing vessels (Project No. (58) 2012), and input from the project participants; Ola Flaaten, Nguyen Ngoc Duy, Hans Ellefsen, Jonas Hallgrimsson, Cecilia Hammarlund, Oystein Hermansen, John Isaksen, Frank Jensen, Dadi Mar Kristoffersson, Marko Lindroos, Max Nielsen, Fredrik Salenius, and Daniel Schutt; and from Karin Bergman.

Furthermore, environmental correlates of walking distance may differ by stop location. Using the 2010 Transit Onboard Survey in the Minneapolis and St. Paul Metropolitan Area, this study develops four models to compare the effects of the built environment around transit stops on walking distance of transit egress. Job density is negatively correlated with walking distance, consistent in all four models. Other built environment variables exhibit different impacts by stop location. Particularly, land use mix has positive impacts on walking distance for stops outside of downtown and suburban employment centers whereas job density is more important for suburban centers. Job accessibility and the number of intersections have significant effects on stops within downtown areas but have no significant impacts on stops outside of downtown areas. The number of transit stops has opposite impacts on walking distance for stops within and outside of downtown. Moreover, the built environment tends to have a larger impact on walking distance in downtown areas than non-downtown areas. We then discuss the implications for stop area land use planning and transit stop location choice.","[Wang, Jueyu; Cao, Xinyu] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 301 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Wang, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Sch Publ Affairs, 301 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",wang5931@umn.edu; cao@umn.edu,"Cao, Jason/AAE-4374-2020","Cao, Xinyu/0000-0002-4403-9762",,,,,27,35,38,8,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our multivariate tests show that banks that were politically connected-either through lobbying efforts or employment of politically connected individuals-were substantially more likely to participate in the Federal Reserve's emergency loan programs. In economic terms, participation in these programs was 28-36% more likely for banks that were politically connected than for banks that were not politically connected. In our final set of tests, we attempt to identify a proper explanation for this peculiar relationship. While a broad literature speaks of the moral hazard associated with receiving bailouts, we test whether another type of moral hazard exists in the period preceding the bailout. In particular, we argue that, to the extent that political connections act as synthetic insurance, banks may have engaged in more risky behavior that lead them to the Fed's emergency lending facilities. Tests seem to confirm this explanation.","[Blau, Benjamin M.] Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84332 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Blau, BM (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84332 USA.",ben.blau@usu.edu,,,Mercatus Center at George Mason University,Mercatus Center at George Mason University,This research was partially funded by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.,,41,20,23,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2017,172.0,3-4,,,,,333,358,,10.1007/s11127-017-0446-8,0.0,,,26,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FD8CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407753200003,0

Under our model framework the factor returns are cross-sectional information coefficients IC, that vary randomly over time with constant mean and variance. The fundamental law holds for portfolio managers who use conditional expectation of the residual returns and the associated conditional covariance matrix as inputs to active quadratic utility portfolio optimization. The fundamental law formula shows that the optimal portfolio's information ratio (IR) is positively related to the mean of IC, and the number of assets N in the portfolio selection universe, inversely related to the volatility of IC and is an absolute upper bound on IR as N tends to infinity. Support for our choice of factor model and our fundamental law is provided by an empirical study showing that significantly higher IR values are obtained using our choice of factor model as compared with IR values using an industry standard factor model.","[Ding, Zhuanxin] Analyt Investors, 555 W 5th St,50th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90013 USA; [Martin, R.

In a world where political talk is often ambiguous and imprecise, it then becomes important to understand whether correct choices can still be made. In this paper we identify two elements of political culture that are key to answering this question: (i) whether or not political statements satisfy a so-called grain of truth assumption, and (ii) whether or not politicians make statements that are comparative, that is contain information about politicians' own positions relative to that of their adversaries. The grain of truth assumption means that statements, even if vague, do not completely misrepresent the true positions of the parties. We find that only when political campaigning is comparative and has a grain of truth, will voters always make choices as if they were fully informed. Therefore, the imprecision of political statements should not be a problem as long as comparative campaigning is in place.","[Janssen, Maarten C.

Using a century of data for 14 advanced economies, we find that credit cycle synchronization dropped in the early 1920s from initially relatively high levels. Between the 1920s and the 1970s synchronization was overall low and concentrated within five, predominantly regional, clusters. However, synchronization has significantly increased in the post-Bretton Woods era and has become less associated with geographic proximity: Australia, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the US form a single major credit cycle cluster since the 1970s. A smaller cluster is formed by Canada, the Netherlands, and Sweden, while the German credit cycle follows a distinct path. Using logistic regressions, we find that the synchronization of credit and business cycles go hand in hand. Our findings are especially relevant for the international coordination of macroprudential policy, as well as to spur and inform further analysis on credit cycle dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence, we find that there are two mechanisms at a firm's disposal so as to deal with financial difficulties: one corresponds to a recapitalization process, the other to a liquidation one. The choice of mechanism is based on a cost-benefit analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Canonical correlation analysis to predict relative prosperity was performed for selected 110 nations with the focus on Romania and Slovenia. The study results for Romania for 2011 indicate low approval of the government, low confidence in the judicial system as well as in financial institutions, in addition to concerns about health prospects and lack of confidence in the transparency of elections for the loving construct. In addition, the being construct is also negative in Romania suggesting overall dissatisfaction with the economic status and development, indicating strong dissatisfaction with governmental efforts to address poverty and efforts regarding sanitation, concerns about environment, existing standard of living and life expectancy, suggesting a weak health system. The study further suggests for Slovenia for 2011 negative expectations for the loving construct and below average expectations for the being construct. The approval of the government and confidence in the judicial system and financial institutions in Slovenia is also low, the only positive expectation is the confidence in electoral system, but Slovenians are also worried about their health prospects. In addition, the being construct for Slovenia is also slightly below average, indicating dissatisfaction with economic development and below average satisfaction with water quality and environment, and life expectancy suggesting health system inefficiency. The longitudinal study for the time period from 2011 till 2016 suggests moderate improvements for Romania in eight areas of relative prosperity, especially for the natural environment, governance and education, and for Slovenia practically unchanged situation. The study further suggests that both nations still face numerous challenges but due to implementation of certain structural reforms till 2016, albeit limited, some additional improvements regarding the economic prosperity of their citizens could be expected in the near future.","[Cirkvencic, Franci] Govt Republ Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Bertoncel, Tine] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bertoncelj, Andrej; Mesko, Maja] Univ Primorska, Koper, Slovenia",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Primorska,"Mesko, M (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Koper, Slovenia.",maja.mesko@fm-kp.si,,,,,,,56,4,4,0,2,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2017,19.0,46,,,,,822,835,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413856000015,0

We show that this criticism of Simon's account of rule-based behavior in organizations is unsound. More importantly, Simon's account overcomes some serious limitations of practice approaches with regard to understanding reflexivity, subjectivity, and improvisation. We reconstruct Simon's view of organizational rules and cognition as part of his decision-making theory. In this view, rules are not rigid repetitive patterns of action, but mental structures allowing for various degrees of subjective interpretation, behavioral flexibility, and strategic action. We emphasize the central place that Simon assigns to the concept of a shared cognitive model governing representations of reality, and the importance of this concept in understanding the issue of rule-based behavior. Simon's analysis is contemporary and powerful, insofar as it offers a valuable and comprehensive alternative to current understandings of routine and cognition in organizations.","[Koumakhov, Rouslan] NEOMA Business Sch, Campus Reims,59 Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51100 Reims, France; [Daoud, Adel] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",University of Cambridge,"Koumakhov, R (通讯作者)，NEOMA Business Sch, Campus Reims,59 Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51100 Reims, France.",rouslan.koumakhov@neoma-bs.fr; ad836@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,72,6,6,2,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

However, extant studies demonstrate that less developed countries (LDC) and emerging economies (EE) are reaching the transition process faster than those from developed regions, which renders the speed of ageing, besides ageing, a critical variable to explore in this context. Comparing system dynamic panel data estimations for 40 LDC, 19 EE and 28 developed countries (DC), between 1990 and 2013, we uncovered that ageing is detrimental to countries' economic growth, with noticeable nuances depending on countries' development level. The current level of ageing significantly and negatively impacts on DC's growth but not on that of LDC or EE. For these latter groups, the most relevant issue is the speed of ageing. The current annual growth of old age dependency ratio significantly diminishes EE's growth prospects whereas the lagged annual growth of the ageing index and the old age dependency ratio significantly curtails LDC's growth. Such results emphasize the need for urgent public policies that might mitigate the imbalance in LDCs' age structure before the speed of ageing leads LDCs to become even much poorer.","[Teixeira, Aurora A.

Some states utilized this optioneither tightening income limits for the same family over time or loosening them. In this article, we construct a theoretical model of utility-maximizing workers facing different time-dependent eligibility thresholds to predict the Medicaid participation and employment behavior of workers with varying wage levels. The model reveals some inter-temporally perverse incentives created by linking eligibility thresholds to Medicaid duration. Then, we empirically test these predictions using the Survey of Income and Program Participation and a unique compilation of state-by-family size Medicaid thresholds for both new and continuing recipients. We find that patterns of Medicaid participation and spell duration are consistent with the predictions of our model. There is also evidence that the individuals predicted by our model to lower their work hours may supply fewer hours of labor. As of January 2014, the Affordable Care Act disallows time-varying income disregards; our findings suggest that states previously using this strategy will experience an adjustment in Medicaid caseloads and possibly labor market outcomes because of the change.

Experimental research in behavioral economics has recently adopted dual-system theories of the mind from psychology in order to address this question. This research uses response time data in public good games to distinguish between the two distinct cognitive processes. We extend this literature towards environmental public goods by analyzing response time data from an online experiment in which over 3400 subjects from the general population faced a dichotomous choice between receiving a monetary payment or contributing to climate change mitigation efforts. Our evidence confirms a strong positive link between response times and contributions: The average response time of contributors is 40 % higher than that of non-contributors. This suggests that reflection, not intuition, is at the root of pro-environmental contributions. This result is robust to a comprehensive set of robustness checks, including a within-subjects analysis that controls for potentially unobserved confounds and recovers the relationship at the individual level.","[Lohse, Johannes; Goeschl, Timo; Diederich, Johannes H.] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Bergheimer Str 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Lohse, J (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Bergheimer Str 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",lohse@eco.uni-heidelberg.de,,"Goeschl, Timo/0000-0001-7618-5070; Diederich, Johannes/0000-0001-9301-1590; Lohse, Johannes/0000-0001-6897-5304",German Science Foundation (DFG) [GO1604/1]; German Ministry for Education and Research [OIUV1012],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support by the German Science Foundation (DFG) under Grant GO1604/1 and the German Ministry for Education and Research under grant OIUV1012.

Ancient Greek and contemporary political thought draws attention to the connections between the assumed equality of moral worth among citizens and systems of voting, and to the relationship between equality or inequality of standing to the bases of dessert and the fair distribution of political influence in a democratic state. These matters in turn bear directly on democratic legitimacy, and thus on the stability of the social order. Some issues that must be decided in a democratic community concern common interests. Common-interest issues, based on widely held conceptions of equal moral worth, are not appropriately determined by preference intensity, and thus are inappropriate for a QV voting system. Real-money versions of QV risk undermining respect for law and democratic legitimacy. The costs of system-threatening civil conflict attendant upon loss of legitimacy outweighs any efficiency gains within the system. Token-currency versions of QV, which do not threaten democratic legitimacy, are a more plausible option for the application of QV to political issues in which correlating unequal influence with preference intensity does not conflict with assumptions of equal moral worth.","[Ober, Josiah] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Ober, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jober@stanford.edu,,,,,,,11,7,7,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2017,172.0,1-2,,,SI,,223,232,,10.1007/s11127-017-0409-0,0.0,,,10,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,EY2EV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403782200010,0

In this article, we challenge the popularized view of the Leave voter as an outsider and find that individuals from an intermediate class, whose malaise is due to a declining financial position, represent an important segment of the Brexit vote. We use individual-level data from a post-Brexit survey based on the British Election Study. Our analysis tests three predictive models. First, although our analysis confirms the negative association between education and Leave vote, we find that voting Leave is associated more with intermediate levels of education than with low or absent education, in particular in the presence of a perceived declining economic position. Secondly, we find that Brexiters hold distinct psycho-social features of malaise due to declining economic conditions, rather than anxiety or anger. Thirdly, our exploratory model finds voting Leave associated with self-identification as middle class, rather than with working class. We also find that intermediate levels of income were not more likely to vote for remain than low income groups. Overall our analysis of the Brexit vote underlines the importance of considering the political behaviour of the declining middle.","[Antonucci, Lorenza] Teesside Univ, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Horvath, Laszlo] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Kutiyski, Yordan] Kieskompas, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Krouwel, Andre] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Teesside; University of Exeter; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Antonucci, L (通讯作者)，Teesside Univ, Sch Social Sci Business & Law, Middlesbrough TS1 3BX, Cleveland, England.",l.antonucci@tees.ac.uk,"Krouwel, Andre/D-3959-2016","Krouwel, Andre/0000-0003-0952-6028; Antonucci, Lorenza/0000-0002-1145-2972; Horvath, Laszlo/0000-0003-0606-1050",People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 under REA [608085],People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 under REA(Marie Curie Actions),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research leading to these results has received funding from the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013/under REA grant agreement no. 608085.",,44,81,83,2,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Within an analytical model, we show that extinction is never optimal when a global biodiversity value is taken into account. Moreover, a stronger preference for species diversity leads to a more even distribution of stock sizes in the optimal steady state, and a higher value of biodiversity increases steady state stock sizes for all species when species are ecologically independent or symbiotic. For a predator-prey ecosystem, the effects may be positive or negative depending on relative prices and the strength of species interaction. The analytical results are illustrated and extended using an age-structured three-species predator-prey model for the Baltic cod, sprat, and herring fisheries. In this quantitative application, we find that using stock biomass or stock numbers as abundance indicators in the biodiversity index may lead to opposite results.","[Bertram, Christine] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Quaas, Martin F.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 1, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Bertram, C (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",Christine.Bertram@ifw-kiel.de; Quaas@economics.uni-kiel.de,"Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012","Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829; Bertram, Christine/0000-0002-8186-5617",,,,,39,11,11,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find that, when tax rates are moderate, funding public investment by raising taxes may increase long-run growth. If existing tax rates are high, public investment is only growth enhancing if funded by restructuring the composition of overall public spending. Additionally, public investment that is debt financed can have adverse effects on long-run growth due to the resulting increases in interest rates and debt-servicing costs.","[Christie, Tamoya A.

Measuring the systemic risk of an individual hedge fund by using the marginal expected shortfall (MES), we find evidence for a positive and statistically significant relation between systemic risk and hedge fund returns. The risk-adjusted return of a hedge fund portfolio with a high systemic risk is 0.64% per month higher than for one with a low systemic risk during 1994-2012, while negative performance is observed during crisis periods. The relation between systemic risk and hedge fund returns holds for both live and defunct funds. Moreover, the relation holds even after controlling for a large set of fund characteristics. Hence, systemic risk is a powerful determinant of cross-sectional variations in hedge fund returns. Our results imply that the positive relation between hedge fund returns and systemic risk is due to compensation for the realized losses during systemic events.","[Hwang, Inchang] Korea Insurance Res Inst, KFPABldg,38 Gukjegeumyung Ro 6 Gil, Seoul 07328, South Korea; [Xu, Simon] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Banking & Finance, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [In, Francis] Griffth Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Griffth Business Sch, Gold Coast Campus, Qld 4222, Australia; [Kim, Tong Suk] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, 85 Hoegiro, Seoul 130722, South Korea",Monash University; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"In, F (通讯作者)，Griffth Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Griffth Business Sch, Gold Coast Campus, Qld 4222, Australia.",hic7217@kaist.ac.kr; simon.xu@monash.edu; f.in@griffth.edu.au; tskim@business.kaist.ac.kr,"Kim, Tong Suk/C-1598-2011; Hwang, Inchang/GZM-9060-2022",,,,,,56,5,6,3,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

The first is a conventional pollution tax, the second is an environmental campaign raising consumers' awareness about the relative impact of their consumption choices. The comparison is carried out in two different scenarios, depending on whether consumers' aprioristic preferences are such that they value the environmental attribute of a product (environmental quality) or its pure performance (hedonic quality) . In the case of environmental quality, the campaign is preferred under some specific conditions based on consumer heterogeneity, cost-effective analysis, and pollution level. On the contrary, the pollution tax is always preferred in the case of hedonic quality. Therefore, we show that the relative efficiency of the two policy instruments crucially depends on consumers' initial concern for the environment, which may vary across countries due to socio-economic conditions.","[Mantovani, Andrea] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Mantovani, Andrea] Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, C JM Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Vergari, Cecilia] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Mantovani, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.;Mantovani, A (通讯作者)，Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, C JM Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",a.mantovani@unibo.it; cecilia.vergari@unibo.it,,"VERGARI, CECILIA/0000-0003-4585-984X",Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Forli,Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Forli,"We thank the Editor Eswaran Somanathan, the Associate Editor Carlos Chavez, and two anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

The resulting data set of intercompany loss triangles displays a multilevel structure of claim development where a portfolio consists of a group of insurers, each insurer several lines of business, and each line various cohorts of claims. In this article, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze intercompany claim triangles. A copula regression is employed to join multiple triangles of each insurer, and a hierarchical structure is specified on major parameters to allow for information pooling across insurers. Numerical analysis is performed for an insurance portfolio of multivariate loss triangles from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

They affect not only divorce welfare but also within-marriage allocations. A central question in this context is whether or not intra-marital bargaining is Coasean, where Coasean bargains are characterised by the costless transfer of utility between spouses when property rights are well defined. In Coasean bargains divorces are efficient in the sense that they cannot occur when the joint surplus within marriage is larger than the sum of individual divorcees' values outside marriage. This is because the spouse with the highest value can always compensate the spouse who wants to leave, and thus persuade her/him to stay. Under non-Coasean bargaining inefficient divorces can occur, due to the absence of costless side-payments. This paper offers a theoretical framework to identify Coasean and non-Coasean behaviour. Whilst an increase in the spouse's wage always reduces (increases) non-Coasean labour supply (home production), it increases both labour supply and home production under Coasean bargains. Observing labour supply falls after a divorce will again indicate Coasean bargaining. The paper provides a possible explanation for why both males' preferences for stereotypical work division and females' preference for non-monetary work aspects persist.","[Skatun, John Douglas] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Business Sch, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Skåtun, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Dept Econ, Business Sch, Aberdeen AB24 3QY, Scotland.",j.skatun@abdn.ac.uk,,,University of Aberdeen,University of Aberdeen,Funder was provided by University of Aberdeen,,83,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Household private cash and inkind transfers do not serve as insurance against illness in the relief phase; they do so only after pooled resources are recovered in the reconstruction phase (i.e., resource effect). Risk-sharing arrangements are dependent on the history of labor-time transfers corresponding to housing damage (i.e., reciprocity effect): only disaster non-victims are insured against illness, because victims have already received labor help for their rehabilitation from non-victims.

In the same time, they contribute to the creation of a mentality of equilibrium in consumption and among consumers. With no connection with the area of activity, the XXIst century companies make real efforts to obtain competitive advantages by a consequent implementation of social responsibility, by assuring a responsible consumption in all the processes, and by protecting the consumer interests and rights. It became more and more frequent for the companies from tourism industry to apply the principles of sustainable development and to follow a strategy of responsible consumption. Their efforts are focused on providing different and unique experiences to contemporary consumer. In this way, the responsible consumption becomes not only a competitive advantage, but, also, an efficient way of informing the tourists and protecting their interests and rights. Without having a well-determined ideological motivation, tourists become more careful in responsible selection of services, depending on their degree of sustainability. They choose those touristic services that have a big contribution at the environment protection and preservation, respectively that integrate in a harmonious and synergic way cultural, psycho-social and emotional considerations. The institutions that regulate the touristic services supply contribute, also, at the careful monitoring of messages submitted to tourists and the messages content. To measure the way that the rural tourist guesthouses from Romania base their actions on the responsible consumption of raw materials and resources in their strategies of approaching the market and attracting tourists, in order to get sustainable competitive advantages and to offer efficient solutions to protect the tourists interests, the authors did a qualitative empirical research among the managers of these kind of accommodation units. Based on some matrix of importance considered dimensions of the responsible consumption in the analyzed guesthouses, the authors attempt is fulfilled by the development and emphasis of some strategies, which can increase the tourist safety and can contribute to a proper strategy defining, if they are implemented in an adequate way.","[Epuran, Gheorghe; Tescasiu, Bianca; Todor, Raluca Dania; Sasu, Karin-Andreea] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania; [Cristache, Nicoleta] Dunarea Jos Univ, Galati, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov; Dunarea De Jos University Galati,"Epuran, G (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania.",epuran.gheorghe@unitbv.ro,"Cristache, Nicoleta/V-8674-2017; Epuran, Gheorghe/N-4395-2015; Tescasiu, Bianca/K-3418-2016","Cristache, Nicoleta/0000-0001-6337-4315; Epuran, Gheorghe/0000-0002-4959-102X;",,,,,52,6,6,0,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2017,19.0,45,,,,,447,462,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404523800009,0

And what are the implications, if any, for banking regulation? To answer these questions, I study a Diamond-Dybvig environment, where banks hedge against aggregate liquidity risk in the interbank market or default, and depositors borrow and lend in a hidden-bond market. In this framework, banks offer an endogenously incomplete contract, and default in equilibrium only when facing systemic liquidity risk. In this case, the allocation at default is inefficient, and countercyclical liquidity requirements are welfare-improving.","[Panetti, Ettore] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Panetti, Ettore] CRENoS, Madrid, Spain; [Panetti, Ettore] UECE, Ceara, Brazil",Banco de Portugal; Universidade Estadual do Ceara,"Panetti, E (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal.;Panetti, E (通讯作者)，CRENoS, Madrid, Spain.;Panetti, E (通讯作者)，UECE, Ceara, Brazil.",,"Panetti, Ettore/E-8223-2014",,Jan Wallander och Tom Hedelius' Research Foundations; Autonomous Region of Sardinia (Legge) [7]; FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) Portugal [PTDC/IIM-ECO/6337/2014]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/IIM-ECO/6337/2014] Funding Source: FCT,Jan Wallander och Tom Hedelius' Research Foundations; Autonomous Region of Sardinia (Legge); FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This paper is a revised version of the first chapter of my PhD dissertation.

I argue that the productivity measures are related to the foreign integration strategies adopted by the multinationals and should reflect a different productivity sorting. Using a panel data of Taiwanese multinationals, the empirical results show that the number of their investing locations increases with labor productivity but decreases with total factor productivity. The MNEs with higher total factor productivity were more likely to invest in countries with higher prices or wages. Empirical results also show that China is the top choice for the MNEs with either increasing total factor productivity or labor productivity. If their labor productivity is further increased, they would consider to invest in the U.S. or Hong Kong and Singapore.","[Tang, Meng-Chi] Natl Clung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan",,"Tang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Clung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan.",ecdmct@ccu.edu.tw,,"Tang, Meng-Chi/0000-0002-7175-7241","National Science Council, Taiwan [102-2410-H-194-009-]","National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","I thank the Editor, Hamid Beladi, and an anonymous referee for their numerous suggestions and support concerning this paper.

Using data from the 2006 edition of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) for the Netherlands, we propose a methodology to study the effect of firm-level characteristics on the propensity to undertake a research collaborative agreement. In particular, we show that controlling for a richer variance structure yields a different picture with respect to simpler regression frameworks adopted in the literature of R&D cooperation determinants. Moreover, such a hierarchical framework can be generalized allowing for clustering at higher levels, such as sectors or geographical areas. Besides the link between public funding and R&D collaboration, our results confirm the findings of the literature: technological spillovers, risk and cost sharing rationales, firm's size, and type of innovative activity are related to the decision of engaging in different sorts of research alliances.","[Amoroso, Sara] Joint Res Ctr European Commiss, Calle Inca Garcilaso,3, Seville 41092, Spain",,"Amoroso, S (通讯作者)，Joint Res Ctr European Commiss, Calle Inca Garcilaso,3, Seville 41092, Spain.",sara.amoroso@ec.europa.eu,"Amoroso, Sara/L-7179-2014","Amoroso, Sara/0000-0001-5835-079X",,,,,46,20,21,0,40,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Whilst a number of empirical studies have suggested the former is alive and well, this paper argues that power relations may also be constituted by the self-perceptions of weaker actors as much as by the explicit actions of more powerful ones. This study explores the role of power through the perceptions of subjugated actors, which set the rules of the game'. Our case centres on perceptions of Northern Irish beef farmers and their reflections on their powerlessness' in relation to the larger, more consolidated processors that they sell to. We find that the way farmers make sense of the power relations they encounter is influenced by the individuating character of the power relations exercised by the processors, which debilitates their ability to collaborate and resist collectively. What emerges is a story about the process of accommodation whereby farmers pragmatically resign themselves to play by the rules of the game' to remain part of the game'.","[Brooks, Stephanie; Spence, Michelle; Elliott, Christopher T.; Dean, Moira] Queens Univ Belfast, 18-30 Malone Rd, Belfast BT9 5BN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Leaver, Adam] Univ Manchester, Manchester, England",Queens University Belfast; University of Manchester,"Dean, M (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, 18-30 Malone Rd, Belfast BT9 5BN, Antrim, North Ireland.",moira.dean@qub.ac.uk,"Dean, Moira/E-3273-2010","Leaver, Adam/0000-0001-6199-6057; Dean, Moira/0000-0002-9014-1266","Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in Northern Ireland [PG14/05]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/M003094/1, ES/M0033183/1]; ESRC [ES/M003183/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M003183/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in Northern Ireland; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This material is based upon work funded by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in Northern Ireland (PG14/05) and supported by Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under grand numbers, ES/M003094/1 (Analyses of Food Supply Chain for Risks and Resilience to Food Fraud/Crime) and ES/M0033183/1 (Food fraud: a supply network integrated systems analysis).",,90,5,5,1,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

It finds that foreign-controlled enterprises were more important than domestically controlled enterprises in overall labour productivity growth for 2001-2010, but the contribution of foreign-controlled enterprises declined after 2006 as a result of an increase in the exits of large and productive foreign-controlled firms during that period. Restructuring in the manufacturing sector intensified after 2006. During 2006-2010, there was an increase in reallocation to enterprises that are more productive and an increase in reallocation of labour to industries that are more capital and intermediate input intensive. The effect of new enterprises displacing exitors also increased after 2006, mostly because of the increased effect of domestic entrants displacing exitors while the effect of foreign entry and exit declined. Offsetting those positive effects of reallocation on labour productivity growth is the negative effect of reallocation of labour to the firms with lower relative capital and intermediate intensities within the same industries. Finally, the article finds that the decline in labour productivity growth after 2006 was partly due to a decline in the productivity contribution of foreign-controlled enterprises as a result of an increase in the exits of large and productive foreign-controlled firms during that period.","[Gu, Wulong] STAT Canada, Econ Anal Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Li, Jiang] Global Affairs Canada, Off Chief Economist, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Statistics Canada,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Global Affairs Canada, Off Chief Economist, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",jiangbery.li@canada.ca,,"Li, Jiang Beryl/0009-0003-8355-9941",,,,,22,1,1,0,3,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Our study is motivated by conflicting findings in the literature on whether politically connected firms appoint reputable auditors (Big 4 auditors). On one hand, politically connected firms are less likely to appoint Big 4 auditors if they wish to cover up RPT-related tunneling activities by providing financial statements that fail to reflect their true economic performance. On the other hand, politically connected insiders who refrain from self-dealing would prefer higher-quality financial reporting and, hence, appoint Big 4 auditors. Using data from Indonesia, we find support for the former. By documenting the role of RPTs as a motivating factor for politically connected firms to choose non-Big 4 auditors, we enrich the political connection and auditor choice literature.

J,"Kauffman, CM; Martin, PL",,,,"Kauffman, Craig M.; Martin, Pamela L.",,,Can Rights of Nature Make Development More Sustainable? Why Some Ecuadorian lawsuits Succeed and Others Fail,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,sustainable development; rights of nature; Latin America; Ecuador; buen vivir; sumak kawsay,,"In 2008, Ecuador became the world's first country to include rights of Nature (RoN) in its constitution. The constitution presents RoN as a tool for building a new form of sustainable development based on the Andean Indigenous concept sumak kawsay (buen vivir in Spanish), which is rooted in the idea of living in harmony with Nature. While much is written on the ethical arguments regarding RoN (and buen vivir), few studies analyze how RoN might be implemented. We fill this gap by explaining why some efforts to apply Ecuador's RoN laws succeeded while others failed. We compare 13 RoN lawsuits using an original framework for analyzing the pathways and strategies RoN advocates (and their opponents) use to build (and counter) momentum behind judicial processes meant to buttress the enforcement of contested RoN norms. The case descriptions and analysis draw on primary documents and in-depth interviews conducted during 2014-15. Through process tracing, we identified key structural conditions and strategic decisions shaping the outcomes in each case. Our findings as of 2016 reveal unexpected pathways of influence involving a symbiotic process among civil society, state agencies, and the courts. Surprisingly, civil society pressure was the least successful pathway, as activists lost high-profile lawsuits. Nevertheless, they facilitated judicial momentum by working on less-politicized local cases and training lower-level judges. Instrumental use of RoN laws by the state produced unintended consequences, including establishing precedent and educating judges. Knowledgable judges are unilaterally applying RoN in their sentencing, even when neither claimants nor defendants allege RoN violations. Ecuador's cases demonstrate how weak RoN laws can strengthen, providing important insight into the global contestation over sustainable development and the strategies and legal tools being used to advance a post-neoliberal development agenda rooted in harmony with nature.

Secondly, our method allows to disentangle the contributions of jumps and diffusion for the early exercise premium. Finally, using American-style options on the S&P 100 index from January 2007 until December 2012, we estimate various hyper-exponential specifications and investigate the implications for option pricing and jump diffusion disentanglement.

To mitigate this lack of robustness, we propose an approach in which the optimal hedge is determined by optimizing the worst-case value of the objective function with respect to a set of plausible probability distributions. In the empirical analysis, we consider an insurer who hedges longevity risk using a longevity bond, and we compare the worst-case (robust) optimal hedges with the classical optimal hedges in which parameter uncertainty and model misspecification are ignored. We find that unless the risk premium on the bond is close to zero, the robust optimal hedge is significantly less sensitive to variations in the underlying probability distribution. Moreover, the robust optimal hedge on average outperforms the nominal optimal hedge unless the probability distribution used by the nominal hedger is close to the true distribution.","[Li, Hong] Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [De Waegenaere, Anja; Melenberg, Bertrand] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ & Operat Res, Tilburg, Netherlands; [De Waegenaere, Anja; Melenberg, Bertrand] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands",Nankai University; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Li, H (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",hong.li@nankai.edu.cn,"Melenberg, Bertrand/IUM-2524-2023","Melenberg, Bertrand/0000-0003-4195-8744; De Waegenaere, Anja/0000-0001-7396-3789",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"Hong Li is an Assistant Professor in the School of Finance at Nankai University, Tianjin, China.

After the start of the European debt crisis in 2009, the importance of the financial balance, the economic development and the external debt increased substantially and the effect of eurozone membership switched from positive to negative. In addition, GDP growth gained a lot of importance for highly indebted sovereigns and government debt became much more important for countries with a low GDP growth rate.

However, such programs' impact on forest degradation remains unclear because of the absence of empirical evidence. In addition, there is heated debate about whether certification programs create an incentive for producers to expand their coffee-growing areas, which may accelerate forest degradation in the surrounding natural forest. This study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, aimed to evaluate the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest degradation. Additionally, to provide empirical evidence for the debate, we examined the spillover effects of certification to surrounding forest areas and used remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 to classify forest areas based on their density. We applied matching methods, such as the propensity score matching with different algorithms, to compare forest coffee areas with and without the certification. We found that the certified forest coffee areas slightly increased in forest density. By contrast, we observed drastic forest degradation in the forest coffee areas without certification. We checked the sensitivity of our results and found that our results are robust to potential hidden bias. Furthermore, our empirical results revealed that the natural forest areas within a 100-m radius from the forest coffee boundary area exhibited significantly reduced forest degradation compared with forest areas under similar environmental conditions but that such positive and significant impact diminished after 100-m distance. These results indicate that the certification program is effective in alleviating forest degradation in the certified area and in the surrounding natural forest. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Concerns about competition on a level-playing field are raised. The debate on vertical network unbundling is reaching the distribution networks. Primary driver for this discussion is the requirement to exchange information in smart grids in a neutral and non-discriminatory way. Against the background of the unbundling discussion for distribution networks, we introduce a new approach: the Common Information Platform (CIP). The CIP tries to balance better between competition and coordination. The CIP adds two new dimensions. First, it unbundles information and data management as the key step in the value chain. Correspondingly, the CIP avoids such drastic measures as network ownership unbundling and legal unbundling will suffice. Second, it does not separate information and data management from the sector, but rather involves third parties in the rule making process; the governance structure is common instead of independent.","[Brandstatt, Christine; Buchmann, Marius] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Fraunhofer Inst Mfg Technol & Adv Mat, IFAM, Bremen Energy Res, Coll Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Brunekreeft, Gert] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Bremen Energy Res, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Friedrichsen, Nele] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, ISI, Karlsruhe, Germany",Jacobs University; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Jacobs University; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Buchmann, M (通讯作者)，Jacobs Univ Bremen, Fraunhofer Inst Mfg Technol & Adv Mat, IFAM, Bremen Energy Res, Coll Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",m.buchmann@jacobs-university.de,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,5,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

We find evidence of a MAX effect similar to the U.S. and European markets. However, contrary to U.S. and European evidence, the MAX effect in China does not weaken much less reverse the anomalous idiosyncratic volatility (IV) effect. Both the MAX and IV effects appear to independently coexist in the Chinese stock markets.

Therefore, developing a methodology which gives precise estimates to reduce the exposure of risk to a minimum is of great importance. This paper uses an asymmetric BEKK-GARCH model to examine the return and volatility linkages between the FTSE Bursa Malaysia Emas Shariah (FBMS) index and the sectoral indices under a normal market. The findings suggest that the FBMS plays a leading role in the mean return spillover effect. There is a strong evidence of significant transmission of past shocks, volatilities and leverage effects are observed on the current conditional variance-covariance in all the pair-wise models. These empirical results are helpful in quantifying the cross-market risk evaluation, risk minimizing weight and cross-market hedge ratio for strategizing appropriate portfolio selection.

We examine the association between holding ETF positions and AMMF performance, as well as indirect measures of performance, including market timing, flow management, and cash holdings. We find that over one-third of AMMFs take an ETF position between 2004 and 2015. Our results indicate that AMMFs allocating large portions of their portfolio to ETFs perform worse, by between 0.41% and 1.63% annually using various performance measures. These AMMFs also exhibit worse market timing and hold more cash. In contrast, AMMFs that hold ETFs in small amounts have similar characteristics to non-user AMMFs. Therefore, the act of holding an ETF does not signal inferior ability, however, taking large ETF positions does. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Sherrill, D.

Using original data from husbands and wives (interviewed separately) in 1,851 Tanzanian households, the analysis examines differences in the wife's authority over 13 household and farming decisions. The study finds that the level of decision-making authority allocated to wives by their husbands, and the authority allocated by wives to themselves, both vary significantly across households. In addition to commonly considered assets such as women's age and education, in rural agricultural households women's health and labor activities also appear to matter for perceptions of authority. We also find husbands and wives interviewed separately frequently disagree with each other over who holds authority over key farming, family, and livelihood decisions. Further, the results of OLS and logistic regression suggest that even after controlling for various individual, household, and regional characteristics, husband and wife claims to decision-making authority continue to vary systematically by decision-suggesting that decision characteristics themselves also matter. The absence of spousal agreement over the allocation of authority (i.e., a lack of intra-household accord) over different farm and household decisions is problematic for interventions seeking to use survey data to develop and inform strategies for reducing gender inequalities or empowering women in rural agricultural households. Findings provide policy and program insights into when studies interviewing only a single spouse or considering only a single decision may inaccurately characterize intra-household decision-making dynamics.

We initialize GCAM to reproduce observed agriculture and land use in 1990 and forecast agriculture and land use patterns on one-year time steps to 2010. We report overall model performance for nine crops in 14 regions. We report areas where the hindcast is in relatively good agreement with observations and areas where the correspondence is poorer. We find that when given observed crop yields as input data, producers in GCAM implicitly have perfect foresight for yields leading to over compensation for year-to-year yield variation. We explore a simple model in which planting decisions are based on expectations but production depends on actual yields and find that this addresses the implicit perfect foresight problem. Second, while existing policies are implicitly calibrated into IAMs, changes in those policies over the period of analysis can have a dramatic effect on the fidelity of model output. Third, we demonstrate that IAMs can employ techniques similar to those used by the climate modeling community to evaluate model skill. We find that hindcasting has the potential to yield substantial benefits to the IAM community.","[Calvin, Katherine; Wise, Marshall; Kyle, Page; Clarke, Leon; Edmonds, Jae] Univ Maryland, Joint Global Change Res Inst, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Edmonds, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Joint Global Change Res Inst, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jae@pnnl.gov,"Kyle, Page/AFP-3602-2022","Kyle, Page/0000-0002-1257-8358",Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the Integrated Assessment Research Program; DOE [DE-AC05-76RL01830],Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the Integrated Assessment Research Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),This research was supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the Integrated Assessment Research Program.

The different ICT capacities are captured by online presence (having a website), online transactions (e-sales activities) and proportion of employees with broadband internet access or post-upper secondary ICT education. The results show a significant and positive relationship between the ICT capacities and the engagement in exporting activities of small- and medium-sized firms, although the kind of ICT capacity of importance seems to vary across countries. In countries where the ICT usage in firms is less developed, mainly basic capacities such as online presence are related to the decision to export.

Violence has two dimensions: outward violence (i.e., crime) and inward violence (i.e., suicide). To our knowledge, rigorous empirical studies have not been performed to investigate how climate change affects both criminal and suicidal behavior. This study aims to estimate the effects of climate change on crime and suicide in Japan by using prefecture-level monthly panel data on climate, crime, and suicide between 2009 and 2015. Even after controlling for prefecture, yearly, and monthly effects, we found that many climate factors affected both crime and suicide in Japan. In particular, more aggressive behavior and an increased number of suicides were observed when the average temperature increased. Furthermore, we predicted how changes in the climate of Japan will affect future patterns of criminal and suicidal behavior based on two climate change scenarios.","[Takahashi, Ryo] Waseda Univ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1690051, Japan",Waseda University,"Takahashi, R (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1690051, Japan.",inter.takahashi@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,11,12,1,43,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

The accrual principle is reflected in the Balance Sheet and Income Statement. Accrual measurements in the Balance Sheet are measured using PersistenceCurrent Operating Accrual, Persistence Non-Current Operating Accrual. Idiosyncratic risk reflects the specific information about the company and it will fluctuate according to the information itself. To measure the idiosyncratic risk in this study five factors of Fama-French Model were used (Fama and French 2014). Asset Pricing Measurement uses the Dividend Discount Model to predict stock prices. The samples used in this study are listed below. The Manufacturing Company is selected with consideration for accrual measurement of accounts receivable, inventory, investment, and liabilities. The sample was chosen by purposive random sampling method. The number of samples generated by this method is 145 companies with full reports for 2010-2015. Using the SEM AMOS Ver.24 and Sobel Test-Path Analysis, the results show that Current Operating Accrual has a negative and significant relationship to the idiosyncratic risk and stock price. For non-current Operating Accrual, variables have a positive and significant relation. By using Sobel Test, the test result shows that idiosyncratic risk has mediation effect in Persistence Current Operating Accrual, Non-Current Operating Accrual relationship to stock price.","[Asri, Marselinus] Atma Jaya Makassar Univ, Accounting Dept, Makassar, Indonesia",,"Asri, M (通讯作者)，Atma Jaya Makassar Univ, Accounting Dept, Makassar, Indonesia.",marselinus.asri@yahoo.co.id,,,,,,,101,0,0,0,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-410-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,40.0,,,,,,154,174,,,,,,21,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9IB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416100900012,0

The estimation results highlight the importance of these risks in determining bank spreads. Overall, credit risk is more important than liquidity risk in explaining bank spreads. However, their impacts on spreads differ over business cycles. Specifically, while liquidity risk has a more significant impact on spreads during recessions, credit risk has a more significant impact during economic booms. These findings are consistent with the recent policy measures taken by the regulatory authorities in Turkey. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

SRISK measures the capital shortfall of a firm conditional on a severe market decline, and is a function of its size, leverage and risk. We use the measure to study top financial institutions in the recent financial crisis. SRISK delivers useful rankings of systemic institutions at various stages of the crisis and identifies Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers as top contributors as early as 2005-Q1. Moreover, aggregate SRISK provides early warning signals of distress in indicators of real activity.","[Brownlees, Christian] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain; [Brownlees, Christian] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Engle, Robert F.] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Finance, New York, NY 10003 USA",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; New York University,"Brownlees, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27,Off 20-2E10, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",christian.brownlees@upf.edu,"Brownlees, Christian T/D-9811-2014","Brownlees, Christian T/0000-0003-4276-1468","Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [MTM2015-67304-P]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075]; Sloan Foundation; National Science Foundation; NYU Stern and Corporate and Individual Sponsors of the Volatility Institute","Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government); Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

Our first conclusion is that employment effects are always divided into 3 types: direct effect, indirect effect and induced effect. The input-output (IO) or computable general equilibrium (CGE) models and spreadsheet-based analytical models are the two most broadly adopted methods to estimate the employment effects of renewable energy.

But ordinary citizens are usually cast both as the innocent victims of this process, and as the potential solution if only governments could be made more accountable to them. This paper draws upon recent developments in social psychology to discuss the formation of mass opinions on two aspects of resource ownership. One is the spatial assignment of ownership between local and national claims, which has been a significant cause of conflict. The other is the assignment of revenues between current consumption and future investment, which has usually been excessively biased towards the former. I suggest why, in the absence of an active government communications policy to offset them, known psychological biases may interact with resource discoveries to generate mass opinions which contribute to these problems.","[Collier, Paul] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Econ & Publ Policy, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Collier, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Econ & Publ Policy, Radcliffe Observ Quarter, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",Paul.collier@bsg.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,22,24,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

By construction, RPPs compare the average price level for a region with the national average. Accordingly, unlike traditional, temporal price indexes, RPPs can be used to adjust nominal incomes for cost of living differences, thereby allowing for more accurate comparison of living standards across geographic areas. When adjusting incomes in this manner, the authors find that, despite slow economic growth recently, living standards are relatively high in the St. Louis metropolitan statistical area (MSA). For example, the St. Louis MSA ranks in the top 6 percent of MSAs based on real per capita personal income and in the top 16 percent based on real median household income.","[Coughlin, Cletus C.; Gascon, Charles S.; Kliesen, Kevin L.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Coughlin, CC (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Kliesen, Kevin L/I-5746-2016; Coughlin, Cletus/K-6860-2016; Gascon, Charles/L-8119-2016","Kliesen, Kevin L/0000-0002-7166-6016; Coughlin, Cletus/0000-0002-8304-2796; Gascon, Charles/0000-0002-6129-5741",,,,,14,0,0,0,3,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Thus, we consider an epistemological analysis of the ways in which the decision making process is encoded, decrypted and forwarded by decision makers at the level of business organizations. By the epistemological analysis we want to highlight some theoretical and practical approaches on the idea of decision-making process. In those circumstances, the starting point of our work is aimed at the idea that any business organization the decision makers have a relevant role in terms of assuming strategies and implicitly in the decision-making. In other words, the managerial dimension of the business organization overlaps the very dimension of the decision-making processes within it. In our approach we are interested on how such an approach is possible that will try to explain in epistemology terms while making reference to a logical process of the managerial action. We believe that such an attempt may prove to be effective to the extent that a number of issues that can be integrated and validated at economic and social levels in conjunction, of course, with the logical algorithm of the decision-making process are considered. Moreover, the present study aims to examine how the decision making process becomes reality depending on its simple or complex nature. The research methodology envisages on the one hand, a comprehensive analysis of the methods of enunciation and the materialization of the decision-making process, and on the other hand, those which explicit the practical results validated at the business organization level and at socio-economic level. The synthesis of the main ideas that express the concretization of the decision making process within business organizations involves a form of valorization of information by the very logic of action of decision makers (founders / top-managers). Therefore, we will try to provide details and develop at the same time a number of conceptual and theoretical approaches on the subject by relating to the ideas of simplicity and complexity.","[Esi, Marius-Costel] Stefan cel Mare Univ Suceava, 13 Univ St, Suceava 720229, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Esi, MC (通讯作者)，Stefan cel Mare Univ Suceava, 13 Univ St, Suceava 720229, Romania.",mariusesi@yahoo.com,"ESI, Marius Costel/C-9427-2014",,,,,,26,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,385,395,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800030,0

The study uses a sample of ninety-nine Spanish corporations, each comprising a parent company listed on the stock exchange and a set of subsidiaries. Heckman's two-step correction is used to eliminate selection bias and the endogeneity of family ownership. Different models are contemplated in which we analyse the impact of both diversification and the family nature of a business on performance, established as Tobin's q-value. The results show how family control has a negative impact on Tobin's q-value, and that differences are greater between family groups and non-family groups controlled by banks and/or foreign agents. They also show how diversification does not affect the creation of value either individually or considering the possible moderating effect of family ownership. (C) 2016 AEDEM.

According to the OECD (2011a), green growth means taking measures conducive to growth and economic development, while ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the resources and environmental services that contribute to the country's prosperity. The purpose of this article is to analyze the level of green growth in selected OECD countries. Research was carried out based on Hellwig's method, which enabled the construction of a synthetic measure of greening of the growth. The adopted method made it possible to evaluate the studied phenomenon as a whole, providing grounds for assigning the selected countries into four groups, characterized by similar levels of green growth. In Group I, showing the highest level, there is only one country-Denmark.

We model post-marital residence and transfers simultaneously in a two-stage probit least squares estimation framework. We find a positive relationship between transfers and post-marital residence, a proxy for old age support. Children who receive more assets are more likely to stay at birth place after marriage and vice versa. In conditions of scarce or lacking social security mechanisms, parents make strategic transfers to ensure better old age.","[Kedir, Abbi] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Kedir, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.",andrea.oterova@hotmail.com,,,,,,,39,1,1,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This study considers 20 developing countries from the whole of South, East and South-East Asia. Design/methodology/approach - Using seven explanatory variables (market size, trade openness, infrastructure, inflation, interest rate, research and development and human capital), the authors have tried to find the best fit model from the two models considered (fixed effect model and random effect model) with the help of Hausman test. Findings - Fixed effect estimation indicates that market size, trade openness, interest rate and human capital yield significant coefficients in relation to FDI inflow for the panel of developing countries under study. The findings reveal that market size is the most significant determinant of FDI inflow. Research limitations/implications - Like any other study, this work also has some limitations. Lack of data on key determinants such as labor cost, exchange rate, corruption, natural resources, effectiveness of rule of law and political risk may be considered one such limitation. Further, controlling for variables such as exchange rate, corruption, labor cost and political risk could make significant improvements to this study. Practical implications - This study has significant implications for policy makers, mangers and investors. Policy makers would be able to understand the importance of the major determinants of FDI mentioned in the paper, and take steps to formulate policies that encourage FDI. Such measures could include developing market size, making regulations more international trade friendly and investing in the nation's human capital. Further, steps could be taken to keep interest rates and inflation rates under control as these factors have been found to influence FDI. Originality/value - The sample of 20 developing nations chosen for this study has not been considered by any study earlier. This is a unique contribution to existing body of research, and highlights the originality value of this paper.","[Kumari, Reenu; Sharma, Anil Kumar] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Management Studies, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Kumari, R (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Management Studies, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India.",kmreenu1985@gmail.com,"Sharma, Anil/AAU-3234-2021","Sharma, Anil/0000-0001-5453-2473; Sharma, Anil/0000-0002-9768-1644; kumari, Reenu/0000-0002-0910-9155",,,,,90,76,79,3,65,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The primary objectives of this study are to decompose nominal yields into their expected real yield and inflation components and to examine their behaviour using state-space and regime-switching frameworks. The dynamic yield-curve models capture three well-known latent factors-level, slope, and curvature - that accurately aggregate the information for the nominal yields and the expected real and inflation components for all maturities. The nominal yield curve is found to increase slightly with a slope of about 120 basis points, while the real yield curve slopes upward by about 20 basis points, and the expected inflation curve is virtually flat at slightly above 2 per cent. The regime-switching estimations reveal that the nominal yield, real yield and expected inflation curves have shifted down significantly since 1999.

The Russian banking sector remains extremely vulnerable to systemic risks. One of the material sources thereof is the concentration of banking sector assets at both micro-and macro-levels. The statistical data of international organizations suggest that among European countries having reported on such figure Russia is high on the list regarding the risk concentration. The high level of asset concentration in the Russian banking sector requires the analysis and improvement of the existing supervisory practice.

Specifically, we investigate how individualist-collectivist culture affects the relationship between ownership concentration and earnings quality. We predict that the social connections among corporate insiders are stronger in collectivist societies, thus reducing corporate monitoring efficiency and exacerbating agency problems. Consistent with our prediction we find the poor earnings quality that normally goes handin- hand with concentrated ownership, is improved when the firm's national culture is individualist. We further find that the poor earnings quality induced by ownership concentration is more pronounced in East Asia, where cultures are rooted in Chinese cultures and collectivism.

At the beginning, Islamic bonds had the character of the specific instrument, that appeared occasionally at some local markets. By the time, Islamic bonds gained bigger and bigger market share. Nowadays, the market sukuk, has the raising number of foreign investors from banks and corporations. The organization AAOIFI defines sukuk as the certificates of the similar value, which, after the final underwriting, authorize to accept the nominal value of certificates and its usage for the planned investments to tangible assets, rights and services or to the sufficient capital for projects or other investment activities. Another point that puts the accent on the knowledge of this instrument is the increasing population of muslim citizens in the european countries, what creates the basic assumptions for the growing demand for the instruments of islamic financial products, the need for the knowledge of the basic and also more detailed approaches and the philosophy of this financial market. On the other hand, this segment is obstructed by a number of problematic factors which restrict remarkably the future possible development. The aim of this paper is to specify more closely the features of Islamic bonds (sukuk) and to perform on this theoretical basis the comparative analysis with the conventional bonds. For their comparison, we are going to use the calculations of the value at risk. The data used with the comparison consist of the monthly prices of the public and company sukuk and bonds taken from he database Bloomberg. Although the weekly prices are more exact in substituing the market prices, where the position of the portfolio can be liquid, despite of this fact, we used the monthly prices because of the restriction of availability of the daily time chains in the case of sukuk. We also had the limited number of countries, regarding the fact that the trading with sukuk is on the primary market in the majority of cases restricted.

Main aim of our research was to empirically test relations between e-satisfaction, e-loyalty and repurchase intention. Based on an extensive literature review, we have formulated a hypothesis, which we tested in the structural model by using structural equation modelling (SEM). We examined whether e-loyalty mediated the effect of consumers' e-satisfaction on their repurchase intention. The quantitative data for our analysis was collected through a survey on 190 participants from Slovenia. Results showed that e-loyalty mediated the relationship between e-satisfaction and repurchase intention. Implications for research and practice of our findings are discussed. Researches in the area of online consumers' behaviour are of great importance for researchers and e-retailers.

However, recent analyses challenge this hypothesis and find that the expectation holds true for White college-educated households but not for Black college-educated households. To examine this finding further and investigate the role of family financial transfers in household net wealth, the authors perform a mixed-method study using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for a 24-year period, 1989-2013, and qualitative data from the Institute on Assets and Social Policy Levering Mobility study. Their results confirm that White college-educated households amass wealth, whereas the wealth of their Black counterparts declines. The authors also estimate the impact of just inheritance or large financial gifts and find that they decrease the existing racial wealth gap by nearly $ 40,000, or 20 percent. Further analyses demonstrate that White college graduates are significantly and substantially more likely to provide and receive financial support for education and/ or a home purchase, while Black college graduates are significantly more likely to financially support their parents. Multivariate regression analysis identifies receipt of financial support for education and a home purchase as a positive contributor to net wealth and financial help for parents as a negative contributor to net wealth, disadvantaging Black college-educated households, who are less likely to receive and more likely to give financial support. Longitudinal interview data collected in the Institute on Assets and Social Policy Leveraging Mobility study illustrate the mechanisms of family financial transfers and their relationship to wealth accumulation, contrasting the White and Black households' experiences. The discussion underscores the need to better understand intergenerational wealth and wealth sharing within families when studying wealth outcomes and highlights the role of family financial wealth transfers in creating opportunities for those who benefit the most-mostly White college-educated households.","[Meschede, Tatjana; Taylor, Joanna; Mann, Alexis] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Shapiro, Thomas] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, Law & Social Policy, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Shapiro, Thomas] Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, Inst Assets & Social Policy, Waltham, MA 02254 USA",Brandeis University; Brandeis University; Brandeis University,"Meschede, T (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Heller Sch Social Policy & Management, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.",,,"Taylor, Joanna/0009-0004-4246-5241; Meschede, Tatjana/0000-0001-8019-7701","Center for Household Financial Stability; Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Center for Household Financial Stability; Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This article was prepared for presentation at the symposium, Does College Level the Playing Field?

Daily scanner data from a hypermarket supports the effects of price promotions on sales within and between product categories, as expected. We expect that, (1) due to these light products representing more enduring involvement, demand is less price sensitive compared to demand for regular products; (2) as nonimpulse purchase products, price promotions of light products cannibalize the sales of other light products; and (3) the loss of light product benefits associated with switching means that price promotions of light products hurt regular product sales more than vice versa.","[Parreno-Selva, Josefa; Mas-Ruiz, Francisco J.; Ruiz-Conde, Enar] Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Ctra San Vicente S-N, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Parreño-Selva, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Ctra San Vicente S-N, Alicante, Spain.",pepi@ua.es,"MAS-RUIZ, FRANCISCO/H-4365-2015","MAS-RUIZ, FRANCISCO/0000-0002-3342-012X",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain [ECO2012-32001],Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain(Spanish Government),The authors appreciate the financial support provided by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of Spain (ECO2012-32001).

Strategic knowledge management and innovation become key tools for this purpose. Taking into account the importance of this subject, both in academic and professional terms, this paper aims to explore and analyse the literature published in ISI Web of Science. Besides the specific objectives are: a) to describe how literature is organized in terms of publications, authors and sources (journals); b) to identify main terms and definitions used; c) to discuss how this literature presents challenges (opportunities and difficulties) to strategic knowledge management and innovation. The articles identified related to the strategic knowledge management were submitted to a bibliometric analysis using VOSViewer software. The systematic literature review performed shows the use of knowledge is as decisive as its possession, and the inefficient use of this resource has opportunity costs that may be irrecoverable. In addition, the results obtained include three clusters: cluster 1 - Knowledge and Competitiveness, that explains the positive, far-reaching implications that knowledge allows for organizations, as well as its ability to improve competitiveness and thereby create value for the company; cluster 2 - Knowledge and innovation management, that refers to knowledge as promoter of innovation in general and value added in particular; and, finally, cluster 3 - Intellectual Capital, where emphasis is given to how knowledge management influences productivity and becomes relevant to the success of any organization. Based on the results found, this article identifies research paths that can be explored in order to give greater consistency and substantively increase theoretical and empirical knowledge in this area. By studying the citation profile of the Strategic Knowledge Management papers, we intend further to contribute to a better understanding of the flow of scientific production and practices in this stimulating area of research since de beginning of the XXI century.","[Silva, Rui; Leal, Carmem; Marques, Carla Susana] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Dept Econ Sociol & Management, Vila Real, Portugal; [Silva, Rui; Leal, Carmem; Marques, Carla Susana] CETRAD Res Unit, Vila Real, Portugal; [Ferreira, Joao] Univ Beira Interior, Dept Business & Econ, Covilha, Portugal; [Ferreira, Joao] NECE Res Unit, Covilha, Portugal",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Universidade da Beira Interior,"Silva, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Dept Econ Sociol & Management, Vila Real, Portugal.;Silva, R (通讯作者)，CETRAD Res Unit, Vila Real, Portugal.",ruisilva@utad.pt; cleal@utad.pt; smarques@utad.pt; jjmf66@gmail.com,"ferreira, joao/JJE-8433-2023; Silva, Rui/I-1473-2017; Ferreira, Joao/HNP-5121-2023; Ferreira, João J.M./K-7669-2012; Marques, Carla/U-2410-2018; Leal, Carmem/V-7073-2017","Silva, Rui/0000-0002-0283-9462; Ferreira, João J.M./0000-0002-5928-2474; Marques, Carla/0000-0003-1557-1319; Leal, Carmem/0000-0002-7860-9858",,,,,27,2,2,0,18,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,303,311,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000038,0

As a result of the study of the dependence of rates on long-term bank loans from short-term rates of banking market, it was found out that during the increase of the key rate, banks primarily increase rates on the short-term programs. Thus, as the total cost of lending grows, the cost of long-term lending may be lower than that of the short-term lending. It is determined that the relationship between the growth rate of short-term rates and the spread between short-term and long-term rates is negative. It was also concluded that, in spite of accelerating pace of the development of long-term lending in Russia, it does not provide the necessary growth rate of the investments in fixed assets of organizations, which is partly due to an increase in the share of loans to non-residents of the country.","[Sytnik, Maxim M.] Tyumen State Univ, Dept Finance & Monetary, Tyumen, Russia",Tyumen State University,"Sytnik, MM (通讯作者)，Tyumen State Univ, Dept Finance & Monetary, Tyumen, Russia.",sytnikmax@gmail.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,660,664,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600108,0

The relative trade space for U.S.-bound containerized shipments is delineated via reverse spatial interaction modeling. Reconfiguration and reverse calibration of the doubly constrained spatial interaction model is used to derive functional distances between origins and ports of export, as a means of estimating a Trade Impedance Quotient (TIQ) for trade flows at the scale of the continent. Global and local statistics of spatial autocorrelation are then used to analyze the spatial pattern of trade impedance. With this approach, the analysis of containerized flows establishes the existence, extent, location, and spatial distribution of discrepancies in South American landside trade impedance. A large share of trade flows have trade impedance that is disproportionate to distance. Trade impedance at origins is spatially clustered for the total dataset and randomly distributed for commodity segments, and randomly distributed at destinations. Potential focus areas for high trade impedance are identified. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper is focused on the observation of the share of individual portions of tax revenues in the structure of total tax revenues of municipalities. For this evaluation, the municipalities are divided into 11 size groups, in which are assessed the shares of individual items on total tax revenues and the size of tax revenues per capita in individual size groups of municipalities. By the observed values and the income structure can be examined what affects the tax revenues in size groups of municipalities. Although the rules for tax revenues of municipalities are unified, the individual conditions of individual municipalities are manifested by differences in resources of economy management. Attention is also focused on the causes that affect the size of tax revenues of small municipalities.","[Tomanek, Petr] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Tománek, P (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",petr.tomanek@vsb.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

One of the main reasons may reside in the fact that the relationship between sustainability and the marketing practices finds itself in continuous progress.

It lays emphasis on the relational perspective of CMP - i.e. on Interaction and Network Marketing - given the fact that, according to the extant literature, they are more indicative of the entrepreneurs' sustainability orientation than their counterparts. Framed within the market-oriented sustainability framework, the present approach provides further considerations on the underlying market-oriented and generally intangible constructs that precipitate sustainability efforts.","[Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania; [Alexandru, Vlad-Andrei] Univ Insubria, PhD Program Methods & Models Econ Decis, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania; University of Insubria,"Vatamanescu, EM (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",madalina.vatamanescu@facultateademanagement.ro; valexandru@uninsubria.it,"Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/F-4872-2017; Alexandru, Vlad Andrei/R-3702-2019",,,,,,32,0,0,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,373,383,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800029,0

Such an initiative starts with the economic interests of the farmers and may result in sustainability certification afterwards. An approach was investigated to implement more sustainable coffee production at the local level in Indonesia - the Mediated Partnership Model (Motramed). We conceptualize this model, initiated by an Indonesian research institute, as a form of collaborative governance to create a new, more sustainable management practice. We particularly focus on four critical mechanisms in the partnering process: defining a common problem, building trust, exploring collaborative advantages, and establishing a leadership role. Empirical research was conducted in three regions: Bali, Flores, and Java. In conclusion, we define several critical factors that need to be addressed to further develop similar bottom-up partnerships for more varied agricultural commodities.","[Wijaya, Atika; Glasbergen, Pieter] Maastricht Univ, Int Ctr Integrated Assessment & Sustainable Dev I, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Wijaya, Atika] Semarang State Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Kampus Unnes Semarang, Semarang 50229, Indonesia; [Mawardi, Surip] Indonesian Coffee & Cocoa Res Inst ICCRI, Sci Board, Jember 68118, Indonesia",Maastricht University; Universitas Negeri Semarang; Riset Perkebunan Nusantara; Indonesian Coffee & Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI),"Wijaya, A (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Int Ctr Integrated Assessment & Sustainable Dev I, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.;Wijaya, A (通讯作者)，Semarang State Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Kampus Unnes Semarang, Semarang 50229, Indonesia.",atika.wijaya@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Wijaya, Atika/V-2254-2019","Wijaya, Atika/0000-0002-6759-1488","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW); Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (MENRISTEKDIKTI) of Republic Indonesia","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW); Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (MENRISTEKDIKTI) of Republic Indonesia","This research was conducted as part of the joint research project on Social and Economic Effects of Partnering for Sustainable Change in Agricultural Commodity Chains in Indonesia.

Pig transport especially, has frequently been the focus of public interest. In the last several decades, awareness for animal welfare has grown in society, which has often led to negative attitudes from the public towards farm animal husbandry and transportation. It is a well-known fact that a person's knowledge and his/her attitude are strongly linked. Thus far, the connection between knowledge and attitude with regards to the transport of farm animals, especially pigs, has not been scientifically examined. In an online survey taken by 272 German consumers the effect that additional information in the form of written texts and pictures on public perception was examined. The results of this study reveal that this additional information does have a positive effect on the respondents' attitudes, yet consumer attitudes remain rather negative.","[Wille, Stefan Clemens; Busch, Gesa; Spiller, Achim] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Wille, SC (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Lehrstuhl Mkt Lebensmittel & Agrarprod, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",stefan-clemens.wille@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Busch, Gesa/AAI-1529-2020; Busch, Gesa/JHT-5738-2023; Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,,,,,35,11,11,0,16,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

I conceptualize the MVP as a paradoxical utopia, which is attempting to socially produce the supposedly natural order of a market society, through the staging of a fantasy of harmonious capitalist development that misrepresents the realities of rural African capitalism. Drawing on field research conducted in the Millennium Villages of Ruhiira, Uganda, and Bonsaaso, Ghana, I show how the conceptual failings of the MVP have led to the elite capture of project inputs, the absence of inclusive participation and a lack of long-term sustainability. In Ruhiira, the MVP has contributed to the consolidation of existing relations of inequality, while in Bonsaaso it has been overwhelmed by an influx of foreign gold miners. Through its failure to stage its fantasy of capitalist development in these cases, the MVP has paradoxically succeeded in consolidating the actual social relations of capitalism.","[Wilson, Japhy] Natl Strateg Ctr Right Terr CENEDET, Quito, Ecuador",,"Wilson, J (通讯作者)，Natl Strateg Ctr Right Terr CENEDET, Quito, Ecuador.",japhy.wilson@iaen.edu.ec,,,Hallsworth Fellowship,Hallsworth Fellowship,"Thanks to Tanja Muller, Ioanna Tantanasi and two anonymous referees for comments on previous drafts, and to Nicholas Scarle for the map.

It analyzes the modeling process of the time series model, and selects the financial revenue and tax revenue data of the National Bureau of statistics for the last 20 years. First of all, we only use the historical data of fiscal revenue to predict it, then combine the tax revenue data to make integration test, and establish the error correction model with the help of Eviews6.0 software. In this paper, the application of time series and co-integration test are the innovation point, finally, we draw a conclusion that tax revenue plays an important role in the government revenue of long and short time.","[Zhao, Jianna; Xin, Di] North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Econ & Management, 689 Huadian Rd, Beishi Dist 071003, Baoding, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Zhao, JN (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Econ & Management, 689 Huadian Rd, Beishi Dist 071003, Baoding, Peoples R China.",zhjnzhf@163.com; xindilove@163.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-435-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,49.0,,,,,,279,283,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6OH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426885700068,0

Using hedonic regression methods and household micro data, we find that the rent savings to public housing tenants are considerable and comparable in size to the housing allowance. Furthermore, this public housing subsidy is less targeted towards low-income households than the housing allowance. At the same time, low-income public housing tenants live in poorer, less educated and lower quality neighborhoods than similar low-income households living in private rental housing. This suggests that place-based programs may lead to more segregation than tenant- based alternatives even when neighborhood mixing is an explicit aim of the program, as is the case in Finland.","[Eerola, Essi; Saarimaa, Tuukka] VATT Inst Econ Res, POB 1279, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland",VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Eerola, E (通讯作者)，VATT Inst Econ Res, POB 1279, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.",essi.eerola@vatt.fi,"Saarimaa, Tuukka/AAL-4179-2020","Saarimaa, Tuukka/0000-0001-5671-4836; Eerola, Essi/0000-0001-6713-6816",Academy of Finland [255445]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [255445] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"This paper was previously circulated under the title Who benefits from public housing?.

J,"Fielding, D",,,,"Fielding, David",,,The geography of violence during a presidential election: Evidence from Zimbabwe,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Elections; Voter intimidation; Zimbabwe,STATE REPRESSION,"Successful election monitoring depends on the ability to predict where violence will be used to intimidate voters. However, the strategy of a violent electoral candidate will depend on the particular characteristics of the election, including (i) whether other candidates are able to organize violence, (ii) whether the outcome depends on nationwide voting shares or shares in individual electoral districts, and (iii) how costly it is to transport the resources used to perpetrate violent acts. Although there is already ample theory and evidence for some combinations of these characteristics, analysis of other combinations is still lacking. This paper presents a theory designed to analyse strategy in an election in which the outcome depends on nationwide voting shares and only one candidate is able to organize violence, distinguishing between the case of costless transportation and the case in which transportation is prohibitively costly. The theory predicts that in the case of costly transportation with constant returns to scale, violence will be targeted at areas where support for the opposition is relatively low. Evidence suggests that the second round of the 2008 presidential election in Zimbabwe corresponds to such a case, and statistical analysis of the geographical distribution of violence around the time of the election indicates that areas of opposition weakness did indeed suffer more violence.","[Fielding, David] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Fielding, David] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford, England",University of Otago; University of Oxford,"Fielding, D (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",david.fielding@otago.ac.nz,,"Fielding, David/0000-0003-0506-4233",,,,,34,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

In this article, we focus on examining legal reforms, specific policy, and collective bargaining agreement developments in the two Canadian Atlantic provinces that are currently publicly addressing the need for presumptive legislation: Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. We focus on two occupational groups, police and correctional services, who have been cited in media and public discussions as focal points for legislative and policy reform because of the nature of their work. We assess how stress-related compensation and prevention laws are developing in Atlantic Canada and how occupational policies are moving in a similar direction across the country among these groups. We find that Atlantic Canada is moving relatively slowly to embrace the policy changes introduced by other provinces and the federal government, in terms of legal reforms, organizational policy, and collective bargaining language. We conclude that the lack of legal reforms in compensation, health, and safety law and the limited progress in occupational policies and collective agreements are mutually reinforcing the slow pace of change.","[Hall, Alan; Ricciardelli, Rosemary; Medeiros, Daniella Simas] Mem Univ, Dept Sociol, St John, NF, Canada; [Sitter, Kathleen] Univ Calgary, Fac Social Work, Calgary, AB, Canada; [de Boer, Catherine] Mem Univ, Fac Social Work, St John, NF, Canada; [Small, Sandra] Mem Univ, Fac Nursing, St John, NF, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland; University of Calgary; Memorial University Newfoundland; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Hall, A (通讯作者)，Mem Univ, Dept Sociol, St John, NF, Canada.",,,"Ricciardelli, Rosemary/0000-0002-0905-8968",,,,,44,5,5,0,7,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Using factor-analyses, we identify and validate four relevant dimensions that capture (1) preferences for economic equality, (2) preferences for markets and efficiency, (3) preferences for personal and cultural freedom, and (4) nationalist, protectionist and populist preferences. We continue with a regression analysis on the determinants of multidimensional voter ideology and compare these to the determinants of the traditional left right measure of ideology. We find that there is substantial heterogeneity in the determinants of political preferences. Moreover, using a one-dimensional left-right representation of voter ideology conceals most of this heterogeneity.","[Lameris, Maite D.; Jong-A-Pin, Richard; Garretsen, Harry] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Laméris, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.d.lameris@rug.nl; r.m.jong.a.pin@rug.nl; j.h.garretsen@rug.nl,"Jong-A-Pin, Richard/AAD-7173-2019",,,,,,47,15,16,1,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Speculation is easier in the land market than in the housing market due to frictions that make renting less efficient than owner-occupancy. As a result, undeveloped land facilitates construction and intensifies the speculation that causes booms and busts in house prices. This observation challenges the standard intuition that in cities where construction is easier, house price booms are smaller. It can also explain why the largest house price booms in the United States between 2000 and 2006 occurred in areas with elastic housing supply.","[Nathanson, Charles G.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Zwick, Eric] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zwick, Eric] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Nathanson, CG (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,", Charles G.

This form of crowdfunding helps entrepreneurs to obtain feedback on market demand (next to raising money), since the pre-purchase decision of the crowd generates useful public information about product demand. However, it may also lead to project discontinuation if not enough money is raised during the campaign. We therefore derive conditions under which the entrepreneur sets a higher target. At other times, this leads entrepreneurs to raise sometimes even more money than necessary when there is a risk that the idea is quickly replicated by others, leading to even larger campaigns but also to fewer projects offered on platforms. Conversely, the increased presence of professional investors (business angels, venture capitalists) on platforms reduces the entrepreneurs' incentives in their crowdfunding campaign, which leads to more but on average smaller crowdfunding campaigns.","[Schwienbacher, Armin] Univ Cote dAzur, SKEMA Business Sch, Dept Finance & Accounting, Lille Campus,Ave Willy Brandt, F-59777 Euralille, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School,"Schwienbacher, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cote dAzur, SKEMA Business Sch, Dept Finance & Accounting, Lille Campus,Ave Willy Brandt, F-59777 Euralille, France.",armin.schwienbacher@skema.edu,,,,,,,35,53,59,8,68,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We find that corruption scandals have a marked effect both on levels of trust in local politicians and on perceptions of corruption. We also show that, while these perceptions gradually revert back to their pre-scandal levels, the effect on trust is more persistent.

Current estimates indicate that climate change will likely have a limited impact on the economy and human welfare in the twenty-first century. In fact, the initial impacts of climate change may well be positive. However, in the long run the negative impacts dominate the positive ones. Negative impacts will be substantially greater in poorer, hotter, and lower-lying countries. Poverty reduction complements greenhouse gas emissions reduction as a means to reduce climate change impacts. Although climate change may affect the growth rate of the global economy and may trap more people in poverty, quantification of these impacts remains difficult. The optimal carbon tax in the near term is somewhere between a few tens and a few hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon.","[Tol, Richard S.

Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to consider the effect of content marketing on sponsorship-response favorability in the South African energy drink market. Design/methodology/approach It is theorized that in an FGC environment, sponsor factors, sponsorship factors and event factors drive sponsorship favorability. This notion is tested using a structural equations model among 18- to 35-year-olds. Findings The results show acceptable model fit and confirm the usefulness of understanding the effects of content marketing on sponsorship favorability. The authors also offer directions for future research. Practical implications The results suggest that FGC which is well-designed, packaged and presented can enhance the views of individuals regarding a sponsor - even if the brand operates in a background position as opposed to the conventional foreground position common in promotional material. Originality/value The current study considers content marketing in contexts that have largely been avoided so far, or have only featured on a very limited scale in the literature. This study was conducted in an emerging market, business-to-consumer and sponsorship context for the application of a content marketing strategy.","[Human, Gert] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Business Management, Saldanha, South Africa; [Hirschfelder, Benedikt] Univ Cape Town, Sch Management Studies, Cape Town, South Africa; [Nel, Jacques] Univ Free State, Dept Business Management, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of the Free State,"Human, G (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Business Management, Saldanha, South Africa.",ghuman@sun.ac.za; benedikt.hirschfelder@gmx.de; nelj@ufs.ac.za,"Nel, Jacques/AAC-3927-2020","Nel, Jacques/0000-0001-6004-2446",,,,,96,9,11,4,68,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We derive conditions under which (1) the inter-temporal, green-effort reaction function of the firm with the less-aggressive green strategy is non-monotonic, (2) the level of green effort chosen by the firm with the more-aggressive green strategy increases when it views itself as the leader in a hybrid game rather than moving concurrently in a simultaneous-choice game, and (3) the establishment of a resale market by the more aggressive firm acts as a substitute for its choice of green-effort level. The sufficiency conditions underlying these results impose qualitative restrictions on the more-aggressive firm's lagged (i.e., reputational) and contemporaneous cross effects of its green effort on demand for the less-aggressive firm's product, as well as on the less-aggressive firm's price markup and marginal cost associated with its production and green-effort choices, respectively.","[Caplan, Arthur J.; Oladi, Reza] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Caplan, AJ (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",arthur.caplan@usu.edu,"Oladi, Reza/AAA-7218-2019","Oladi, Reza/0000-0002-4621-7622",,,,,27,5,5,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

If the threshold is sufficiently high, the agent only beats it, and is rewarded for increasing output through greater effort, if there is a high noise realization. Thus, a fall in output volatility reduces effort incentives information and effort are substitutes offsetting the standard effect that improved information lowers the cost of compensation.

In this paper, we exploit this heterogeneity to estimate the extent to which the boom was spread via spatial spillovers from one market to another. Our analysis focuses on spillovers that occur around the time that a local market enters its boom, which we identify using sharp structural breaks in house price growth rates. On the extensive margin, there is evidence that the likelihood of a market booming increases substantially if nearby neighbors boom. On the intensive margin, we also fmd statistically significant but economically modest effects of the size of a neighbor's boom on subsequent price growth in nearby markets. These affects appear to be unrelated to local market fundamentals, suggesting a potential role for non-rational factors.","[DeFusco, Anthony] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Ding, Wenjie; Ferreira, Fernando; Gyourko, Joseph] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ferreira, Fernando] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"DeFusco, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",anthony.defusco@kellogg.northwestern.edu; fferreir@wharton.upenn.edu; gyourko@wharton.upenn.edu,,,Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton,Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton,"The authors thank the Research Sponsors Program of the Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton for financial support.

These developments have sparked intense debate on the potential of RMB internationalization and its pros and cons. In view of these developments, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of the RMB in both the spot and NDF markets since 2005 by examining the role and significance of the RMB NDF in the price discovery process and in predicting the volatility dynamics of the RMB markets. The results indicate that asymmetric volatility effects are significant for several NDF contract maturities and the spot-NDF correlations are significantly time-varying. Moreover, shocks to the volatility levels are highly persistent. Causality tests on the spot and NDF volatilities further suggest that the NDF markets impact the future fluctuations of the spot market, but the spot market does not have predictive power for the volatility of the NDF markets. Public information flows are found to have a significantly positive impact on the spot-forward conditional correlations.

Beyond indigenous' prior consultation and citizen participation,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Citizen participation; Environmental Impact Assessment; Indigenous politics; Political ecology; Environmental governance; Indigenous rights,IMPACT ASSESSMENT; INFORMED-CONSENT; HUMAN-RIGHTS; PEOPLES,"Recent studies explore how participatory mechanisms such as prior consultation/consent processes and participation in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) might reinforce the mediating role of the state between social groups and companies at the same time that creates political opportunities for promoting social demands. This article problematizes these ideas by deepening the understanding of participatory mechanisms within broader environmental governance structures. The focus of the article is Peru, the first Latin American country that has passed a General Law of prior consultation for indigenous peoples, and currently is struggling to articulate this mechanism to participatory stages in ElAs. From an engagement with the literature on political ecology and development studies, this article explores the limitations of indigenous participation within an environmental governance that prioritize the promotion of investments in extractive industries. In particular, by exploring the challenges and limitations of indigenous decision-making power in new institutions for consultation and EIA participation, the article holds that participatory mechanisms themselves are unable to provide more power of decision to indigenous peoples if policy-makers translate claims for institutional transformation (related to indigenous self-determination and ecological zoning) into merely participatory provisions of specific projects. The result is a paradoxical multiplication of weak participatory channels, making the voices of local communities and indigenous peoples auditable, however, without a real compromise to translate these concerns into public policies beyond participatory processes. This study is a qualitative investigation whose data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, observation and documentary analysis. The author undertook 38 semi-structured interviews in 2016-2017 with key relevant actors (from state offices, indigenous organizations, and civil society organizations) involved in consultation processes and participation in ElAs, and documentary analysis of ElAs, reports, legal regulations and policy instruments.

It extends earlier work by measuring protection from NTMs over time from a newly available database and provides evidence on the evolution of NTMs. In particular, building on Kee et al. (Econ J 119(534):172-199, 2009), this paper estimates the ad valorem equivalents of NTMs for 97 countries at the product level over the period 1997-2015. We show that the incidence and the intensity of NTMs were both increasing over this period, with NTMs becoming an even more dominant source of trade protection. We are also able to investigate the evolution of overall protection derived jointly from tariffs and NTMs. The results show that the overall protection level, for most countries and products, has not decreased despite the fall in tariffs associated with multilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements in recent decades. We also document an increase in overall trade protection during the recent 2008 financial crisis. Overall, this study sheds light on an under-researched aspect of trade liberalization: the proliferation and increase of NTMs.","[Niu, Zhaohui] Beihang Univ, 37 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chang] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, 199 Taikang East Rd, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Gunessee, Saileshsingh] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch China, 199 Taikang East Rd, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Milner, Chris] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Beihang University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Nottingham,"Milner, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",chris.milner@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,43,45,3,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

These models emerged in the developed countries. Subsequently, the informational revolution has expanded across the globe, and contributed to the development of these new models. The sharing economy is one of them. Through technology and the internet, tools that provide instant access to information from anywhere in the world, the collaborative economy expands and grows continuously. This allows for easier interaction between people of all categories. The aim of this paper is to highlight the challenges, opportunities and benefits brought by the sharing economy regarding the national and international tourism, as well as to find out to what extent is the availability, accessibility, consumer and stakeholders' degree of acceptance towards the current technological infrastructure. The paper contains the analysis of a study case regarding the Airbnb business model, company that has been involved in the economic transition of the last years and contributed to the emergence of the sharing economy. As well, the article contains a study of collected data with regards to the distributed spaces on the company's site from 5 Romanian cities, and 5 European cities, in a certain period, statistical data regarding the online bookings made in member countries of the European Union, and data about the accommodation units in Romania, the number of overnight stays and arrivals. This research is useful for all individuals or legal entities involved in the tourism field in order to acknowledge in what way and to what extent the accommodation units in Romania are evaluated and rated. Moreover, the possible options for touristic improvement and development through the sharing economy, in terms of quality, technological infrastructure and approach are evaluated. We consider that it is important how the sharing economy impacts and influences Romania to a lesser extent, and what repercussions or changes will occur in the future.","[Onete, Cristian Bogdan; Plesea, Doru; Budz, Sonia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Onete, CB (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",bogdan.onete@com.ase.ro,"PLESEA, DORU ALEXANDRU/AAH-7798-2021; Budz, Sonia/AAG-1671-2019; Onete, Cristian Bogdan/E-6579-2017; Budz, Sonia/ISV-0711-2023","PLESEA, DORU ALEXANDRU/0000-0002-0678-0170; Budz, Sonia/0009-0008-7373-2612",,,,,48,20,21,1,88,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,998,1015,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/998,0.0,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700012,0

When herding appears, managers tend to present poor timing abilities; however, a weak herding level (a result commonly found in pension funds) may evidence a mixed scenario, where some managers develop skills, and others follow the herd. Additionally, when informational cascades emerge, some managers may act as leaders, anticipating others' movements. Nonetheless, this anticipatory skill does not mean that leaders also anticipate market movements and present timing skills. Our results show herding and inter-temporal herding in a sample of Spanish pension funds, though the imitation behavior is not strong. We also find evidence of a mixed scenario, in which some non-herding managers present timing skills, while herding funds are not able to develop these abilities. Finally, we find successful timing for certain leaders, showing that the anticipation of others' movements does not show real timing abilities.","[Alda, Mercedes] Univ Zaragoza, C Gran Via 2, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Alda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, C Gran Via 2, Zaragoza, Spain.",malda@unizar.es,,"Alda Garcia, Mercedes/0000-0002-2525-9049",,,,,52,0,0,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

These non-traditional loans, including interest-only and negative-amortization mortgages, enable households to postpone loan repayment in contrast to fully amortizing traditional mortgages. Contrary to common perception, complex mortgages are used by households with high-income levels and prime credit scores, quite unlike the low-income population targeted by subprime mortgages. Nonetheless, we find that complex-mortgage borrowers become delinquent on their mortgages at rates twice as high as borrowers with plain-vanilla fixed-rate contracts even after controlling for household and loan characteristics.

We repeatedly observe the decision making of individual professional baseball umpires, quasi-randomly assigned to varying air quality across time and space. Unique characteristics of this setting combined with high-frequency data disentangle effects of multiple pollutants and identify previously underexplored acute effects. We find that a 1 ppm increase in 3-hour CO causes an 11.5% increase in the propensity of umpires to make incorrect calls and a 10 g/m(3) increase in 12-hour PM2.5 causes a 2.6% increase. We control carefully for a variety of potential confounders, and results are supported by robustness and falsification checks.

Consistent with the model, we find that less wealthy insiders are more likely to time their insider selling, and to sell in greater magnitudes, prior to abnormal price declines than wealthy insiders. We also find that less wealthy insiders with lower risk aversion as measured by their criminal behavior are particularly prone to timing their selling to avoid price declines. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Many commercial and business districts have been planned in the areas surrounding stations. This study examines and critiques the impacts of HSR on commercial land markets in Jiangsu: a pioneering province for HSR development in China. After considering various locational and contextual factors, this study focuses specifically on how HSR stations and the frequency of train services have affected the dynamics of commercial land markets, using a spatial panel approach. The results show that the opening of HSR services has significantly impacted trade volumes, while the frequency of train services has significantly affected trade prices. Further analysis shows variation in the impacts of HSR stations and train service frequency on commercial land markets between Jiangsu's developed south and less-developed central and northern sub-regions. The findings suggest that the study of HSR impacts is sensitive to the selected spatial scale. Moreover, HSR development may not result in the creation of dynamic commercial economies for every city. Consequently, locally based policies are needed to take advantage of the transport-induced opportunities.","[Wang, Lei] Univ Manchester, Manchester Urban Inst, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Yuan, Feng; Duan, Xuejun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","University of Manchester; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Duan, XJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",lei.wang-3@manchester.ac.uk; xjduan@niglas.ac.cn,"Wang, Lei/J-3748-2019","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-8421-7244","Hallsworth Research Fellowship Fund at the University of Manchester; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China [BK20161088]","Hallsworth Research Fellowship Fund at the University of Manchester; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province)","This research is funded by Hallsworth Research Fellowship Fund at the University of Manchester and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (BK20161088).

In this paper, we prove such a combinatorial result and obtain a formula for the Shapley value that has a great potential to be extended to more general classes of games.","[Bernardi, Giulia] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Matemat, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Freixas, Josep] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Escola Politecn Super Engn Manresa, Dept Matemat, Av Bases Manresa 61-73, Barcelona 08242, Spain",Polytechnic University of Milan; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Bernardi, G (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Matemat, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",giulia.bernardi@polimi.it; josep.freixas@upc.edu,,"Bernardi, Giulia/0000-0001-7622-9790; Freixas, Josep/0000-0002-9033-9432",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO); European Union (FEDER funds) [MTM2015-66818-P],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO)(Spanish Government); European Union (FEDER funds)(European Union (EU)),The second author research was partially supported by funds from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and from the European Union (FEDER funds) under grant MTM2015-66818-P (MINECO/FEDER).,,14,6,6,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2018,176.0,3-4,,,,,557,565,,10.1007/s11127-018-0560-2,0.0,,,9,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GQ5ZF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441775600010,0

Slow economic and trade growth during the recovery from the Great Recession, as well as recent political developments in the UK and USA, pose a threat to cross-border supply chains and have thus brought this question to the forefront of policy circles. This note investigates by examining new and detailed data on Group of 20 (G20) trade policy use through 2016, with a special emphasis on changes in policymaking behavior since 2010. First, there is no evidence that the G20 economies made significant changes to their applied import tariffs during this period. However, there has been a modest increase in import protection arising through other policy instruments of note such as the temporary trade barriers (TTBs) of antidumping, countervailing duties and safeguards. More importantly, there is evidence of changes in how countries have applied their TTBs. TTBs were increasingly imposed on imports not only from China, but also on imports from other countries, reversing a post-2001 trend. Furthermore, TTB protection has moved away from imports of final goods and toward imports of intermediate inputs. These shifts in policy have several potential contributing causes as well as economic consequences, including for cross-border supply chains.","[Bown, Chad P.] CEPR, Peterson Inst Int Econ, 1750 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Peterson Institute for International Economics,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，CEPR, Peterson Inst Int Econ, 1750 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",cbown@piie.com,,"Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",,,,,30,9,9,0,12,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Variance decompositions indicate that the impact of macroeconomic variables on the term structure differs from existing models. For short maturities, inflation is relatively more important than real activity growth at short forecast horizons. For longer maturity yields, the long-run component of inflation explains most of the long-horizon forecast variance, but real activity growth matters for short forecast horizons. Unlike existing macro models, the model implies plausible term premia and expectations of short rates. The long-run components also improve the prediction of bond excess returns relative to information in the yield curve and macro variables. Measures of in-sample and out-of-sample fit confirm the benefits of allowing for long- and short-run components.","[Doshi, Hitesh; Jacobs, Kris] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Liu, Rui] Duquesne Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; Duquesne University,"Jacobs, K (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, CT Bauer Coll Business, 334 Melcher Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",kjacobs@bauer.uh.edu,,,,,,,83,1,1,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

Compared to renters, homeowners are financially invested in their communities and are less mobile. Therefore, homeowners should care more about local policies and have incentives to engage actively in local politics. The disparity in political participation between homeowners and renters, however, should diminish in presidential elections for which policy discussions are more targeted at the national-level. These hypotheses are tested using census block group-level election panel data. Fixed effects models and a control function approach are used to identify the effect of homeownership on voter turnout in off-year mayoral elections relative to presidential elections. Results show that mayoral election voter turnout increases with the local homeownership rate. This suggests that local policies may tend to cater to the tastes of homeowners over renters.","[Jiang, Boqian] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Jiang, Boqian] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University; Syracuse University,"Jiang, BQ (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.;Jiang, BQ (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",bjiang03@syr.edu,,,,,,,39,11,16,2,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

This can affect human health outcomes. For example, the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB) has led to the destruction of millions of ash trees, one of the most common tree species in the US. Since trees are an important source of air pollution sinks, EAB-caused ash dieback may affect human health through changes in air quality. The quasi-random nature of EAB detections and consequent changes in various air pollution levels allow us to analyze differences in mortality rates for individuals living in counties where the beetle has been found relative to individuals in contemporaneously beetle-free counties. Results suggest that EAB are associated with lagged increases in pollutant concentrations ranging from 9.2 to 46.2%. A 2SLS fixed effects model indicates that EAB-induced air pollution is associated with increases in rates of cardiovascular mortality of 6.2/year-32.6/year per 100,000 people and increases in respiratory mortality of 1.9/year-3.9/year per 100,000. Impacts are greatest for children and young adults. At its peak impact, EAB-induced air pollution resulted in $4.8-$21.6 billion in annual mortality costs over 2002-2014 in the 24 US states in the study area. This study has important abatement policy implications.","[Jones, Benjamin A.] Univ New Mexico, 1915 Roma Ave NE,MSC 05 3060, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [McDermott, Shana M.] Trinity Univ, Dept Econ, Chapman Ctr Room 415,One Trinity Pl, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA",University of New Mexico; Trinity University,"McDermott, SM (通讯作者)，Trinity Univ, Dept Econ, Chapman Ctr Room 415,One Trinity Pl, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA.",bajones@unm.edu; smcdermo@trinity.edu,,,,,,,42,31,35,2,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

A detailed look at Project STAR illustrates this point and offers some possible correctives. Initiated by the Tennessee legislature to help decide whether to enact state-wide class size reduction (CSR), STAR compared the test scores of students randomly assigned to classes of different size. It addressed a well-formed research question, but focused narrowly on refining a single link in a long chain of evidence necessary to address the policy question at hand: whether CSR would be a good use of a large increase in education spending. It disregarded the limitations of test scores as indicators of education quality and ignored general equilibrium effects on teacher quality and salaries. Moreover, the emphasis it placed on estimating average CSR effects in a given setting diverted attention from the heterogeneity of these effects and the conditions that mediated their impact, limiting its external validity. These observations continue to be relevant for the design of policy-oriented research, and for the academic training of empirical economists.","[Justman, Moshe] Ruppin Acad Ctr, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Emek Hefer, Israel; [Justman, Moshe] Ben Gution Univ Negev, Dept Econ, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ruppin Academic Center; Ben Gurion University,"Justman, M (通讯作者)，Ruppin Acad Ctr, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Emek Hefer, Israel.",justman@bgu.ac.il,,"Justman, Moshe/0000-0002-5455-0943",,,,,84,3,5,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Moreover, the multivariate Granger causality test and a modified version of Wald test are applied to examine the direction of the short-run and long-run causality respectively. The cointegration analysis reveals that manufactured exports contribute more to economic growth than primary exports in the long-run.

Examining the effects on test scores reveals that there is no negative later-born effect for girls among surviving children. Instead, girls seem to be consistently at an advantage if they have elder sisters. Furthermore, gender bias among primary school age children is detected only in households of larger size.

The model can also replicate the fact observed in the United States that housing prices are more volatile than output.,"[Quoc Hung Nguyen] Univ Hyogo, Sch Econ, Nishi Ku, 8-2-1 Gakuen Nshimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6512197, Japan",University of Hyogo,"Nguyen, QH (通讯作者)，Univ Hyogo, Sch Econ, Nishi Ku, 8-2-1 Gakuen Nshimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6512197, Japan.",nguyenhung@econ.u-hyogo.ac.jp,"Nguyen, Quoc Hung/IWV-2883-2023","Nguyen, Quoc Hung/0000-0003-2751-416X",,,,,11,2,2,0,8,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1051-1377,1096-0791,,J HOUS ECON,J.

Skill import may result in large-scale migration, which will not be to the liking of the natives. Skill production will require financial incentives, which will not be to the liking of the ministry of finance. In this paper we suggest a third response: impose a substantial migration admission fee, import fee-paying workers regardless of their skills, and use the revenue from the fee to subsidize the acquisition of the required skills by the natives. We calculate the minimal fee that will remedy the shortage of workers with particular skills with fewer migrants than under the skill import policy.

The paper presents a novel explanation of order effects, relating to attention and novelty. Typically, multiple valuation tasks for consumer goods use the same good for valuation in each task. In this experiment the type of good valued in each task is varied, allowing two potential mechanisms to be disentangled: experimental novelty effects, whereby participants become less interested with completing later tasks, and good-specific novelty effects, whereby participants become less interested with the goods used in later tasks. The results find a particular importance of the first task; goods in the first task are valued significantly higher than later valued goods, evidence of experimental novelty effects, and goods of a similar type to the good in the first task are valued significantly higher than goods of a different type to the first, evidence of good-specific novelty. The paper discusses the potential implications of these findings.","[Belton, Cameron A.] Econ & Social Res Inst, Sir John Rogersons Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Sugden, Robert] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Ctr Behav & Expt Social Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); University of East Anglia,"Sugden, R (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Ctr Behav & Expt Social Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",cameron.belton@esri.ie; r.sugden@uea.ac.uk,"Sugden, Robert/B-1153-2012","Sugden, Robert/0000-0002-3401-3139; Belton, Cameron/0000-0002-7344-250X",Centre for Behavioural and Experimental Social Science (CBESS); University of East Anglia,Centre for Behavioural and Experimental Social Science (CBESS); University of East Anglia,The authors would like to give thanks to the Centre for Behavioural and Experimental Social Science (CBESS) and the University of East Anglia for financial support.

That is, there is a potential to sharing this risk ex-ante across regions and hence to reduce the welfare-economic costs of these risks. We analyze how climate risks could be reduced via an insurance scheme at the global scale across regions and quantify the potential welfare gains. We introduce risk sharing of global climate risk represented by the equilibrium climate sensitivity, and introduce an asset-based insurance scheme to allow for risk sharing across regions. We estimate that such risk sharing scheme could lead to welfare gains reducing the global costs of climate change by up to 15%. Such a scheme implies transfers of about USD 200 billion per year and faces important implementation challenges. The results provide a motivation for the loss and damage mechanism related negotiations about sharing risks of climate change at the global level.","[Emmerling, Johannes] FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Emmerling, Johannes] CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Emmerling, J (通讯作者)，FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.;Emmerling, J (通讯作者)，CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",johannes.emmerling@cmcc.it,"EMMERLING, Johannes/K-8283-2019","EMMERLING, Johannes/0000-0003-0916-9913","European Union Seventh Framework Programme [266992, 282846]",European Union Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"I would like to thank Valentina Bosetti, Per Krusell, Simon Dietz, and participants at the FEEM/CMCC Convention 2013 in Venice, at the IAERE Annual Conference 2014 in Milan, and at IEW2014 in Beijing for very helpful comments.

A general equilibrium overlapping generations model with endogenous decisions on fertility, educational investment, and factor accumulation is employed for our analysis. The family support provided by children to the elderly, which is a component of traditional culture in Chinese society, is also considered. We find that technological changes matter most for growth. Demographic changes, on average, account for approximately 4% of the growth in China, while the effect is negative in the pre-1980 period. With an extension to include population aging, we find that aging is not necessarily adverse to growth. This finding reflects the fact that a longer life expectancy requires more savings and makes educational investment in children more attractive, which accelerates physical capital and human capital accumulation. However, if the social norm of family support for aging parents is strict, aging will significantly increase the children's burden and crowd out physical and human capital accumulation.","[Hsu, Minchung] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Liao, Pei-Ju] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Zhao, Min] World Bank Beijing Off, Beijing, Peoples R China",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; National Taiwan University; The World Bank,"Hsu, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",minchunghsu@gmail.com,"Liao, Pei-Ju/M-2351-2018","Liao, Pei-Ju/0000-0003-4559-6322","GRIPS Policy Research Center; Nomura Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI; National Science Council [20467062, 16KK0052, 17H02537, NSC 100-2410-H-001-026-MY2]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16KK0052, 17H02537] Funding Source: KAKEN","GRIPS Policy Research Center; Nomura Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","GRIPS Policy Research Center; Nomura Foundation; JSPS KAKENHI; National Science Council, Grant/Award Number: 20467062; 16KK0052; 17H02537; NSC 100-2410-H-001-026-MY2",,28,17,18,5,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In this paper, we focus on lotteries with negative expected value and study if (and how) risky choices made on behalf of another person differ i) compared to decisions which do not affect anyone else, and ii) depending on the social distance between who makes the decision and who is affected by it. Our results show that social distance (i.e., whether the person affected by one's decision is an unknown stranger or a friend) is an important determinant when people decide on behalf of others. Moreover, when deciding on behalf of a friend rather than only for themselves or a stranger, average individual behavior is closer to expected value maximization, exhibiting less risk taking. These findings suggest that responsibility for others' outcome and the empathy gap affect the decision making process, particularly when the social distance is shortened. The results are robust to different feedback frequencies. Controlling for order effects shows that experiencing a decrease in social distance is crucial in activating this mechanism.","[Montinari, Natalia] Univ Bologna, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Rancan, Michela] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",University of Bologna; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Montinari, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",natalia.montinari2@unibo.it; michela.rancan@ec.europa.eu,,,"Max Planck Institute (Jena, Germany); Handelsbanken (Stockholm, Sweden)","Max Planck Institute (Jena, Germany); Handelsbanken (Stockholm, Sweden)","We would like to thank the Editorial Board of the Journal and two anonymous referees for very useful and constructive comments.

This article argues that a performativity approach allows us to understand identity in ways that are important for adaptation. Performativity sees identity as constructed through practices in an ongoing process of negotiation and renegotiation. Individuals and groups can thus be understood as having the agency to redefine identity by changing their everyday practices; changed practices, in turn, can influence the construction of identity. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted with pastoral and agro-pastoral livestock keepers in West Pokot County, Kenya, the article focuses on one set of identity-linked and adaptation-relevant practices: those involved in ensuring that livestock receive water regularly. Practices of livestock keeping reveal how identity is both implicated by and constructs the social context - between and within individuals, families, and communities, but also in relation to livestock and wider biophysical phenomena. By focusing on the changing practices of livestock watering within a changing social and biophysical context, it is possible to extract not only normative practices, but also a number of practices that disturb settled patterns, contesting or resisting identity constructs. This agency to change practices and identity has important implications for adaptation, which also requires changes in practice and behaviour. As this diversity and fluidity of identity as constructed and practised in the present emerges, so do the different ideas of what it can and will mean to be a livestock keeper in relation to the contextual challenges of today and the future.

The large deviation between the two drastically weakens the power of these tests. This paper proposes to use analysts consensus price target for a stock as the market expectation of the stock's future price to directly construct the stock's expected excess return. Analyzing the expected excess return behavior both over time and across different stocks shows that classic asset pricing theory works much better on ex ante return expectations than on ex post realizations. The analysis also provides new insights on the pricing of common equity risk factors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we expand our understanding of this form of pro-social behavior to help explain a puzzle of voting: why do individuals who are indifferent between two potential policy outcomes of an election participate when voting is costly? Using a simple voting experiment, we provide robust evidence that many voters are willing to engage in voting as a form of punishment, even when voting is costly and the voter has no monetary stake in the election outcome. In our sample, and in a robustness check through Monte Carlo simulation, we show that at least fourteen percent of individuals are willing to incur a cost to vote against candidates who broke their electoral promises, even when they have no pecuniary interest in the election outcome.","[Aimone, Jason A.] Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Butera, Luigi] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Stratmann, Thomas] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Baylor University; University of Chicago; George Mason University,"Aimone, JA (通讯作者)，Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",Jason_Aimone@baylor.edu; lbutera2@gmail.com; tstratma@gmu.edu,,,Mercatus Center at George Mason University,Mercatus Center at George Mason University,Financial support from The Mercatus Center at George Mason University is gratefully acknowledged.,,54,4,4,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Specifically, we examine the effects of sanitation coverage and usage on child height for age in a semi-urban setting in Northern India. Although sanitation - broadly defined as hygienic means of promoting health through prevention of human contact with the hazards of wastes, particularly human waste - has long been acknowledged as an indispensable element of disease prevention and primary health care programmes, a large number of recent impact evaluation studies on sanitation interventions in low income countries fail to find any health improvements. We address endogeneity of sanitation coverage through an instrumental variable approach, exploiting variation in raw material construction prices. Doing so, we find that sanitation coverage plays a significant and positive role in height growth during the first years of life and that this causal relationship holds particularly for girls. Our findings suggest that a policy that aims to increase sanitation coverage in a context such as the one studied here, is not only effective in reducing child stunting but also implicitly targets girls.

This paper investigates the incentives and consequences underlying this recent shift toward country- or theme-specific funding and away from bilateral and multilateral aid. We propose a game-theoretic model with multiple principals and a multilateral agent to study how the interaction between donor preferences, voter concerns in the donor country, the voting rules at the multilateral organization, and the presence of special purpose trust funds influences aid allocation. We show that multilateral organizations with majority rules are more likely to receive discretion and thus voluntary core contributions than those with unanimity requirements and that the possibility of earmarking multilateral aid decreases donors' contributions to the multilateral's discretionary core budget and the amount of bilateral aid. In contrast to much of the literature dealing with issues of delegation and bi- and multilateral aid, our model suggests non-monotonic effects of preference heterogeneity on the choice of aid channel for some parameter combinations when contributions to special purpose trust funds are an option.","[Eichenauer, Vera Z.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hug, Simon] Univ Geneva, Fac Sci Soc, Dept Sci Polit & Relat Int, Geneva, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Geneva,"Hug, S (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Fac Sci Soc, Dept Sci Polit & Relat Int, Geneva, Switzerland.",simon.hug@unige.ch,,"Eichenauer, Vera Z./0000-0002-0440-3136; Hug, Simon/0000-0002-7741-2201",Swiss Network for International Studies,Swiss Network for International Studies,Swiss Network for International Studies,,63,10,10,0,13,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Drawing empirical data from two drought-prone districts in Northeastern Ethiopia (Kobo and Raya Azebo), this article deals with the differentiated effects of planned adaptation, exemplified by Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP). Two layers of differentiating effects are studied by looking at the differences between households that are and households that are not targeted by PSNP; and the more detailed differences are explored by zooming in on male and female-headed households, respectively, within the subset of households targeted by PSNP. We use semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with female and male household heads and key informant interviews with government officials. Our study indicates that the interplay has a differentiated effect following the participation of households in planned adaptation programs and gender lines. We show that the effect on building community assets can be positive at the community level and expands autonomous adaptation particularly for non-targeted households; however, targeted households in general and female-headed households in particular experience a negative effect of the interplay: planned adaptation constrains autonomous adaptation due to time and labor demands of public work, program restrictions and local gender norms.

Prior work on biological pollution problems generally examines the efficient allocation of prevention and control efforts, but does not identify the specific externalities underpinning the design of efficiency-enhancing policy instruments. Prior analyses also focus on problems where those being damaged do not contribute to externalities. We examine a problem where the initial biological introduction harms the importer and then others are harmed by spread from this importer. Here, the externality is the spread of infection beyond the initial importer. This externality is influenced by the importer's private risk management choices, which provide impure public goods that reduce disease spillovers to others-making disease spread a filterable externality. We derive efficient policy incentives to internalize filterable disease externalities given uncertainties about introduction and spread. We find efficiency requires incentivizing an importer's trade choices along with self-protection and abatement efforts, in contrast to prior work that targets trade alone. Perhaps surprisingly, we find these incentives increase with importers' private risk management incentives and with their ability to directly protect others. In cases where importers can spread infection to each other, we find filterable externalities may lead to multiple Nash equilibria.","[Reeling, Carson] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Reeling, Carson] Western Michigan Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Horan, Richard D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Western Michigan University; Western Michigan University; Michigan State University,"Reeling, C (通讯作者)，Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.;Reeling, C (通讯作者)，Western Michigan Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",carson.reeling@wmich.edu,,"Reeling, Carson/0000-0002-6203-0649","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health [2011-67023-30872, 1R01GM100471-01]; NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program [1414374]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1414374] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health; NSF as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant #2011-67023-30872, Grant #1R01GM100471-01 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health, and NSF Grant #1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program.

Understanding the truncated agrarian transition in Thailand",WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rural development; Agrarian transition; Smallholders; Precarity; Asia; Thailand,FUTURE; LAND; SIZE; ASIA,"Drawing on rural field research in three provinces of Northeast Thailand, the paper seeks to understand the ways in which life course, generational, era-defining and developmental change intersect, and why rural smallholders and smallholdings continue to persist notwithstanding deep structural change. We outline the creative ways that households and their members have sought to address the scissor effects of declining land holdings, rising needs, reduced relative returns to agriculture, and often precarious non-farm work. We posit, drawing on this work from Thailand, that while Asia's 'truncated agrarian transition' goes some way to explaining the current empirical fact of persistent smallholders, we raise doubts whether the rural development agenda of modernisation, marketisation and rural exit will have the traction that governments and some scholars anticipate. A focus on production obscures how rural livelihoods also embody acts of consumption, care, reproduction and redistribution. Our study finds that the current experience of occupational multiplicity where households' livelihoods comprise farm and non-farm, commoditised and quasi-subsistence, in situ and ex situ, production and care, and reproduction and redistribution will likely also persist, if non-farm occupations remains classically precarious and social safety nets thinly woven. The paper contributes to debates over agrarian and rural livelihood transitions in Asia, and sheds explanatory light on why the farm-size transition has not taken hold. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The firms' investment dynamics is computed as the growth rate of fixed assets. Our results obtained using static and dynamic estimators, show that both external and internal conditions influence the firms' investment decision. The inflation uncertainty has a positive and significant impact on investment, providing evidence in the favor of the growth-option theory. The liquidity has a positive and significant influence, while the impact of the leverage and economic growth uncertainty is significant only under the dynamic specification.

We combine observed income with predicted income to create four categories of households: income & asset poor (structurally poor), income rich & asset poor (stochastically non-poor), income poor & asset rich (stochastically poor) and income & asset rich (structurally non-poor), and assess exposure and vulnerability across these groups. The income poor are more exposed to extreme climate conditions. They tend to live in dryer (and hotter) villages in the dry forest zones, in wetter villages in the wet zones, and experience larger rainfall fluctuations. Among the income-generating coping strategies, extracting more environmental resources ranks second to seeking wage labor. The poorest in dry regions also experience the highest forest loss, undermining the opportunities to cope with future climate shocks.","[Angelsen, Arild; Dokken, Therese] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway; [Angelsen, Arild] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Angelsen, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway.;Angelsen, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia.",arild.angelsen@nmbu.no,,"Angelsen, Arild/0000-0002-6037-6849",,,,,37,40,40,0,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Risk aversion is stochastic and depends nonlinearly on consumption and beliefs. Equilibrium is obtained in closed form. The market price of risk, the interest rate, and the stock return volatility acquire new components tied to fluctuations in beliefs. A three-regime specification is estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM). Model moments match their empirical counterparts for a variety of unconditional moments, including the equity premium, stock returns volatility, and the correlations between stock returns and consumption and dividends. Dynamic features of the data, such as the countercyclical behaviors of the equity premium and volatility, are also captured. Model volatility provides a good fit for realized volatility. A new factor, the information risk premium, is found to be a strong predictor of future excess returns. These results are obtained with an estimated risk aversion fluctuating between 1.44 and 1.93.

Evidence from rural Mali,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gender; Inequality; Empowerment; Public opinion; Political knowledge; Family Code,GENDER-GAP; PARTICIPATION; IMPACT; HOUSEHOLD; DEMOCRATIZATION; REPRESENTATION; ENGAGEMENT; NETWORKS; AFRICA; LABOR,"According to many prominent theorists of democracy, citizens must be able to formulate and signify preferences to participate as 'political equals' for democracy to work (Dahl, 1971). However, a gender gap in political knowledge and opinions exists across the Global South, especially in rural areas. In this paper, we study the relationship between rural women's socioeconomic empowerment (household agency and mobility outside the village) and political knowledge and opinions in Mali, a West African country with patriarchal gender norms. To reduce well-known difficulties of gaining access to rural women and reducing bystander effects, we use simultaneous co-gender interviews of one man and one woman per extended family household and a modified Audio-Self-Administered Questionnaire for illiterate populations. Further to reduce satisficed opinions, we elicit opinion justifications and measure justified opinions. Consistent with predictions, we find that women's empowerment is positively associated with rural women's political knowledge and opinions. We close by examining opinions towards one controversial policy area with redistributive consequences for men and women-the Family Code, which regulates rights of men and women in marriage, inheritance, and the family. More empowered women are more likely to support pro-woman changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we distinguish two archetypal institutional settings, a centralized and a confederal one, and argue that bureaucrats in a centralized setting are able to increase the fiscal residual. Our empirical test case is the German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt. We test the effect of the institutional setup using the bootstrap approach suggested by Simar and Wilson (2007), concluding that a decentralized institutional setting improves the efficiency of municipal production.","[Boenisch, Peter; Haug, Peter] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Kleine Markerstr 8, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Bönisch, P (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Kleine Markerstr 8, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",peteboe@aol.com; peter.haug@iwh-halle.de,,,,,,,83,1,1,1,12,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,JUN,2018,74.0,2,,,,,260,291,,10.1628/fa-2018-0008,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN5CG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439061300004,0

The focus is on the allocation of self-employed individuals with different skill levels across sectors-primary, secondary and tertiary-and on its link to selectivity corrected returns to skills in these sectors. While self-employment is dominated by service sector activities and these activities attract more skilled individuals than do the manufacturing and primary sectors, the level of skills across all three entrepreneurial sectors is lower than that of both salaried workers and individuals who do not work. Returns to skills among self-employed individuals in the manufacturing sector are particularly low. This is at least partially explained by constraints to productive entrepreneurial activities and is inconsistent with the idea of smooth structural transformation towards innovative entrepreneurship. We discuss some conceptual and policy implications.","[Dimova, Ralitza; Pela, Kevwe] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Dimova, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England.",Ralitza.Dimova@manchester.ac.uk,,"Dimova, Ralitza/0000-0001-5977-0446; Pela, Kevwe/0000-0002-5948-9571",,,,,44,10,13,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

It uses a large-scale dataset collected through a web-based travel diary survey among all students of four universities (seven campuses) in Toronto. Multinomial logit (MNL), nested logit (NL) and cross-nested logit (CNL) models are used for investigating home to school trips mode choices. In terms of goodness-of-fit, the CNL outperforms the MNL and NL model. Furthermore, the proposed CNL model shows fundamental improvements over the MNL and NL models by capturing non-proportional substitution patterns. Empirical models reveal that the mode choice behaviour of female students who travel to downtown campuses differ significantly from female students who travel to suburban campuses. Female students who travel towards downtown are more transit and active mode oriented than those who travel towards outside of downtown. This study also shows mobility tool ownerships (i.e., transit pass, car and bike ownership) and age groups have distinctive influences on student's mode choice behaviour. Using the CNL model as a tool for policy scenario analysis, it is found that public transit users are highly sensitive to changes in travel time. In the context of policy implementation, if bike and ride mode is encouraged during peak hour commuting, there is likely a large amount of latent demand for this mode.","[Hasnine, Md Sami; Lin, TianYang; Weiss, Adam; Habib, Khandker Nurul] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada",University of Toronto,"Habib, KN (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",khandker.nurulhabib@utoronto.ca,"HASNINE, MD SAMI/GQR-4878-2022","Hasnine, Md Sami/0000-0003-4110-5047",NSERC,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"The study was partially funded by an NSERC Discovery grant.

Relying on a single source of income imposes a barrier to leaving an abusive relationship. Women with higher human capital are better equipped to leave a relationship, which allows them to tolerate less violence in a relationship. Using a California health survey dataset, we found that more educated women were less likely to experience spousal violence. We used the detailed nature of the data to control for commonly omitted variables such as adverse childhood experiences. In addition, we found that the effect of education on intimate partner violence varied by nativity (US-born vs. foreign-born) and was smaller for foreign-born women. Drawing from the literature on the returns to education by race, we hypothesized that foreign-born women have a lower return on human capital, which in turn moderated the effect of education on household bargaining power.","[Henke, Alexander] Howard Univ, Dept Econ, 2400 Sixth St NW, Washington, DC 20059 USA; [Hsu, Lin-chi] 1802 Wyoming Ave NW, Washington, DC 20009 USA",Howard University,"Hsu, LC (通讯作者)，1802 Wyoming Ave NW, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",linchi07@uw.edu; henkearuw@gmail.com,"Hsu, Lin-chi/ABH-3541-2020; Henke, Alexander/AAD-4121-2022","Hsu, Lin-chi/0000-0002-8044-2997; Henke, Alexander/0000-0003-3584-1718",,,,,38,4,7,1,32,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

We use heterogeneous panel cointegration methods and bank interest rates for four different loan categories: small and large firm loans, housing loans and consumer loans. We find that interest rate pass-through is complete only for small firm loans; it is thus incomplete for other loan categories. Our results suggest that while interest rate pass-through has been weakened by higher sovereign credit risk, the European Central Bank's balance sheet policies helped curb these adverse effects on pass-through. Lower financial market fragmentation translated into lower lending rates.

Revisiting sites and services projects in Mumbai and Chennai 20 years later,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sites and services; Affordable housing; Urban expansion; Inclusive cities; Asia; India,,"Twenty years after the sites and services approach was largely abandoned by the World Bank, new evidence from India demonstrates that the projects were largely successful and achieved many sought after urban planning goals. Drawing on field visits, semi-structured interviews with residents and project officials, archival research and spatial analysis, we found that sites and service projects in Chennai and Mumbai had transformed into bustling and thriving communities over the last two decades. Contrary to past critiques, the incremental housing approach - where small serviced plots are developed and sold to low income households - had worked. This unique land product is not typically available in the formal sector and helped to broaden access to the housing market. However, the bigger success to emerge from these projects, is the creation of well-planned and well-serviced neighborhoods that are both livable and inclusive. This occurred because the incremental development process was coupled with neighborhood planning and the integration of mixed income households. Key design innovations included incorporating a range of plot sizes to reach different income groups, increasing density, developing a hierarchy of road and open space layouts, incorporating mixed use by allocating space for commerce and social services, and strategically selecting sites for connectivity to transport and economic activity. Lessons from these projects offer valuable tools and insights for planners as they guide growth to create more inclusive and livable cities.

We consider this issue from two perspectives. First, by decomposing, examining, and breaking down the overall gender wage gap, we fend that 2-14% of the overall gender wage gap during this period can be attributed to workers' industry affiliation. Second, through the analysis of the gender wage gap across industries in Taiwan, we notice that the financial industry is the most monetarily advantageous industry for women during the past 15 years based on the interindustry ranking approach. The wage level for women in the financial industry was only 3-20% below that of men, compared to 15-93% for women in the mining industry. A cross country comparison with the results from the literature suggests that the range of the interindustry gender wage gap in Taiwan is larger than that in the U.S. The financial industry is more likely to rank the highest (with a smaller gender wage gap) in Taiwan, while ranking the lowest in the U.S. labor market.","[Chuang, Hwei-Lin; Lin, Eric S.] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Chiu, Shih-Yung] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Ctr Learning Assessment Serv CLASS, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University; National Tsing Hua University,"Chiu, SY (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Ctr Learning Assessment Serv CLASS, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",hlchuang@mx.nthu.edu.tw; slin@mx.nthu.edu.tw; sychiu@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

We explore how both sources influence facility fees and the price of the service offered by downstream carriers. Travelers' costs include a fare, a transportation cost to the facility and a schedule delay cost. The interactions in the facility-carrier model are represented as a sequential three-stage game in fees, times and fares. Duopolistic competition leads to an identical departure time across carriers when their operating costs do not vary with the time of day, but generally leads to distinct service times when this cost is time-dependent. We also find that higher per-passenger commercial revenue at one facility induces a lower fee charged by both facilities to their carrier and a lower fare charged by both carriers at their departure facility, while a lower marginal operating cost for one carrier implies a higher fee at its departure facility, a lower fee at the rival carrier's facility and a lower fare at both facilities. Finally, we show that the socially optimal schedule differentiation decreases in the distance between facilities and in the unit transportation cost incurred by travelers, and increases in the unit schedule delay cost incurred by travelers as well as in the marginal time cost faced by carriers.","[de Palma, Andre] Ecole Normale Super Paris Saclay, Paris, France; [Criado, Carlos Ordas] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Randrianarisoa, Laingo M.] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Universite Paris Saclay; Laval University; University of British Columbia,"Criado, CO (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",carlos.ordas@ecn.ulaval.ca,"sihite, janfry/B-2951-2015","Ordas Criado, Carlos/0009-0004-9333-7522; Randrianarisoa, Laingo M./0000-0003-1985-3559",Laval University,Laval University,"We are very grateful to two anonymous referees and to the editor of the journal for their insightful and perceptive comments that significantly improved the paper.

This raises a more general question about the relationship between reasoning and spontaneous intentions, including in the individual case. I show that the tension need not arise in accounts that separate intentions from intentionality, as they can deny spontaneous intentions while retaining spontaneous intentionality in both the individual and the collective case. However, individual reasoning is a special case in the team reasoning model and spontaneous individual intentions are plausible, so it would be advantageous for team reasoning theorists to be able to account for spontaneous intentions in the collective case. In order to do this, we need to show how spontaneous intentions are compatible with reasoning. I consider how reasoning is understood in philosophy, economics, and cognitive science, and I show how spontaneous collective intentions can be reconciled on at least some accounts of what it is to do reasoning, which are compatible with the way reasoning is used in the team reasoning literature. I argue that we should think of team reasoning as a computational-level model, as used in cognitive science. I draw on research from philosophy of computation, and show how, on some theories, the view of reasoning as computation has sympathetic implications for theories of group agency, as it would allow that groups can be reasoners.","[Gold, Natalie] Univ Oxford, Fac Philosophy, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Gold, N (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Fac Philosophy, Oxford, England.",natalie.gold@rocketmail.com,,"Gold, Natalie/0000-0003-0706-1618",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant [283849]; European Research Council (ERC) [283849] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),Work on this paper was supported by funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant Agreement n. 283849.,,81,3,3,0,2,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We also examine whether the time-varying relations can be linked to two dimensions: fundamental economic factors and stock market uncertainty. The empirical results show that the short-term and long-term dependencies between stocks and bonds do vary over time. In addition, the relations between stock and bond returns have positive sign sensitivity to the short rate and the slope of term structure, while their sensitivity to stock market volatility is negative. Moreover, the impact of crises on the long-term stock-bond relation is significantly negative but the impact on short-term relation is significantly positive. Overall, the fundamental economic factors which drive the stock-bond relations do not vary across time frequencies; however, the impacts of crises do vary across the time frequencies. The findings have economic implications to help investors determine their portfolio allocations. Furthermore, these results also help policy makers monitor the financial markets and adjust the macroeconomic policies by observing changes in these state variables.","[Lin, Fu-Lai] Da Yeh Univ, Dept Finance, Dacun, Changhua, Taiwan; [Yang, Sheng-Yung] Providence Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Yang, Sheng-Yung] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, 145 Xingda Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Marsh, Terry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Marsh, Terry] Quantal Int Inc, San Francisco, CA USA; [Chen, Yu-Fen] Da Yeh Univ, Dept Business Adm, Dacun, Changhua, Taiwan",Da Yeh University; Providence University - Taiwan; National Chung Hsing University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Da Yeh University,"Yang, SY (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, 145 Xingda Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan.",fllin@mail.dyu.edu.tw; shengyang@nchu.edu.tw; terry.marsh@quantal.com; yfchen@mail.dyu.edu.tw,"Lin, Fu-Lai/AAI-2907-2020",,,,,,46,30,31,3,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Tourism, as an economic branch with strong dynamics in recent years, is one of the areas where resource conservation and environmental protection are of significant importance. Circular tourism, derived from the principles of circular economy, aims at recycling tourism resources and favoring the sustainable development of the environment, thus giving tourists a greater sense of responsibility. The authors sought to study the influence of the implementation of integrated quality-environment-security systems on the economic performance of hotel establishments in Romania from the perspective of industry managers, as a starting point for determining the applicability of the principles of circular economy in this sector. In order to study this influence, questionnaires were addressed to tourism operators in order to establish the existing link between the implementation of ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards and the economic, social and environmental performance of those operators. From the perspective of the systemic approach and analyzing the obtained data, the authors of the paper argue that the hotel industry in Romania is not yet sufficiently prepared to adopt the principles of the circular economy, the adoption of an integrated management system not having as much influence as believed on the performances of the operators in the field.","[Pamfilie, Rodica; Croitoru, Adina-Gabriela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Firoiu, Daniela; Ionescu, George Horia Ioan] Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Croitoru, AG (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",adina_gc@yahoo.com,"Firoiu, Daniela/ABE-1940-2020; Ionescu, George Horia/W-2079-2019","Firoiu, Daniela/0000-0003-2498-457X; Ionescu, George Horia/0000-0002-3149-2517",,,,,19,35,36,9,55,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,388,404,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/388,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN9XV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439567500011,0

These limitations are obvious in the following areas: resource exploitation, environment, economic added value of a unit of consumed resource, and also on the labour market. Under these circumstances, the circular economy model, which provides feasible solutions for all of these areas where the linear economic model shows its limitations, becomes an alternative to be taken into account. Although these challenges are global in nature, it is obvious that a functional global circular economy can be built incrementally starting from the interconnection of national circular economies that rely on interconnected regional circular economies. Using this hypothesis, in this paper we propose an indicator that can be used for a multi-criteria evaluation of the potential for developing a circular economy at national level, for the case of Romania. Our proposed approach allows the assessment of the county's potential based on a six-dimensional indicator and on 16 individual variables, built on a methodology similar to the one used for the indicator measuring the potential of an economy to attract foreign direct investment proposed by UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) in WIR2012 (World Investment Report 2012). Thus, using the 16 variables collected for the period 2008-2014, the circular economy potential indicator was calculated based on the NIS and NTRO databases. Among the most important empirical results are the identification of the concentration poles, which, in 2014, are represented by the city of Bucharest and by the counties: Braila, Constanta, Mures, Alba, Sibiu and Maramures and the identification of areas with low potential, which are Oltenia, Muntenia and the central and north-eastern area of Moldova.","[Strat, Vasile Alecsandru; Teodor, Cristian; Saseanu, Andreea Simona] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Teodor, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cristian_teodor84@yahoo.ro,"Saseanu, Andreea/AAL-1437-2021; Strat, Vasile/AAS-3578-2021","Strat, Vasile/0000-0002-5074-1419; Saseanu, Andreea Simona/0000-0002-8553-6191",,,,,25,12,12,2,24,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,278,293,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/278,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN9XV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439567500004,0

However, limited efforts have been made to reveal the spatial variations of multi-modal public ridership (such as buses, metro systems, and taxis) and the underlying controlling factors. This study explores multi-modal public ridership and compares the similarities and differences of the associated factors. Daily bus, metro, and taxi ridership patterns are first extracted from multiple sources of big transportation data, including vehicle (bus and taxi) GPS trajectories and smart card data. Multivariate regression analysis and geographically weighted regression analysis are used to reveal the associations between these data and demographic, land use, and transportation factors. An empirical study in Shenzhen, China, suggests that employment, mixed land use, and road density have significant effects on the ridership of each mode; however, some effects vary from negative to positive across the city. The results also indicate that road density, income, and metro accessibility do not have significant effects on metro, transit or bus ridership. These findings suggest that the effects of the associated factors vary depending on the mode of travel being considered and that the city should carefully consider which factors to emphasize in formulating future transport policy.","[Tu, Wei; Yue, Yang; Zhou, Baoding; Li, Qingquan] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Informat Smart Sensing &, Res Inst Smart Cities, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Tu, Wei; Yue, Yang; Zhou, Baoding; Li, Qingquan] Shenzhen Univ, Natl Adm Surveying Mapping & GeoInformat, Key Lab Geoenvironm Monitoring Coastal Zone, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Qingquan] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Cao, Rui] Univ Nottingham, Int Doctoral Innovat Ctr, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Qiuping] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Ctr Integrated Geog Informat Anal, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Wuhan University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Sun Yat Sen University,"Tu, W (通讯作者)，Shenzhen Univ, Room 1402,Sci & Technol Bldg,3688 Nanhai Ave, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",tuwei@szu.edu.cn,"Yue, Yang/AAE-1652-2019; JIN, LIYING/JFB-1980-2023; TU, Wei/H-4073-2014; Cao, Rui/AAL-3946-2020","Yue, Yang/0000-0001-6934-2357; TU, Wei/0000-0002-0255-4037; Cao, Rui/0000-0002-1440-4175; Li, Qingquan/0000-0002-2438-6046","National Science Foundation of China [41401444, 91546106]; Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program [JCYJ20170412105839839, CXZZ20150504141623042]; open fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources [KF-2016-02-009, KF-2016-02-010]; Tsinghua University Open Fund for Urban Transformation Research [K-17014-01]; International Doctoral Innovation Centre; Ningbo Education Bureau; Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau; University of Nottingham; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L015463/1]","National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program; open fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources; Tsinghua University Open Fund for Urban Transformation Research; International Doctoral Innovation Centre; Ningbo Education Bureau; Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau; University of Nottingham; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China (#41401444, #91546106), Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program (#JCYJ20170412105839839, #CXZZ20150504141623042), the open fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources (#KF-2016-02-009, #KF-2016-02-010), and the Tsinghua University Open Fund for Urban Transformation Research: [#K-17014-01], the International Doctoral Innovation Centre, Ningbo Education Bureau, Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau, the University of Nottingham, and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [#EP/L015463/1].",,49,131,145,25,294,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

However, being often very subtle and covert, nudges are also criticized as unethical. By not being transparent about the intention to influence individual choice they might be perceived as limiting freedom of autonomous actions and decisions. So far, empirical research on this issue is scarce. In this study, we investigate whether nudges can be made transparent without limiting their effectiveness. For this purpose we conduct a laboratory experiment where we nudge contributions to carbon emission reduction by introducing a default value. We test how different types of transparency (i.e. knowledge of the potential influence of the default, its purpose, or both) influence the effect of the default. Our findings demonstrate that the default increases contributions, and information on the potential influence, its purpose, or both combined do not significantly influence the default effect. Furthermore, we do not find evidence that psychological reactance interacts with the influence of transparency. Findings support the policy-relevant claim that nudges (in the form of defaults) can be transparent and yet effective.","[Bruns, Hendrik] Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Bruns, Hendrik] Univ Hamburg, Welckerstr 8, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Kantorowicz-Reznichenko, Elena] Erasmus Univ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Klement, Katharina] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, D-07737 Jena, Germany; [Jonsson, Marijane Luistro] Stockholm Sch Econ, POB 6501, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Rahali, Bilel] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, INRA, Grenoble INP,GAEL, F-38000 Grenoble, France",Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Stockholm School of Economics; INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Bruns, H (通讯作者)，Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",hendrik.bruns@wiso.uni-hamburg.de; reznichenko@law.eur.nl; KatharinaKlement@web.de; marijane.jonsson@hhs.se; bilel.rahali@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,"Bruns, Hendrik/W-3362-2019; Bruns, Hendrik/AAC-7842-2022","Rahali, Bilel/0000-0002-8339-4089; Bruns, Hendrik/0000-0003-4301-0009; Kantorowicz-Reznichenko, Elena/0000-0001-8128-7290","ESL Innovation Program, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands; Graduate School of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Hamburg, Germany","ESL Innovation Program, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands; Graduate School of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Hamburg, Germany","This work was supported by the ESL Innovation Program, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands, as well as the Graduate School of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Hamburg, Germany.

Using a data set of more than 14.5 million customer product reviews on Amazon.com from 2004 through 2015, I find evidence that consumer opinions contain information for stock pricing. A spread portfolio that is long on stocks with high abnormal customer ratings and short on stocks with low abnormal customer ratings delivers an abnormal return of around 55.7 to 73.0 basis points per month. There is no evidence of return reversals in the subsequent year. The return predictability of customer ratings continues to hold after controlling for firm characteristics such as gross profitability, advertising, research and development expenses, and trading volume. Furthermore, abnormal customer ratings positively predict revenues and earnings surprises. These results suggest that consumer opinions contain novel information about firms' fundamentals and stock pricing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we examine the relationship between the loan description written by a borrower and whether or not the project is funded by investors. Using textual analysis, we find that small business loan descriptions can be used to predict the likelihood that the loan will be funded. We also find that an index, created from a textual analysis of the words used in the loan description, can forecast the performance of the loan, specifically whether or not the loan defaults. This index has the strongest impact when we focus on borrowers with low FICO scores, suggesting that for these individuals the description can signal information that standard measures used for lending purposes cannot.

This paper takes a case study valley from Nepal's eastern hills, tracing over two centuries of agrarian change and evolving interactions between adivasi and semi-feudal economic formations with capitalism. In recent years, the expansion of markets, rising demand for cash, and climate stress have solidified migrant labour as a core component of livelihoods, and the primary mechanism of surplus appropriation from the hill peasantry. Through a focus on three altitudinal zones, however, it is demonstrated how the trajectory of this transformation, including the interactions with persisting pre-capitalist formations, is mediated by both political-economic processes and the local agro-ecological context.","[Sugden, Fraser] Univ Birmingham, Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Seddon, David] Crit Fac, 57 Paragon Pl, London SE3 0SP, England; [Raut, Manita] Int Water Management Inst, GPO Box 8975 EPC 416, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Seddon, David] Univ East Anglia, Dev Studies, Norwich, Norfolk, England",University of Birmingham; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); University of East Anglia,"Sugden, F (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",f.sugden@bham.ac.uk,"Sugden, Fraser/JPL-1806-2023","Sugden, Fraser/0000-0002-7559-4486",CGIAR Research Program on Water Land and Ecosystems (WLE),CGIAR Research Program on Water Land and Ecosystems (WLE),"This paper was funded through the CGIAR Research Program on Water Land and Ecosystems (WLE), led by the International Water Management Institute, as part of its Ganges basin Gender and Inclusion Profiles project.

However, identifying efficient design solutions and determining how bicycle infrastructure planning knowledge can be integrated into comprehensive policy remains a challenge. The objective of this paper is to shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of current bicycle infrastructure planning in both an experienced city, Copenhagen, and in a less experienced city, Beijing. The paper examines how local design solutions are identified, how efficient they are and to what extent bicycle infrastructure planning is supported by the local planning cultures. The study draws on the successful experience of Copenhagen to identify challenges to bicycle infrastructure planning in Beijing and to improve it based on lessons learnt. The study uses qualitative semi-structured data collected from 11 interviews with key planners. It employs the Dutch CROW principles to assess the efficiency of the bicycle infrastructure planning. The analysis of the role of the local planning culture is framed by the `culturized planning model'. The study finds that bicycle-friendly infrastructure planning could be strengthened in Beijing by integrating and applying all the CROW principles simultaneously. It concludes that Beijing can draw inspiration from Copenhagen by increasing the priority of cycling in both the planning and societal environment. The planning environment could be strengthened by professionalizing bicycle infrastructure planning and by aligning the prioritization of bicycle transport between policies. The societal environment could become more supportive by improving the status of the bicycle as a means of transport.","[Zhao, Chunli; Carstensen, Trine Agervig; Olafsson, Anton Stahl] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Managemen4, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick] Danish Rd Directorate, Sect Planning & Anal, Niels Juels Gade 13, DK-1022 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Zhao, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Managemen4, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",zhao@ign.ku.dk,"; Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick/F-1701-2016; Carstensen, Trine Agervig/C-8504-2015; Olafsson, Anton/D-1002-2015","Zhao, Chunli/0000-0002-4420-4203; Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick/0000-0002-6679-4515; Carstensen, Trine Agervig/0000-0002-2133-1621; Olafsson, Anton/0000-0002-7940-8126",University of Copenhagen,University of Copenhagen,This study has been possible due to PhD research grant funded by the University of Copenhagen.

Using a multidimensional measure, we find that greater board diversity leads to lower volatility and better performance. The lower risk levels are largely due to diverse boards adopting more persistent and less risky financial policies. However, consistent with diversity fostering more efficient (real) risk-taking, firms with greater board diversity also invest persistently more in research and development (R&D) and have more efficient innovation processes. Instrumental variable tests that exploit exogenous variation in firm access to the supply of diverse nonlocal directors indicate that these relations are causal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We simultaneously model firms' adoption of ERM and the effect of ERM on the cost of capital. We find that ERM adoption significantly reduces firm's cost of capital.

We ask how the Medicaid rules map into the reality of Medicaid recipiency, and we ask what other observable characteristics are important to determine who ends up on Medicaid. The data show that both singles and couples with high retirement income can end up on Medicaid at very advanced ages. We find that, conditioning on a large number of observable characteristics, including those that directly relate to Medicaid eligibility criteria, single women are more likely to end up on Medicaid - so are non-white people, but, surprisingly, their higher recipiency is concentrated in the higher income percentiles. We also find that people with low incomes who have a high-school diploma or higher degree are much less likely to end up receiving Medicaid than their less-educated counterparts.

The most salient feature of these schools is that, despite remaining part of the state sector, they operate with more autonomy than the predecessors they replaced. Two distinct periods of academy school introduction have taken place, under the auspices of different governments. The first batch was initiated in the 2002-03 school year by the Labour government of the time, and was a school improvement programme directly aimed at turning around badly performing schools. The second batch involved a mass academisation process following the change of government in May 2010 and the Academies Act of that year, which resulted in increased heterogeneity of new academies. This paper compares the two batches of introduction with the aim of getting a better understanding of their similarities and differences, and their importance for education policy. To do so, we study what types of schools were more likely to change to academy status in the two programmes, and the impact of this change on the quality of new pupil enrolments into the new types of school. Whilst we do point out some similarities, these are the exception rather than the norm. For the most part, our analysis reveals a number of marked dissimilarities between the two programmes, in terms of both the characteristics of schools that became academies and the changes in pupil intakes that occurred post-conversion.","[Eyles, Andrew] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Eyles, Andrew; Machin, Stephen; Silva, Olmo] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; [Machin, Stephen] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London, England; [Silva, Olmo] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Eyles, A (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London, England.;Eyles, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England.",A.Eyles@lse.ac.uk; S.J.Machin@lse.ac.uk; O.Silva@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,26,12,12,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Results suggested that age, economic and financial status, and job characteristics are important indicators for voluntary superannuation savings. Affordability, false beliefs, and lack of awareness about retirement savings inhibit participation. Past saving habits and retirement planning positively affect voluntary retirement savings.

When each firm has local cost advantage and technological difference between firms is sufficiently large, firms reallocate resources toward their more profitable products. By contrast, when there exists a small technological difference or global cost advantage, the more productive firm may expand the product line.","[Kim, Kyungmin] Bank Korea, 39 Namdaemun Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Bank of Korea,"Kim, K (通讯作者)，Bank Korea, 39 Namdaemun Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Relying on financial statements and survey data I compare the performance of three different categories of foreign banks to the group of domestic banks in sub-Saharan Africa: global banks from developed countries, regional African banks and banks from non-African emerging economies. While emerging-market banks and global banks consistently outperform domestic banks, the difference is not significant for regional African banks. The higher performance of global banks and emerging-market banks is related to higher operational efficiency and lower cost of funding, while there is no strong evidence of segmentation by business segment in the loans market. Regional African banks, which started their foreign expansion more recently, are less able to generate interest income compared to domestic banks. These findings highlight the importance of taking into account foreign banks' heterogeneity when assessing the impact of financial FDI on the host economy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

First, we investigate the extremal properties of different high-frequency-based volatility processes and show that only a subset of them can generate dependence in the extremes. Second, we corroborate the empirical evidence on extremal dependence in financial returns, showing that extreme returns present strong and persistent correlation and that extreme negative returns are much more correlated than positive ones. Finally, a large empirical analysis suggests that only models exhibiting extremal dependence and endowed with a leverage component can appropriately explain extreme events.","[Trapin, Luca] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,"Trapin, L (通讯作者)，Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",luca.trapin@sns.it,"Trapin, Luca/AAI-3733-2020","Trapin, Luca/0000-0001-8613-0962",HEC Montreal,HEC Montreal,"Part of this work was conducted while the author was a post-doctoral fellow at HEC Montreal and financial support is gratefully acknowledged.

In our experiment, 181 participants state their willingness to pay for insurance contracts with different levels of default risk. We find that the willingness to pay sharply decreases with increasing default risk. Our results, hence, strongly support the hypothesis of probabilistic insurance. Furthermore, we study the impact of customer reaction to default risk on an insurer's optimal solvency level using our experimentally obtained data on insurance demand. We show that an insurer should choose to be default-free rather than having even a very small default probability. This risk strategy is also optimal when assuming substantial transaction costs for risk management activities undertaken to achieve the maximum solvency level.","[Zimmer, Anja; Schade, Christian D.] Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Spandauerstr 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Gruendl, Helmut; Glenzer, Franca] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Gründl, H (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.",gruendl@finance.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Schade, Christian D./0000-0001-6879-4976",Berlin Association of Insurance Research (Verein zur Forderung der Versicherungswissenschaft in Berlin),Berlin Association of Insurance Research (Verein zur Forderung der Versicherungswissenschaft in Berlin),"Anja Zimmer and Christian D.

Three key issues in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Region,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transport; Differential mobility; Social inequality; Territorial inequality; Buenos Aires,,"One of the main challenges that geographers and urban planners face when thinking about mobility in Latin American cities is how to accurately assess the effect produced by severe social and territorial inequality. In an attempt to explore this question, this article analyses three key issues related to the inequality-mobility relationship: a) mobility as a facilitator in the access to goods, services and opportunities at different urban scales, and its direct effects on poverty and social exclusion; b) socially and territorially conditioned assets and competences among individuals when managing mobility needs and territorial control; and c) the uneven appropriation and use of the city, both in terms of proximity and connection to metropolitan networks. Analysis is carried out on secondary information on transport and mobility at the metropolitan scale according to income level and territorial location of households. This is followed by examination of three specific cases in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Region that show the importance of territorial features when addressing mobility patterns of particular socioeconomically vulnerable groups, including: mobility of informal settlers in urban peripheries; mobility of domestic workers in gated communities; and mobility of residents at risk of displacement in gentrifying neighborhoods. The key findings highlight how the particular territorial conditions can intensify or attenuate the pre-existing socioeconomic inequality.","[Blanco, Jorge; Apaolaza, Ricardo] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Inst Geog, 480 Puan,4th Floor 1240, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires,"Apaolaza, R (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Inst Geog, 480 Puan,4th Floor 1240, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",ricardoapaolaza@yahoo.com.ar,,"BLANCO, JORGE/0000-0002-2258-4540; APAOLAZA, Ricardo/0000-0002-3684-8623",Universidad de Buenos Aires [UBACyT F134]; 7th European Community Framework Programme by a Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme Fellowship [FP7- PEOPLE-PIRSES-GA-2012-318944],Universidad de Buenos Aires(University of Buenos Aires); 7th European Community Framework Programme by a Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme Fellowship(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions),"This research was supported within the Project UBACyT F134 Movilidad, territorio y desigualdad en la Region Metropolitana de Buenos Aires; estudios de caso vinculados con el acceso a servicios y la accesibilidad a lugares de empleo of Universidad de Buenos Aires and the 7th European Community Framework Programme (FP7- PEOPLE-PIRSES-GA-2012-318944) by a Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme Fellowship, which is titled CONTESTED_CITIES: Contested Spatialities of Urban Neoliberalism, Dialogues between Emerging Spaces of Citizenshipin Europe and Latin America.",,50,23,25,3,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We use the contingent behavior method and account for unobserved heterogeneity in order to overcome problems associated with limited data, collinearity and endogeneity. We characterize the climate change with two types of climate change scenarios: dry-spells and wet-spells. Results show that moderate and extreme increases in dry-spells increase adoption of off-farm activities such as casual labor and small business, and decrease adoption of on-farm activities such as gardening. We find opposite cases for mild or moderate wet-spells. Our results also show that households tend to diversify their livelihood portfolios in response to a moderate increase in dry-spells and a mild increase in wet-spells. Some household characteristics are also important in influencing some types of activities, including household's health status, gender of the household head, and household's prior experience.","[Dassanayake, Wijaya] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton Clin Hlth Acad 3 270, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Mohapatra, Sandeep; Luckert, Martin K.; Adamowicz, Wiktor] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Dassanayake, W (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton Clin Hlth Acad 3 270, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",dassanay@ualberta.ca,,"Adamowicz, Wiktor/0000-0002-7634-2985",International Development Research Centre (IDRC),International Development Research Centre (IDRC),Financial support from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) for the field surveys is gratefully acknowledged.

The disclosure of financial information induces a trade externality: if speculators refrain from trading, hedgers do the same, depressing the asset price. Market transparency reinforces this mechanism, by making speculators' trades more visible to hedgers. Hence, issuers will oppose both the disclosure of fundamentals and trading transparency. Issuers may either under-or over-provide information compared to the socially efficient level if speculators have more bargaining power than hedgers, while they never under-provide it otherwise. When hedgers have low financial literacy, forbidding their access to the market may be socially efficient.","[Di Maggio, Marco] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Di Maggio, Marco] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pagano, Marco] Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Pagano, Marco] CSEF, Naples, Italy; [Pagano, Marco] EIEF, Rome, Italy; [Pagano, Marco] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Naples Federico II; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Di Maggio, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.;Di Maggio, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"PAGANO, MARCO/AAD-8218-2022","PAGANO, MARCO/0000-0002-0709-6119",EIEF,EIEF,"We thank the Editor (Franklin Allen), an anonymous referee, Daron Acemoglu, Abhijit Banerjee, Nicholas Barberis, Bruno Biais, Milo Bianchi (discussant), Guillermo Caruana, Hui Chen, Kent Daniel, Darrell Duffie, Xavier Gabaix, Diego Garcia, Johan Hombert, Pab Jotikasthira, Andrey Malenko, Gustavo Manso, Meg Meyer, Andrea Prat, Barbara Rindi, Steve Ross, Ioanid Rosu (discussant), Andrei Shleifer, Peter Norman Sorensen, Xavier Vives, Liyan Yang (discussant), Hongkai Zhang, and seminar participants at the Econometric Society Meeting, the Barcelona GSE Summer Forum on Information and Market Frictions, the European Summer Symposium in Financial Markets, the EFA meeting, the SFS Finance Cavalcade, the FIRS meeting, the CREI-CEPR workshop on Behavioral Decision Theory and its Applications to Economics and Finance, the CSEF-IGIER Symposium on Economics and Institutions, the XIV Madrid Finance Workshop, the 2015 Graz Workshop on Accounting, Information, and Financial Crises, and seminars at MIT, Catholic University (Milan) and Science Po (Paris) for helpful comments and suggestions.

We compare the default probability according to a mini-bond's initial rating with that implied by credit risk models and show that rating agencies can create rating inflation by issuing overly favorable ratings. This creates a favorable opportunity for lower quality firms to compete for funding. In this environment, high-quality firms have an incentive to use mini-bond underpricing to signal their quality. Our data highlight that, according to information-based corporate finance theory, higher underpricing is correlated with higher quality mini-bond issuer`s and lower early default rates.","[Mietzner, Mark] Zeppelin Univ, Dept Corp Management & Econ, Seemooser Horn 20, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany; [Mietzner, Mark] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, Hochschulstr 1, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany; [Proelss, Juliane; Schweizer, Denis] Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business Bldg, 1450 Guy, Montreal, PQ H3H 0A1, Canada",Zeppelin University; Technical University of Darmstadt; Concordia University - Canada,"Schweizer, D (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business Bldg, 1450 Guy, Montreal, PQ H3H 0A1, Canada.",mark.mietzner@zu.de; Juliane.Proelss@concordia.ca; Denis.Schweizer@concordia.ca,,,Manulife Professorship,Manulife Professorship,"We thank two anonymous referees for their numerous highly useful comments and suggestions.

Yet research that links industrial agglomeration with rail transit is scant what types of industries are likely to cluster near rail stations? To what extent can rail transit access be seen as having an influence on industrial agglomeration? And how do these interactions vary as rail transit proximity increases? To answer these and related questions, we investigate the relationship between industrial agglomeration and rail transit in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area using the Longitudinal Employer Dynamics (LEHD) employment data from 2014 at the census block level. First, we use the Local Indicator of Spatial Association statistics (LISA) tests to identify industrial agglomeration patterns within the study area. We then use logistics models to reveal the relationship between rail transit proximity and industrial agglomeration. Our study finds that the impacts of rail transit on industrial agglomeration, in terms of magnitudes and signs, are mixed across industries. The varying results suggest that the benefits of rail transit access exhibit considerable demand from certain industry sectors including the manufacturing, knowledge, and services industries, while exerting weaker forces in pulling agglomeration in its immediate environs among other industries (including the retail trade sector). In practice, these results are useful for justifying evidence-based rail transit planning.","[Yu, Haitao] Univ Florida, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Architecture Bldg,1480 Inner Rd, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Jiao, Junfeng] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Architecture, Sutton Hall 3-120, Austin, TX 78759 USA; [Houston, Eric] City Hallandale Beach, Dept Transportat & Mobil, 400 South Fed Highway, Hallandale Beach, FL 33009 USA; [Peng, Zhong-Ren] Univ Florida, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 1480 Inner Rd, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Yu, HT (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Architecture Bldg,1480 Inner Rd, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",rayyht@ufl.edu; jjiao@austin.utexas.edu; Ehouston@cohb.org; zpeng@ufl.edu,"Peng, Zhong-Ren/X-4342-2019; Peng, Zhongren/AAH-8123-2020","Peng, Zhongren/0000-0003-3648-6770",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD042849] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,66,35,38,4,74,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The analysis allowed to answer the first question in the affirmative, but it also highlighted some disadvantages of integrated reporting. The second question can be answered that integrated reports give a general picture of risks, because they are specific to each group. The article describes sustainable development and corporate social responsibility, marking the beginning of integrated reporting. On the basis of literature and related legal acts therefore the article refers to existing research and adds the author's contribution to them. Also the case study method was applied. The results were visibly presented and interpreted, and the right conclusions were drawn. The added value of this work is dealing with integrated reports as a new research field, and more precisely with the risks disclosed in such reports of the two leading Polish capital groups. The risk issues disclosed in the integrating reports have been rarely undertaken so far in international surveys.","[Babuska, Ewa Wiktoria] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Babuska, EW (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland.",babuskae@uek.krakow.pl,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-7-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,219,234,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM3BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461826900020,0

We propose a simple model where firms producing varieties face labor-market frictions and credit constraints. In the model, tighter credit leads to lower output, a lower number of vacancies, and higher directed-search unemployment. If workers are more productive at higher levels of firm output, then a lower credit supply increases firm capital intensity, raises income inequality by increasing the rental of capital relative to the wage, and has an ambiguous effect on welfare. With an initially high share of labor costs in total production costs, tighter credit lowers welfare. This pattern reverses during an expansionary phase when there is higher credit availability.","[Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Dinopoulos, Elias] Univ Florida, Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Unel, Bulent] Louisiana State Univ, Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/I-5739-2016",,,,,,33,3,3,0,3,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

However, representatives of ruling parties in the Czech Republic are considering an implementation of new sector tax focused on commercial insurance undertakings in order to increase tax revenues flowing to public budgets. Tax efficiency is affected by several factors and trends including tax optimization. The implementation of new sector tax is therefore questionable. In order to assess benefits and negatives of additional taxation, tax efficiency has been verified. Insurance undertakings have been distinguished by market positions reflecting financial results of insurers, and different effects have been taken into account. Comparative analysis of tax efficiency respecting market shares of insurers has established a way to assess a level of tax burden on insurance undertakings in conditions of the Czech insurance market. Results of analysis have offered a consideration of tax adequacy concerning the implementation of new sector tax.","[Bartova, Hana] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Banking & Insurance, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bártová, H (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Banking & Insurance, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",hana.bartova@vse.cz,,,[IG102046],,The article is processed as an output of a research project Development Trends in Banking and Insurance in Conditions of Changing Financial Markets registered by the Internal Grant Agency under the registration number IG102046.,,6,0,0,2,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68762-9; 978-3-319-68761-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,117,122,,10.1007/978-3-319-68762-9_13,0.0,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL3UH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450036900013,0

Poland is an example of the country characterized by low activity and employment rates, especially among older workers. The purpose of the paper is to evaluate if the gradual increase in retirement age (since 2013) and phasing-out of early retirement had contributed to the increase in effective retirement age and what were the drivers of retirement decisions prior the statutory retirement age. As the analysis shows, the observed increase in effective retirement age was a consequence of rising the statutory retirement age for men and women and phasing-out the early retirement for women born after 1953 and men born after 1948. The drivers of transition from work to retirement have not changed in recent years. The very first outcomes of the reversal from the increase in retirement age (since October 2017) also suggest that workers in Poland are interested in receiving the old-age pension as soon as possible despite its amount or its progressive increase in case of the postponing of the retirement.","[Bielawska, Kamila] Univ Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Bielawska, K (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.",kamila.bielawska@ug.edu.pl,"BIELAWSKA, KAMILA/A-4095-2019","BIELAWSKA, KAMILA/0000-0003-1558-0194",,,,,19,0,0,0,7,LODZ UNIV TECHNOLOGY PR,LODZ,"BIBLIOTEKA POLITECHNIKI LODZKIEJ-BUDYNEK B22, UL WOLCZANSKA 223, LODZ, 90-924, POLAND",,,978-83-7283-900-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,195,204,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470276200017,0

To explore this issue, a regression kink model with an unknown threshold proposed by Hansen (2017) is used for analysis. Using data from visible stock indices for G7 countries, our empirical evidence shows the presence of threshold effects for most of the G7 stock indices. Moreover, the evidence indicates that the historical high ratio has a strong negative effect on subsequent stock index returns, as the current stock index price is far from its historical high. Overall, these findings support the prospect theory developed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979), in that investors are instinctively risk-seeking (averse) when they face a loss (gain).

Then the Markov Regimes Switching model is used to identify the risk status and migration probability of dynamic correlation between the two. We have come to the following conclusions. Firstly, there is a significant positive effect between RMB exchange rate and short-term capital flows. The depreciation of RMB exchange rate will lead to the increase of China's short-term capital outflows, which will further strengthen the pressure of exchange rate depreciation. Secondly, the appreciation of RMB exchange rate will increase the volatility of short-term capital flows, and the short-term capital inflows will also increase the volatility of exchange rate. Thirdly, compared with the real exchange rate, the negative relationship between RMB nominal exchange rate and short-term capital flows is more stable. During the exchange reform and financial crisis, the dynamic relation between RMB exchange rate and short-term capital flows will be significantly enhanced.","[Dai Shugeng; Yu Bo] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Yao Feng] Kagawa Univ, Fac Econ, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7608523, Japan",Xiamen University; Kagawa University,"Dai, SG (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",,,,Development Project of the Ministry of Education's Philosophy and Social Science Development Report [11JBGP006]; Fundamental research results of the Special Funding Fundamental Research Funding for Central Universities project [20720181068]; [GX2013-1005(Y)],Development Project of the Ministry of Education's Philosophy and Social Science Development Report; Fundamental research results of the Special Funding Fundamental Research Funding for Central Universities project;,"This article is the first batch of funding projects for the study of generalized virtual economy The Application of Generalized Virtual Economy Theory in the Financial Industry in 2013 [Project Number: GX2013-1005(Y)], the Development Project of the Ministry of Education's Philosophy and Social Science Development Report (11JBGP006), and Fundamental research results of the Special Funding Fundamental Research Funding for Central Universities project (20720181068).",,27,3,3,0,3,DALIAN UNIV TECHNICAL ELECTRONIC & AUDIO-VISUAL PRESS,DALIAN CITY,"NO.80 SOFTWARE PARK ROAD, HI-TECH ZONE, DALIAN CITY, LIAONING PROVINCE 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-202-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,278,287,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7UP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455659900041,0

The methodology is based on the dynamic conditional correlation model and its asymmetric volatility and asymmetric correlation extensions. The stability of parameters was tested by t-test applied on the rol ling windows data. The information importance of asymmetric volatility and correlation was tested by global minimum variance portfolio. The results suggest that the parameters loading the asymmetric behavior of the correlation are not stable for the analyzed time series during the financial crisis. With one exception we have found out that global minimum variance portfolio based on the dynamic conditional correlation model with asymmetric volatility is significantly less volatile than the global minimum variance portfolio based on the asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation model.","[Fryd, Lukas] Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fak Informatiky & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Fryd, L (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka Praze, Fak Informatiky & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic.",xfry100@vse.cz,,,,,,,33,0,0,2,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Retail investors trading on their own accounts display a rolled disposition effect, selling the new position when its value exceeds the initial investment in the original position. On reinvestment days, these investors display no disposition effect (consistent with no disutility from realizing a loss) and make better selling decisions. Using a laboratory experiment, we show that reinvestment causally reduces the disposition effect and improves trading.","[Frydman, Cary] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Hartzmark, Samuel M.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Solomon, David H.] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",University of Southern California; University of Chicago; Boston College,"Hartzmark, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Samuel.hartzmark@chicagobooth.edu,"Hartzmark, Samuel/P-9996-2019",,,,,,40,27,32,4,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

If it proceeds, states can design policies to meet those requirements and also raise revenue via a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program with auctioned permits. We calculate each state's potential revenue and demonstrate its significance. In 13 states, carbon revenue could replace all of corporate tax revenue. In addition, we collect budget projections from six key states to determine if and how carbon revenue can substantially reduce deficits. While such revenue is not free money, we discuss its advantages over use of distortionary taxation. Finally, we consider distributional aspects and potential external fiscal effects on federal revenue.

For numerical analysis, we designed a hybrid computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that explicitly incorporates electricity generation technologies. The Indonesian FITs have been stipulated in Government Regulation No. 79/2014 on National Energy Policy. We assume that the government sets a 15% subsidy rate for renewable generation technologies. Two possible financing schemes are implemented: (i) the FIT is paid by electricity consumers through the endogenous electricity tax rate; and (ii) the FIT is financed by a carbon tax adjustment. The results show that the effects of both FIT scenarios on macroeconomic and CO2 emission accounts are negligible. These negligible effects are due to the low shares of renewables (geothermal and hydro) generation load in total electricity mix. Therefore, we argue that Indonesia's current FIT regulation is insufficient to boost the national clean energy production and therefore is ineffective to reduce the national emissions.","[Hasudungan, Herbert Wibert Victor] Univ Dundee, Dundee, Scotland; [Sabaruddin, Sulthon Sjahril] Minist Foreign Affairs, Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Dundee,"Hasudungan, HWV (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Dundee, Scotland.",herbertwvh@gmail.com,"Sjahril, Sulthon/AAD-8888-2019","Sjahril, Sulthon/0000-0002-9555-5599",,,,,33,5,5,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The economic data are mixed and indicate a stall, but not a collapse, of globalization. Cross-border financial flows have been reduced, but the overall outcome mostly reflects changes in European banking. Trade is not growing as quickly as before the crisis, but that may be the consequence of technology shortening supply chains. There are more protectionist measures, but they have not radically cut trade. But political deglobalization has advanced much further, and consequently, there is the prospect of more intense conflicts over trade and financial regulation in the future, as well as one of an increasing backlash against migration. Globalization depends on a complex system of regulating cross-border flows and on embedding domestic rules in an international order. The political momentum is directed against the existing methods or regulation and against the complex rules that had been established to manage globalization. The promise given by populist myth builders is that eliminating international entanglements can make life simpler, less regulated, and above all, less subject to the dictates of an administrative class. Modern economic nationalism or unilateralism can be understood as a reversal of the process of embedding and may thus be termed disembedded unilateralism.","[James, Harold] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"James, H (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",hjames@princeton.edu,,,,,,,58,43,46,2,65,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

This paper identifies groups of retirees that have experienced relatively high price inflation over the last few decades and could thus be considered most vulnerable when income decreases, as has been the case in the Netherlands in recent years. For this we use household budget survey data from 1978 to 2004 supplemented with price information from 1978 to 2012. A methodological contribution to the literature is that an empirical framework based on the theory of consumer demand is used that explicitly makes the link between expenditure patterns and inflation experiences of households. We find that retired couples aged 65-69 have experienced about average inflation over the past few decades. Differences in inflation experiences between households result from relative price increases in goods, such as rent and utilities, on which single, low-income and older households spend relatively more of their budget, and relative price decreases in goods, such as leisure activities (including vacations), on which these households spend relatively less. The estimated differences over the 1978-2012 period in annual inflation experience are about 0.14 percentage points between single and married retirees, 0.06 percentage points between retired couples in the age groups 65-69 and 75-79 and 0.19 percentage points between retirees with low and high expenditures. Although these differences are statistically significant, they could be considered too small to be of economic significance compared with an average household having experienced 2.4% annual inflation.","[Kalwij, Adriaan] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ, POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Alessie, Robertus] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Gardner, Jonathan] Willis Towers Watson, London, England; [Ali, Ashik Anwar] European Actuarial Serv, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University; University of Groningen,"Kalwij, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ, POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.s.kalwij@uu.nl,,"Alessie, Rob/0000-0002-5128-6753",,,,,18,1,1,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

This paper contributes to a vast strand of the literature on the effects of uncertainty on households saving by addressing the issue of buffer stock saving in Poland. Following the reduced-form buffer stock saving model proposed by Carroll et al. (2012) three determinants of the household saving rate are identified: household net financial wealth, credit conditions, and the unemployment risk faced by households. An analysis of data for the period 2003-2016 finds that all three explanatory variables play a statistically significant and economically important role. Thus, it supports the hypothesis that the increased uncertainty causes greater savings in the presence of credit constraints and reveals that the buffer stock model explains substantial part of variation in the household saving rate.","[Klopocka, Aneta Maria] Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland",,"Klopocka, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.",a.klopocka@vizja.pl,"Klopocka, Aneta M./X-3759-2018","Klopocka, Aneta/0000-0002-7940-5910",National Science Centre (Poland) [DEC-2011/01/B/HS4/05114],National Science Centre (Poland),"This work was supported by the National Science Centre (Poland) under the research grant Directions of changes in household saving behavior - international perspective, funded based on decision No. DEC-2011/01/B/HS4/05114.",,37,1,1,0,1,LODZ UNIV TECHNOLOGY PR,LODZ,"BIBLIOTEKA POLITECHNIKI LODZKIEJ-BUDYNEK B22, UL WOLCZANSKA 223, LODZ, 90-924, POLAND",,,978-83-7283-900-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,174,183,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470276200015,0

At the level of practical bureaucratic incentives for officials, some scholars point to political patronage as both an appropriate and effective contributor to economic growth. They argue that the patronage bureaucracy system is an optimal alternative political model to the impersonal and merit-based Weberian model for developing countries. In this paper, we test this theory by empirically analyzing the relationship of patronage to economic growth against the effects of both fiscal federalism and promotion tournament models. We find that political patronage in China appears to reduce economic growth, in another word, the patronage hinders economic growth.","[Lei, Xu; Adewale, Adekoya Lukman] Bohai Univ, Management Sch, Jinzhou 121013, Peoples R China",Bohai University,"Lei, X (通讯作者)，Bohai Univ, Management Sch, Jinzhou 121013, Peoples R China.",,"LEI, XU/JEF-7372-2023",,,,,,5,1,1,0,2,DALIAN UNIV TECHNICAL ELECTRONIC & AUDIO-VISUAL PRESS,DALIAN CITY,"NO.80 SOFTWARE PARK ROAD, HI-TECH ZONE, DALIAN CITY, LIAONING PROVINCE 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-202-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,216,219,,,,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7UP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455659900033,0

The results show how co-operatives with more committed memberships display higher levels of capitalization and that capitalization positively relates with innovation levels.

These results are relevant from a managerial point of view as they reveal the importance of members' commitment in this particular type of organizations and provide new insights to improve co-operatives' innovation and performance.,"[Marcos-Matas, Gustavo] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Business Management, Edificio Dept Los Madronos,Campus Arrosadia, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Ruggeri, Arianna; Ghelfi, Rino] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci, Fac Agr, Viale Fanin 50, I-40127 Bologna, Italy",Universidad Publica de Navarra; University of Bologna,"Marcos-Matas, G (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Business Management, Edificio Dept Los Madronos,Campus Arrosadia, Pamplona 31006, Spain.",gustavo.marcos@unavarra.es,"ruggeri, arianna/Q-5101-2018; Matás, Gustavo Marcos/R-5052-2018; GHELFI, RINO/HLQ-2371-2023; ruggeri, arianna/U-3285-2019","Matás, Gustavo Marcos/0000-0001-8779-0559; ruggeri, arianna/0000-0002-2078-2703",,,,,69,3,3,2,21,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The aim of the work was to analyze the innovation processes which have been taking place in the three leading East Asian countries, taking into account the strategic interests of the Russian Federation. Methodologically, the systemic, institutional, neoinstitutional and comparative approaches were used. Research methods: comparative analysis, structural and functional analysis, sociological analysis, observation, included observation, extrapolation. Institutional mechanisms of Russia's partnership with three East Asian countries were considered, the main results and the degree of their effectiveness were described. The necessity of shifting the emphasis of cooperation from the industrial sector to the non-material sphere (creation of information, knowledge, services) was justified. The research results are in demand in the situation of making political decisions in the innovation policy segment in the context of ensuring national security, effective international and regional policies. In the process of research, the hypothesis was confirmed that the process of world and regional development of a cooperative type is pushing modern countries to search for options for rapprochement and interaction based on innovation. A prognosis was made for the development of innovative integration between Russia and the countries of East Asia. The main obstacles to its implementation were noted. Russia, having set ambitious goals to achieve a high level of the well-being of the population and to consolidate the geopolitical role of the country as one of the leaders that determine the world political agenda, should be oriented towards the transition to an innovative socially-oriented model of development.","[Martynova, Marina; Grishin, Oleg; Rudnitskaya, Anastasia] Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Grishin, Oleg] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Polit Sci, Moscow, Russia",Russian State Social University (RSSU); Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Martynova, M (通讯作者)，Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia.",martynovamju@rgsu.net; helg-g@mail.ru; rudnickajaap@rgsu.net,"Martinova, Marina Юрьевна/S-3405-2018",,,,,,31,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,572,579,,,,,,8,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000063,0

The strongest from among the credit union streams was formed of charitable societies. The second stream was created through transforming consumers' cooperatives to district economic credit unions, and the last of the significant streams came to our lands from Germany, in the form of Raiffeisen credit unions. Because of the demand for cheap credits, credit unions soon flourished into a significant group of credit providers, both in terms of the quantity of credits and the volume of provided finances. The main attention is paid to the change in orientation of credit unions after 1873, when Act No. 70, on associations, was passed, significantly influencing the change of originally charitable credit unions to financial institutions providing cheap credits to the general population. This transformation subsequently contributed to unification of the three streams.","[Mullner, Vojtech] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Müllner, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",vojtech.mullner@econ.muni.cz,"Müllner, Vojtěch/HJI-9200-2023; Mullner, Vojtech/ABH-1105-2020","Müllner, Vojtěch/0000-0002-5327-3761; Mullner, Vojtech/0000-0002-5327-3761",,,,,16,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-68762-9; 978-3-319-68761-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,136,143,,10.1007/978-3-319-68762-9_15,0.0,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL3UH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450036900015,0

The Institutional Effects of Services,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CORRUPTION; COUNTRIES; PEOPLE,"Whereas most studies find the poor in Africa to be more vulnerable to bribery because of their lower socio-economic status, this paper proposes institutional differences as an alternative explanation. Because poor people are unable to afford privately provided services, they must use public services. In relying on the state more often, the poor become more vulnerable to bribery. Analyses of Afrobarometer data show that the poor are not more likely to pay bribes for state monopolised services. The poor's disproportionate vulnerability to bribery for choice services is a function of their greater likelihood to have contact with the state.","[Peiffer, Caryn] Univ Birmingham, Int Dev Dept, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Rose, Richard] Univ Strathclyde Glasgow, Ctr Study Publ Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Birmingham; University of Strathclyde,"Peiffer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Int Dev Dept, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",c.peiffer@bham.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I03482X/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I03482X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I03482X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I03482X/1].,,45,27,28,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The size distribution of firms is visibly distorted by these regulations: There are many firms with exactly 49 employees. A quantitative model is developed with a payroll tax of 0.15 percent that applies only to firms with more than 50 employees. Removing the regulation while holding total employment constant leads to an increase in output of around 0.3 percent.","[Roys, Nicolas] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63106 USA; [Roys, Nicolas] Royal Holloway Univ London, London, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Roys, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO 63106 USA.;Roys, N (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, London, England.",,"Roys, Nicolas/K-6863-2016",,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

The aim of this paper is to identify all all variables affecting income distribution and inequality in Croatia. Looking at the data from 2001 to today, we come to the conclusion about the possible impact of social transfers, inflation, wages, government consumption and other variables on income distribution. In this paper, we will specifically focus on the calculation of inequality in the distribution of income based on the basic indicators for the calculation of inequality such as the Gini coefficient and other measures. Today, we can talk about the influence of the state on income distribution, the impact of education, regional influences, and other impacts, but we can't quantify individual individual impacts. There is no calculation that would show us the importance of an individual impact or its quantifiable effect. It is precisely the basis of this paper, where it tries to show the effect of certain variables, as well as their importance in order. The issue that goes through this paper is very important because it seeks to determine the determinants of income distribution and on the basis of this determinants, it estimates why inequality in income distribution occurs and how this inequality can affect other aspects of the economy. Based on this paper, one can get an answer on how and whether inequality in the distribution of income affects the creation of an economic crisis. This paper is a continuation of the research conducted in Croatia on the topic of inequality in the distribution of income. However, these papers have looked at the individual effects on income distribution, such as the influence of the state, the level of education etc. Unlike previous works, this paper tries to evaluate all possible impacts on inequality in income distribution and also to show their mutual influence and classify their their importance.","[Stjepanovic, Sasa] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradovica 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Stjepanovic, S (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradovica 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",sstjepan@unipu.hr,"Stjepanović, Saša/AAL-4337-2020; Stjepanović, Saša/AAE-1335-2022","Stjepanović, Saša/0000-0003-1938-3681;",,,,,20,1,1,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,240,252,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000027,0

However, traditional project information is relatively clear. If traditional project evaluation method is simply applied to the PPP project procurement, it is likely to be difficult to accept. Therefore, based on triangular fuzzy multi-attributes decision-making theory, this paper takes the situation that decision makers are unable to give accurate measurement due to the fuzziness of project information into account and selects suitable bidding evaluation indicators to establish corresponding evaluation model. By means of TOPSIS, this model could carry out a comprehensive evaluation of social capital and obtain the ranking quickly by which we could obtain a more reasonable bidding evaluation results of PPP project.

The analysis is done for yearly data for period 2014 - 2016 as two steps analysis - if FDI takes place or not and about decision about the amount of FDI. The results shows, that the data of FDI in SPE has impact on elasticity of variables. In the step about decision making, data without SPE has more statistically significant variables. In case of decision about amount of FDI the statistically significant variables are almost the same in both cases, but there is difference in the elasticity (impact).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of individual legal acts concerning pension system in Poland (acts introduced on 25.03.2011, 11.05.2012, 6.12.2013). This evaluation is performed using a deterministic model consisting of a sequence of identity equations for each institutional sector, preceded by an input-output model. The sequence of equations takes into account all transactions included in non-financial national accounts, starting with the production account and ending with capital account. The model is supplemented by a pension sub-model, taking into consideration demographic structure changes, propensity to retire, replacement rate at retirement. The results of the simulation analyses show the isolated effects of changes in the pension system that are reflected mainly in the secondary distribution of income account and in the balancing item of non-financial accounts, i.e. the net lending/net borrowing of individual institutional sectors, paying particular attention to the deficit and debt of the general government.","[Trebska, Joanna] Univ Social Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Social Sciences,"Trebska, J (通讯作者)，Univ Social Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",joannatrebska@o2.pl,,"Trebska, Joanna/0000-0002-0398-5867",Polish National Science Center [DEC-2012/07/B/HS4/02928],Polish National Science Center,Simulation analyses presented in this paper are the extension of the research developed under the project financed by Polish National Science Center no.

Results suggest a strategy to establish a double mechanism where macro-regional funds can guarantee more tailored fees for farmers (specific for different geographical areas and level of riskiness), whereas a national IST, being able to reduce the systemic risk and the variability of income losses more than smaller funds, can provide resources for the compensation of farm losses, in case of insolvency.","[Trestini, Samuele; Giampietri, Elisa] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Trestini, S (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Padua, Italy.",samuele.trestini@unipd.it; elisa.giampietri@unipd.it,"GIAMPIETRI, ELISA/AAD-6643-2022; TRESTINI, SAMUELE/B-6157-2012","GIAMPIETRI, ELISA/0000-0002-1523-1739; TRESTINI, SAMUELE/0000-0002-9828-8262",,,,,13,3,3,0,1,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

It shows that none of these planning devices would be available under a DBCFT, if adopted universally. This is because intra-group payments between two countries do not affect tax liabilities in either country. If adopted unilaterally, however, there would be an incentive to shift profit to the adopting country, at the expense of non-adopting countries.","[Auerbach, Alan J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Devereux, Michael P.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England; [Keen, Michael] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Vella, John] Univ Oxford, Fac Law, Oxford, England",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Oxford; International Monetary Fund; University of Oxford,"Auerbach, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",auerbach@econ.berkeley.edu; michael.devereux@sbs.oxac.uk; mkeen@imf.org; john.vella@law.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,26,29,1,40,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We exploit the unexpected announcement of a drastic wage cut (25%) related to public sector employees in Romania. Using data from the Eurobarometer Surveys and the European Quality of Life Survey, we employ a difference-in-difference research design combined with matching, based on entropy balancing, to identify the causal effects. Our results reveal that the mere announcement of austerity measures leads to an overall drop in life satisfaction among those working in the public sector. We also show that men, and especially married individuals, are most affected by the substantial wage cut announcement. Contrary to previous research, we find that public sector employees with higher levels of education are more likely to be affected by this policy communication compared to those with only secondary or primary levels of education. Our results also suggest that the negative effect of the announcement is not persisting over time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Second, we find that three transmission channels (assets channel, funding channel, and rating channel) explain a relevant part of the impact of a sovereign downgrade.

In line with the existing literature, evidence from Swiss immigrants indicates that low income taxes are - at least for experienced employees - a significant consideration for migration decisions. However, due to a separate tax treatment of most of the immigrants, only cantonal-level taxes, not municipal taxes, are found to be a significant pull factor. Dominance analysis suggests that the importance of taxes compared to other locational factors is rather low. Network effects and labor market conditions are by far the most important factors that influence the choice of a destination municipality.","[Morger, Mario] Univ Lucerne, Konsumstr 20, CH-3007 Bern, Switzerland; [Morger, Mario] Ctr Labour & Social Policy Studies BASS, Konsumstr 20, CH-3007 Bern, Switzerland",,"Morger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lucerne, Konsumstr 20, CH-3007 Bern, Switzerland.;Morger, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Labour & Social Policy Studies BASS, Konsumstr 20, CH-3007 Bern, Switzerland.",mario.morger@buerobass.ch,,"Morger, Mario/0000-0001-9826-444X",,,,,54,0,0,0,7,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,DEC,2017,73.0,4,,,,,424,453,,10.1628/001522117X15089094661174,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FQ4XV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418363300005,0

Yet, research into the subject of supply chain processes' effects on performance is nascent. The purpose of this study is to examine the process dimensions' effects on supply chain (SC) partners' trust and firms' performance as supply chain processes are essential for firms' competitiveness. The research framework consists of seven hypotheses. An empirical study was conducted in Pakistan, and the data were collected from 164 supply chain firms. The reliability and validity of the model were examined through the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results delineate that supply chain processes have a significant relationship with SC partners' trust and performance. Thus, all hypotheses were supported. This study presents interesting theoretical contributions and managerial implications. At last, limitations regarding future research directions are discussed.","[Muhammad, Ziaullah] Ghazi Univ, Fac Management & Social Sci, Dept Business Adm, Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan; [Yi, Feng; Shumaila, Naz Akhter] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Muhammad, Z (通讯作者)，Ghazi Univ, Fac Management & Social Sci, Dept Business Adm, Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan.",mziaullah@gudgk.edu.pk; fengyi@uestc.edu.cn; shumailanazakhtar@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,4,4,1,4,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Specifically we analyze transaction data from the e-MID market, the only electronic interbank market in the Euro Area and US, over the period 2006-2009 that encompasses the global financial crisis. We show that interbank spreads are significantly affected by both local and global measures of connectedness. The effects of network centrality increased as the financial crisis evolved. Local measures show that having more links increases borrowing costs for borrowers and reduces premia for lenders. For global network centrality, borrowers receive a significant discount if they increase their intermediation activity and become more central, while lenders pay in general a premium (i.e. receive lower rates) for centrality. This provides evidence of the 'too-interconnected-to-fail' hypothesis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

After deriving our hypotheses from a decision theoretic model, we examine voting decisions in an experiment in which we use the size of the electorate as the treatment variable. Using a Heckman selection model that includes both the electoral participation decision and voting choice decision, we find mixed results for the expressive voting hypothesis. In line with expressive voting, our findings suggest that non-ideological voters are more likely to abstain from voting than ideological voters especially when the electorate grows large. Concerning the voting choice decision between an equal but inefficient, and an unequal but efficient income distribution the evidence for expressive voting is mixed. We do find that voters with socialist (left wing) preferences behave expressively, but we do not find this effect for voters with capitalist (right wing) preferences.","[Wiese, Rasmus; Jong-A-Pin, Richard] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Wiese, R (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands.",r.h.t.wiese@rug.nl; r.m.jong.a.pin@rug.nl,"Jong-A-Pin, Richard/AAD-7173-2019",,GREELAB committee,GREELAB committee,"We thank the GREELAB committee members, in particular Adriaan Soetevent and Te Bao for financial support and advice.

The study exploits World Bank repeated cross-section household data on Malawi and exogenous variation in precipitation measures across localities to identify the impact of drought and flood shocks on health, schooling and satisfaction levels. Our main estimate for children's anthropometric growth reveals that an incidence of drought shock leads to a resultant average decrease of 15%, 17% and 43% in age-standardized weight z-scores for shocks experienced at in-utero stage, first and second years respectively. Correspondingly, the relative impacts of an incidence of drought shock on age-standardized height z-scores are 14%, 15% and 27%. In contrast, the impacts of flood shock on each of these outcomes deteriorate over the outlined reference periods. On the adult dimension, we find that adults who face in-utero drought shock are more likely to have greater school entry delays and be unhappy with their current economic situations. However, this adulthood result pertains to male adults in our sample.","[Abiona, Olukorede] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Abiona, O (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",oa111@le.ac.uk,,"Abiona, Olukorede/0000-0002-1696-4475",,,,,41,17,19,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Public expenditures, financed through labour taxation, provide both public health and abatement. We study the role of these three components of longevity on welfare and economic stability. At the steady state, we show that an appropriate fiscal policy may enhance welfare. However, when pollution is heavily harmful for longevity, the economy might experience aggregate instability or endogenous cycles. Nonetheless, a fiscal policy, which raises the share of public spending devoted to health, may display stabilizing virtues and rule out cycles. This allows us to recommend the design of the public policy that may comply with the dynamic and welfare objectives.","[Raffin, Natacha] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, EconomiX & Climate Econ Chair, Bldg G,Off 604b,200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Seegmuller, Thomas] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille 02, France; [Seegmuller, Thomas] EHESS, Ctr Vieille Charite, 2 Rue Charite, F-13236 Marseille 02, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Nanterre; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Raffin, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, EconomiX & Climate Econ Chair, Bldg G,Off 604b,200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",nraffin@u-paris10.fr; thomas.seegmuller@univ-amu.fr,,,A*MIDEX Project - Investissements d'Avenir French Government program [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02],A*MIDEX Project - Investissements d'Avenir French Government program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work has been carried out thanks to the support of the A*MIDEX Project (ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02) funded by the Investissements d'Avenir French Government program, managed by the French National Research Agency (ANR).

We find evidence that Pennsylvania banks with larger direct interbank exposures to New York City changed the composition of their asset holdings, shifting from loans to more liquid assets and reducing their New York City correspondent deposits in the near-term. Over the long-term though, only the lower correspondent deposits effect persisted.

The analysis first shows that swap lines by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) had a positive impact on bank stocks in Central and Eastern Europe. It then highlights the importance of individual bank characteristics in identifying the asymmetric effect of swap lines on bank stocks. Bank level evidence suggests that stock prices of local and less-well capitalized banks as well as banks with high foreign currency exposures and high reliance on short-term funding responded more strongly to SNB swap lines. This new evidence is consistent with the view that swap lines not only enhanced market liquidity but also reduced risks associated with micro-prudential issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, transient institutional investors have the opposite effect. Using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation FD as an exogenous shock to information dissemination, we find evidence consistent with dedicated institutions having an information advantage. Similarly, dedicated investors are associated with better future governance characteristics, while transient investors are not.

Despite the efforts, however, recent studies suggest that some land use strategies such as densification and mixed-use development may result in slower vehicle movements, and consequently generate more driving emissions. Since vehicle miles of travel (VMT) is only a proxy and not an exact measure of emissions, reduction in VMT may not lead to a proportional reduction in transportation GHG emissions. Aside from local land use efforts, regional factors also influence vehicle travel and associated emissions. This study investigates the relationship between land use, vehicle travel, and driving emissions in the selected U.S. metropolitan areas at multiple geographic levels. The study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques to examine how land use influences vehicle travel characteristics and associated emissions. The main data sources for the analyses include the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) add-on samples and the Smart Location Database (SLD) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The study results show that VMT reduction and the associated environmental benefit do not show a one-on-one relationship due to the emissions penalty of lowered vehicle operating speed. Vehicle travel and associated emissions are not only influenced by local urban form factors but also affected by the greater geographical context.","[Choi, Kwangyul] Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Choi, Kwangyul] Univ Calgary, Fac Environm Design, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Zhang, Ming] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Architecture, 310 Inner Campus Dr,B7500, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Choi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.;Choi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Fac Environm Design, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",kwangyul.choi1@ucalgary.ca; zhangm@austin.utexas.edu,,"Choi, Kwangyul/0000-0002-4839-0314",,,,,31,13,13,0,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Given Crossrail remains under construction, we estimate how the anticipated benefit of Crossrail's announcement enters the house price determination process. Anticipated journey-time savings should enter the home-buyer's pricing equation because these benefits are speculatively internalised even before the service becomes operational. Using a experimental method that accounts for the possibility of a spatial autoregressive process in housing values, we test the hypotheses that the announcement of a new commuter rail service generated a location premium, and that house price appreciation reflected proximity to Crossrail terminals.

First, using a modified capital consumption asset pricing model (CCAPM) with stochastic taxation and money supply, we compute the fundamental values for REITs for our sample period, 1972-2013. Second, for publicly traded equity REITs, we define a bubble to be the difference between the actual stock market price and the fundamental value derived from our theoretical model. U.S. REITs have, among other corporate structural features, special rules governing dividend distributions and corporate taxation that make them an especially attractive and preferred vehicle for testing for the presence of pricing bubbles. Our findings suggest that during our sample period, U.S. REITs experienced many price bubbles, some of which were quite large. Third, our results imply that monetary policy, in the short run, plays a role in the formation of these pricing bubbles.","[Edelstein, Robert H.; Magin, Konstantin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Edelstein, RH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",edelstei@haas.berkeley.edu; magin@berkeley.edu,,,Center for Risk Management Research,Center for Risk Management Research,This research was supported by a grant from the Center for Risk Management Research.

The estimated model shows that, as collateral constraints became slack during the housing boom of 2001-2006, expanding housing wealth made a small contribution to consumption growth. By contrast, the housing collapse that followed tightened the constraints and sharply exacerbated the recession of 2007-2009.

We find that beneficial partial-equilibrium effects of stimulating annuity markets are counteracted by negative general-equilibrium repercussions. Balancing the positive partial-equilibrium and negative general-equilibrium forces we show that there exists an intermediate level of annuitization such that the lifetime utility of steady-state agents is maximized. Studying the transition to this optimal degree of annuitization shows that currently middle-aged individuals stand to gain most from the stimulation of annuity markets.

Using a large panel of US residents with bachelors' degrees in scientific fields, we ask whether higher rates of entrepreneurship among immigrants can be explained by their position on the ability spectrum and establish four new facts about science-based and immigrant entrepreneurship. First, in this sample, an immigrant entrepreneurship premium exists only in science-based entrepreneurship. Second, this premium persists after controlling for ability (measured by paid employment wage residuals.) Third, a U-shaped relationship between ability and entrepreneurship exists only in non-science entrepreneurship; for science entrepreneurship, the relationship is increasing. Finally, the immigrant premium in science entrepreneurship is largest among immigrants with non-US degrees and those from non-English-speaking or culturally dissimilar countries. Stated preferences for self-employment do not explain the immigrant premium. The results suggest that immigrants may on average have higher levels of unobservable skills related to entrepreneurship.","[Kahn, Shulamit; MacGarvie, Megan J.] Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [La Mattina, Giulia] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [MacGarvie, Megan J.] NBER, Boston, MA USA",Boston University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; National Bureau of Economic Research,"La Mattina, G (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",skahn@bu.edu; glamattina@usf.edu; mmacgarv@bu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SBE-0738371],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This project was funded by National Science Foundation Grant SBE-0738371.

The US nitrogen fertilizer industry has been considered by conventional metrics to be one of the most vulnerable to such effects. Since 2010 the industry has undergone increased concentration of producers and a dramatic reduction in natural gas prices. Our research establishes that the pass-through of changes in prices to domestic natural gas declined from 80% prior to 2010 to effectively zero through 2014. One implication of this change in pricing dynamics is that the imposition of greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations on producers of nitrogen fertilizers would have little impact on fertilizer prices. Within the context of a GHG cap-and-trade program, the allocation of emissions allowances would likely result in a transfer to fertilizer producers on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars with no impact on fertilizer prices, emissions, or quantity consumed.","[Bushnell, James] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Humber, Jacob] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Bushnell, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jbbushnell@ucdavis.edu; humber@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture [2012-67023-30236]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This work was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture, under Agreement no. 2012-67023-30236.",,48,5,6,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

We calibrate the model to data on 1,707 CEOs and show that it explains observed contracts much better than the standard model without risk-taking incentives. When we apply the model to contracts that consist of base salary, stock, and options, the results suggest that options should be issued in the money. Our model also helps us rationalize the universal use of at-the-money options when the tax code is taken into account.

The analysis of data on the number, the characteristics and the activity of the representatives on the one hand and the analysis of the budgets' assemblies on the other hand display different features. First the representatives benefit from a generous pension system but their base salary has declined in real terms while other elements '(such as expenditure allowances to cover expenses which arise in the course of their parliamentary activities) of their compensation package have increased on the contrary.

We employ both the Prais-Winston and system GMM procedures to tackle the problems of endogeneity among the explanatory variables and our measure of bond market development, group-wise heteroscedasticity, and contemporaneous cross-sectional and serial correlations in the residuals. Our results suggest that a combination of structural, financial and institutional factors seem to exert a significant effect on bond markets. Indeed, economic size, trade openness, investment profile, GDP per Capita, bureaucratic quality, and size and concentration of banking system are positively related to bond market development, while interest rate volatility and fiscal balance are negatively associated with the development of bond markets. Those results are robust to the inclusion of developed countries' bond markets, international bonds issuers, and to possible structural breaks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Economic production generates emissions of pollutants whose environmental impact is mitigated by abatement activities financed by government expenditure; environmental quality affects preferences but does not play any productive role. We show that government intervention, by reallocating resources from capital accumulation to environmental preservation activities, allows the economy to achieve a sustainable balanced growth path. Along such a path, softer environmental policy regimes lead to win-win outcomes, fostering economic growth and improving environmental quality. Such a result needs to be interpreted as a long run outcome, but it clearly shows that the compatibility between economic growth and environmental improvement is far from automatic. Indeed, in the long run it could paradoxically be the case that both the economy and the environment benefit from low levels of environmental protection.","[Marsiglio, Simone] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Ansuategi, Alberto] Univ Basque Country, Dept Fdn Econ Anal 1, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain; [Ansuategi, Alberto] Univ Basque Country, Inst Publ Econ, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Wollongong; University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Marsiglio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",simonem@uow.edu.au,"Ansuategi, Alberto/B-9754-2009; Marsiglio, Simone/K-2863-2012","Ansuategi, Alberto/0000-0003-1408-3807;","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-25064]; Basque Ministry of Education, Universities and Research [GIC07/56-IT-383-07]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Basque Ministry of Education, Universities and Research","The authors are grateful to Ilaski Baranano and Fabio Privileggi for insightful discussions and comments.

People have been shown to be risk seeking for small probability gains and large probability losses, while being risk averse for large probability gains and small probability losses. Another fourfold pattern of risk preferences over outcomes, postulated by Harry Markowitz in 1952, has received much less attention and is currently not integrated into prospect theory. In two experiments, we show that risk preferences may change over outcomes. While we find people to be risk seeking for small outcomes, this turns to risk neutrality and later risk aversion as stakes increase. We then show how a one-parameter logarithmic utility function fits such stake effects significantly better under prospect theory than the power or exponential functions mostly used when fitting prospect theory models. We further investigate the extent to which the use of ill-suited functional forms to represent utility may result in violations of prospect theory, and whether such violations disappear when using logarithmic utility.","[Bouchouicha, Ranoua] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England; [Vieider, Ferdinand M.] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading; University of Reading,"Vieider, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Reading, Berks, England.",r.bouchouicha@reading.ac.uk; f.vieider@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,53,17,20,2,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Literature suggests that bilateral trade linkages lead to the diffusion of good labor standards from importing countries of the Global North to exporting countries of the Global South. The crucial mechanism is the ability and willingness of importing firms to deploy their market leverage and ask for improved labor standards from their overseas suppliers. Yet, cost-cutting pressures emanating from economic downturns might lead the same importing firms to give lower priority to worker safety in their overseas supply chains. When importing firms demand price reductions, overseas suppliers might respond by reducing wages, ignoring safety regulations, and working their labor force for longer hours. The observable implication is that worker safety in the Global South may deteriorate during economic downturns in their export markets located in the Global North. We evaluate our hypothesis using a panel of 83 developing countries for the period during 1980-2009, and find that economic downturns in developed country markets are associated with significant increases in non-fatal occupational injury rates in developing countries. The injury-increasing effect is more pronounced in developing countries with weak workers' rights protection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The new real estate tax allowed discretion to local governments. This generates a random variation in the distance of municipalities from the following elections when they choose the level of the tax rate. We do find substantial evidence of political budget cycles, with municipalities choosing lower tax rates when close to elections. We observe this budget cycle for smaller municipalities where the tax was more likely to be the single most important issue for the local government. Cities close to elections with large deficits did not set lower rates and so did municipalities with a lower average value of properties. Finally, the political budget cycle is stronger in the South.","[Alesina, Alberto; Paradisi, Matteo] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Alesina, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",aalesina@harvard.edu,"Paradisi, Matteo/ABF-4825-2021","Paradisi, Matteo/0000-0002-6370-3825",,,,,34,42,46,0,15,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Evidence from Small-Scale Supply Systems in Rural Brazil,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,water supply; community-based development; rural development; Latin America; Brazil,RANDOMIZED FIELD EXPERIMENT; LOCAL COMMONS; PARTICIPATION; IMPACT; DECENTRALIZATION; ACCOUNTABILITY; GOVERNANCE; GOVERNMENT; EDUCATION; INFRASTRUCTURE,"This paper investigates whether small-scale water supply systems implemented and operated by water user associations increase access to piped water supply in rural Brazil by more than systems by local governments. Starting from 15% to 16% in the year 2000, access rates in rural areas with water user associations increased to 33.4% in 2010. In areas with local government supply systems, access rates only increased to 24.9%. Based on data from Brazilian census and the national water and sanitation survey, the empirical analysis in this paper shows that the observed difference is effectively due to project-type choice. Additionally it points toward higher accountability as a potential reason for better results of community-based projects. In municipalities where social groups requested a new system before the local government started implementation and therefore public awareness for the project was higher, the increase in access rates is comparable to the increase in municipalities with water user association projects. The same is true if local media is present or political competition in local elections is higher. As the effect of project type on access rates might be confounded by simultaneous drivers of project-type choice and access rates, the quantitative analysis is based on a difference-in-difference estimator in combination with kernel matching to overcome the endogeneity of project type. The treatment effect revealed by this analysis is robust to various specification changes and the robustness checks show no structural differences between treatment and control groups that could bias the results. The calculation of matching weights for the kernel matching is informed by semi-structured interviews with academics and sector experts in Brazil explaining the determinants of project choice. The interviews highlight the political economy behind infrastructure expansion in rural Brazil. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Do such place-based investments in capital raise urban productivity or is this another case of the powerful state misallocating capital in China? This paper measures the localized spillover effects of 110 parks built in eight major cities on firm productivity, wages, and local manufacturing employment growth. We find that the geographic spillover effect of parks is an increasing function of the park's overall human capital level, the FDI share, and its synergy with nearby incumbent firms (measured by Marshallian factors). Using geo-coded data, we document that the growth in local employment and wages stimulates nearby local housing construction and retail store openings.

Deteriorating public news increases the probability of a crisis, since the initially strong (weak) prior induces no attacks (attacks). This effect is amplified with endogenous information choices.

To this purpose, we simulate a New Keynesian model of the euro area (EA). Our results are as follows. First, if the monetary authority brings forward the unwinding of its long-term sovereign bond holdings, the stimulus from the APP on inflation and economic activity is correspondingly reduced. Second, if the monetary authority communicates that the policy rate will be held constant for 1 year instead of 2, the APP would be less effective and the increase in inflation would be halved. Third, an early exit from bond holding subdues the impact of theAPP, delaying the normalization of monetary policy conditions after a negative EA-wide demand shock.","[Burlon, Lorenzo; Gerali, Andrea; Notarpietro, Alessandro; Pisani, Massimiliano] Bank Italy, Res Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Pisani, M (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Res Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",massimiliano.pisani@bancaditalia.it,"Burlon, Lorenzo/AAI-4927-2020","Burlon, Lorenzo/0000-0002-8468-7078",,,,,17,3,3,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

Conventional wisdom suggests that group insurance mitigates adverse selection because it minimizes individual choice. We complement this conventional wisdom by analyzing a group insurance scenario in which individual choice is excluded, and we find that group insurance alone is not effective enough to eliminate adverse selection; that is, between-group adverse selection exists. Between-group adverse selection, however, disappears over time if the group renews with the same insurer for a certain period. Our results thus indicate that experience rating and underwriting based on information that insurers learn over time are important in addressing adverse selection.","[Eling, Martin; Jia, Ruo] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Yao, Yi] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of St Gallen; Peking University,"Eling, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.",martin.eling@unisg.ch; ruo.jia@unisg.ch; yao.yi@pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,61,12,13,4,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

First, we show that the temporary reduction in refining led to a significant reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations. Second, this shock significantly increased birth weight and gestational age of newborns, particularly for those exposed to the strike during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, and decreased asthma and bronchitis admissions. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that a 1-unit ( or 26%) decline in monthly SO2 leads to an (sic)89 million increase in lifetime earnings per birth-year cohort. This externality from oil refineries should be an important part of policy discussions surrounding the production of energy.","[Lavaine, Emmanuelle] Savoie Mont Blanc Univ, IREGE, 4 Chemin Bellevue, Annecy Le Vieux, France; [Neidell, Matthew] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 600 West 168th St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10032 USA",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc; Columbia University,"Lavaine, E (通讯作者)，Savoie Mont Blanc Univ, IREGE, 4 Chemin Bellevue, Annecy Le Vieux, France.",emmanuelle.lavaine@univ-smb.fr; mn2191@columbia.edu,,,French National Research Agency [ANR-09-BLAN-0350-01]; Spanish government [ECO2011-25349]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-09-BLAN-0350] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Spanish government(Spanish Government); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"Emmanuelle Lavaine (emmanuelle.lavaine@univ-smb.fr) is at Savoie Mont Blanc University, IREGE, 4 chemin de Bellevue, BP 80439-74944 Annecy le vieux, France.

Candidate models include time-varying (with various degrees of dynamics) and constant-coefficient autoregressions based on the logarithm of monthly realized volatility augmented with exogenous predictors capturing risk premia, leverage, bond rates and proxies for credit risk. Thus, we simultaneously address parameter instability and model uncertainty that unavoidably impact volatility predictions. Applied to monthly S & P 500 volatility from 1926 to 2010, we find that Bayesian model averaging with time-varying regression coefficients provides very competitive density and modest improvements in point forecasts compared to rival approaches.","[Nonejad, Nima] Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; [Nonejad, Nima] CREATES, Aalborg, Denmark; [Nonejad, Nima] Aalborg Univ, Dept Math Sci, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark",Aalborg University; CREATES; Aalborg University,"Nonejad, N (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Math Sci, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.",nimanonejad@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,64,66,0,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

This paper introduces a conceptual framework for studying entrepreneurship in the digital age by integrating two well-established concepts: the digital ecosystem and the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The integration of these two ecosystems helps us better understand the interactions of agents and users that incorporate insights of consumers' individual and social behavior. The Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystem framework consists of four concepts: digital infrastructure governance, digital user citizenship, digital entrepreneurship, and digital marketplace. The paper develops propositions for each of the four concepts and provides a theoretical framework of multisided platforms to better understand the digital entrepreneurial ecosystem. Finally, it outlines a new research agenda to fill the gap in our understanding of entrepreneurship in the digital age.","[Sussan, Fiona] Univ Phoenix, Sch Adv Studies, Tempe, AZ 85282 USA; [Acs, Zoltan J.] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",University of Phoenix; George Mason University,"Sussan, F (通讯作者)，Univ Phoenix, Sch Adv Studies, Tempe, AZ 85282 USA.",fiona.sussan@phoenix.edu,"acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013",,,,,,92,307,339,98,726,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Previous literature has examined the social inequalities of park accessibility under the Western context; however, the issue has seldomly investigated against the non-Western background, especially in China. Using a case of Shenzhen (China), this paper examines the accessibility to parks of three quality levels (official standard) under four transport modes (public transit, walking, bicycle, and private car). In particular, the daily travel time from each community (8117) to each park (625) was harvested from the Baidu Map during 18:30-20:30 in July 2016. We further, based on the travel time calculations, develop four baseline indicators (the weighted average, the minimum, the maximum, and the standard deviation travel time) and three tolerance indicators of park accessibility (weighted average travel time within visit tolerance thresholds, standard deviation travel time within visit tolerance thresholds, and number of parks within visit tolerance thresholds) to measure park accessibility for each community. Results show that the seven accessibility indicators generate different estimations and the quantified accessibility varies greatly with park quality levels and transport modes. Communities present greater variations in accessibility to the first quality level and second quality level parks via walking and public transit. In addition, hierarchical regression is utilized to quantify the relationships between park accessibility and sociodemographic characteristics at two geographic levels (community and district). It is found that the associations are subjected to park quality, transport modes, and geographic levels. In particular, we discover significant social inequalities in park accessibility under the mode of public transit, walking, and bicycle. Our study should provide some new insights into accessibility research and advance the understanding of unequal park provision in developing countries.","[Xu, Mengya; Su, Shiliang; Weng, Min; Cai, Zhongliang] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xin, Jing; Su, Shiliang] Shanghai Surveying & Mapping Inst, Ctr Geog Census Applicat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Su, Shiliang; Weng, Min; Cai, Zhongliang] Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Su, Shiliang] Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Syst, Minist Educ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Su, SL (通讯作者)，129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",shiliangsu@whu.edu.cn,,"Xu, Mengya/0000-0001-6550-9391",Luojia Young Scholar Program [205410100025],Luojia Young Scholar Program,We thank the Associate Editor Prof. Becky Loo and four anonymous reviewers for providing professional comments and suggestions.

We explore the hypothesis that dispersal of responsibilities could be the result or a cause of a lack of consensus between the principal and the agent. Our findings suggest that a dispersal of responsibilities has a negative impact on the principal-agent relationship and that it represents a foundation for theoretical and empirical approaches to organisational behaviour. We find that agent perceptions of a dispersal of responsibilities are linked to his/her resistance to the principal's interests, but this relationship is deeper than was suggested by previous research. However, if the sharing of responsibilities does not run parallel to that, we may have as a result what we call an agency problem.","[Burlea, Adriana Schiopoiu] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania; [Remme, Joop] FOM Hsch, Leiden, Netherlands",University of Craiova,"Burlea, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania.",aburlea2000@yahoo.it,"Burlea-Schiopoiu, Adriana/B-8733-2009","Burlea-Schiopoiu, Adriana/0000-0002-3600-3663",,,,,28,18,18,0,4,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2017,19.0,45,,,,,464,476,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404523800010,0

We build a price index for the representative painting through hedonic regressions controlling for the characteristics of auctions and paintings and for the artists' fixed effects. The emergence of an efficient secondary art market was an important opportunity for portfolio diversification. Estimating a CAPM model for art investment suggests that British paintings could deliver a higher return compared to imported paintings and an attractive source of diversification relative to the contemporary stock market. This contributed to increase the demand for British art and, possibly, to promote the innovations of its Golden Age. While the representative painting of the British school was initially undervalued, new British painters reached foreign prices by the beginning of 1800s.","[Etro, Federico; Stepanova, Elena] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy; [Etro, Federico; Stepanova, Elena] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Etro, F (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy.;Etro, F (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Pisa, Italy.",,"Stepanova, Elena/AAF-7111-2020","Stepanova, Elena/0000-0002-2924-4565",,,,,49,9,9,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

By forming pairs of Latin American sovereign bonds, bundled into similar maturity class, the analysis highlights the complex nature of risk shifting, and the temporal nature of the volatility transmission and sharing mechanisms in the lead up to, and after, a crisis period. The results show that shorter maturity groups and longer maturity groups behave in fundamentally different ways in terms of volatility transmission, while one or two leading countries act as regional benchmarks. The dynamics are consistent with temporal but segmented investor preferences, with the arrival of crisis contributing to a breakdown in the previous relationships.

These households tend to be located in peripheral neighborhoods and access the BRT system largely via its sprawling network of feeder buses, rather than directly accessing the more central trunk lines. This paper examines the relationship between BRT access especially feeder-based BRT access and the degree to which the city's lower wealth households are able meet needs for mobility and out-of-home activity participation by analyzing changes in self-reported travel patterns among lower wealth households from before to after introduction of the BRT system. A secondary aim of this paper is to propose and test the variable 'travel purpose diversity' as an indicator of the degree to which households are able to meet their needs for out-of-home activity participation. Further work is needed to improve measurement of mobility in order to assess the household-level impacts of transit investments, particularly on lower wealth households. The results provide preliminary support for the validity of this indicator. Overall, findings suggest that the introduction of the BRT has not had a substantial or significant impact on the ability of Bogota's lower wealth households to meet daily mobility needs. The paper presents some possible interpretations of these findings and offers suggestions for additional research to help improve our understanding of the impacts of Bogota's transit investment.

It sheds new light on the following issues: why profitable firms may be interested in issuing equity and why debt does not necessarily signal a firm's quality. These issues seem to be puzzling from the classical pecking-order theory or signalling theory point of view. The paper also contributes to the analysis of the link between capital structure choice and a firm's expected performance (short-term and long-term). An empirical analysis confirms most of our theoretical results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This paper explores the extent to which spatial proximity of inland ports vis-a-vis each other influences agglomeration externalities. Spatially lagged regression models are employed to analyse whether spatial dependence between proximate inland ports can be observed or, alternatively, whether the density of the inland port network in the Netherlands is leading to diseconomies of scale because of overproximity. The conclusions indicate that especially in the context of the dense fluvial network of the Netherlands inland ports development involves much competition among inland ports; being proximite to strong neighbouring inland ports is not necessarily beneficial to the growth prospects of an inland port. This indication of overproximity highlights a need for reflection on the possibility of an integrated and coordinated regional governance approach towards inland port development in the Netherlands and North-West Europe. The relationship between inland ports and regional development is obviously present, but ambiguous since it involves a multiplicity of interactions among a diversity of actors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The association of lower socioeconomic status at a young age or those who experienced economic shocks at a young age with the likelihood of self-employment is only significant when interaction effects of temporal discounting and age are present in the model.

In the context of India, bankruptcy reforms were enacted for the first time in 2016 in the form of a unified Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a regulatory intervention by the Indian central bank over the last decade in leading an attempt to prevent bank failure in the absence of a sound bankruptcy process. We assess how the volume of restructured assets at bank level impacted risk taking of Indian banks over the time period 2003-2012. During this period, a large number of banks restructured their distressed assets as a means to reduce NPAs. Our results show that higher levels of restructured assets significantly reduced risk taking as banks benefited from low provisioning, and this relation is more pronounced for banks that had lower loan loss provisions. We also find that by restructuring distressed assets, public sector banks benefited significantly more in improving their stability than private sector domestic and foreign banks. Overall, our main results suggest that similar regulatory support in the absence of a strong legal-system, can be implemented to avoid bank fragility in other emerging market economies.

Using the Hou and Moskowitz (2005) measure of price delay, which captures the inefficiency of stock prices, we test for, and find evidence supporting the idea that opacity is positively associated with price delay. Bank stocks have markedly higher delay than similar non-bank stocks. This higher level of delay is driven, in part, by market-based measures of informational opacity as well as the asset composition of the bank's balance sheet. Combined, our findings suggest that bank opacity reduces the efficiency of financial markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

After doubling between 1950 and 1980, water withdrawals have stabilized and even decreased. Our decomposition reveals that 35%-50% of the productivity gains that let the United States produce each dollar of its GDP with less water stem from long-term structural changes between sectors ( growing service economy). The remaining 50%-65% come from productivity improvements within those sectors due to improved production techniques, productivity improvements in electricity generation, and shifts toward less water-intensive products. Importing more water-intensive goods is not the main reason why US water use plateaued.","[Debaere, Peter; Kurzendoerfer, Amanda] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Debaere, P (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",debaerep@darden.virginia.edu,,,Darden Foundation,Darden Foundation,"We received research funding from the Darden Foundation.

It is frequently claimed that such intergenerational associations are stronger in Britain than in other countries. But is this really true? I investigate this issue by estimating the link between parental education and later lifetime income, using three cross-nationally comparable data sets covering more than 30 countries. My results suggest that the UK is broadly in the middle of the cross-country rankings, with intergenerational associations notably stronger than in Scandinavia but weaker than in eastern Europe.

We estimate labor supply reactions and welfare effects using a microsimulation model based on household data from the SocioEconomic Panel and a structural labor supply model. We find that all three reforms increase labor supply in the first decile of the income distribution. The flat tax scenario reduces overall labor supply by about 5%; the reform designed to increase participation reduces labor supply by 1%; the reform that provides incentives to work full-time has negligible effects on overall labor supply. With equal welfare weights, aggregate welfare gains are realizable under all three reforms.","[Jessen, Robin; Rostam-Afschar, Davud; Steiner, Viktor] Free Univ Berlin, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Rostam-Afschar, Davud] Univ Hohenheim, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",Free University of Berlin; University Hohenheim,"Jessen, R (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",r.jessen@fu-berlin.de; davud.rostam-afschar@uni-hohenheim.de; viktor.steiner@fu-berlin.de,"Rostam-Afschar, Davud/I-6153-2015","Rostam-Afschar, Davud/0000-0002-9358-998X",Hans-Bockler-Stiftung [2012-545-1],Hans-Bockler-Stiftung,Robin Jessen and Davud Rostam-Afschar have received research grants from the Hans-Bockler-Stiftung (grant number 2012-545-1).,,50,7,8,0,17,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2017,73.0,1,,,,,1,41,,10.1628/001522117X14864674910065,0.0,,,41,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EQ1JY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397827300001,0

Using the post-Soviet context, we examine how language policies-vital components for how minorities are treated with far-reaching economic consequences-are influenced by trade. We argue that while ethnic politics and colonial legacies are both important in shaping language laws, it is important to recognize that the Russian language remains a significant commercial lingua franca in the region. When economic exchanges between Russia and other post-Soviet republics are frequent, governments are more likely to adopt pro-Russian language laws as a practicality and to maintain favor with the Russian government and Russian-speaking businesses. Using an original dataset covering all Russian language-related laws in the former Soviet states from 1992 to 2009, we find a significant and positive relationship between trade and pro-Russian language laws. These results are robust even when we (1) instrument for Russian import levels and (2) consider the Baltic effect, spillovers from cultural affinity, and the uniqueness of fuel exports.","[Liu, Amy H.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Roosevelt, Megan; Sokhey, Sarah Wilson] Univ Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Sokhey, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Polit Sci, Ketchum Hall 133, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",sarah.sokhey@colorado.edu,"Sokhey, Sarah/GWU-9290-2022","SOKHEY, SARAH/0000-0001-7786-9351",,,,,50,6,7,0,11,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Our findings with different indices of globalization depict a positive effect on education financing. The use of legal and institutional variables, the inclusion of the crisis and euro dummies, and further control variables do not alter our main findings. The Bologna dummy variable is not found to have a significant effect on public education financing, indicating that the integration goals under this process have not translated into increasing levels of public expenditure for education.","[Ozkok, Zeynep] St Francis Xavier Univ, Antigonish, NS, Canada",Saint Francis Xavier University - Canada,"Ozkok, Z (通讯作者)，St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, POB 5000, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",zozkok@stfx.ca,,"Ozkok, Zeynep/0000-0001-6022-4274",St. Francis Xavier University [UCR2014/01-91998],St. Francis Xavier University,"The views expressed in this paper are those of the author and do not reflect the views of the European Commission or the Euro system.

One goal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was to increase preventive care and improve health behaviors by expanding access to health insurance. This paper estimates how the ACA-facilitated state-level expansions of Medicaid in 2014 affected these outcomes. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and a difference-in-differences model that compares states that did and did not expand Medicaid, we examine the impact of the expansions on preventive care (e.g., dental visits, immunizations, mammograms, cancer screenings), risky health behaviors (e.g., smoking, heavy drinking, lack of exercise, obesity), and self-assessed health. We find that the expansions increased insurance coverage and access to care among the targeted population of low-income childless adults. The expansions also increased use of certain forms of preventive care, but there is no evidence that they increased ex ante moral hazard (i.e., there is no evidence that risky health behaviors increased in response to health insurance coverage). The Medicaid expansions also modestly improved self-assessed health.

We show that level-premium life insurance products with a medium duration (around 20-30 years) can better hedge annuity products than whole life products.

While CDS were blamed for destabilizing the financial system, they remain effective tools for hedging credit risk, especially for major banks, and produce positive informational externalities to market participants. This paper examines whether the introduction of CDS enhances the amount of firm-specific information impounded in stock prices. We use stock return synchronicity to measure the amount of firm-specific information reflected in stock prices, with more firm-specific information being associated with a lower level of synchronicity. We find that a firm's stock return synchronicity decreases after the commencement of CDS trading. This finding is robust to different model specifications, synchronicity measures, and endogeneity controlling methodologies. Furthermore, the decrease in stock return synchronicity is more pronounced for CDS firms with higher credit risk. Overall, our evidence supports the positive role of CDS in improving informativeness of stock prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Insights into the route choice behavior involving two dominant vehicle trip purposes-work and shop trips-will help in the design of traffic facilities and implementation of measures to influence route choice in the desired direction. In this study, we show that the utility and scale parameters for separate models of work and shop trips differ by direct comparison using a sequential scaling estimation method and likelihood ratio tests, and highlight the differences in route choice behavior by considering the interaction of route attributes and individual characteristics using Path-Size Logit modeling. In the process, we used Potential Path Area - Gateway (PPAG) algorithm-that generates feasible route choice sets for route choice modeling from GPS trajectories of observed routes. The results show that, indeed, route choice behavior varies by trip, which suggests that drivers attach value to route choice determinants relative to trip purpose. The inclusion of interaction terms in model specifications further indicates that work route choice behavior tends to be restrictive compared to the nonrestrictive route choice for shop trips-a generalization consistent with the mandatory and discretionary nature of work and shop trips, respectively. Specifically, individual characteristics such as personal income, age, gender, tenure, household size, and access to public transit affect route choice behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Theory suggests that factor price convergence should follow increased migration, capital flows, and commercial integration. All three have increased between the United States and Mexico over the last 25 years. This paper evaluates the degree of wage convergence between these countries during the period 1988 and 2011. We match survey and census data from Mexico and the United States to estimate the change in wage differentials for observationally identical workers over time. We find very little evidence of convergence. What evidence we do find is most likely due to factors unrelated to US-Mexico integration. While migration, trade, and FDI may reduce the US-Mexico wage differential, these effects are small when compared to the overall wage gap.","[Gandolfi, Davide] Uppsala Univ, St Olofsgatan 10 A, Uppsala, Sweden; [Halliday, Timothy] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Halliday, Timothy] Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Halliday, Timothy; Robertson, Raymond] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Robertson, Raymond] Texas A&M Univ, 1032 Allen Bldg,4220 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Uppsala University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Robertson, R (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Robertson, R (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, 1032 Allen Bldg,4220 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",Robertson@tamu.edu,"Halliday, Timothy/F-5032-2010","Robertson, Raymond/0000-0002-0989-7673",,,,,55,2,4,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

The present paper investigates social segregation over the 24 h a day in the Paris region, taking into account how social groups move within a city throughout the day. From a large and precise daily travel survey carried out in the Paris region (EGT 2010) among 25,500 respondents aged 16 or over, we have computed segregation indices and maps hour by hour from respondents' educational and socioprofessional indicators. We then observed that social segregation within the Paris region decreases during the day and that the most segregated group (the upper class group) during the night remains the most segregated during the day. We also explored how the co-presence between various social groups evolves throughout the day. Finally, we highlighted some large variations in districts' social composition over 24 h: districts with similar social composition during the night can differ deeply in their social composition during the day-time because of socially selective daily trips. Exploring social segregation around the clock helps in considering more dynamically place effects on individual behavior and targeting areas to implement interventions more connected with the real city rhythm.

More interestingly, we find that the relationship between governance and firm performance is an increasing function of dispersed ownership and that the value addition of good governance is not necessarily maintained at high levels of ownership concentration.

A theory where (i) growth is generated by innovative entrepreneurs; (ii) entrepreneurial investments respond to incentives that are themselves shaped by economic policies and institutions; (iii) new innovations replace old technologies: in other words, growth involves creative destruction and therefore involves a permanent conflict between incumbents and new entrants. First, we motivate and then lay out the Schumpeterian paradigm and point to a set of empirical predictions which distinguish this paradigm from other growth models. Second, we raise four debates on which the Schumpeterian approach sheds new light: the middle income trap, secular stagnation, the recent rise in top income inequality, and firm dynamics. Third and last, we show how the paradigm can be used to think (or rethink) about growth policy design.","[Aghion, Philippe] Coll France, 3 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France; [Aghion, Philippe] London Sch Econ, London, England",Universite PSL; College de France; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Aghion, P (通讯作者)，Coll France, 3 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.;Aghion, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",paghion@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,30,45,55,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper follows the methodology of Bali and Cakici (2004) to investigate the relationship between VaR and stock returns and employs Fama and French's (1993) and Fama and Macbeth's (1973) methods to find out the predictive power of VaR in time-series and cross-section settings. Further, it follows Fama and French (2008) to estimate separate cross-section regressions for small, medium and big stocks to verify the pervasiveness of the anomaly. Findings - This study finds positive risk premium associated with VaR in the Indian stock market during 2001-2008, the period of short selling constraint for institutional investors. This premium is confined to small stocks and low institutional holdings. The positive premium can be attributed to short selling constraints. Practical implications - The risk-return tradeoff can be utilized by investors and fund managers. As it is confined to small stocks, transaction costs may affect the profitability of the investment strategy. Originality/value - The study contributes to the scanty empirical literature on the role of VaR in the cross-section of expected stock returns. Moreover, this is the first study that explores the relationship between VaR and stock returns in the asset pricing context for the Indian stock market.","[Aziz, Tariq; Ansari, Valeed Ahmad] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Fac Management Studies & Res, Dept Business Adm, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India",Aligarh Muslim University,"Ansari, VA (通讯作者)，Aligarh Muslim Univ, Fac Management Studies & Res, Dept Business Adm, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India.",valeedin@yahoo.com,"Aziz, Tariq/Q-3609-2019; Aziz, Tariq/JYO-9586-2024","Aziz, Tariq/0000-0003-4528-840X;",,,,,44,9,9,3,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Our framework assumes that household portfolios are subject to short-selling constraints in stocks and bonds, and that financial investment decisions are taken conditional on real estate and business wealth. We derive an explicit solution for the model, and estimate its parameters using the US Survey of Consumer Finances from 1995 to 2013. The results show that our modified mean-variance model fits the data adequately, and that the demographic, occupational and educational characteristics of the investors are relevant in shaping risk aversion and return expectations. In contrast, wealth, income, and past market performance have limited impacts on expectations and risk aversion.

The analysis - carried out on panel data covering 1993-2012 for 111 low- and middle-income countries - shows that growing use of revenue conditionality by low-income countries partially offsets the depressing effect of foreign grants on tax revenue, particularly on taxes on goods and services. The impact of conditionality is strong in countries where aid dependence is high and where institutions are strong, suggesting that revenue conditionality cannot substitute for weak institutions in mitigating any negative effect of aid on tax revenue collection.","[Crivelli, Ernesto; Gupta, Sanjeev] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Crivelli, E (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",ecrivelli@imf.org,,,,,,,31,7,7,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This development is often attributed to yield-chasing in anticipation of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank. We examine how portfolio adjustments by long-term investors aimed at containing duration mismatches may have acted as an amplification mechanism in this process. Declining long-term interest rates tend to widen the negative duration gap between the assets and liabilities of insurers and pension funds, and any attempted rebalancing by increasing asset duration results in further downward pressure on interest rates. Evidence from the German insurance sector is consistent with such an amplification mechanism.","[Domanski, Dietrich; Shin, Hyun Song; Sushko, Vladyslav] Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland",Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Domanski, D (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland.",dietrich.domanski@bis.org; hyunsong.shin@bis.org; vlad.sushko@bis.org,,,,,,,39,21,26,0,7,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

[Method] Design survey questionnaire about the employment intentions of community nursing students. A cluster sampling survey was conducted on 456 nursing students in a private medical school in Xi'an and interviews were conducted with nursing students. [Result] There were significant differences in employ intentions for nursing students with different education levels(p>0.01). There were 75.91% of the college graduate students, 60.47% of the undergraduate students and 59.09% of top-up students would like to be engaged in community nursing. Undergraduate nursing students are willing to be engaged in community nursing work due to the large degree of freedom of work and the space for development and are not willing to be engaged in community nursing work due to the low benefits and the small contact area; College graduate nursing students are willing to be engaged in community nursing work due to the working stability and small pressure and are not willing to be engaged in community nursing work due to the poor working environment. [Result] The limitations of understanding of the community is the school's training. It is necessary to train large quantities of high-quality community nursing personnel in order to strengthen the school education. In particular, it is important to strengthen nursing students community nurse practice education, to improve their awareness and to carry out education targeted at different levels of nursing students so as to correct the concept of career choice and broaden employment opportunities. According to Healthy China 2030 plan, we will adjust and optimize the professional structure of medical education that adapts to the development of the health service industry and increase the training of healthy personnel, such as pensioners, rehabilitation therapists as well as counselors.

We will continue to improve the policy system for promoting transformation and development, and promote reforms in the fields of discipline professional setting, the mode of personnel training as well as other key areas. So that the educational goal of transitional high schools will be more in line with the needs of the society and the orientation in applied colleges and universities. In the context of the rising enrollment of higher education and the difficult employment of college graduates, employment for grass-roots and community has become an important direction for graduates for local colleges and universities([1]). Due to the professional advantage, ordinary undergraduate nursing students own relatively high position, so they have higher expectations of their career and are more willing to work in big hospital of big city. There are only a small number of them who will choose to be engaged in primary health care services of communities([2]).
